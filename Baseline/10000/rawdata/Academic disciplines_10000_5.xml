The '''Bachelor of Computer Science''' or '''Bachelor of Science in Computer Science''' (abbreviated '''BCompSc''' or '''BCS''' or '''BS CS''' or '''B.Sc. CS''') is a type of [[bachelor's degree]], usually awarded after three or four years of collegiate study in [[computer science]], but possibly awarded in fewer years depending on factors such as an institution's course requirements and academic calendar. In some cases it can be awarded in five years. In general, computer science degree programs emphasize the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uowdubai.ac.ae/computer-science-and-engineering-programs/bachelor-of-computer-science-bcompsc-degree |title=Bachelor of Computer Science (BCOMPSC) Degree |publisher=[[University of Wollongong in Dubai]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same core curriculum may, depending on the school, result in other degrees, including:
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) in Computer Science 
* Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Computer Science
* Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (B.Tech)
* Bachelor of Science in Information Technology 
* Bachelor of Mathematics in Computer Science  
* Bachelor of Engineering (BEng or BE) in Computer Science

'''Bats''' are the only mammal capable of '''true flight'''. Bats use flight for capturing prey, breeding, avoiding predators, and long-distance migration. Bat wing morphology is often highly specialized to the needs of the species.

==Evolution==
[[Charles Darwin]] foresaw an issue with his theory of evolution by natural selection in the evolution of [[complex traits]] such as eyes or "the structure and habits of a bat."&lt;ref name="Darwin"&gt;Darwin, C. (1968). On the origin of species by means of natural selection. 1859. London: Murray Google Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the oldest [[Onychonycteris|bat fossils]] are very similar in wing morphology to the bats of today, despite living and dying 52.5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Sears 2006"&gt;Sears, K. E., Behringer, R. R., Rasweiler, J. J., &amp; Niswander, L. A. (2006). Development of bat flight: morphologic and molecular evolution of bat wing digits. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103(17), 6581-6586.&lt;/ref&gt; The common ancestor of all bats is hypothesized to have been an [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] [[Quadrupedalism|quadruped]] of the [[northern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="Teeling 2005"&gt;Teeling, E. C., Springer, M. S., Madsen, O., Bates, P., O'brien, S. J., &amp; Murphy, W. J. (2005). A molecular phylogeny for bats illuminates biogeography and the fossil record. Science, 307(5709), 580-584.&lt;/ref&gt; This ancestor is predicted to have lived 64 million years ago at the border of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary|Cretaceous and Paleogene]], based on molecular and paleontological data.&lt;ref name="Cooper 2008"&gt;Cooper, K. L., &amp; Tabin, C. J. (2008). Understanding of bat wing evolution takes flight. Genes &amp; development, 22(2), 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a gap in the fossil record, and no transitional fossils exist from this quadrupedal ancestor to the appearance of the modern bat. It is unclear how long the transition from quadrupedalism to powered flight took. After evolving powered flight, bats underwent massive [[adaptive radiation]], becoming the second-most speciose [[mammal classification|mammal order]], after [[rodent]]s.&lt;ref name="Nowak"&gt;Nowak, R. M. (1994). Walker's bats of the world. JHU Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have shown that, rather than having evolved from gliders, the ancestors of bats were flutterers.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Matt |title=Ancient bats got in a flap over food |journal=Nature|year=2011 |doi=10.1038/nature.2011.9304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations for flight==
To make powered flight possible, bats had to evolve several features. Bat flight necessitated the increase of membrane surface area between the digits of the forelimbs, between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, and between the hindlimbs.&lt;ref name="Cooper 2008"/&gt; Bats also had to evolve a thinner cortical bone to reduce torsional stresses produced by propulsive downstroke movements.&lt;ref name="Swartz 1992"&gt;Swartz, S. M., Bennett, M. B., &amp; Carrier, D. R. (1992). Wing bone stresses in free flying bats and the evolution of skeletal design for flight. Nature, 359(6397), 726.&lt;/ref&gt; Bats had to reroute innervation to their wing muscles to allow for control of powered flight.&lt;ref name="Thewissen 1991"&gt;Thewissen, J. G. M., &amp; Babcock, S. K. (1991). Distinctive cranial and cervical innervation of wing muscles: new evidence for bat monophyly. Science, 251(4996), 934-937.&lt;/ref&gt; The strength and mass of forelimb musculature also had to be increased to allow powerful upstrokes and downstrokes.&lt;ref name="Thewissen 1992"&gt;Thewissen, J. G. M., &amp; Babcock, S. K. (1992). The origin of flight in bats. BioScience, 42(5), 340-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wing shape==

=== Wing chord ===
The [[Chord (aeronautics)|chord]] length of a bat wing is the distance from the [[leading edge]] to the [[trailing edge]] measured parallel to the direction of flight. The mean chord length &lt;math&gt;\bar{c}&lt;/math&gt; is a standardized measure which captures a representative chord length over a whole flap cycle. Given wing area ''S'', and wingspan ''b'', the mean chord can be calculated by,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/468014494|title=Bird flight performance : a practical calculation manual|last=J.|first=Pennycuick, Colin|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198577214|oclc=468014494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Von Busse|first=R.|last2=Hedenstrom|first2=A.|last3=Winter|first3=Y.|last4=Johansson|first4=L. C.|date=2012-10-11|title=Kinematics and wing shape across flight speed in the bat, Leptonycteris yerbabuenae|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/bio.20122964|journal=Biology Open|volume=1|issue=12|pages=1226–1238|doi=10.1242/bio.20122964|issn=2046-6390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bar{c} = \frac{S}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

===Aspect ratio===
[[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)|Aspect ratio]] has been calculated with different definitions. The two methods outlined here give different, non-comparable values. The first method of calculation uses the wingspan ''b'', and the wing area ''S,'' and is given by,&lt;ref name="Farney 1969"&gt;Farney, J., &amp; Fleharty, E. D. (1969). Aspect ratio, loading, wing span, and membrane areas of bats. Journal of Mammalogy, 50(2), 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hedenström|first=A.|last2=Johansson|first2=L. C.|last3=Wolf|first3=M.|last4=Busse|first4=R. von|last5=Winter|first5=Y.|last6=Spedding|first6=G. R.|date=2007-05-11|title=Bat Flight Generates Complex Aerodynamic Tracks|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/316/5826/894|journal=Science|language=en|volume=316|issue=5826|pages=894–897|doi=10.1126/science.1142281|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17495171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-10-01|title=Recent progress in flapping wing aerodynamics and aeroelasticity|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376042110000023|journal=Progress in Aerospace Sciences|language=en|volume=46|issue=7|pages=284–327|doi=10.1016/j.paerosci.2010.01.001|issn=0376-0421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{AR} \equiv \frac{b^2}{S} = \frac{b}{\bar{c}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this definition, typical values of aspect ratio fall between 5 and 11 depending on the wing morphology of a given species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Faster flight speed is significantly correlated with higher aspect ratios.&lt;ref name="Findley 1972"&gt;Findley, J. S., Studier, E. H., &amp; Wilson, D. E. (1972). Morphologic properties of bat wings. Journal of Mammalogy, 53(3), 429-444.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher aspect ratios decrease the energetic costs of flight, which is beneficial to migratory species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt;

Another way to calculate the wing aspect ratio is by taking the length of the wrist to the tip of the third finger, adding the length of the forearm, and then dividing that total by the distance from the wrist to the fifth finger.&lt;ref name="Freeman 1981"&gt;Freeman, P. W. (1981). A multivariate study of the family Molossidae (Mammalia, Chiroptera): morphology, ecology, evolution. Mammalogy papers: University of Nebraska State Museum, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wing loading===
[[Wing loading]] is the weight of the bat divided by the wing area and is reported in the units, &lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Given a bat of mass ''m'', the wing loading ''Q'' is,

&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{m g}{S}&lt;/math&gt;

For bats, wing loading values typically range from 4 to 35 N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the bat species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Mass loading differs only by a constant ''[[Gravity of Earth|g]]'', and is reported as &lt;math&gt;\frac{kg}{m^2}&lt;/math&gt;as opposed to &lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

In a meta analysis covering 257 species of bats, higher relative wing loading values were observed in bats which fly at higher velocities, while lower wing loading values were correlated with improved flight maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Additionally, bats with lower wing loading were seen to have better mass-carrying ability, and were able carry larger prey while flying.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt;

===Wingtips===
Bats with larger wingtips have slower flight speeds.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Wings with rounded tips have lower aspect ratios, and are associated with slower, more maneuverable flight.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

==Wing morphology as it relates to ecology==
===Fast hawking===
Bats that consume insects by hawking (aerial pursuit and capture) must be able to travel at fast speeds, and must employ a high level of maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"&gt;Norberg and Rayner (1987). Ecological morphology and flight in bats (Mammalia; Chiroptera): wing adaptations, flight performance, foraging strategy and echolocation. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences 316.1179 (1987): 335–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphological adaptations that favor this style of flight include high wing loading, long and pointed wingtips, and wings with high aspect ratios.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The bat family [[Molossidae]] is considered highly specialized at hawking, with unusually high aspect ratios and wing loading.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; These traits make them capable of incredibly-fast speeds. [[Mexican free-tailed bat]]s are thought to be the fastest animal on earth, capable of horizontal flight speeds over a level surface up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/hr (99&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name="McCracken 2016"&gt;McCracken, G. F., Safi, K., Kunz, T. H., Dechmann, D. K., Swartz, S. M., &amp; Wikelski, M. (2016). Airplane tracking documents the fastest flight speeds recorded for bats. Royal Society Open Science, 3(11), 160398.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gleaning===
Bats that glean insects capture stationary prey on a solid substrate. This foraging method requires bats to hover above the substrate and listen for insect noises.&lt;ref name="Schmidt 2000"&gt;Schmidt, S., Hanke, S., &amp; Pillat, J. (2000). The role of echolocation in the hunting of terrestrial prey–new evidence for an underestimated strategy in the gleaning bat, Megaderma lyra. Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 186(10), 975-988.&lt;/ref&gt; Short, rounded wingtips in gleaning bats may be advantageous to allow maneuverability of flight in cluttered airspace.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Pointed wingtips may be detrimental to a bat's ability to glean insects.&lt;ref name="Stoffberg 2004"&gt;Stoffberg, S., &amp; Jacobs, D. S. (2004). The influence of wing morphology and echolocation on the gleaning ability of the insectivorous bat ''Myotis tricolor''. Canadian journal of zoology, 82(12), 1854-1863.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trawling===
Bats with this foraging style pluck insects off the surface of a body of water. [[Piscivore]]s employ the same flight style to catch fish just below the water's surface.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Trawling bats travel at slower speeds, which means that they require low wing loading.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Frugivory===
[[Frugivore]]s have below-average aspect ratios.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Fruit-eating bats have variable wing-loading, which corresponds to vertical stratification of rain forests.&lt;ref name="Hodgkison 2004"&gt;Hodgkison, R., Balding, S. T., Zubaid, A., &amp; Kunz, T. H. (2004). Habitat structure, wing morphology, and the vertical stratification of Malaysian fruit bats (Megachiroptera: Pteropodidae). Journal of Tropical Ecology, 20(06), 667-673.&lt;/ref&gt; Fruit-eating bats that travel below the canopy have higher wing-loading; bats that travel above the canopy have intermediate wing-loading; bats that travel in the understory have low wing-loading.&lt;ref name="Hodgkison 2004"/&gt; This pattern of decreasing wing-loading as airspace becomes more cluttered is consistent with data that suggest that lower wing-loading is associated with greater maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Nectarivory===
[[Nectarivore]]s, like gleaners, will frequently employ hovering during foraging. Hovering nectarivores are more likely to have rounded wingtips, which aids in maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Nectarivores that land on the flower before feeding have worse maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Nectarivores in general have lower aspect ratios, which makes them more suited to flight in a cluttered environment.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Nectarivores that migrate to seasonal food resources, such as the genus ''[[Leptonycteris]]'', have lower wing-loading than nectarivorous species with small home ranges.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Carnivory===
Bats that consume non-insect animal prey are benefited by low wing-loading, which allows them to lift and carry larger prey items.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; This increased capacity for lift even allows them to take flight from the ground while carrying a prey item that is half of their body weight.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Sanguinivory===
The three species of [[Hematophagy|sanguinivorous]] bats belong to the subfamily [[Vampire bat|Desmodontinae]]. These bats are characterized by relatively high wing-loading and short or average wingspans.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The high wing-loading allows them faster flight speeds, which is advantageous when they have to commute long distances from their roosts to find prey.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The [[common vampire bat]] has an average aspect ratio and very short, slightly rounded wingtips.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The [[hairy-legged vampire bat]] has the lowest aspect ratio of the three species; it also has relatively long and rounded wingtips.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Hairy-legged vampire bats are more adapted to maneuverable flights than the other two species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The [[white-winged vampire bat]] has the highest aspect ratio of the three species, which means it is most adapted to long flights.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

Designed in the [[United Kingdom]], the bebionic hand is manufactured by RSL Steeper and is available worldwide. Since February 2nd, 2017 BeBionic is owned by [[Otto Bock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healio.com/orthotics-prosthetics/industry-news/news/online/%7Be973ffbd-3c94-4a48-a400-7481c7af32df%7D/ottobock-acquires-bebionic-from-steeper|title=Ottobock acquires BeBionic from Steeper|website=www.healio.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bebionic.com/latest_news/new_owners_at_steeper_group|title=New Owners at Steeper Group|publisher=BeBionic|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

The bionic hand is said to receive instructions from sensors that detect the movement of the muscles in the patient’s arm. These instructions are processed, which are then directed to the 337 mechanical parts, which are present within this bionic hand that eventually, mimic natural human movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.todaysmedicaldevelopments.com/article/micromo-faulhaber-prosthetic-medical-device-bebionic-3917/|title=Bebionic myoelectric hand prosthesis - Today's Medical Developments|work=Today's Medical Developments|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== bebionic 2.0 ==

In September 2011, the bebionic second-generation prosthetic hand was updated with improvements to speed, accuracy, grip and durability. The updated version also saw the bebionic hand available two sizes - medium and large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bionic hand gets a grip on prosthetics market|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/8816665/Bionic-hand-gets-a-grip-on-prosthetics-market.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The device was upgraded with new, higher capacity 2200mAh split cell internal batteries for increased usage time.

In addition, the reverse effect is argued, where it is proposed that language comprehension influences movement and sensation. Proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action conduct and interpret [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Cognitive science|cognitive]], and [[Kinesiology|movement]] studies within the framework of [[embodied cognition]] and [[embodied language processing]]. '''Embodied language''' developed from embodied cognition, and proposes that sensorimotor systems are not only involved in the comprehension of language, but that they are necessary for understanding the [[Semantics|semantic]] meaning of words.

Action-oriented models of cognition propose that cognitive processes stem from action (bottom, red), thereby necessitating sensorimotor systems for higher cognitive processes like language comprehension. Adapted from Kilner et al. (2016).]]
The theory that sensory and motor processes are coupled to cognitive processes stems from action-oriented models of cognition.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://bernhard-hommel.eu/SFR18_10%20Kilner%20et%20al.pdf|title=The Pragmatic Turn: Toward Action-Oriented Views in Cognitive Science|last=Kilner|first=J.|last2=Hommel|first2=B.|last3=Bar|first3=M.|last4=Barsalou|first4=L.W.|last5=Friston|first5=K.J.|last6=Jost|first6=J.|last7=Maye|first7=A.|last8=Metzinger|first8=T.|last9=Pulvermuller|first9=F. et al.,|publisher=MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=|volume=18|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=159–173|chapter=Action-oriented models of cognitive processing: A little less cogitation, a little more action please}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories, such as the [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] and [[Situated cognition|situated]] cognitive theories, propose that cognitive processes are rooted in areas of the brain involved in [[Motor cortex|movement planning and execution]], as well as areas responsible for [[Primary sensory areas|processing]] [[Sensory cortex|sensory]] input, termed sensorimotor areas or areas of action and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barsalou|first=L.W.|year=2008|title=Grounded Cognition|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=59|pages=617–645|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to action-oriented models, higher cognitive processes evolved from sensorimotor brain regions, thereby necessitating sensorimotor areas for cognition and language comprehension.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; With this organization, it was then hypothesized that action and cognitive processes exert influence on one another in a bi-directional manner: action and perception influence language comprehension, and language comprehension influences sensorimotor processes.

Although studied in a unidirectional manner for many years, the bi-directional hypothesis was first described and tested in detail by Aravena et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These authors utilized the [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]], a task commonly used to study the relationship between action and language, to test the effects of performing simultaneous language comprehension and motor tasks on neural and behavioral signatures of movement and language comprehension.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These authors proposed that these two tasks cooperate bi-directionally when compatible, and interfere bi-directionally when incompatible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, when the movement implied by the action language stimuli is compatible with the movement being performed by the subject, it was hypothesized that performance of both tasks would be enhanced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Neural evidence of the bi-directional hypothesis was demonstrated by this study,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the development of this hypothesis is ongoing.

== Effects of Language Comprehension on Systems of Action ==
Language comprehension tasks can exert influence over systems of action, both at the neural and behavioral level. This means that language stimuli influence both electrical activity in sensorimotor areas of the brain, as well as actual movement.

=== Neural activation ===
Language stimuli influence electrical activity in sensorimotor areas of the brain that are specific to the bodily-association of the words presented. This is referred to as [[Semantics|semantic]] [[Somatotopic arrangement|somatotopy]], which indicates activation of sensorimotor areas that are specific to the bodily association implied by the word. For example, when processing the meaning of the word “kick,” the regions in the motor and somatosensory cortices that represent the legs will become more active.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hauk|first=O.|last2=Johnsrude|first2=I.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2004|title=Somatotopic representation of action words in human motor and premotor cortex|url=|journal=Neuron|volume=41|pages=301–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boulenger|first=V.|last2=Hauk|first2=O.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2009|title=Grasping ideas with the motor system: Semantic somatotopy in idiom comprehension|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=19|pages=1905–1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulenger et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; demonstrated this effect by presenting subjects with action-related language while measuring neural activity using [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]]. Subjects were presented with action sentences that were either associated with the legs (e.g. “John kicked the object”) or with the arms (e.g. “Jane grasped the object”). The medial region of the [[motor cortex]], known to represent the legs, was more active when subjects were processing leg-related sentences, whereas the lateral region of the motor cortex, known to represent the arms, was more active with arm-related sentences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This body-part-specific increase in activation was exhibited about 3 seconds after presentation of the word, a time window that is thought to indicate [[semantic processing]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, C., Binder, J.R., Medler, D.A., Liebenthal, E. (2007). "Time-course of semantic processes during sentence comprehension: an fMRI study." ''Neuroimage''. '''36''': 924-932.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this activation was associated with subjects comprehending the meaning of the word. This effect held true, and was even intensified, when subjects were presented with [[idiom]]atic sentences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Abstract language that implied more figurative actions were used, either associated with the legs (e.g. “John kicked the habit”) or the arms (e.g. “Jane grasped the idea”).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Increased neural activation of leg motor regions were demonstrated with leg-related idiomatic sentences, whereas arm-related idiomatic sentences were associated with increased activation of arm motor regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This activation was larger than that demonstrated by more literal sentences (e.g. “John kicked the object”), and was also present in the time window associated with semantic processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Action language not only activates body-part-specific areas of the motor cortex, but also influences neural activity associated with movement. This has been demonstrated during an [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]] task, a common test used to study the relationship between language comprehension and motor behavior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glenberg|first=A. M.|last2=Kaschak|first2=M.P.|date=2002|title=Grounding language in action|url=|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=9|pages=558–565}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task requires the subject to perform movements to indicate understanding of a sentence, such as moving to press a button or pressing a button with a specific hand posture, that are either compatible or incompatible with movement implied by the sentence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, pressing a button with an open hand to indicate understanding of the sentence "Jane high-fived Jack" would be considered a compatible movement, as the sentence implies an open-handed posture. Motor potentials (MP) are an [[Event-related potential|Event Related Potentials]] (ERPs) stemming from the motor cortex, and are associated with execution of movement.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Enhanced amplitudes of MPs have been associated with precision and quickness of movements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hatta|first=A.|last2=Nishihira|first2=Y.|last3=Higashiura|first3=T.|last4=Kim|first4=S.R.|last5=Kaneda|first5=T.|date=2009|title=Long-term motor practice induces practice-dependent modulation of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) preceding self-paced non-dominant handgrip movement in kendo players|url=|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=459|pages=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobounov|first=S.|last2=Johnston|first2=J.|last3=Chiang|first3=H.|last4=Ray|first4=W.J.|date=2002|title=Motor-related cortical potentials accompanying enslaving effect in single versus combination of fingers force production tasks|url=|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=113|pages=1444–1453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-afferent potentials (RAPs) are another form of ERP, and are used as a marker of sensory feedback&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deecke|first=L.|date=1987|title=Bereitschaftspotential as an indicator of movement preparation in supplementary motor area and motor cortex|url=|journal=Ciba Foundation Symposium|volume=132|pages=231–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=A.L.|last2=Staines|first2=W.R.|date=2006|title=Cortical adaptions and motor performance improvement associated with short-term bimanual training|url=|journal=Brain Research|volume=1071|pages=165–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both MP and RAP have been demonstrated to be enhanced during compatible ACE conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These results indicate that language can have a facilitory effect on the excitability of neural sensorimotor systems. This has been referred to as [[Priming (psychology)#Semantic|semantic]] [[Priming (psychology)|priming]],&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grisoni|first=L.|last2=Dreyer|first2=F.R.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2016|title=Somatotopic Semantic Priming and Prediction in the Motor System|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=26|pages=2353–2366}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that language primes neural sensorimotor systems, altering excitability and movement.

=== Movement ===
The ability of language to influence neural activity of motor systems also manifests itself behaviorally by altering movement. Semantic priming has been implicated in these behavioral changes, and has been used as evidence for the involvement of the motor system in language comprehension. The [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]] is indicative of these semantic priming effects. Understanding language that implies action may invoke motor facilitation, or prime the motor system, when the action or posture being performed to indicate language comprehension is compatible with action or posture implied by the language. Compatible ACE tasks have been shown to lead to shorter reaction times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwaan|first=R.A.|last2=Taylor|first2=L.J.|date=2006|title=Seeing, acting, understanding: motor resonance in language comprehension|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=135|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been demonstrated on various types of movements, including hand posture during button pressing,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; reaching,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and manual rotation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Language stimuli can also prime the motor system simply by describing objects that are commonly manipulated. In a study performed by Masson et al., subjects were presented with sentences that implied non-physical, abstract action with an object (e.g. "John thought about the calculator" or "Jane remembered the thumbtack").&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After presentation of language stimuli, subjects were cued to perform either functional gestures, gestures typically made when using the object described in the sentence (e.g. poking for calculator sentences), or a volumetric gesture, gestures that are more indicative of whole hand posture (e.g. horizontal grasp for calculator sentences).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Target gestures were either compatible or incompatible with the described object, and were cued at two different time points, early and late. Response latencies for performing compatible functional gestures significantly decreased at both time points, whereas latencies were significantly lower for compatible volumetric gestures in the late cue condition.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masson|first=M.E.|last2=Bub|first2=D.N.|last3=Newton-Taylor|first3=M.|date=2008|title=Language-based access to gestural components of conceptual knowledge|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=61|pages=869–882}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results indicate that descriptions of abstract interactions with objects automatically (early time point) generate motor representations of functional gestures, priming the motor system and increasing response speed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The specificity of enhanced motor responses to the gesture-object interaction also highlights the importance of the motor system in semantic processing, as this enhanced motor response was dependent on the meaning of the word.  
[[File:Olmstead et al. figure.png|left|thumb|Change in relative phase shift (RPS), indicating movement coordination, as a function of language stimuli. Subjects exhibited a significant change in RPS only when presented with performable sentences. Adapted from Olmstead et al. (2009).]]
A study performed by Dr. Olmstead et al.,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olmstead|first=A.J.|last2=Viswanathan|first2=N.|last3=Aicher|first3=K.A.|last4=Fowler|first4=C.A.|date=2009|title=Sentence comprehension affects the dynamics of bimanual coordination: Implications for embodied cognition|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=62|pages=2409–2417}}&lt;/ref&gt; described in detail [[Embodied cognition#Language comprehension|elsewhere]], demonstrates more concretely the influence that the semantics of action language can have on movement coordination. Briefly, this study investigated the effects of action language on the coordination of rhythmic bimanual hand movements. Subjects were instructed to move two [[pendulum]]s, one with each hand, either in-[[Phase (waves)|phase]] (pendulums are at the same point in their cycle, [[phase difference]] of roughly 0 degrees) or anti-phase (pendulums are at the opposite point in their cycle, phase difference of roughly 180 degrees).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Robust behavioral studies have revealed that these two phase states, with phase differences 180 and 0 degrees, are the two stable relative phase states, or the two coordination patterns that produce stable movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information, natural law, and the self-assembly of rhythmic movement|last=Kugler|first=P.|last2=Turvey|first2=M.|publisher=Routledge|year=1987|isbn=|location=Hillside, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This pendulum swinging task was performed as subjects judged sentences for their plausibility; subjects were asked to indicate whether or not each presented sentence made logical sense.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plausible sentences described actions that could be performed by a human using the arms, hands, and/or fingers ("He is swinging the bat"), or actions that could not be performed ("The barn is housing the goat").&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Implausible sentences also used similar action verbs ("He is swinging the hope"). Plausible, performable sentences lead to a significant change in the relative phase shift of the bimanual pendulum task.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The coordination of the movement was altered by action language stimuli, as the relative phase shift that produced stable movement was significantly different than in the non-performable sentence and no language stimuli conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This development of new stable states has been used to imply a reorganization of the motor system utilized to plan and execute this movement,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and supports the bi-directional hypothesis by demonstrating an effect of action language on movement.

== Effects of Systems of Action on Language Comprehension ==
The bi-directional hypothesis of action and language proposes that altering the activity of motor systems, either through altered neural activity or actual movement, influences language comprehension. Neural activity in specific areas of the brain can be altered using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), or by studying patients with [[Neuropathology|neuropathologies]] leading to specific sensory and/or motor deficits. Movement is also used to alter the activity of neural motor systems, increasing overall excitability of motor and pre-motor areas.

=== Neural activation ===
Altered neural activity of motor systems has been demonstrated to influence language comprehension. One such study that demonstrates this effect was performed by Dr. Pulvermüller et al.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulvermüller|first=F.|last2=Hauk|first2=O.|last3=Nikulin|first3=V.|last4=Ilmoneimi|first4=R.J.|date=2005|title=Functional links between motor and language systems|url=|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|volume=21|pages=793–797}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMS was used to increase the excitability of either the leg region or the arm region of the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Authors stimulated the left motor cortex, known to be more closely involved in language processing in right-handed individuals, the right motor cortex, as well as a sham stimulation where stimulation was prevented by a plastic block placed between the coil and the skull.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During the stimulation protocols, subjects were shown 50 arm, 50 leg, 50 distractor (no bodily relation), and 100 pseudo- (not real) words.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Subjects were asked to indicate recognition of a meaningful word by moving their lips, and response times were measured.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It was found that stimulation of the left leg region of the motor cortex significantly reduced response times for recognition of leg words as compared to arm words, whereas the reverse was true for stimulation of the arm region.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Stimulation site on the right motor cortex, as well as sham stimulation, did not exhibit these effects.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, somatotopically-specific stimulation of the left motor cortex facilitated word comprehension in a body-part-specific manner, where stimulation of the leg and arm regions lead to enhanced comprehension of leg and arm words, respectively.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This study has been used as evidence for the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action, as it showcases that manipulating motor cortex activity alters language comprehension in a semantically-specific manner.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A similar experiment has been performed on the articulatory motor cortex, or the mouth and lip regions of the motor cortex used in the production of words.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schomers|first=M.R.|last2=Kirilina|first2=E.|last3=Weigand|first3=A.|last4=Bajbouj|first4=M.|last5=Pulvermüller|first5=F.|date=2014|title=Causal influence of articulatory motor cortex on comprehending single spoken words: TMS evidence|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=25|pages=3894–3902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two categories of words were used as language stimuli: words that involved the lips for production (e.g. "pool") or the tongue (e.g. "tool).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Subjects listened to the words, were shown pairs of pictures, and were asked to indicate which picture matched the word they heard with a button press.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; TMS was used prior to presentation of the language stimuli to selectively facilitate either the lip or tongue regions of the left motor cortex; these two TMS conditions were compared to a control condition where TMS was not applied.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It was found that stimulation of the lip region of the motor cortex lead to a significantly decreased response time for lip words as compared to tongue words.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In addition, during recognition of tongue words, reduced reaction times were seen with tongue TMS as compared to lip TMS and no TMS.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although this same effect was not seen with lip words, authors attribute this to the complexity of tongue as opposed to lip movements, and the increase difficulty of tongue words as opposed to lip.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Overall, this study demonstrates that the activity in the articulatory motor cortex influences the comprehension of single spoken words, and highlights the importance of the motor cortex in speech comprehension&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Lesions of sensory and motor areas have also been studied to elucidate the effects of sensorimotor systems on language comprehension. One such example of this is the patient JR; this patient has a lesion in areas in the auditory association [[Auditory cortex|cortex]] implicated in processing [[Auditory system|auditory]] information.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trumpp|first=N.M.|last2=Kliese|first2=D.|last3=Hoenig|first3=K.|last4=Haarmeier|first4=T.|last5=Kiefer|first5=M.|date=2013|title=Losing the sound of concepts: Damage to auditory association cortex impairs the processing of sound-related concepts|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=49|pages=474–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; This patient showcases significant impairments in conceptual and perceptual processing of sound-related language and objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, processing the meaning of words describing sound-related objects (e.g., "bell') was significantly impaired in JR as compared to non-sound-related objects (e.g., "armchair").&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These data suggest that damage of sensory regions involved in processing auditory information specifically impair processing of sound-related conceptual information,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; highlighting the necessity of sensory systems for language comprehension.

=== Movement ===
Movement has been shown to influence language comprehension. This has been demonstrated by priming motor areas with movement, increasing the excitability of motor and pre-motor areas associated with the body part being moved.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mollo|first=G.|last2=Pulvermüller|first2=F.|last3=Hauk|first3=O.|date=2016|title=Movement priming of EEG/MEG brain responses for action-words characterizes the link between language and action|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=74|pages=262–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that motor engagement of a specific body part decreases neural activity in language processing areas when processing words related to that body part.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This decreased neural activity is a feature of semantic priming, and suggests that activation of specific motor areas through movement can facilitate language comprehension in a semantically-dependent manner.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; An interference effect has also been demonstrated. During incompatible ACE conditions, neural signatures of language comprehension have been shown to be inhibited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Combined, these pieces of evidence have been used to support a semantic role of the motor system.

Movement can also inhibit language comprehension tasks, particularly tasks of verbal working memory.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shebani|first=Z.|last2=Pulvermüller|first2=F.|date=2013|title=Moving the hands and feet specifically impairs working memory for arm-and leg-related action words|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=49|pages=222–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to memorize and verbally recall four-word sequences of either arm or leg action words, performing complex, rhythmic movements after presentation of the word sequences was demonstrated to interfere with memory performance.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This performance deficit was body-part specific, where movement of the legs impaired performance of recall of leg words, and movement of the arms impaired recall of arm words.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These data indicate that sensorimotor systems exhibit cortically specific "inhibitory casual effects" on memory of action words,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; as impairment was specific to motor engagement and bodily association of the words.

== Organization of Neural Substrates ==
Relating cognitive functions to brain structures is done in the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]]. This field attempts to map cognitive processes, such as language comprehension, onto neural activation of specific brain structures.The bi-directional hypothesis of language and action requires that action and language processes have overlapping brain structures, or shared [[neural substrate]]s, thereby necessitating motor areas for language comprehension. The neural substrates of embodied cognition are often studied using the cognitive tasks of [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|object recognition]], [[Activity recognition|action recognition]], [[Working memory|working memory tasks]], and [[Sentence processing|language comprehension]] tasks. These networks have been elucidated with behavioral, computational, and imaging studies, but the discovery of their exact organization is ongoing.

=== Circuit organization ===
[[File:Leg Neural Network.jpg|thumb|Proposed organization of motor-semantic neural circuits for action language comprehension. Gray dots represent areas of language comprehension, creating a network for comprehending all language. The semantic circuit of the motor system, particularly the motor representation of the legs (yellow dots), is incorporated when leg-related words are comprehended. Adapted from Shebani et al. (2013).]]
It has been proposed that the control of movement is organized hierarchically, where movement is not controlled by individually controlling single neurons, but that movements are represented at a gross, more functional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawato|first=M.|last2=Furukawa|first2=K.|last3=Suzuki|first3=R.|date=1987|title=A hierarchical neural-network model for control and learning of voluntary movement|url=|journal=Biological cybernetics|volume=57|pages=169–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept has been applied to the control of cognition, resulting in the theory of cognitive circuits.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulvermüller|first=F.|last2=Garagnani|first2=M.|last3=Wennekers|first3=T.|date=2014|title=Thinking in circuits: toward neurobiological explanation in cognitive neuroscience|url=|journal=Biological cybernetics|volume=108|pages=573–593}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory proposes that there are functional units of neurons in the brain that are strongly connected, and act coherently as a functional unit during cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These functional units of neurons, or "thought circuits," have been referred to as the "building blocks of cognition".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thought circuits are believed to have been originally formed from basic anatomical connections, that were strengthened with correlated activity through [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian learning]] and plasticity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Formation of these neural networks has been demonstrated with computational models using known anatomical connections and Hebbian learning principles.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Pulvermüller, F., &amp; Garagnani, M. (2014). From sensorimotor learning to memory cells in prefrontal and temporal association cortex: a neurocomputational study of disembodiment. ''Cortex,'' '''57:''' 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sensory stimulation through interaction with an object activates a distributed network of neurons in the cortex. Repeated activation of these neurons, through Hebbian plasticity, may strengthen their connections and form a circuit.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doursat, R., &amp; Bienenstock, E. "Neocortical self-structuration as a basis for learning." ''5th International conference on development and learning (ICDL 2006)''. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This sensory circuit may then be activated during the perception of known objects.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This same concept has been applied to action and language, as understanding of the meaning of action words requires an understanding of the action itself. During language and motor skill development, one likely learns to associate an action word with an action or a sensation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This action or sensation, and the correlated sensorimotor areas involved, are then incorporated into the neural representation of that concept.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This leads to semantic topography, or the activation of motor areas related to the meaning and bodily-association of action language.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These networks may be organized into "kernels," areas highly activated by language comprehension tasks, and "halos," brain areas in the periphery of networks that experience slightly increased activation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; It has been hypothesized that language comprehension is housed in the left-perisylvian neuronal circuit, forming the "kernel," and sensorimotor regions are peripherally activated during semantic processing of action language, forming the "halo".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Evidence for shared neural networks ===
Many studies that have demonstrated a role of the motor system in semantic processing of action language have been used as evidence for a shared neural network between action and language comprehension processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; For example, facilitated activity in language comprehension areas, evidence of semantic priming, with movement of a body part that is associated with the action word has also been used as evidence for this shared neural network.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A more specific method for identifying whether certain areas of the brain are necessary for a cognitive task is to demonstrate impaired performance of said task following a functional change to the brain area of interest.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Shallice, T. ''From neuropsychology to mental structure''. Cambridge University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  A functional change may involve a lesion, or altered excitability through stimulation, or utilization of the area for another task.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; According to this theory, there is only a finite amount of neural real-estate available for each task. If two tasks share a neural network, there will be competition for the associated neural substrates, and the performance of each task will be inhibited when performed simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Using this theory, proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis have postulated that performance of verbal working memory of action words would be impaired by movement of the concordant body part.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This has been demonstrated with the selective impairment of memorization of arm and leg words when coupled with arm and leg movements, respectively.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This implies that the neural network for verbal working memory is specifically tied to the motor systems associated with the body part implied with the word.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This semantic topography has been suggested to provide evidence that action language shares a neural network with sensorimotor systems, thereby supporting the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action.

'''Biosolids''' is a term used for several types of treated [[sewage sludge]]s that can be used as [[soil conditioner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=L.K|last2=Shammas|first2=N.K|last3=Hung|first3=Yung-Tse|title=Biosolids treatment processes|date=2007|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, N.J|isbn=9781592599967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treated sewage sludge has long been [[Reuse of excreta|used in agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Land Treatment of Waste Water|last=Gohil|first=M.B.|date=2000|publisher=New Age International|isbn=8122412270|edition=|volume=|location=|page=6|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are concerns about offensive [[odor]]s and disease risks from [[pathogen]]s and [[toxic]] chemicals. This may reduce public acceptance of such reuse activities.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Terminology ==

Biosolids may be defined as organic wastewater solids that can be reused after suitable [[sewage sludge treatment]] processes leading to sludge stabilization such as [[anaerobic digestion]] and [[composting]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title = Wastewater engineering : treatment and reuse|publisher = Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., McGraw Hill, USA|isbn = 0-07-112250-8|page = 1449|edition = 4th|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the biosolids definition may be restricted by local regulations to wastewater solids only after those solids have completed a specified treatment sequence and/or have concentrations of pathogens and toxic chemicals below specified levels.&lt;ref name="epa"/&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defines the two terms – sewage sludge and biosolids – in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR), Title 40, Part 503 as follows: ''Sewage sludge'' refers to the solids separated during the treatment of municipal wastewater (including domestic [[septage]]), while ''biosolids'' refers to treated sewage sludge that meets the EPA pollutant and pathogen requirements for land application and surface disposal.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/region9/water/npdes/sludge.html |title=Sewage Sludge/Biosolids Program |last= |first= |website= |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar definition has been used internationally, for example in Australia.&lt;ref name="awa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biosolids.com.au/what-are-biosolids.php |title=What are biosolids? |last= |first= |website= |publisher=Australian Water Association |accessdate=24 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423124151/http://www.biosolids.com.au/what-are-biosolids.php |archivedate=23 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the term "biosolids" may officially be subject to government regulations. However, informal use describes a broad range of semi-solid organic products produced from [[sewage]] or sewage sludge. This could include any solids, slime solids or liquid slurry residue generated during the treatment of domestic sewage including scum and solids removed during primary, [[secondary treatment|secondary]] or advanced treatment processes.&lt;ref name="wwd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwdmag.com/biosolids-or-sludge-semantics-terminology|title=Biosolids or Sludge? The Semantics of Terminology|last=Turovskiy|first=Izrail S.|website=|publisher=Water and Wastes Digest|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials that do not conform to the regulatory definition of "biosolids" can be given alternative terms like "wastewater solids".

== Characteristic ==

=== Quantities  ===
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 4522 Testing for pathogens in agricultural soil containing biosolids.jpg|thumb|Testing for human pathogens in cereal crops after the application of biosolids.]]Approximately 7.1 million dry tons of biosolids were generated in 2004 at approximately 16,500 [[Sewage treatment|municipal wastewater treatment facilities]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=wef/&gt;

In the United States, as of 2013 about 55% of sewage solids are turned into [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name="black_gold"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=176822392 Cities Turn Sewage Into 'Black Gold' For Local Farms] (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges faced when increasing the use of biosolids include,  the capital needed to build [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digesters]] and the complexity of complying with health regulations. There are also new concerns about micro-pollutions in sewage (e.g. [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s) which make the process of producing high quality biosolids complex.&lt;ref name="Smith, S. R. 2009"&gt;Smith, S. R. (2009). Organic contaminants in sewage sludge (biosolids) and their significance for agricultural recycling. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 367(1904), 4005-4041&lt;/ref&gt; Some municipalities, states or countries have banned the use of biosolids on farmland.&lt;ref name="Smith, S. R. 2009"/&gt;

=== Nutrients ===
Encouraging agricultural use of biosolids is intended to prevent filling landfills with nutrient-rich organic materials from the treatment of domestic sewage that might be recycled and applied as fertilizer to improve and maintain productive soils and stimulate plant growth.&lt;ref name="wef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nviro.com/files/Biosolids_Facts.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404072822/http://www.nviro.com/files/Biosolids_Facts.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 April 2015 |title=Questions and Answers on Land Application of Biosolids  |last= |first= |website= |publisher=Water Environment Federation |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biosolids can be an ideal agricultural conditioner and fertilizer&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R. (1998). The use of biosolids from wastewater treatment plants in agriculture. Environmental Management and Health, 9(4), 165-169.&lt;/ref&gt; which can help promote crop growth to feed the increasing population. Biosolids may contain macronutrients [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[sulphur]] with micronutrients [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[boron]], [[molybdenum]] and [[manganese]].&lt;ref name="awa" /&gt;

=== Industrial and man-made contaminants ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and others have shown that biosolids can contain measurable levels of [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic organic compounds]], [[radionuclide]]s and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]].&lt;ref name="awa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biosolids: Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey Report - Overview {{!}} Biosolids {{!}} US EPA|url = http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/biosolids/tnsss-overview.cfm|website = water.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/docs/tenorm/832-r-03-002b.pdf|title = ISCORS Assessment of Radioactivity in Sewage  Sludge: Recommendations on Management of  Radioactive Materials in Sewage Sludge and Ash  at Publicly Owned Treatment Works|date = April 2004|accessdate = 18 May 2015|website = United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|publisher = Interagency Steering Committee on Radiation Standards|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has set numeric limits for [[arsenic]], [[cadmium]], copper, [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], molybdenum, [[nickel]], [[selenium]], and zinc but has not regulated dioxin levels.&lt;ref name="wef" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Final Action Not to Regulate Dioxins in Land-Applied Sewage Sludge {{!}} Biosolids {{!}} US EPA|url = http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/biosolids/dioxinfs.cfm|website = water.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contaminants from pharmaceuticals and personal care products and some steroids and hormones may also be present in biosolids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CWA Analytical Methods: Contaminants of Emerging Concern|url = https://www.epa.gov/cwa-methods/cwa-analytical-methods-contaminants-emerging-concern|website = epa.gov|accessdate = 2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Substantial levels of persistent, [[bioaccumulative]] and toxic (PBT) [[polybrominated diphenyl ether]]s were detected in biosolids in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flame retardants: Persistent pollutants in land-applied sludges|publisher=|journal=Nature|volume=412|issue=6843|pages=140–141|doi=10.1038/35084130|pmid=11449259|vauthors=Hale RC, La Guardia MJ, Harvey EP, Gaylor MO, Mainor TM, Duff WH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Geological Survey]] analyzed in 2014 nine different consumer products containing biosolids as a main ingredient for 87 organic chemicals found in cleaners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and other products. These analysis detected 55 of the 87 organic chemicals measured in at least one of the nine biosolid samples, with as many as 45 chemicals found in a single sample.&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/regional/emc/municipal_biosolids.html |title=Land Application of Municipal Biosolids |last= |first= |website=Environmental Health - Toxic Substances |publisher=United States Geological Survey |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the City of Charlotte discovered extreme levels of PCB's in their biosolids after being alerted by SCDHEC that illegal PCB dumping was taking place at regional waste water treatment plants across the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9095525.html|title=Task force named to probe chemical dumping|work=charlotteobserver|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biosolids land application was halted after an emergency regulation was enacted by SCDHEC that outlawed any PCB contaminated biosolids from being land applied regardless if Class A or Class B.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926153115/http://www.scdhec.gov/administration/news/2013/nr20130925-01.htm|title=S.C. DHEC: News - DHEC Issues Emergency Regulation, Expands Investigation into PCBs Found at Water Treatment Plants|date=2013-09-26|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Very soon thereafter, SCDHEC expanded PCB fish consumption adviseries for nearly every waterway bordering biosolids land application fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scdhec.gov/FoodSafety/FishConsumptionAdvisories/#Map|title=DHEC: Fish Consumption Advisories|last=Control|first=S.C. Dept. of Health and Environmental|website=scdhec.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathogens ===
In the United States the EPA mandates certain treatment processes designed to significantly decrease levels of certain so-called [[indicator organism]]s, in biosolids.&lt;ref name="wef" /&gt; These include, "...operational standards for fecal coliforms, ''Salmonella'' sp. bacteria, enteric viruses, and viable [[helminth]] ova."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biosolids Applied to Land: Advancing Standards and Practices|last = |first = |publisher = National Academy of Sciences|year = 2002|isbn = 0-309-08486-5|location = |pages = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the US-based Water Environment Research Foundation has shown that some pathogens do survive [[sewage sludge treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Assessing the Fate of Emerging Pathogens in Biosolids|url = http://www.werf.org/WERFDownload.aspx?ContentKey=9a2ee773-f7e3-4d50-9e6e-0a7c96d26e0a&amp;ContentItemKey=989e1b81-5b11-4871-97d9-98aeef322f08|website = Water Environment Research Foundation|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA regulations allow only biosolids with no detectable pathogens to be widely applied; those with remaining pathogens are restricted in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biosolids FAQ, Questions 17-18|url = http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/wastewater/treatment/biosolids/genqa.cfm|website = water.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different types of biosolids ==
# Anaerobic Digestion: Micro-organisms decompose the sludge in the absence of oxygen either at mesophilic (at 35&amp;nbsp;°C) or thermophilic (between 50° and 57&amp;nbsp;°C) temperatures.

# Aerobic Digestion: Micro-organisms decompose the sludge in the presence of oxygen either at ambient and mesophilic (10&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C) or auto-thermal (40&amp;nbsp;°C to 80&amp;nbsp;°C) temperatures.

# Composting: A biological process where organic matter decomposes to produce humus after the addition of some dry bulking material such as sawdust, wood chips, or shredded yard waste under controlled aerobic conditions.

# Alkaline Treatment: The sludge is mixed with alkaline materials such as lime or cement kiln dust, or incinerator fly ash and maintained at pH above 12 for 24 hours (for Class B) or at temperature 70&amp;nbsp;°C for 30 minutes (for Class A).

# Heat Drying: Either convention or conduction dryers are used to dry the [[Sport|biosolids]]

# Dewatering: The separation of the water from biosolids is done to obtain a semi-solid or solid product by using a dewatering technologies (centrifuges, belt filter presses, plate and frame filter presses, and drying beds and lagoons).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccme.ca/files/Resources/waste/biosolids/pn_1448_biosolids_esoc_final_e.pdf|title=Emerging substances of concern in biosolids: concentrations and effects of treatment processes|last=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment.|first=|date=2010|website=https://www.ccme.ca/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification systems ==

=== United States ===
In the United States [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR), Title 40, Part 503 governs the management of biosolids. Within that federal regulation biosolids are generally classified differently depending upon the quantity of pollutants they contain and the level of treatment they have been subjected to (the latter of which determines both the level of vector attraction reduction and the level of pathogen reduction). These factors also affect how they may be disseminated (bulk or bagged) and the level of monitoring oversight which, in turn determines where and in what quantity they may be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Plain English Guide to the EPA Part 503 Biosolids Rule, Chapter 2 "Land Application of Biosolids"|url = http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/biosolids/upload/2002_06_28_mtb_biosolids_503pe_503pe_2.pdf|website = water.epa.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-20|page = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
The European Union (EU) was the first to issue regulations for biosolids land application; this aimed to put a limit to the pathogen and pollution risk.&lt;ref&gt;Iranpour, R., Cox, H. H. J., Kearney, R. J., Clark, J. H., Pincince, A. B., &amp; Daigger, G. T. (2004). Regulations for biosolids land application in US and European Union. Journal of Residuals Science &amp; Technology, 1(4), 209-22.&lt;/ref&gt; These risks come from the fact that some metabolites remain intact after waste water treatment processes.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, R. M., &amp; Cummins, E. (2015). Evaluation of “classic” and emerging contaminants resulting from the application of biosolids to agricultural lands: A review. Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal, 21(2), 492-513.&lt;/ref&gt; Debates over biosolid use vary in severity acros the EU&lt;ref&gt;Iranpour, R., Cox, H. H. J., Kearney, R. J., Clark, J. H., Pincince, A. B., &amp; Daigger, G. T. (2004).Regulations for biosolids land application in US and European Union. Journal of Residuals Science &amp; Technology, 1(4), 209-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and gathering acceptance is the major hurdle facing biosolids in Europe.

== History ==
{{Further|Sewage sludge#History}}
As public concern arose about the disposal of increased volumes of solids in the United States being removed from sewage during [[sewage treatment]] mandated by the [[Clean Water Act]]. The [[Water Environment Federation]] (WEF) sought a new name to distinguish the clean, agriculturally viable product generated by modern wastewater treatment from earlier forms of sewage sludge widely remembered for causing offensive or dangerous conditions. Of three-hundred suggestions, ''biosolids'' was attributed to Dr. Bruce Logan of the [[University of Arizona]], and recognized by WEF in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thewatchers.us/wef/explain.pdf |title=Biosolids: A Short Explanation and Discussion |last= |first= |website=WEF/U.S. EPA Biosolids Fact Sheet Project |publisher=Water Environment Federation |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Collecting CWR IK Morocco.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Two conservationists collecting indigenous knowledge on cultural practices that favour CWR populations, from a farmer near [[Fes]], Morocco.]]

A '''crop wild relative''' ('''CWR''') is a wild plant closely related to a [[domesticated plant]], whose geographic origins can be traced to regions known as [[Vavilov Center]]s (named for the pioneering [[botanist]] [[Nikolai Vavilov]]).  It may be a wild ancestor of the domesticated plant, or another closely related [[taxon]].

== Overview ==
The wild relatives of crop plants constitute an increasingly important resource for improving agricultural production and for maintaining sustainable agro-ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Bioversity International, (2006). ''Crop wild relatives''. Bioversity International, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAO, (1998). ''The State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture''. FAO, Rome&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAO, (2008). ''Establishment of a global network for the in situ conservation of crop wild relatives: status and needs''. FAO, Rome&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of anthropogenic climate change and greater ecosystem instability CWRs are likely to prove a critical resource in ensuring food security for the new millennium.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Maxted, N., Ford-Lloyd, B.V. and Kell, S.P., (2008). Crop wild relatives: establishing the context. In: Maxted, N., Ford-Lloyd, B.V., Kell, S.P. Iriondo, J., Dulloo, E. and Turok, J. (eds.) ''Crop Wild Relative Conservation and Use''. Pp. 3-30. CABI Publishing, Wallingford.&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Nikolai Vavilov]], the Russian botanist who first realized the importance of crop wild relatives in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vavilov, N.I., (1926). ''Studies in the origin of cultivated plants''. Institute of Applied Botany and Plant Breeding, Leningrad.&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetic material from CWRs has been utilized by humans for thousands of years to improve the quality and yield of crops. Farmers have used traditional breeding methods for millennia, wild [[maize]] (''Zea mexicana'') is routinely grown alongside maize to promote natural crossing and improve yields. More recently, plant breeders have utilised CWR genes to improve a wide range of crops like [[rice]] (''Oryza sativa''), [[tomato]] (''Solanum lycopersicum'') and grain [[legumes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hajjar R., Hodgkin T. | year = 2007 | title = The use of wild relatives in crop improvement: a survey of developments over the last 20 years | url = | journal = Euphytica | volume = 156 | issue = | pages = 1–13 | doi=10.1007/s10681-007-9363-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CWRs have contributed many useful genes to crop plants, and modern varieties of most major crops now contain genes from their wild relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dempewolf|first=Hannes|last2=Baute|first2=Gregory|last3=Anderson|first3=Justin|last4=Kilian|first4=Benjamin|last5=Smith|first5=Chelsea|last6=Guarino|first6=Luigi|date=2017-05-06|title=Past and Future Use of Wild Relatives in Crop Breeding|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/57/3/1070|journal=Crop Science|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=1070–1082|doi=10.2135/cropsci2016.10.0885|issn=0011-183X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, CWRs are wild plants related to socio-economically important species including food, fodder and forage crops, [[medicinal plants]], condiments, ornamental, and forestry species, as well as plants used for industrial purposes, such as oils and fibres, and to which they can contribute beneficial traits. A CWR can be defined as "... a wild plant [[taxon]] that has an indirect use derived from its relatively close genetic relationship to a crop...”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maxted N., Ford-Lloyd B.V., Jury S.L., Kell S.P., Scholten M.A. | year = 2006 | title = Towards a definition of a crop wild relative | url = | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 15 | issue = 8| pages = 2673–2685 | doi=10.1007/s10531-005-5409-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation of crop wild relatives ==
[[File:Genetic-Reserve-Syria.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Example of one of the first genetic reserves established to conserve CWRs near Kalakh al Hosn, [[Syria]]]]
CWRs are essential components of natural and agricultural [[ecosystems]] and hence are indispensable for maintaining ecosystem health.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Their conservation and sustainable use is very important for improving agricultural production, increasing [[food security]], and maintaining a healthy environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, J.G., Maxted, N. and Ford-Lloyd, B.V., (2000). ''The ex situ conservation of plant genetic resources''. pp. 1-250. Kluwer, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heywood V.H., Dulloo M.E. | year = 2006 | title = In Situ Conservation of Wild Plant Species – a Critical Global Review of Good Practices.

[[File:Geographic hotspots of distributions of crop wild relatives not represented in genebanks.tif|thumb|left|Geographic hotspots of distributions of crop wild relatives not represented in genebanks]]

The natural populations of many CWRs are increasingly at risk. They are threatened by [[habitat loss]] through the destruction and degradation of natural environment or their conversion to other uses. Deforestation is leading to the loss of many populations of important wild relatives of fruit, nut, and industrial crops. Populations of wild relatives of cereal crops that occur in arid or semi-arid lands are being severely reduced by over grazing and resulting desertification. The growing industrialization of agriculture is drastically reducing the occurrence of CWRs within the traditional agro-ecosystems. The wise conservation and use of CWRs are essential elements for increasing food security, eliminating poverty, and maintaining the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tanksley S.D., [[Susan McCouch|McCouch S.R.]] | year = 1997 | title = Seed banks and molecular maps: Unlocking genetic potential from the wild | url = | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = | pages = 1063–1066 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5329.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation strategies for CWRs often consider both ''in situ'' and ''ex situ'' conservation.&lt;ref name=CzechCWR&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Taylor, N.G.; Kell, S.P.; Holubec, V.; Parra-Quijano M.; Chobot K.; Maxted N. |title=A systematic conservation strategy for crop wild relatives in the Czech Republic |journal=Diversity and Distributions |date=2017 |volume=23  |issue=4 |pages=448–462 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12539/full |doi=10.1111/ddi.12539}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are complementary approaches to CWR conservation, since each has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, whilst ''ex situ'' conservation protects CWR (or more correctly, their genes) from threats in the wild, it can limit [[evolution]] and [[adaptation]] to new environmental challenges.

In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=Castaneda&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Castañeda-Álvarez N.P.; Khoury C.K.; Achicanoy, H.A.; Bernau, V; Dempewolf, H.; Eastwood, R.J.; Guarino, L.; Harker, R.H.; Jarvis, A.; Maxted, N.; Mueller, J.V.; Ramírez-Villegas J, Sosa C.C.; Struik, P.C.; Vincent, H.; Toll, J. |title=Global conservation priorities for crop wild relatives |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=16022 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.22 |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CWRpolbrief&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Khoury, C.K.; Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P.; Dempewolf, H.; Eastwood, R.J.; Guarino, L.; Jarvis, A.; Struik, P.C. |title=Measuring the state of conservation of crop diversity: a baseline for marking progress toward biodiversity conservation and sustainable development goals |journal=Crop Wild Relatives Policy Brief |date=2016 |volume=  |issue= |pages=6 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10568/74483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CzechCWR" /&gt;

In [[computability theory]] a '''cylindric numbering''' is a special kind of [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]] first introduced by [[Yuri L. Ershov]] in 1973. 

If a numberings &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is [[reducibility (numbering)|reducible]] to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; then there exists a computable function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\nu = \mu \circ f&lt;/math&gt;. Usually &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not [[injective]] but if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a cylindric numbering we can always find an injective &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. 

== Definition ==

A numbering &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is called '''cylindric''' if 
:&lt;math&gt;\nu \equiv_1 c(\nu).&lt;/math&gt;
That is if it is [[one equivalent numbering|one-equivalent]] to its [[cylindrification]]

A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is called '''cylindric''' if its [[indicator function]] 
:&lt;math&gt;1_S: \mathbb{N} \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; 
is a cylindric numbering.

== Examples ==

* every [[Gödel numbering]] is cylindric

== Properties ==

* cylindric numberings are [[idempotent]], &lt;math&gt;\nu \circ \nu = \nu&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2172">In [[telecommunication]], '''degradation''' is the loss of quality of an electronic signal, which may be categorized as either "''[[graceful degradation|graceful]]''" or "''catastrophic''", and has the following meanings: 

#The deterioration in quality, level, or standard of performance of a [[functional unit]]. 
#In [[telecommunication|communications]], a condition in which one or more of the required performance parameters fall outside predetermined limits, resulting in a lower [[quality of service]]. 

There are several forms and causes of degradation in electric signals, both in the [[time domain]] and in the physical domain, including [[runt pulse]], [[voltage spike]], [[jitter]], [[wander]], swim, [[Drift (telecommunication)|drift]], [[glitch]], [[ringing (signal)|ringing]], [[crosstalk]], antenna effect (not the same [[antenna effect]] as in IC manufacturing), and [[phase noise]].

Degradation usually refers to reduction in quality of an analog or digital signal. When a signal is being transmitted or received, it undergoes changes which are undesirable. These changes are called degradation. Degradation is usually caused by:

# Weather or environmental conditions.
# Terrain
# Other signals.
# Faulty or poor quality equipment.

==Weather conditions==
{{Confusing section|reason=transmitter frequency is usually not changed in response to temperature changes.|date=August 2014}}
A signal has two important factors: frequency and wavelength. If weather is fine and temperature is normal, the signal can be transmitted within given frequency and wavelength limits. The signal travels with velocity ''c'' ≤ 3*10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s, which is equal to the speed of light. For frequency ''f'' Hz and wavelength ''λ'' m, we have
:                                       ''f'' = ''c''/''λ''.
As such, when weather conditions deteriorate, frequency ''f'' has to be increased. This causes the wavelength ''λ'' to decrease, which means that the signal then travels lesser distance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7958">'''Ecological indicators''' are used to communicate information about [[ecosystem]]s and the impact human activity has on ecosystems to groups such as the public or [[government]] [[policy]] makers. Ecosystems are complex and ecological indicators can help describe them in simpler terms that can be understood and used by non-scientists to make management decisions. For example, the number of different [[beetle]] [[taxon|taxa]] found in a field can be used as an [[Diversity index|indicator]] of [[biodiversity]].{{ref|Gird}}{{ref|Niem}}{{ref|Osi}}

Many different types of indicators have been developed.  They can be used to reflect a variety of aspects of ecosystems, including biological, chemical and physical.  Due to this variety, the development and selection of ecological indicators is a complex process.{{ref|Kurt}}

Using ecological indicators is a pragmatic approach since direct documentation of changes in ecosystems as related to management measures, is cost and time intensive.{{ref|Bert}}{{ref|Osi}} For example, it would be expensive and time-consuming to count every [[bird]], [[plant]] and [[animal]] in a newly [[Restoration ecology|restored]] [[wetland]] to see if the restoration was a success. Instead, a few [[indicator species]] can be monitored to determine the success of the restoration.

:''"It is difficult and often even impossible to characterize the functioning of a complex system, such as an eco-agrosystem, by means of direct measurements.  The size of the system, the complexity of the interactions involved, or the difficulty and cost of the measurements needed are often crippling"''{{ref|Gird}}

The terms ecological indicator and [[environmental indicator]] are often used interchangeably. However, ecological indicators are actually a sub-set of environmental indicators.  Generally, environmental indicators provide information on pressures on the [[Ecosystem|environment]], environmental conditions and societal responses.  Ecological indicators refer only to [[ecology|ecological]] processes; however, sustainability indicators are seen as increasingly important for managing humanity's coupled human-environmental systems&lt;ref&gt;Shaker, R. R. (2018). A mega-index for the Americas and its underlying sustainable development correlations. Ecological Indicators, 89, 466-479. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.050&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Policy evaluation==

Ecological indicators play an important role in evaluating policy regarding the environment.

===Contributions===

Indicators contribute to evaluation of policy development by:{{ref|Pior}}
*Providing decision-makers and the general public with relevant information on the current state and trends in the environment.
*Helping decision-makers better understand cause and effect relationships between the choices and practices of businesses and policy-makers versus the environment.
*Assisting to monitor and assess the effectiveness of measures taken to increase and enhance [[ecological goods and services]].

Based on the [[United Nations]] [[convention to combat desertification]] and [[convention for biodiversity]], indicators are planned to be built in order to evaluate the evolution of the factors.  For instance, for the CCD, the [[Unesco]]-funded [[Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel]] (OSS) has created the Réseau d'Observatoires du Sahara et du Sahel ([[ROSELT]]) (website [http://www.roselt-oss.teledection.fr]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) as a network of cross-Saharan observatories to establish ecological indicators.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Limitations===

There are limitations and challenges to using indicators for evaluating policy programs.

For indicators to be useful for policy analysis, it is necessary to be able to use and compare indicator results on different scales (local, regional, national and international).  Currently, indicators face the following spatial limitations and challenges:

# Variable availability of data and information on local, regional and national scales.
# Lack of methodological standards on an international scale.
# Different ranking of indicators on an international scale which can result in different legal treatment.
# Averaged values across a national level may hide regional and local trends.
# When compiled, local indicators may be too diverse to provide a national result.{{ref|Pior}}

Indicators also face other limitations and challenges, such as:

# Lack of reference levels, therefore it is unknown if trends in environmental change are strong or weak.
# Indicator measures can overlap, causing over estimation of single parameters.
# Long-term monitoring is necessary to identify long-term environmental changes.
# Attention to more easily handled measurable indicators distracts from indicators less quantifiable such as aesthetics, ethics or cultural values. {{ref|Pior}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3311">'''Event tree''' is an inductive analytical diagram in which an event is analyzed using [[Boolean logic]] to examine a chronological series of subsequent events or consequences. For example, event tree analysis is a major component of nuclear reactor safety engineering.&lt;ref name="wang69"&gt;Wang, John '' et al.'' (2000). {{Google books|x4Ft7H_2Ik0C|''What Every Engineer Should Know About Risk Engineering and Management,'' p. 69.|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event tree displays sequence progression, sequence end states and sequence-specific dependencies across time.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA, [http://www-ns.iaea.org/downloads/ni/training/specific_expert_knowledge/psa-level1/III1_2_A%20Accident%20sequence%20modelling.pdf  "Accident sequence modelling," p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytical tool==
[[Event tree analysis]] is a logical evaluative process which works by tracing forward in time or forwards through a causal chain to model risk.  It does not require the premise of a known hazard.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council. (2002). {{Google books|pIKrHQDY-mgC|''Environmental Effects of Transgenic Plants: the Scope and Adequacy of Regulation,'' p. 5.|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An event tree is an inductive investigatory process.&lt;ref name="wang69"/&gt;

In contrast, the [[Fault tree analysis]] (FTA) evaluates risk by tracing backwards in time or backwards through a cause chain.  The analysis takes as a premise a given hazard.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council, {{Google books|pIKrHQDY-mgC|p. 4.|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FTA is a deductive investigatory process.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, {{Google books|x4Ft7H_2Ik0C|p. 58.|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
An event tree may start from a specific initiator such as loss of critical supply,&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Timeline of the Fukushima I nuclear accidents]]&lt;/ref&gt; or component failure.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Northeast Blackout of 2003#Causes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some industries use both fault trees and event trees.  Software has been created for fault tree analysis and event tree analysis and is licensed for use at the world's nuclear power plants for [[Probabilistic Safety Assessment]].

==Concept==
Excessivism is a reflection, examination, or investigation of every aspect of life in excessive state with particular consideration to the areas that have real and consequential effect on the members of the society.  Subject areas are, but not limited to, economics, politics and psychology. In the area of economics it is a commentary on [[economic materialism]]. It reflects, examines and investigates the excessive desire to acquire material goods beyond one's needs and often means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Excessivism depicts the excessive use of resources in an exaggerated way, by means of two- or three-dimensional visual creations, written or spoken words, or in any other manner. It aims at a reflection, examination, or investigation of the capitalist system, devoid of aesthetic, legal, commercial, ethical, moral, racial, or religious considerations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The goal of the capitalist system is to deliver profit for private investors, or corporations (without consideration of consequences including human and environmental), as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means of wealth. Said structure provides incomparable contribution to economic growth, employment and prosperity. According to [[determinism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Southern Cone Model: The Political Economy of Regional Capitalist Development in Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w0N-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=excessive+economic+determinism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=excessive%2520economic%2520determinism&amp;f=false|publisher = Routledge|date = 2004-08-02|isbn = 9781134327089|first = Nicola|last = Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Charting a New Course: The Politics of Globalization and Social Transformation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5CEGwRutaEEC|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780742508934|first = Fernando Henrique|last = Cardoso|first2 = Mauricio Augusto|last2 = Font}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Crafting Qualitative Research: Working in the Postpositivist Traditions|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KtDKBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2015-02-24|isbn = 9781317473695|first = Pushkala|last = Prasad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Elgar Companion to Radical Political Economy|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lc6b1Q1Kf1YC|publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing|date = 1994-01-01|isbn = 9781843768647|first = Philip|last = Arestis|first2 = Malcolm C.|last2 = Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; freedom of choice is illusory and society is positioned to function as a reliable producer of excess, the lubricant of the capitalist engine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The inaugural exhibition of Excessivism took place in LA Artcore Brewery Annex gallery with the title "Excessivist Initiative".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; And the Excessivism Manifesto was published in [[Downtown News]] weekly in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[[Downtown News]], Excessivism Manifesto, September 28, 2015 page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.survivorlibrary.com/library/architect_and_engineer_of_california_vol_22_1910.pdf |title=The Architect and Engineer of California Volume 22 |publisher=The Architect and Engineer Co. |date=August 1910 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an art critic Shana Nys Dambrot the idea was conceived in the studio of the founder based on his personal realizations of his relationship as a consumer with the capitalist environment.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  Excessivism was introduced to the Los Angeles art scene in November 2014 in the Red Pipe gallery in an  exhibition titled ''Excess The New Norm''. It was curated by art critic, publisher and curator Mat Gleason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Pipe Gallery: Kaloust Guedel: Excess The New Norm|url=http://www.artslant.com/la/events/show/353832-excess-the-new-norm|publisher=ArtSlant|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''filling carousel''' is intended for filling [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) [[Gas cylinder|cylinders]] in large groups. It consist of a frame with running wheels, rails, a central column for LPG and air, &lt;!-- see talk page --&gt; and a driving unit the carousel frame around the central column. The speed of the carousel can be adapted to the various filling times and capacities. The dimension of the carousel is important to consider for the future filling capacity. The carousel frame chosen can be equipped with a number of filling scales covering the present demand and also for the future demand. Filling carousel can be provided with equipment for automatic introduction and automatic filling scales with ejection of cylinders.

==Automatic inlet device==

Automatic inlet device controls the transfer of LPG cylinders from the inlet portion of the conveyor system into the carousel. It is an integral part of an automated cylinder filling operation.

==Chain conveyor==

The main purpose of the double [[chain conveyor]] is to carry the LPG cylinders to and from the filling carousel. It has a sturdy steel construction and is one of the most important components of an automated LPG filling operation. Good conveyor layout saves time, space and labor.

==Conveyor drive unit==

A conveyor drive unit consists of an [[explosion proof|explosion-proof]] [[electric motor]], a [[Gear ratio|gear reducer]] and a chain-[[sprocket]] drive mechanism.

==Carousel drive unit==

A carousel drive unit consists of an explosion-proof electric motor, an [[hydraulic pump]] and an [[hydraulic motor]] to drive the rubber wheel that turns the carousel.

==Ejection Unit==

The ejection unit is designed to take the filled cylinder from the carousel. The ejection unit typically receives a signal from the corresponding filling head (filling head is up)indicating that the cylinder is filled and may be taken off the carousel. If the filling is not completed, "filling head down" tells the evacuation unit not to activate and the cylinder completes one more cycle on the carousel while being filled. On modern carousels these commands are electronic, but can also be mechanical by means of a dowel which operates a [[switch]].

==Pressure control valve==

The pressure control valve is a very important instrument in cylinder filling. It allows LPG in pipeline to be at a predetermined pressure. When the pressure exceeds this value the valve opens and sends the flow to return line.

The '''German Protestant Institute of Archaeology (GPIA), Research Unit of the German Archaeological Institute''', founded in 1900 is one of the most important biblical archaeological institutes in the Near East. Its [[German language|German]] name is ''Deutsches Evangelisches Institut für Altertumswissenschaft des Heiligen Landes''.

== Institutes ==
The German Protestant Institute of Archaeology, Research Unit of the German Archaeological Institute, operates in two locations – [[Jerusalem]] and [[Amman]]. Its high reputation as cultural institution, help desk, and meeting place for European scholars makes it a sought-after partner for cooperation between German and international organizations and projects. The GPIA is a foundation administered by the [[German Protestant Church]]. At the same time, it serves as a research unit of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] (DAI). They cooperate in several archaeological projects.

* Institute [[Jerusalem]],
Director-General: Professor Dr. Dr. Dr. h.c. [[Dieter Vieweger]]&lt;br /&gt;
Address: Auguste-Victoria-Compound, P.O.Box 18 463, Jerusalem 91184&lt;br /&gt;
- Archaeological library, archaeological museum

* Institute [[Amman]],
Director: Dr. Jutta Häser&lt;br /&gt;
Address: P.O.Box 183, Amman 11118, Jordan&lt;br /&gt;
- Archaeological library, archaeological collection

== Aims ==
The mission of the institute was clearly stated in its founding charter: the exploration of the Holy Land and its diverse past, cultures and religions. The knowledge acquired was meant to be available to, and discussed by, both experts and the general public. In light of this founding mission, the institute undertakes research on the history and culture of the region. To this end, the institute conducts its own excavations and supports other German research projects.

The institute is also committed to disseminating the results of research, especially in the areas of archaeology, cultural studies, theology and the Church. For this purpose, the institute maintains a research library, issues its own archaeological journal and organises meetings, lecture series and exhibitions. Especially important is the Course Programme for theologians, which was founded over 100 years ago by the first director, [[Gustaf Dalman]]. The institute also tries to make archaeological knowledge available to the public by offering guided tours of Jerusalem and the surrounding area.

The GPIA fosters close relations with the cultural institutions in the host countries and supports scientific research without any political or religious borders on both sides of the river Jordan.

== Archaeological projects ==

=== Tall Zira'a and the Gadara Region Project (Jordan) ===
Together with the [[Biblical Archaeological Institute]] in [[Wuppertal]], the GPIA conducts the [[Gadara Region Project]] (2001–2020) in the Wadi al-'Arab, south of Umm Qais. The central archaeological site of the Wadi al-'Arab is the [[Tall Zira'a]].
There is hardly an area of Palestine where its history can be studied in such a concentrated manner as in the Wadi al-'Arab. This deep valley, which lies roughly five kilometres south-west of the ancient [[Decapolis]] city of Gadara (today [[Umm Qais]]), is, in many ways, an archaeological bonanza due to the variety in what it has to offer. A number of springs, fertile soils and a moderate climate all provide for excellent living conditions, and the most imposing hill in the valley, Tall Zira'a, possesses its own artesian spring and the very best potential for settlement.

In addition, an important trade route ran through the wadi which once linked Egypt with Mesopotamia. The economic success and industriousness of the wadi's inhabitants have left plenty of traces over the millennia. Over one hundred sites mark out the distinguished history of human settlement in the region from the advent of sedentism to the Islamic period. Settlements, canals, water mills, cisterns, oil presses, wine presses, watch towers, graves and, above all, Tall Zira'a with its over 5000 years of settlement activity.

=== The archaeological park below the Church of the Redeemer (Jerusalem) ===
The archaeological park opened in November 2012 "The Times", located below the nave of the Church of the Redeemer was co-developed by German Protestant Institute (GPIA) and offers the possibility to commit more than 2000 years of history of the city of Jerusalem by walking through it.

The archaeological excavations, conducted by [[Conrad Schick]] 1893 und Ute Wagner-Lux (the former director of GPIA) respectively Karl Vriezen 1970–1974, have been prepared by the German Protestant Institute in the Holy Land in 2009–2012 to present visitors the different stages of development and building of Jerusalem.

=== Former projects ===
* Ute Wagner-Lux – [[Madaba]] / [[Jerusalem]] / [[Gadara]],
* August Strobel – Kallirrhoë (En ez-Zara),
* Gunnar Lehmann; Martin Peilstöcker – Plain of [[Akko]],
* Volkmar Fritz – Tell el-Oreme,
* Susanne Kerner – [[Gadara Aqueduct|Gadara Tunnel System]]
* Thomas Weber – Gadara
* Hans-Dieter Bienert; Dieter Vieweger – Esh-Shallaf near Irbid,
* Hans-Dieter Bienert; Dieter Vieweger; Roland Lamprichs – Baja near [[Petra]],
* Roland Lamprichs – Tall Johfieh,
* Michael Heinzelmann – [[Hippos]].

==History==
The GPIA was founded on June 19, 1900, by the Deutsche Evangelische Kirchenkonferenz in Eisenach in order to "maintain, further and regulate the relations between the holy places of biblical history, on the one hand, and between the scientific inquiry and the interests of the Christian faith of the Protestant Church, on the other, in the fields of biblical and ecclesiastical archaeology."

Gustaf Dalman – then Professor of Old Testament and Judaic Studies at the [[University of Leipzig]] – was appointed first director and built up the Jerusalem institute. The changed situation after the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967 necessitated the establishment of the Amman institute. In 1982, the institute in Jerusalem moved to new buildings at the Auguste-Victoria-Compound on the [[Mount of Olives]].

It is an Italianized [[Musical terminology|musical term]] derived from the French ''glisser'', "to glide". In some contexts, it is distinguished from the [[wikt:continuous|continuous]] [[portamento]]. Some colloquial equivalents are '''slide''', '''sweep''' (referring to the "discrete glissando" effects on guitar and harp, respectively), '''bend''', '''smear''', '''rip''' (for a loud, violent gliss to the beginning of a note),&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Rip|author=Anon.|date=2003|access-date=January 12, 2014}} (Though the editor is Deane Root, not L. Deane Root).&lt;/ref&gt; '''lip''' (in jazz terminology, when executed by changing one's [[embouchure]] on a wind instrument),&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Lip|author=Robert Witmer|access-date=22 December 2015}}, from ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz'', second edition, edited by Barry Dean Kernfeld (New York: Grove Dictionaries, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; '''plop''', or '''falling hail''' (a glissando on a harp using the back of the fingernails).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.harpspectrum.org/glossary/glossary.shtml |title = Harp Spectrum - Glossary A - M |website = harpspectrum.org |publisher = Harp Spectrum |accessdate = May 8, 2015 |quote = falling hail: gliding in the center of the strings with the back of the fingernails. (C. Salzedo)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glissando vs. portamento==
Prescriptive attempts to distinguish the glissando from the [[portamento]] by limiting the former to the filling in of discrete intermediate pitches on instruments like the piano, harp, and fretted stringed instruments have run up against established usage of instruments like the [[trombone]] and [[timpani]].&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', edited by Willi Apel (Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1944): 298 or 595{{Contradict-inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;!--This quotation cannot possibly occur twice in the same dictionary—which one is correct?--&gt;": "Glissando…the execution of rapid scales". "Portamento…[an] effect frequently but erroneously called glissando… on the violin and on the trombone."&lt;/ref&gt; The latter could thus be thought of as capable of either "glissando" or "portamento", depending on whether the drum was rolled or not. The clarinet gesture that opens ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' could likewise be thought of either way: it was originally planned as a glissando (Gershwin's score labels each individual note) but is in practice played as a portamento though described as a glissando.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenberg, Rodney| year=1998| title=George Gershwin| publisher=Phaidon Press| isbn=0-7148-3504-8| pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrete glissando==
On some instruments (e.g., [[piano]], [[harp]], [[xylophone]]), discrete tones are clearly audible when sliding. For example, on a [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], a player's fingertips can be made to slide across the white keys or over the black keys, producing either a [[C major]] scale or an [[F-sharp major|F{{music|#}} major]] pentatonic (or their [[minor scale|relative]] [[Mode (music)|modes]]); or, by performing both at once, it is possible to produce a full chromatic scale, but this is difficult. Organ players—particularly in contemporary music—sometimes employ an effect known as the palm glissando, where over the course of the glissando the flat of the hand is used to depress a wide area of keys simultaneously, resulting in a dramatic atonal sweep. On a harp, the player can slide their finger across the strings, quickly playing the scale (or on pedal harp even [[arpeggio]]s such as C{{music|flat}}-D-E{{music|sharp}}-F-G{{music|sharp}}-A{{music|flat}}-B). Wind, brass, and fretted-stringed-instrument players can perform an extremely rapid chromatic scale (e.g., sliding up or down a string quickly on a fretted instrument).

Maurice Ravel's piece [[Miroirs|Alborada del Gracioso]] contains notable piano glissando passages in thirds executed by the right hand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiLrWDoHWeU "Richter - Maurice Ravel's Alborada del gracioso"], ''YouTube.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arpeggio effects (likewise named glissando) are also obtained by bowed strings (playing [[Harmonic#Harmonics on stringed instruments|harmonics]]) and brass, especially the [[French horn|horn]].&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar, Norman: ''Anatomy of the Orchestra'' (University of California Press 1981). String harmonic glissandi are discussed pp. 132-33; horn glissandi pp. 252-254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous glissando or portamento==
[[File:Posaune Glissando Wiki Loves Music 2017.webm|thumb|A trombone playing a glissando]]
[[Musical instrument]]s with [[:Category:Continuous pitch instruments|continuously variable pitch]] can effect a [[portamento]] over a substantial range. These include unfretted stringed instruments (such as the [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]] and [[double bass]], and [[fretless guitar]]s), stringed instruments with a way of stretching the strings (such as the [[guitar]], [[veena]], or [[sitar]]), a fretted guitar or [[lap steel guitar]] when accompanied with the use of a slide, wind instruments without valves or stops (such as the [[trombone]] or [[slide whistle]]), [[timpani]] (kettledrums), electronic instruments (such as the [[theremin]], the [[ondes Martenot]], [[synthesizer]]s and [[keytar]]s), the [[water organ]], and the [[human voice]].

Brass and woodwind instruments such as the [[trumpet]] or [[flute]] can effect a similar limited slide by altering the lip pressure (trumpet) or a combination of [[embouchure]] and rolling the head joint (flute), while the [[clarinet]] and some models of flute can achieve this by slowly dragging fingers off tone holes or changing the oral cavity's resonance by manipulating tongue position, [[embouchure]], and throat shaping.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite web|last=Chen|first=Jer Ming|title=How to play the first bar of Rhapsody in Blue|url=http://www.acoustics.org/press/155th/chen.htm|publisher=Music Acoustics, School of Physics, UNSW|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many electric guitars are fitted with a [[tremolo arm]] which can produce either a portamento, a [[vibrato]], or a combination of both (but not a true [[tremolo]] despite the name). Tremolo is a repeated variation of loudness while holding pitch constant; vibrato is a repeated variation of pitch (frequency).{{Clarify|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--Are these definitions meant to be limited only to the electric guitar, or does this apply also to, say, the violin or the piano?--&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--The definitions of both tremolo and vibrato are contentious. A source for the difference and for the claim to "true tremolo" are needed.--&gt;

==Bent note==
&lt;!--[[Bent note]] and [[bent notes]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
{{ref improve section|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
A '''bent note''' is a [[musical note]] that is varied in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. With [[Fret|unfretted]] strings or other continuous-pitch instruments such as the [[trombone]], or with the human [[Vocal music|voice]], such variation is more properly described in terms of [[Intonation (music)|intonation]]. Bent notes are commonly played on fretted instruments, literally by bending the string with excess finger pressure, or on [[Free reed aerophone|free reed]] instruments such as the [[harmonica]], by using excess air pressure to overblow the reed. On brass instruments such as the trumpet, the note is bent by using the lip. "[[indefinite pitch|Indeterminately pitched instruments]] [such as [[unpitched percussion instrument]]s and friction [[drum roll]]s]...produce a pitch or pitch spectrum that becomes higher with an increase of [[dynamics (music)|dynamic]] and lower with a decrease of dynamic."&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Samuel Z. (2016). ''How to Write for Percussion: A Comprehensive Guide to Percussion Composition'', p.246. Oxford University. {{ISBN|9780199920358}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bent note is commonly found in various forms of [[jazz]] and [[blues]].

'''ImpactStory''' is an [[open source]], web-based tool that provides [[altmetrics]] to help researchers measure the impacts of their research outputs including journal articles, [[Blog|blog posts]], datasets, and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Priem|first=Jason|title=The launch of ImpactStory: using altmetrics to tell data-driven stories|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/09/25/the-launch-of-impactstor/|work=Impact of Social Sciences|publisher=LSE|accessdate=1 January 2014|author2=Heather Piwowar|date=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to change the focus of the scholarly reward system to value and encourage web-native scholarship. ImpactStory is a nonprofit organisation funded by the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://impactstory.org/about|work=ImpactStory|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ImpactStory awarded $300k NSF grant!|url=http://blog.impactstory.org/2013/09/27/impactstory-awarded-300k-nsf-grant/|work=ImpactStory|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Concept==
ImpactStory follows open practices with its data (to the extent allowed by providers' terms of service), code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ImpactStory total-impact|url=https://github.com/total-impact|work=GitHub|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloan Foundation grant submitted|url=http://blog.impactstory.org/2012/03/01/18535014681/|work=ImpactStory blog|accessdate=1 January 2014|date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It provides context to its metrics so that they are meaningful without knowledge of the specific dataset: for example, instead of letting the reader guess whether having five [[Fork (software development)|forks]] on [[GitHub]] is common, ImpactStory would tell that the repository is in the 95th percentile of all GitHub repositories created that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ImpactStory adds figshare integration|url=http://www.researchinformation.info/news/news_story.php?news_id=1443|work=Research Information|accessdate=1 January 2014|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metrics provided by ImpactStory can be used by researchers who want to know how many times their work has been downloaded and shared,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eisen|first=Jonathan|title=Playing with Impact Story to look at Alt Metrics for my papers, data, etc |url=http://phylogenomics.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/playing-with-impact-story-to-look-at.html|work=The Tree of Life|accessdate=1 January 2014|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also research funders who are interested in the impact of research beyond only considering citations to journal articles.

==Unpaywall==
Unpaywall is a [[browser extension]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coldewey |first1=Devin |title=Unpaywall scours the web for free versions of scientific papers |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/05/unpaywall-scours-the-web-for-free-versions-of-scientific-papers/ |website=TechCrunch |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which find free versions of (paywalled) articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chawla |first1=Dalmeet Singh |title=Unpaywall finds free versions of paywalled papers |journal=Nature |date=4 April 2017 |doi=10.1038/nature.2017.21765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018 it was reported to provide free access to 20 million articles,&lt;ref name="Else2018"/&gt; and about 47% of the articles that people search with Unpaywall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Doctorow |first1=Cory |title=Unpaywall: a search-engine for authorized, freely accessible versions of scholarly journal articles / Boing Boing |url=https://boingboing.net/2018/02/06/search-engine-arbitrage.html |website=boingboing.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 it was integrated into [[Web of Science]] and in July 2018 [[Elsevier]] announced plans the same month to integrate the service into the [[Scopus]] search engine.&lt;ref name="Else2018"/&gt;

'''The Institute of Astronomy''' of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] is a leading [[Bulgaria]]n [[research]] facility in the field of [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]], located in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria.

The institute co-operates closely with the other two institutions involved in the same field of research in the country - the Department of Astronomy at the Faculty of Physics of [[Sofia University]] and the Astronomical centre at the Faculty of Natural Sciences of [[Shumen University]].

It owns and operates the Bulgarian National [[Rozhen Observatory]] located at an altitude of 1750 m in the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodopi]] mountains in south-east Bulgaria, as well as the [[Belogradchik Observatory]] situated at 650 m at the foot of the [[Balkan Mountains|Western Balkan Mountains]] in north-west Bulgaria.

The institute was inaugurated in 1958 as an independent section of the larger Institute of Physics of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] by the academician Nikola Bonev. In 1995, it became a separate institute. The current{{when|date=April 2017}} director of the institute is Professor Dr. Tanyu Bonev. The deputy-director is Associate Professor Dr. Alexander Antov.

Following a reorganisation in the structure of its departments in 2010, researchers at the institute were divided into four departments: "Sun and Solar System" (head: Dr. T. Bonev), "Stars and stellar systems" (head: Dr. I. Iliev), "Galaxies" (head: Dr. B. Mihov) and "Astroinformatics" (head: Dr. V. Popov). These four replaced the previous division into seven sectors: "Sun", "Solar system", "Non-stationary stars", "Stellar atmospheres and envelopes", "Chemically peculiar stars", "Stellar clusters" and "Galaxies".

''“Monumentalized Early Iron Age Landscapes in the Danube river basin”'' 

'''Iron-Age-Danube''' is a cross-border project and is part of the [[Interreg|Interreg Danube Transnational Programme]] of the [[European Union]]. 

In the Iron-Age-Danube project the early [[Iron Age]] landscapes in the [[Danube]] river basin are explored with the help of modern technology and traditional archaeological tools. The participating partners from [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] work together to promote the concept of archaeological [[landscape]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s beyond single [[Archaeological site|archaeological sites]] in these countries.

The project is funded by the [[European Union]] with about 2.169.200 EUR from the [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF). These ERDF resources make 85% of the total project volume which is about 2.552.000 EUR.

The Iron-Age-Danube project lasts from the 1st of January 2017 till the 30th of June 2019.

== Goals of the project ==
The major goal of the project is to communicate a lively image of archaeological research and the Iron Age landscapes to the visitors and to raise the awareness for the importance of archaeological [[Ancient monument|monuments]] for the [[Human History|human history]]. 

The project Iron-Age-Danube ignores [[Border (disambiguation)|border]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;lines between the countries and researches the remains of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] (Iron Age) in the Danube region. The data of this research will help to understand the way of living in the past and the needs of the heritage today.

Another goal is the protection of the monuments and landscapes as well as their sustainable use for the tourism. To strengthen the local tourism, already existing archaeological parks or trails will be revitalised. New visitor programs in form of digital and analogous tools will be developed and implemented in 9 micro-regions. The micro-regions are: [[Großklein]] and Strettweg (Austria), [[Jalžabet]] and [[Kaptol, Požega-Slavonia County|Kaptol]] (Croatia), Poštela and [[Dolenjske Toplice]] (Slovenia) and [[Százhalombatta]], [[Süttő]] and [[Sopron]] (Hungary).

The '''Keeping All Students Safe Act''' refers to a pair of  [[American (USA)|American]] legislative proposals introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 6, 2011 as  [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381: H.R. 1381] and in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]  on December 16, 2011 as [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020].  The bills are designed to protect children from the abuse of restraint and seclusion in school.  The first Congressional bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on December 9, 2007 and named the Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act.&lt;ref name="HR4247"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.4247: HR4247] Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act, H.R. 4247, U.S. House of Representatives, Dec. 9, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary sponsors of the two bills are Senator [[Tom Harkin]] (D-IA), Chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee]], Congressman [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] (D-CA), Ranking Member of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and Workforce Committee]], and Congressman [[Gregg Harper]] (R-MS).

==Background &amp; Legislative History==
Restraint involves immobilizing an individual and preventing him or her from moving his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely.  Seclusion involves the involuntary confinement of an individual in a room or area from which the individual is physically prevented from leaving, whether the room is locked or the door is blocked by furniture.&lt;ref name="S2020"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020] Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 2, S.2020, U.S. Senate, Dec. 16, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) undertook a nationwide study of the use of restraint and seclusion in schools and its effects.&lt;ref name="GAO1"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/122526.pdf  U.S. GAO Report] United States Government Accountability Office, “Seclusions and Restraints, Selected Cases of Death and Abuse at Public and Private Schools and Treatment Centers,” May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The GAO found "hundreds of cases of alleged abuse and death related to the use of these methods on schoolchildren during the past two decades."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/senate-oks-bill-limiting-teachers-in-restraint-seclusion-of-students-q93u2gl-137984118.html Journal Sentinel], “Senate OKs Bill Limiting Teachers In Restraint, Seclusion Of Students,” Journal Sentinel, Jan. 24, 2012.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the incidents involved children with [[disabilities]] who are enrolled in [[special education]], the GAO reported.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;

The GAO documented 20 deaths of children from restraint.  The GAO also reported about restraints that resulted in broken arms, and kindergartners who were tied to chairs with duct tape and who suffered bloody noses.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;  One teenager hanged himself in a seclusion room, while a teacher sat outside the room.  Before the final episode, he was confined 19 times in a concrete 8 foot by 8 foot room for an average of 94 minutes each time.  His parents were never informed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/news/death-highlights-lack-of-100352.html Atlanta Journal Constitution], Alan Judd, “Death Highlights Lack of Regulation at Psycho-educational Schools,” Atlanta Journal Constitution, July 27, 2009.

On May 19, 2009, the House Education and Labor Committee held hearings about the use of restraint and seclusion, chaired by Congressman George Miller.&lt;ref name="hearing1"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg49597/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg49597.pdf  U.S. House of Representatives Hearings]  U.S. Congress, Hearing Before the House Committee on Education and Labor, Examining the Abusive and Deadly Use of Seclusion and Restraint in Schools, 111th Congress, May 19, 2009.

The GAO presented testimony about its report and findings about restraint and seclusion, and the risk of death and injury.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;  The GAO also reported that restraint and seclusion have been used to control minor student misbehaviors such as speaking out of turn or refusing to remain in one’s chair.&lt;ref name="USN1" /&gt;  Another hearing witness testified that restraint may be needed in emergencies. He noted that sometimes educators need to use restraint in emergency situations, where there is a risk that a child will injure himself or others and nothing else will work to prevent the immediate danger.  Teachers may use restraint and seclusion appropriately in those circumstances, the witness testified.&lt;ref name="NPR2"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104277070 National Public Radio] Joseph Shapiro, “Report: Discipline Methods Endanger Disabled Kids,” National Public Radio, May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  An Illinois State Board of Education representative presented data from Illinois showing that implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports reduced the use of restraint and seclusion significantly.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

The United States House of Representatives reported that children, most often children with disabilities, are subjected to seclusion and restraint at much higher rates than adults, and are at greater risk of injury as a result of these practices. The House further reported that children under the age of 12 are restrained or secluded at higher rates than any other age group.  The House of Representatives also reported that, “the use of restraint and seclusion often exacerbates the behaviors that staff are trying to eliminate.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-111hrpt417/pdf/CRPT-111hrpt417.pdf  House Report 111-417], U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Education &amp; Labor, House Report 111-417, Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools, Feb. 23, 2010.

It reported that only 14 states limited the use of restraint to emergencies involving threats of physical injury. Only 11 either banned all forms of seclusion or restricted it to emergency threats of physical harm.  There are 27 states that have no requirement to notify parents when a child is restrained or secluded and only 12 states that require same day or next day notification.&lt;ref name="HowSafe"&gt;[http://www.autcom.org/pdf/HowSafeSchoolhouse.pdf  How Safe Is the Schoolhouse?] Jessica Butler, “How Safe Is The Schoolhouse?

As there is no national clearinghouse that gathers data on the use of the techniques, the exact number of children subjected to restraint and seclusion in school is unknown.&lt;ref name="USN1" /&gt;  The GAO found that only five states kept records.  In two of them, Texas and California, there were over 33,000 cases in 2007-08.  Many of the children had cognitive disabilities, autism, mental health disabilities, attention deficit disorder and other disabilities.&lt;ref name="NPR2" /&gt;  Professor Reece Peterson testified at the House Education and Labor hearing about the need for federal law requiring data collection nationwide.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

On December 9, 2009, six months after the House hearing, the first national restraint and seclusion bill was introduced by Congressman George Miller.  It was cosponsored by Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Chris Dodd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/12/09/restraint-bill-introduced/6448/ Disability Scoop], Michelle Diament, “Lawmakers Unveil Restraint And Seclusion Bill,” Disability Scoop, December 9, 2009.

Restraint and seclusion bills were introduced again in the 112th Congress in 2011.  On April 6, 2011, Congressman George Miller (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, reintroduced the Keeping All Students Safe Act, cosponsored by Congressman Greg Harper (R-MS).&lt;ref name="HR1381"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381:  H.R.1381], H.R. 1381, Keeping All Students Safe Act, April 6, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 16, 2011, the second anniversary of Congressman Miller’s first bill, Senator Tom Harkin, Chairman of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee, introduced a slightly different version of the Keeping All Students Safe Act, S. 2020.&lt;ref name="S2020" /&gt;

==Description of the Keeping All Students Safe Act==
This section of the article focuses on the two newest bills introduced in the 112th Congress in 2011.  The House and Senate versions of the Keeping All Students Safe Act differ.

The House bill prohibits physical restraint except in emergencies when there is an imminent threat of physical injury and less restrictive measures will not resolve the situation.  The Senate bill bars physical restraint unless there is an immediate threat of serious bodily injury and less restrictive measures will not solve the situation.  Both bills would forbid the use of restraint or seclusion for destruction of property, educational disruption, failing to follow instructions, and for coercion, discipline, or in place of proper educational planning.  
 
The House bill also forbids seclusion unless there is an immediate threat of physical injury and less restrictive methods will not resolve the situation.  The House bill will require staff to continuously visually monitor (watch) children who are confined to seclusion rooms to ensure that they are safe.  The Senate bill bans all seclusion of children, which is defined as locking children in rooms or other spaces or blocking the door so they cannot leave (e.g., with furniture).&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020 sec 4] Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 4, S.2020, U.S. Senate, Dec. 16, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381:  H.R.1381 sec 5], Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 5, H.R. 1381, April 6, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Both bills require restraint to end when the emergency ends, and the House bill requires seclusion to end when the emergency ends. Both bills ban the use of mechanical restraints, meaning devices that lock and restrain children, or taping or tying them to chairs or furniture.  Both bills ban chemical restraints and restraints that impair breathing or otherwise threaten life.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;

Both bills require schools to notify parents in writing within 24 hours of restraint and verbally the same day.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;   There are 27 states that do not have legal requirements for schools to tell parents a child was restrained/secluded.&lt;ref name="HowSafe" /&gt;

Both bills impose training requirements to ensure that staff who use restraint and seclusion are trained in evidence-based techniques and that the techniques are not misused in even more dangerous manners.  Both bills prohibit putting physical restraint as a planned intervention in Individual Education Programs, 504 plans, behavioral intervention plans, student safety plans, or other educational planning documents for individual students.  The bills also require the collection of data nationwide and disaggregating the data by such categories as race, sex, income, and disability status.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;

The Senate bill also bans restraints that interfere with the ability to communicate.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;  The GAO reported on at least four cases in which verbal children who died or were injured in restraint told staff that they could not breathe.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;  Numerous children cannot speak or have difficulty doing so, and rely on sign language or augmentative communications devices.&lt;ref name="HowSafe" /&gt;   Additionally, the Senate bill requires that a debriefing be held, where school staff, the parents, and the student may attend.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;  Debriefings are intended to reduce and eliminate restraint and seclusion, by determining what caused the event and how to avoid it in the future, and by analyzing, planning for, and implementing positive interventions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&amp;docid=01-1649-filed.pdf  Federal Register], Medicaid Program; Use of Restraint and Seclusion in Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities Providing Psychiatric Services to Individuals Under Age 21; Interim Final Rule, 66 Fed. Reg. 7148, Jan. 22, 2001.  Retrieved March 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Congressman Miller on Introduction==

When Congressman Miller re-introduced the House bill in 2011, he described his reasons for doing so, “In 2009, the Government Accountability Office told our committee of the shocking wave of abuse by untrained school staff who were misusing emergency interventions. Most of these victims were children with disabilities. Some were 3 and 4 years old. In some cases, children died. Restraint and seclusion should be used only as a last resort and by trained professionals, but the GAO found that was not the case. . . . A media report out yesterday highlights that these horrific abuses continued through this past year. In Chicago, a 4-year-old boy’s wrists were taped together with painter’s tape and then duct tape because he refused to take a nap and he didn’t wash his hands.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-04-07/pdf/CREC-2011-04-07-pt1-PgH2413-7.pdf#page=1  Congressional Record House], Congressman George Miller, Congressional Record, April 6, 2011. Retrieved  Feb. 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Senator Harkin on Introduction==
Senator Harkin introduced his bill and explained the reasons for doing so.  He said, “I am pleased to introduce today the Keeping All Students Safe Act. This important legislation will protect school children against ineffective harmful and life threatening seclusion and restraint practices.  . . . Restraint and seclusion-related fatalities and injuries most often involve children with disabilities. This vulnerable population must especially be protected from this type of abuse, and this legislation seeks to do just that.  . . .The act does allow for the use of restraint in emergency situations to prevent serious bodily injury to the student, other students in the classroom, or staff, it also requires State-approved crisis intervention training program as to how to approach these types of emergency situations.”&lt;ref name="CRHarkin"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-12-16/pdf/CREC-2011-12-16-pt1-PgS8735.pdf  Congressional Record Senate], Senator Tom Harkin, Congressional Record, Dec. 16, 2011. Retrieved  Feb. 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Harkin also addressed data issues, “Another issue uncovered by the GAO study was that no web site, Federal agency, or other entity currently collects comprehensive data related to the use of restraint and seclusion in our Nation's schools. This Act will remedy this situation, as it requires each State educational agency to prepare and submit a report documenting” the use of restraint and seclusion.”&lt;ref name="CRHarkin" /&gt;

==Related Events==
In March 2012, the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education presented a report about its Civil Rights Data Collection.  It reported that students with disabilities made up  represent 12% of students in its data collection sample, but nearly 70% of the students who are physically restrained by adults in school.  For those schools which reported data, there was a total of 38, 792 incidents of physical restraint.  CRDC also found racial and ethnic disproportionality in restraint and seclusion use.  African-American students were 21% of students with disabilities under served under the IDEA, but 44% of students with disabilities subjected to mechanical restraint.  Hispanic children were disproportionately subjected to seclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf  CRDC Data Collection] Dept. of Education, Office of Civil Rights, Civil Rights Data Collection, Revealing New Truths About Our Nation’s Schools, March 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17852">[[File:Smoothed knot.gif|thumb|The rotating view of a smoothed chain of a knotted protein (PDB ID: 1xd3)]]
'''Knotted proteins''' are proteins whose backbones entangle themselves in a knot. One can imagine pulling a protein chain from both termini, as though pulling a string from both ends. When a knotted protein is “pulled” from both termini, it does not get disentangled. Knotted proteins are interesting because they are very rare, and their folding mechanisms and function are not well understood. Although there have been some experimental and theoretical studies that hinted to some answers, systematic answers to these questions have not been found.

Though a number of computational methods have been developed for detecting protein knots, there are still no completely automatic methods to detect protein knots without the necessary manual intervention due to the missing residues or chain breaks in the X-ray structures or the nonstandard PDB formats.

Most of the knots discovered in proteins are deep [[Trefoil knot|trefoil (3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) knots]]. [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)|Figure eight knots (4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Three-twist knot|three-twist knots (5&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]], and [[Stevedore knot (mathematics)|Stevedore knots (6&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)]] have also been discovered.

[[File:Pig2.png|thumb|Four knot types identified in proteins: the 3-1 knot (upper left), the 4-1 knot (upper right), the 5-2 knots (lower left) and the 6-1 knot (lower right). These images were produced by KnotPlot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robert|first=Scharein|title=KnotPlot: Hypnagogic Software (Version 0.1)|url=http://www.knotplot.com/|work=Nearly all of the images here were created with KnotPlot, a fairly elaborate program to visualize and manipulate mathematical knots in three and four dimensions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the 3-1 knot has in fact two distinct forms: left-handed and right-handed. What is shown here is a right-handed 3-1 knot.]]

==Mathematical interpretation==
Mathematically, a [[Knot (mathematics)|knot]] is defined as a subset of a three-dimensional points [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cromwell|first=P. D.|title=Knots and Links|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, a knot only makes sense in a closed loop. However, many strategies have been used to create an artificial closed loop. For example, if we pick a point in space at infinite distance and connect it to the N and C termini through a virtual bond, the [[protein]] can be treated as a closed loop, or stochastic methods that create random closures.[[File:Pig1.png|thumb|(A) A protein is an open chain. (B) To create a closed loop, we pick a point at an infinite distance, and connect it to the N and C termini, thus the whole topological structure becomes a closed loop.]]

==Depth of the knot==
A deep knot is preserved even though the removal of a considerable number of residues from either end does not destroy the knot. The higher the number of residues that can be removed without destroying the knot, the deeper the knot.

==Formation of knots==
Considering how knots may be produced with a string, the folding of knotted proteins should involve first the formation of a loop, and then the threading of one terminus through the loop. This is the only topological way that the trefoil knot can be formed. For more complex knots, it is theoretically possible to have the loop to twist multiple times around itself, meaning that one end of the chain gets wrapped around at least once, and then threading to occur. It has also been observed in a theoretical study that a 6-1 knot can form by the C-terminus threading through a loop, and another loop flipping over the first loop, as well as the C-terminus threading through both the loops which have previously flipped over each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bölinger|first1=D.|last2= Sułkowska|first2= J.I.|last3=Hsu|first3=H-P.|last4=Mirny|first4=L.A.|last5=Kardar|first5=M.|title=A Stevedore's Protein Knot|journal=PLoS Comput Biol|date=1 April 2010|volume=6|number=4|pages=e1000731|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been experimental studies involving [[TRNA (cytidine34-2'-O)-methyltransferase|YibK]] and YbeA, knotted proteins containing trefoil knots. It has been established that these knotted proteins fold slowly,and that the knotting in folding is the rate limiting step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mallam|first=A.L.|author2=Jackson, S.E.|title=Knot formation in newly translated proteins is spontaneous and accelerated by chaperonins|journal=Nat Chem Biol|date=2012|volume=8|number=2|pages=147–153|doi=10.1038/nchembio.742}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another experimental study, a 91-residue-long protein was attached to the termini of YibK and YbeA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lim|first=Nicole C.H.|author2=Jackson, S.E.|title=Mechanistic insights into the folding of knotted proteins in vitro and in vivo|journal=J.

Yet it was seen that the resulting proteins could fold spontaneously. The attached proteins were shown to fold more quickly than YibK and YbeA themselves, so during folding they are expected to act as plugs at either end of YibK and YbeA. It was found that attaching the protein to the N-terminus did not alter the folding speed, but the attachment to the C-terminus slows folding down, suggesting that the threading event happens at the C-terminus. The chaperones, although facilitate the protein knotting, are not crucial in proteins' self-tying&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Yani|last2=Dabrowski-Tumanski|first2=Pawel|last3=Niewieczerzal|first3=Szymon|last4=Sulkowska|first4=Joanna I.|date=2018-03-16|title=The exclusive effects of chaperonin on the behavior of proteins with 52 knot|url=https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005970|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=e1005970|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005970|issn=1553-7358|pmc=5874080|pmid=29547629}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The folding of knotted proteins may be explained by interaction of the nascent chain with the ribosome. In particular, the affinity of the chain to the ribosome surface may result in creation of the loop, which may be next threaded by a nascent chain. Such mechanism was shown to be plausible for one of the most deeply knotted proteins known&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dabrowski-Tumanski|first=Pawel|last2=Piejko|first2=Maciej|last3=Niewieczerzal|first3=Szymon|last4=Stasiak|first4=Andrzej|last5=Sulkowska|first5=Joanna I.|date=2018-10-12|title=Protein Knotting by Active Threading of Nascent Polypeptide Chain Exiting from the Ribosome Exit Channel|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b07634|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|language=en|doi=10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b07634|issn=1520-6106}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Other topologically complex structures in proteins==
[[File:Slipknot protein.jpg|thumb|A possible slipknot in a protein. If the terminus is cut from the red line (1), a trefoil knot is created (2).]]

The class of knotted proteins contains only structures, for which the backbone, after closure forms a knotted loop. However, some proteins contain "internal knots" called slipknots, i.e. unknotted structures containing a knotted subchain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Neil P.|last2=Yeates|first2=Eric O.|last3=Yeates|first3=Todd O.|date=October 2007|title=Identification of Rare Slipknots in Proteins and Their Implications for Stability and Folding|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022283607009813|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=373|issue=1|pages=153–166|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2007.07.042|issn=0022-2836}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Another topologically complex structure is the link formed by covalent loops, closed by disulfide bridges &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dabrowski-Tumanski|first=Pawel|last2=Sulkowska|first2=Joanna I.|date=2017-03-28|title=Topological knots and links in proteins|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/13/3415|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=114|issue=13|pages=3415–3420|doi=10.1073/pnas.1615862114|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5380043|pmid=28280100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boutz|first=Daniel R.|last2=Cascio|first2=Duilio|last3=Whitelegge|first3=Julian|last4=Perry|first4=L.

Three types of disulfide-based links were identified in proteins: two versions of [[Hopf link]] (differing in chirality) and one version of [[Solomon's knot|Solomon link]]. Another complex structure arising by closing part of the chain with covalent bridge are complex lasso proteins, for which the covalent loop is threaded by the chain one or more times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niemyska|first=Wanda|last2=Dabrowski-Tumanski|first2=Pawel|last3=Kadlof|first3=Michal|last4=Haglund|first4=Ellinor|last5=Sułkowski|first5=Piotr|last6=Sulkowska|first6=Joanna I.|date=2016-11-22|title=Complex lasso: new entangled motifs in proteins|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36895|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1038/srep36895|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5118788|pmid=27874096}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet another complex structures arising as a result of the existence of disulfide bridges are the [[Cystine knot|cystine knots]], for which two disulfide bridges form a closed, covalent loop, which is threaded by third chain. The term "knot" in the name of the motif is misleading, as the motif does not contain any knotted closed cycle. Moreover, formation of the cystine knots in general is not different from the folding of an unknotted protein

Apart from closing only one chain, one may perform also the chain closure procedure for all the chains present in the crystal structure. In some cases one obtains the non-trivially linked structures, called probabilistic links&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dabrowski-Tumanski|first=Pawel|last2=Jarmolinska|first2=Aleksandra I.|last3=Niemyska|first3=Wanda|last4=Rawdon|first4=Eric J.|last5=Millett|first5=Kenneth C.|last6=Sulkowska|first6=Joanna I.|date=2016-10-28|title=LinkProt: a database collecting information about biological links|url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D243/2333928|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|volume=45|issue=D1|pages=D243–D249|doi=10.1093/nar/gkw976|issn=0305-1048|pmc=5210653|pmid=27794552}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One can also consider loops in proteins formed by pieces of the main chain and the disulfide bridges and interaction via ions. Such loops can also be knotted of form links even within structures with unknotted main chain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liang|first=Chengzhi|last2=Mislow|first2=Kurt|date=November 1994|title=Knots in Proteins|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00103a057|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=EN|volume=116|issue=24|pages=11189–11190|doi=10.1021/ja00103a057|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dabrowski-Tumanski|first=Pawel|last2=Rubach|first2=Pawel|last3=Goundaroulis|first3=Dimos|last4=Dorier|first4=Julien|last5=Sułkowski|first5=Piotr|last6=Millett|first6=Kenneth C.|last7=Rawdon|first7=Eric J.|last8=Stasiak|first8=Andrzej|last9=Sulkowska|first9=Joanna I.|title=KnotProt 2.0: a database of proteins with knots and other entangled structures|url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gky1140/5223942|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|doi=10.1093/nar/gky1140}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==First discoveries==
Marc L. Mansfield proposed in 1994, that there can be knots in proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mansfield|first=Marc L.|title=Are there knots in proteins?|journal=Nat. Struct. Biol.|date=1994|volume=1|number=4|pages=213–214|pmid=7656045|doi=10.1038/nsb0494-213}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave unknot scores to proteins by constructing a sphere centered at the center of mass of the alpha carbons of the backbone, with a radius twice the distance between the center of mass and the Calpha that is the farthest away from the center of mass, and by sampling two random points on the surface of the sphere. He connected the two points by tracing a geodesic on the surface of the sphere (arcs of great circles), and then connected each end of the protein chain with one of these points. Repeating this procedure a 100 times and counting the times where the knot is destroyed in the mathematical sense yields the unknot score.  Human carbonic anhydrase was identified to have a low unknot score (22). Upon visually inspecting the structure, it was seen that the knot was shallow, meaning that the removal of a few residues from either end destroys the knot.

In 2000, William R. Taylor identified a deep knot in acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase ([[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] ID: 1YVE), by using an algorithm that smooths protein chains and makes knots more visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=William R.|title=A deeply knotted protein structure and how it might fold|journal=Nature|date=2000|volume=406|number=6798|pages=916–919|doi=10.1038/35022623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm keeps both termini fixed, and iteratively assigns to the coordinates of each residue the average of the coordinates of the neighboring residues. It has to be made sure that the chains do not pass through each other, otherwise the crossings and therefore the knot might get destroyed. If there is no knot, the algorithm eventually produces a straight line that joins both termini.

==Studies about the function of the knot in a protein==
Some proposals about the function of knots have been that it might increase thermal and kinetic stability. One particular suggestion was that for the human ubiquitin hydrolase, which contains a 5-2 knot, the presence of the knot might be preventing it from being pulled into the proteasome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Virnau|first=Peter |author2=Mirny, L.A. |author3=Kardar, M.|title=Intricate knots in proteins: function and evolution|journal=PLoS Comput Biol|date=2006|volume=2|number=9|pages=e122|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020122|pmid=16978047|pmc=1570178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is a deubiquitinating enzyme, it is often found in proximity of proteins soon to be degraded by proteasome, and therefore it faces the danger of being degraded itself. Therefore, the presence of the knot might be functioning as a plug that prevents it. This notion was further analyzed on other proteins like YbeA and YibK with computer simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szymczak|first=P.|title=Translocation of knotted proteins through a pore|journal=Eur. Phys. J.|date=2014|volume=223|issue=9|pages=1805–1812|doi=10.1140/epjst/e2014-02227-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knots seem to tighten when they are pulled into a pore, and depending on the force with which they are pulled in, they either get stuck and block the pore, the likeliness of which increases with stronger pulling forces, or in the case of a small pulling force they might get disentangled as one terminus is pulled out of the knot. For deeper knots, it is more likely that the pore will be blocked, as there are too many residues that need to be pulled through the knot. In another theoretical study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soler|first=M.A. |author2=Nunes, A. |author3=Faisca, P. F. N.|title=Effects of knot type in the folding of topologically complex lattice proteins|journal=J. Chem. Phys.|date=2014|volume=141|number=2|doi=10.1063/1.4886401|pages=025101}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that the modeled knotted protein was not thermally stable, but it was kinetically stable. It was also shown, that the knot in proteins creates the places on the verge of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of the chain, characteristic for active sites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dabrowski-Tumanski|first=Pawel|last2=Stasiak|first2=Andrzej|last3=Sulkowska|first3=Joanna I.|date=2016-11-02|title=In Search of Functional Advantages of Knots in Proteins|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165986|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=11|issue=11|pages=e0165986|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0165986|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5091781|pmid=27806097}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This may explain, why over 80% of knotted proteins are enzymes&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jamroz|first=M|author2=Niemyska W|author3=Rawdon EJ|author4=Stasiak A|author5=Millett KC|author6=Sułkowski P|author7=Sulkowska JI|date=2015|title=KnotProt: a database of proteins with knots and slipknots|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=43|issue=Database|pages=D306-D314|doi=10.1093/nar/gku1059|pmc=4383900|pmid=25361973}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Kozma Petrovich Prutkov''' ({{lang-ru|Козьма́ Петро́вич Прутко́в}}) is a fictional author invented by  [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy]] and his cousins, three Zhemchuzhnikov brothers, [[Alexei Zhemchuzhnikov|Alexei]], [[Vladimir Zhemchuzhnikov|Vladimir]] and [[Alexander Zhemchuzhnikov|Alexander]], during the later part of the rule of [[Nicholas I of Russia]].

The four distinguished satirical poets used this [[pseudonym]] as a collective [[pen name]] to publish [[aphorism]]s, [[fable]]s, [[epigram]]s, [[satire|satiric]], [[humor]]ous and [[nonsense verse]]s in the 1850s&amp;ndash;1860s, most notably in the literary magazine "[[Sovremennik]]" (''The Contemporary'').

According to the ''Biographical data on Kozma Prutkov'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://az.lib.ru/p/prutkow_k_p/text_0010.shtml Биографические сведения о Козьме Пруткове], (Biographical data on Kozma Prutkov), first printed in the ''Full Collection of Works'', 1884 (lib.ru)&lt;/ref&gt; Prutkov was born on April 11, 1803 and died on January 13, 1863. He worked for the government of the [[Russian Empire]] his entire adult life, and in 1820 entered military service as a [[Hussar]] only for the uniform. He worked at the Assay Office (Пробирная Палата) from 1823 until his death, ending up as its director.

It was controlled by a variety of host computers.  Straight lines were smoothly rendered in real-time animation.  General principles of operation were similar to the systems used today: 4x4 [[Transformation matrix|transformation matrices]], 1x4 [[Vertex (computer graphics)|vertices]].  Possible uses included flight simulation (in the product brochure there are screenshots of landing on a carrier), scientific imaging and [[Geographic information system|GIS]] systems.

==History==
The first LDS-1 was shipped to the customer ([[BBN Technologies|BBN]]) in August 1969.
Only a few of these systems were ever built. One was used by the [[Los Angeles Times]] as their first typesetting/layout computer. One went to [[NASA]] Ames Research Center for Human Factors Research. Another was bought by the [[Port Authority of New York]] to develop a tugboat pilot trainer for navigation in the harbor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1591">"'''The law of the suppression of radical potential'''" is an idea first described by [[Brian Winston]] in his book, ''Misunderstanding Media''. According to the law, when a communications technology is realized, its growth is suppressed through the constraining influence of already prevailing institutions and other mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=McQuail's Mass Communication Theory |authorlink=Denis McQuail |last=McQuail |first=Denis |page=156 |year=2010 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=978-1-84920-292-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winston shows how the law can be used as a model for describing the life cycle of many communications technologies. His approach is in particular directed against [[technological determinism]] and instead proposes that the [[emergence]] of new media and new technologies is mediated and controlled by society. According to Winston, a supervening social necessity creates a need for a particular technology, but the Law of the suppression of radical potential means that new technology will be integrated into the status quo as opposed to radically disrupting it. 

Winston has elaborated his model of technological change in particular in the books ''Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television'' (1997) and ''Media Technology and Society: A History: From the Telegraph to the Internet'' (1998; Kindle publication in 2007 )

A '''ledger line''' or '''leger line''' is used in Western [[musical notation]] to notate [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] above or below the lines and spaces of the regular [[musical staff]]. A line slightly longer than the note head is drawn parallel to the staff, above or below, spaced at the same distance as the lines within the staff. 

The origin of the word is uncertain, but may have been borrowed attributively from the term for a horizontal timber in a [[scaffolding]], lying parallel to the face of the building and supporting the [[putlog]]s. There is no basis to support the often-found claim that the word originates from the French ''léger'', meaning "light" or "slight" {{harv|OED|2005}}. The Oxford online dictionary describes the origin of the "leger" spelling as a "variant of ledger" that first appeared in the 19th century {{harv|Oxford Living Dictionary|n.d.}}.

Although ledger lines are found occasionally in manuscripts of [[plainchant]] and early [[polyphony]], it was only in the early 16th century in keyboard music that their use became at all extensive {{harv|Anon.|2001}}. Even then, printers had an aversion to ledger lines which caused difficulties in setting type, wasting space on the page and causing a messy appearance. Vocal music employed a variety of different clefs to keep the range of the part on the staff as much as possible; in keyboard notation a common way of avoiding ledger lines was the use of [[open score]] on four staves with different [[Clef|clefs]] {{harv|Godwin|1974|loc=16–17}}.

Except for woodwind players, who prefer ledger lines to ''[[Octave#Notation|8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;]]'' notation because they associate fingerings with staff positions {{harv|Shatzkin|1993|loc=48}}, notes that use at least four ledger lines make music more difficult to read.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} For easier readability, the composer would usually switch [[clefs]] or use the ''[[octave|8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;]]'' notation. Some [[transposing instrument]]s, such as the [[piccolo]], [[double bass]], [[guitar]], and the [[tenor voice]], transpose at the octave to avoid ledger lines.

Notation of [[tuba]], [[trombone]], and [[euphonium]] parts always use ledger lines below the bass staff, and never the ''[[8vb|8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt; bassa]]'' notation {{harv|Read|1969|loc=354}}.

When music for bass clef instruments, such as the cello or trombone, goes several ledger lines above the bass clef, the [[tenor clef]] is used; if it were to go even higher than practical in tenor clef, the notes may be notated in treble clef, or in the case of trombone, alto clef.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;!--I have never seen a part for tenor trombone scored in alto clef nor heard of such a convention. Typically trombone in the high register stays in tenor clef and while it is very rare, if it is necessary to go higher the treble clef is used. Alto clef wouldn't really do much in this situation seeing as you can only go up another third before you get in trouble again.--&gt;

A ledger line is also used to support a [[half note|half rest]] {{music|halfrest}} or [[whole note|whole rest]] {{music|wholerest}} where there are multiple voices on one staff and such a rest is forced above or below the staff. (The rare [[double whole note|double whole rest]] is suspended between two ledger lines in this situation.)

[[File:Shimer College Susan Henking listening 2013 cropped.jpg|thumb|Listening in conversation.]]
'''Listening''' is giving one's attention to sound, for example [[speech]], [[music]] or natural sounds. Listening involves complex affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halone|first1=Kelby|last2=Cunconan|first2=Terry|last3=Coakley|first3=Carolyn|last4=Wolvin|first4=Andrew|title=Toward the establishment of general dimensions underlying the listening process.|journal=International Journal of Listening|date=1998|volume=12|pages=12–28|doi=10.1080/10904018.1998.10499016|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10904018.1998.10499016?journalCode=hijl20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective processes include the motivation to attend to others; cognitive processes include attending to, understanding, receiving, and interpreting content and relational messages; and behavioral processes include responding with verbal and nonverbal feedback.

==What is listening?==
Listening differs from [[Obedience (human behavior)|obeying]].  A person who receives and understands information or an instruction, and then chooses not to comply with it or to agree to it, has listened to the speaker, even though the result is not what the speaker wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Purdy, Michael and Deborah Borisoff, eds. (1997) ''Listening in Everyday Life: A Personal and Professional Approach.  ''University Press of America.  {{ISBN|9780761804611}}.  p. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Listening is a term in which the listener listens to the one who produced the sound to be listened.

==Barthes==
Semiotician [[Roland Barthes]] characterized the distinction between listening and hearing as "Hearing is a physiological phenomenon; listening is a psychological act." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The Responsibility of Forms|year=1985|publisher=New York Hill and Wang|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing is always occurring, most of the time subconsciously. In contrast, listening is the interpretative action taken by the listener in order to understand and potentially make meaning out of the sound waves. Listening can be understood on three levels:  alerting, deciphering, and  an understanding of how the sound is produced and how the sound affects the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=In the Responsibility of Forms|year=1985|publisher=New York Hill and Wang|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alerting, the first level, is the detection of environmental sound cues. While discussing this level, Barthes mentions the idea of territory being demarcated by sounds. This is best explained using the example of one's home. One's home, for instance, has certain sounds associated with it that make it familiar and comfortable. An intrusion sound (e.g. a squeaking door or floorboard, a breaking window) alerts the dweller of the home to the potential danger.

Deciphering, the second level, describes detecting patterns in and interpreting sounds. An example of this level is that of a child waiting for the sound of his mother's return home. In this scenario the child is waiting to pick up on sound cues (e.g. jingling keys, the turn of the doorknob, etc.) that will mark his mother's approach.

Understanding, the third level of listening, means knowing how what one says will affect another. This sort of listening is important in [[psychoanalysis]]. Barthes states that the psychoanalyst must turn off their judgement while listening to the analysand in order to communicate with their patient's unconscious in an unbiased fashion.

However, in contrast to the distinct levels of listening listed above, it must be understood that they all function within the same plane, and sometimes all at once. Specifically the second and third levels, which overlap vastly, can be intertwined in that obtaining, understanding and deriving meaning are part of the same process. In that the child, upon hearing the doorknob turn (obtaining), can almost automatically assume that someone is at the door (deriving meaning).

==In language learning==
Along with [[speaking]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], and [[writing]], listening is one of the "four skills" of [[language learning]]. All [[language teaching]] approaches except for [[grammar-translation]] incorporate a listening component.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Second Language Listening: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521786479|isbn=0521786479|first1=John |last1=Flowerdew|first2=Lindsay|last2=Miller|year=2005|page=4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some teaching methods, such as [[Total Physical Response]], involve students simply listening and responding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Language Arts to English Language Learners|page=171
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0415641446
|first1=Anete|last1=Vásquez|first2=Angela L. |last2=Hansen|first3=Philip C. |last3=Smith
|year=2013|isbn=0415641446|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between "intensive listening", in which learners attempt to listen with maximum accuracy to a relatively brief sequence of speech, and "extensive listening", in which learners listen to lengthy passages for general comprehension.  While intensive listening may be more effective in terms of developing specific aspects of listening ability, extensive listening is more effective in building [[fluency]] and maintaining learner [[motivation]].{{sfn|Flowerdew|2005|p=14}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8645">'''Military art''' ({{ lang-fr|L'Art de la Guerre}}) (lit. art of war) is a field of [[Military theory|theoretical research]] and [[Military education and training|training]] methodology in [[military science]] used in the [[conduct of military operation]]s on land, in the maritime or air environments. Military art includes the study and application of the [[principles of warfare]] and [[laws of war]] that apply equally to the closely interrelated [[military strategy]], [[operational mobility|operational art]] and [[military tactics|tactics]]. Exercise of military art is highly dependent on the [[economics]] and [[logistics]] supporting the [[armed forces]], their [[military technology and equipment]], and reflects the social influences on the [[military organisation]] exercising military art. Often misunderstood due to its 19th-century perception as generally "including the entire subject of war",&lt;ref&gt;p.37, Halleck&lt;/ref&gt; it is primarily, as the term implies, the expression of [[creative thinking]] on the part of the [[Decision making|decision-makers]] in employing their forces,&lt;ref&gt;p.140, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt; with the map of the area of operations as a veritable [[Canvas#Canvas for painting|canvas]], and the movement of forces commonly marked on the map with arrows, as [[brush stroke]]s. Less imaginatively it was defined in France during the 19th century as &lt;blockquote&gt;
The art of war is the art of concentrating and employing, at the opportune moment, a superior force of troops upon the decisive point.&lt;ref&gt;p.7, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; and &lt;blockquote&gt;
The art of divining the intention of the enemy from slight indications is one which rarely misleads, and is one of the most precious attributes of [[military genius]].&lt;ref&gt;p.294, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is not well known that many of the greatest military leaders in Europe and Asia, notably Japan, were themselves either accomplished [[artist]]s, or [[Art collector|collectors of art]].

In history, schools of thinking about military art can be divided during the ancient and medieval periods by the influence of [[infantry]] troops on tactics in Europe, and [[cavalry]] on tactics in [[Asia]], and the period commencing with the [[Early Modern period]] when firearms and artillery increasingly influenced employment of forces. The need for mobility, opportunity and decisiveness have tended to associate military art with offensive manoeuvre, cavalry, and therefore, before advent of late-19th century firearms, Asia.&lt;ref&gt;p.97, De La Barre Duparcq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe military art was primarily concerned with time of [[combat]], understanding the best way an [[occupied position]] can enhance [[Defense (military)|defensive potential]] of a small [[field army]] largely consisting of relatively [[Mobility (military)|low mobility]] troops, by often using [[high ground]], terrain [[choke point]]s or [[field entrenchment]]s. Due to relative lack of economic and logistic support, European military art theorists advocated [[Battle#Types|decisive battles]] that could bring a [[military campaign]] to a quick conclusion, thus reducing the economic cost of [[war]], notably through the [[shock tactics]] of the [[armoured cavalry]].
In Asia, due to a more developed and widespread [[horse breeding]] offering enhanced mobility, military art developed a more [[Offensive (military)|offensive-based]] way of thinking about military tactics, and military art was dominated by considerations of choosing [[point of attack]] and [[military communications]].

The confrontation between these two forms of military art that took place as a result of the [[Crusades]] and the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], and the contemporaneous introduction of [[artillery]] into warfare significantly changed thinking about military art in Europe, leading to wide-ranging experiments in [[tactical formation]] of troops, use of [[combined arms]] and exercise of [[maneuver warfare]] concepts and methods not only in tactics, but on a larger scale, including in use of naval forces. This later led to creation of European [[colonial empire]]s.

Although European military art on land can be argued not to have reached its developed stage until the 19th century in the attempt to defeat [[linear tactics]] that led to the [[First World War]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 115, Halleck&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimate sophistication during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]], great increases in the [[firepower]] of the European [[firearms]] and artillery were usually able to negate greater number and mobility of the Asian field forces, no-where more illustrated than during the [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|French Invasion of Egypt]] in 1798. The defining application of firepower and manoeuvre in military art became expressed during the conduct of [[strategic operations of the Red Army in World War II]] that sought to combine the shock of [[armoured warfare]] with mobility, and the traditional reliance on infantry in strengthened positions to first stop the German advances and during [[counter-attack]]s to achieve [[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] of the enemy position, and in conducting [[deep operations]] to destroy the logistic support, literally starving German troops of supplies and ammunition, and forcing them to [[Surrender (military)|surrender]].

Military art in [[naval warfare]] likewise developed along the considerations of position versus speed, initially through use of [[galley]]s and later during the [[Age of Sail]]. However, increasingly [[naval tactics]] became dominated by the relative firepower of individual vessels, and this was demonstrated during the epic [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. The use of naval forces in military art significantly expanded the [[scale of conflict]]s to global ranges. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries naval military art became concerned primarily with the firepower and the ability of ships to withstand it through use of increasing their [[armour]] until the introduction of [[naval aviation]] into consideration of [[naval battle]]s and [[naval strategy]].

Introduction of aircraft into [[warfare]] drastically altered the 19th century understanding of military art, and application of its principles. [[Aerial warfare]] became the ultimate solution to manoeuvre in delivery of firepower, and drastically increased the [[tempo of conflict]]s, making [[blitzkrieg]] possible during the Second World War. Aerial warfare also finally negated the advantage of a [[defensive position]] which left the defender as an easily detected and attacked target for the [[bomber]]s. While German [[industrial centres]] became just such targets for the Allied [[strategic bombing during World War II]], on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] the Soviet [[Red Army]] chose to adapt by developing concepts and methods suggested by theorists during the [[interwar period]] to a more offensive-based and dynamic conduct of operations coordinating ground and [[air offensive]]s.

The final development in military art came with the increased influence of the [[electronics]] and its implications for the ability by infantry to halt the breakthroughs using increasingly powerful [[infantry support weapon]]s, and the effect on the [[military communications]] by a new form of combat, [[electronic warfare]]. The potential of losing ability to exercise [[command and control]] over forces, particularly strategically significant forces, completely undermined much of the theoretical thinking of the Cold War. Some have argued that this was one of the factors, along with those of economic considerations, that eventually led to the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], and [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|Dissolution of the USSR]].

Since the end of the Cold War in Europe, application of military art has been sought primarily by conventional forces in combat operations against unconventional opponents, and this has many attempts to review [[military history]] in the effort to find solutions to successful conduct of operations against these forces.

The '''mineralogy of Mars''' is the [[chemical composition]] of rocks and [[soil]] that encompass the surface of [[Mars]]. Various [[orbital spaceflight|orbital craft]]s have used [[spectroscopic]] methods to identify the signature of some [[minerals]].  The [[Lander (spacecraft)|planetary landers]] performed concrete [[chemical analysis]] of the [[soil]] in rocks to further identify and confirm the presence of other minerals. The only samples of Martian rocks that are on [[Earth]] are in the form of [[meteorites]].  The elemental and atmospheric composition along with planetary conditions is essential in knowing what minerals can be formed from these base parts.

== Mineral Composition ==

The surface [[geology of Mars]] is somewhere between the [[basalt]] or [[andesite]] rocks on Earth.  This led to the formation of minerals similar to what is found on Earth.  The presence of [[iron oxide]] gives the surface the “rust” color that is associated with Mars, the Red Planet.  The presence of [[perchlorate]], in high percentages, forms highly [[saline soils]], which could produce liquid water.&lt;ref name="Head"&gt;Head, J.W., Marchant, D.R., and Kreslavsky, M.A., 2008, Formation of gullies on Mars:  Link to recent climate history and insulation microenvironments implicate surface water flow origin:  PNAS, vol. 105, p. 13258-13263&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alteration of Martian rocks into [[carbonate]] and [[phyllosilicate]] minerals occurred earlier in Mars history when water was present in large quantities.&lt;ref name="Mustard"&gt;Mustard, J.F., Pelkey, S.M., Ehlmann, B.L., Roach, L., et. al, 2008, Hydrated silicate minerals on Mars observed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM instrument: Nature, Vol. 454, p. 305-309.&lt;/ref&gt;  Orbital instruments and Landers not only identified new minerals but in some cases also confirmed the presence of minerals detected by the others.

== Orbital Instruments ==
Orbital crafts sent to Mars provided data on surface geology mostly through [[spectroscopy]].  This data is used to determine possible minerals on the surface, and the types of instruments Landers would need in order to narrow down those minerals.

'''Mars Global Surveyor'''

''Main article:'' [[Mars Global Surveyor]]
Launched in 1996, it used the [[Mars Orbiter Camera]] (MOC), [[Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter]], and [[Thermal Emission Spectrometer]] to show layering on the surface, presence of surface ice, and the mineral hematite.  The presence of ice over the surface is essential to understanding why certain water bearing minerals are on Mars.

'''Mars Odyssey'''

''Main article:'' [[Mars Odyssey]]

Launched in 2001, although it carried multiple instruments only [[Thermal Emission Imaging System]] was designed to look at minerals.   This allowed it to detect the presence of quartz, olivine, and hematite.

'''Mars Express'''

''Main article:'' [[Mars Express]]

Launched in 2003 the [[Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer]] (OMEGA) observed montmorillonite and localized phyllosilicate minerals.&lt;ref name="Mustard"/&gt;

'''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter '''

''Main article:'' [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]

Launched in 2005 this orbiter carried multiple instruments which found the mineralogy to be dominated by [[mafic]] minerals such as olivine, mica, pyroxene and smectite clays such as kaolinite.  The [[HiRISE]] was used in determining the landing site for the [[Phoenix Lander]].  Using the [[CTX (camera)]] and [[CRISM]] instruments it was able to find phyllosilicate minerals, carbonate minerals, and oxides.  The [[SHARAD]] was used to detect carbonate dust layers.&lt;ref name="Byrne"&gt;Byrne, S., 2009, The Polar Deposits of Mars: Annual Review Earth Planet Science, vol. 37 p.535-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landers ==
To date, mankind’s only way of carrying out experiments on the Martian surface has been to send probes to it.  The successful missions are able to carry out experiments that directly observe the composition of Martian soil and rocks. They are the key to verifying our observations of minerals, although currently they are limited to the uppermost area of the surface.

'''Mars Pathfinder'''
''Main article:'' [[Mars Pathfinder]]

'''Mars Exploration Rover Mission '''

''Main article:'' [[Mars Exploration Rover]]

Launched in 2003 it contained two separate rovers the [[Spirit rover]] and the [[Opportunity rover]].

'''Spirit'''
One of its instruments the [[Mössbauer spectrometer]] (MIMOS II) was designed to look at the iron bearing minerals on mars.  It is responsible for determining the presence of many specific iron oxides, which give the planet a red color.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Morris, R.V., et al., 2004,  Mineralogy at Gusev Crater from the Mossbauer Spectrometer on the Spirit Rover: Science, vol. 305, p.833&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opportunity'''
Using the [[Mini-TES]] it was able to detect the presence of some calcium and magnesium rich sulfate minerals.  It also found feldspar, jarosite, pigeonite, clinopryoxene, and maskelynite along with detecting the presence of minerals found by the orbiters and other rovers.&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;Christensen, P.R., et al., 2004, Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover: Science, vol. 306, p. 1733&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phoenix Lander'''

''Main article:'' [[Phoenix (spacecraft)]]

Most noted for landing in a polar region, it carries the WCL ([[Wet chemistry|Wet Chemistry Laboratory]]), which is a part of the MECA (Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer) instrument suite.  It is responsible for identifying perchlorate salts, and various cations such as magnesium, sodium, calcium, and potassium.  Along with [[TEGA]] it showed the presence of calcium carbonate, and minute traces of [[methane]].  Due to the analytical limits of MECA, the Phoenix was unable to determine the sulfur-based minerals detected by the Opportunity.&lt;ref name="Goetz"&gt;Goetz, W., 2010, Phoenix on Mars: American Scientist, vol. 98, p. 40-47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NOMINATE''' (an acronym for Nominal Three-Step Estimation) is a [[multidimensional scaling]] application developed by political scientists [[Keith Poole|Keith T. Poole]] and [[Howard Rosenthal (political scientist)|Howard Rosenthal]] in the early 1980s to analyze
preferential and choice data, such as legislative roll-call voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=Keith T.|first2=Howard|last2=Rosenthal|year=1983|url=http://k7moa.com/pdf/Upside_Down-A_Spatial_Model_for_Legislative_Roll_Call_Analysis_1983.pdf|title=A Spatial Model for Legislative Roll Call Analysis|work=GSIA Working Paper No. 5–83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=Keith T.|first2=Howard|last2=Rosenthal|title=A Spatial Model For Legislative Roll Call Analysis|journal=American Journal of Political Science|year=1985|volume=29|issue=2|pages=357–384|doi=10.2307/2111172|jstor=2111172}}&lt;/ref&gt; As computing capabilities grew, Poole and Rosenthal developed multiple iterations of their NOMINATE procedure: the original D-NOMINATE method, W-NOMINATE, and most recently DW-NOMINATE (for dynamic, weighted NOMINATE). In 2009, Poole and Rosenthal were named the first recipients of the [[Society for Political Methodology]]'s Best Statistical Software Award for their development of NOMINATE, a recognition conferred to "individual(s) for developing statistical software that makes a significant research contribution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polmeth.wustl.edu/about.php?page=awards|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620171509/http://polmeth.wustl.edu/about.php?page=awards|archive-date=20 June 2010 |title=Awards|website=The Society for Political Methodology}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Keith T. Poole was awarded the Society for Political Methodology's Career Achievement Award. The citation for this award reads, in part, "One can say perfectly correctly, and without any hyperbole: the modern study of the U.S. Congress would be simply unthinkable without NOMINATE legislative roll call voting scores. NOMINATE has produced data that entire bodies of our discipline—and many in the press—have relied on to understand the U.S. Congress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polmeth.wustl.edu/career-achievement-award/articles/1443|title=The 2016 Political Methodology Career Achievement Award: Keith T. Poole|website=The Society for Political Methodology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
The main procedure is an application of [[multidimensional scaling]] techniques to political choice data. Though there are important technical differences between these types of NOMINATE scaling procedures;&lt;ref&gt;[http://k7moa.com/page2a.htm Description of NOMINATE Data].&lt;/ref&gt; all operate under the same fundamental assumptions. First, that alternative choices can be projected on a basic, low-dimensional (often two-dimensional) [[Euclidean space]]. Second, within that space, individuals have utility functions which are bell-shaped ([[Normal distribution|normally distributed]]), and maximized at their ideal point. Because individuals also have symmetric, single-peaked [[Utility|utility functions]] which center on their ideal point, ideal points represent individuals' most preferred outcomes. That is, individuals most desire outcomes closest their ideal point, and will choose/vote probabilistically for the closest outcome.

Ideal points can be recovered from observing choices, with individuals exhibiting similar preferences placed more closely than those behaving dissimilarly. It is helpful to compare this procedure to producing maps based on driving distances between cities. For example, Los Angeles is about 1,800 miles from St. Louis; St. Louis is about 1,200 miles from Miami; and Miami is about 2,700 miles from Los Angeles. From this (dis)similarities data, any map of these three cities should place Miami far from Los Angeles, with St. Louis somewhere in between (though a bit closer to Miami than Los Angeles).  Just as cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco would be clustered on a map, NOMINATE places ideologically similar legislators (e.g., liberal Senators [[Barbara Boxer|Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)]] and [[Al Franken|Al Franken (D-Minn.)]]) closer to each other, and farther from dissimilar legislators (e.g., conservative Senator [[Tom Coburn|Tom Coburn (R-Okla.)]]) based on the degree of agreement between their roll call voting records. At the heart of the NOMINATE procedures (and other [[Multidimensional scaling|multidimensional scaling methods]], such as Poole's Optimal Classification method&lt;ref name="Poole2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Poole|first=Keith T.|title=Spatial Models of Parliamentary Voting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OmeQNHvcULoC|accessdate=9 November 2012|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521851947|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are algorithms they utilize to arrange individuals and choices in low dimensional (usually two-dimensional) space. Thus, NOMINATE scores provide "maps" of legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2060047/|title=Mapping Congress' growing polarization|last=Ellenberg|first=Jordan|date=26 December 2001|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Me and howard 1984 4.gif|thumb|left|Keith T. Poole (left) and Howard Rosenthal (right), 1984.]]
Using NOMINATE procedures to study congressional roll call voting behavior from the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] to the
present-day, Poole and Rosenthal published ''Congress: A Political-Economic History of Roll Call Voting''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poole|first1=Keith T.|first2=Howard|last2=Rosenthal|year=1997|title=Congress: A Political-Economic History of Roll Call Voting|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997 and the revised edition ''Ideology and Congress''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poole|first1=Keith T.|first2=Howard|last2=Rosenthal|year=2007|title=Ideology and Congress|location=New Brunswick, NJ|publisher=Transaction Publishers|url=http://www.transactionpub.com/title/Ideology-and%20Congress-978-1-4128-0608-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007. Both were landmark works for their development and application of the use of sophisticated measurement and scaling methods in political science. These works also revolutionized the study of the American politics and, in particular, Congress. Their methods provided political scientists—for the first time—quantitative measures of Representatives' and Senators' ideology across chambers and across time.

==Dimensions==
Poole and Rosenthal demonstrate that—despite the many complexities of congressional representation and politics—roll call voting in both the House and the Senate can be organized and explained by no more than two dimensions throughout the sweep of American history. The first dimension (horizontal or x-axis) is the familiar left-right (or liberal-conservative) spectrum on economic matters. The second dimension (vertical or y-axis) picks up attitudes on cross-cutting, salient issues of the day (which include or have included slavery, [[bimetallism]], civil rights, regional, and social/lifestyle issues). For the most part, congressional voting is uni-dimensional, with most of the variation in voting patterns explained by placement along the liberal-conservative first dimension.

==Interpretation of nominate scores==
For illustrative purposes, consider the following plots which use W-NOMINATE scores to scale members of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] and uses the probabilistic voting model (in which legislators farther from the "cutting line" between "yea" and "nay" outcomes become more likely to vote in the predicted manner) to illustrate some major Congressional votes in the 1990s. Some of these votes, like the House's vote on [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton's]] welfare reform package ([[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996]]) are best modeled through the use of the first (economic [[Left-right politics|liberal-conservative]]) dimension. On the welfare reform vote, nearly all Republicans joined the [[Moderate (politics)|moderate]]-[[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] bloc of House Democrats in voting for the bill, while opposition was virtually confined to the most [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] Democrats in the House. The errors (those representatives on the "wrong" side of the cutting line which separates predicted "yeas" and predicted "nays") are generally close to the cutting line, which is what we would expect. A legislator directly on the cutting line is indifferent between voting "yea" and "nay" on the measure. All members are shown on the left panel of the plot, while only errors are shown on the right panel:

[[File:NOMINATE 2.jpg|House Vote on Welfare Reform (1996)]]

[[Economic ideology]] also dominates the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] vote on the [[Balanced Budget Amendment|Balanced Budget Amendment of 1995]]:

[[File:NOMINATE 3.jpg|Senate Vote on Balanced Budget Amendment (1995)]]

On other votes, however, a second dimension (which has recently come to represent attitudes on [[Culture war|cultural and lifestyle issues]]) is important. For example, roll call votes on [[gun control]] routinely split party coalitions, with [[Blue Dog Democrats|socially conservative "blue dog" Democrats]] joining most Republicans in opposing additional regulation and [[Rockefeller Republican|socially liberal Republicans]] joining most Democrats in supporting gun control. The addition of the second dimension accounts for these inter-party differences, and the cutting line is more horizontal than vertical (meaning the cleavage is found on the second dimension rather than the first dimension on these votes) This pattern was evident in the 1991 House vote to require waiting periods on handguns:

[[File:NOMINATE 4.jpg|House Vote on Handgun Waiting Period (1991)]]

==Political Ideology==
DW-NOMINATE scores have been used widely to describe the political ideology of political actors, political parties and political institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarty|first=Nolan|year=2011|chapter=Measuring Legislative Preferences|title=Oxford Handbook of Congress|editor1-first=Eric|editor1-last=Schickler|editor2-first=Frances|editor2-last=Lee|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a score in the first dimension that is close to either pole means that such score is located at one of the extremes in the liberal-conservative scale. So, a score closer to 1 is described as conservative whereas a score closer to −1 can be described as liberal. Finally, a score at zero or close to zero is described as moderate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleisher|first1=Richard |first2=John R.|last2=Bond|year=2004|title=The Shrinking Middle in the US Congress|journal=British Journal of Political Science|volume=34|issue=3|pages=429–451|jstor=4092328|doi=10.1017/s0007123404000122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poole|first1=Keith T.|first2=Howard|last2=Rosenthal|year=1997|title=Congress: A Political-Economic History of Roll Call Voting|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|at=Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political polarization==
[[File:NOMINATE polarization.jpg|thumb|right|Political polarization in the United States House of Representatives.]]
Poole and Rosenthal (beginning with their 1984 article "The Polarization of American Politics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=Keith T. |first2=Howard|last2=Rosenthal|year=1984|title=The Polarization of American Politics|journal=Journal of Politics|volume=46|issue=4|pages=1061–79|url=http://k7moa.com/pdf/ThePolarizationofAmericanPolitics_1984.pdf|jstor=2131242|doi=10.2307/2131242}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have also used NOMINATE data to show that, since the 1970s, party delegations in Congress have become ideologically homogeneous and distant from one another (a phenomenon known as "[[Political polarization|polarization]]"). Using DW-NOMINATE scores (which permit direct comparisons between members of different Congresses across time), political scientists have demonstrated the expansion of ideological divides in Congress, which has spurred intense partisanship between Republicans and Democrats in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Theriault|first=Sean M.|year=2008|title=Party Polarization in Congress|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Gary|year=2010|title=A Divider, Not a Uniter: George W.

==Applications==
NOMINATE has been used to test, refine, and/or develop wide-ranging theories and models of the United States Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiewiet|first1=D. Roderick|first2=Matthew D.|last2=McCubbins|year=1991|title=The Logic of Delegation|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shickler|first=Eric|year=2000|title=Institutional Change in the House of Representatives, 1867–1998: A Test of Partisan and Ideological Power Balance Models|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=94|issue=2|pages=269–288|jstor=2586012|doi=10.2307/2586012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ideology and Congress'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;270–271), Poole and Rosenthal agree that their findings are consistent with the "party cartel" model that Cox and McCubbins present in their 1993 book ''Legislative Leviathan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Gary W.|first2=Matthew D.|last2=McCubbins|year=1993|title=Legislative Leviathan|location=Berkeley|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Krehbiel utilizes NOMINATE scores to determine the ideological rank order of both chambers of Congress in developing his "pivotal politics" theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krehbiel|first=Keith|year=1998|title=Pivotal Politics: A Theory of U.S. Lawmaking|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do Gary Cox and Matthew McCubbins in their tests of whether parties in Congress meet the conditions of responsible party government (RPG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Gary W.|first2=Matthew D.|last2=McCubbins|year=2005|title=Setting the Agenda: Responsible Party Government in the U.S. House of Representatives|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOMINATE scores are also used by popular media outlets like ''The New York Times'' and ''The Washington Post'' as a measure of the political ideology of political institutions and elected officials or candidates. Political blogger [[Nate Silver]] and his team at [[FiveThirtyEight]] regularly use DW-NOMINATE scores to gauge the ideological location of major political figures and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-sanders-and-cruz-really-less-electable/|title=Are Sanders And Cruz Really Less ‘Electable’?|last=Azari|first=Julia|date=4 April 2016|work=[[FiveThirtyEight]]|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/an-imbalanced-budget-deal/|title=An Imbalanced Budget Deal?|last=Silver|first=Nate|date=10 April 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/in-targeting-murkowski-tea-party-chooses-wisely/|title=In Singling Out Murkowski, Tea Party Chose Wisely|last=Silver|first=Nate|date=1 September 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/how-liberal-is-president-obama/|title=How Liberal Is President Obama?|last=Silver|first=Nate|date=29 April 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/08/the_republicans_on_the_deficit.html|title=The Republicans on the deficit commission are more conservative than the Democrats are liberal|last=Klein|first=Ezra|date=30 August 2008|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOMINATE procedures and related roll call scaling techniques have also been applied to a number of other legislative bodies besides the [[United States Congress]]. These include the [[United Nations General Assembly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voeten|first=Erik|year=2001|title=Outside Options and the Logic of Security Council Action|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=95|issue=4|pages=845–858|jstor=3117717|doi=10.1017/s000305540101005x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Parliament|the European Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hix|first1=Simon|first2=Abdul|last2=Noury|first3=Gérard|last3=Roland|year=2006|title=Dimensions of Politics in the European Parliament|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=50|issue=2|pages=494–511|jstor=3694286|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00198.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Assemblies in [[Latin America]],&lt;ref&gt;Mogernstern, Scott.

The '''New England Complex Systems Institute''' (NECSI) is a small [[United States|American]] research institution dedicated to advancing the study of [[complex systems]]. NECSI offers educational programs, conducts research, and hosts the International Conference on Complex Systems. It was founded in 1996 and is located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref name = "NECSI"/&gt;

== Mission ==
NECSI was established in 1996 by faculty of various New England academic institutions, including [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]], and others, to encourage communication and collaboration among researchers studying complex systems.&lt;ref name="iccs2"/&gt;

The NECSI web site describes "[[complex systems]]" as follows:&lt;ref name="NECSI"/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Complex systems have multiple interacting components whose [[collective behavior]] cannot be simply inferred from the behavior of components. The recognition that understanding the parts cannot explain collective behavior has led to various new concepts and methodologies that are affecting all fields of science and engineering, and are being applied to technology, business and even [[social policy]]. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Collaboration and Communication==

NECSI promotes collaboration and dissemination of new research among complex systems researchers in wide-ranging disciplines and numerous institutions. NECSI's activities for this purpose include hosting an international research conference and maintaining a roster of affiliated scholars and co-faculty.

=== International Conference on Complex Systems ===
NECSI hosts the International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS), whose aims are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
first, to investigate those properties or characteristics that appear to be common to the very different complex systems now under study; and second, to encourage cross fertilization among the many disciplines involved.&lt;ref name = iccs8/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
ICCS takes place on an occasional basis, with the most recent (eighth conference) in 2011. ICCS conferences have featured notable computer scientists (e.g., Gerald Sussman), mathematicians (e.g., Stephen Wolfram), systems theorists (e.g., [[John Sterman]]), physicists (e.g. Sandy Pentland), economists (e.g., James Stock), and others. 
Events at ICCS include research presentations and workshops, as well as pedagogical sessions aimed at a wider community.

=== Affiliates and Co-faculty ===
NECSI provides a public platform for affiliates and co-faculty at numerous academic institutions, primarily in the New England region. These researchers also contribute to NECSI educational programs.&lt;ref name = short_course /&gt;

== Research areas ==

=== Evolution and Ecology ===
NECSI researchers have contributed to the understanding of evolutionary dynamics, the evolution of [[altruism in animals|altruism]], the origin and characterization of [[biodiversity]], and the interplay between evolution and ecology.

Much of the work done at NECSI has focused on the role of the spatial distribution of species, an often overlooked factor of evolutionary dynamics. In the case where portions of a population are geographically isolated from each other, for example, [[Yaneer Bar-Yam]] was able to demonstrate shortcomings in the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], an approximation that is valid only if there is complete mixing of alleles in the gene pool.&lt;ref name="gene-centered" /&gt;

=== Networks ===
Studies of [[network topology|network topologies]] have found surprising similarities between a variety of complex social, technological and biological networks.  NECSI research in networks focuses on the relationship between structure, dynamics and function.

=== Social Systems ===
NECSI research in social systems focuses on the collective actions that create revolutions, ethnic violence, urban health, fads and panics, global food and so on. The role of individuals and organization can be analyzed by techniques and tools of [[complex systems]].

=== Representation ===
Complex systems exhibit behaviors at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Researchers working at NECSI have developed a mathematical formalism for simultaneously describing systems on multiple scales. This formalism had been applied to physical systems, information systems, organizational behavior, engineering projects and military conflict.

An essential tool for multiscale analysis, the complexity profile, the relationship between the observed complexity of a system and the scale of observation.

=== Post-crisis focus on social and economic systems ===
Since 2009, the Institute's research focus has shifted to socio-economic systems, with particular attention to the causes and consequences of the 2008 financial crisis and dynamics of Twitter networks and social sentiment. Policy relevant articles on stock market regulation and market crashes,&lt;ref name=market-interdependence /&gt;&lt;ref name = uptick/&gt;&lt;ref name=panic/&gt;&lt;ref name=bear-raid /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harmon D, Lagi M, de Aguiar MAM, Chinellato DD, Braha D, Epstein IR, et al. (2015). [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131871 "Anticipating Economic Market Crises Using Measures of Collective Panic."] PLoS ONE 10(7): e0131871.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0131871.&lt;/ref&gt; food riots and the causes of high food prices,&lt;ref name = foodprices/&gt;&lt;ref name=food-crises/&gt;&lt;ref name=food-update/&gt; and the European bond crisis&lt;ref name=europe-debt /&gt; have been released straight to the press. Peer reviewed articles continue to appear on other subjects.&lt;ref name=nyt-twitter /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-twitter/&gt;&lt;ref name=ring-species /&gt;

=== Further fields of research ===
* [[Systems Biology]]
* [[Systems Engineering]]
* [[Management|Organizational management]]
* [[Negotiation]]

== Public attention ==
NECSI's work on the global food crisis has been widely cited by the press,&lt;ref name=time-coverage /&gt;&lt;ref name=wired-coverage /&gt;&lt;ref  name=motherboard-coverage /&gt; by movements to curb financial speculation,&lt;ref name=foodwatch /&gt;&lt;ref name=wdm /&gt; and included among the top 10 discoveries in science in 2011 by [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]].&lt;ref name=wired-top-discoveries /&gt; NECSI's scientific visualizations have received multiple citations on top 10 lists.&lt;ref name=wired-best-figures /&gt;&lt;ref name=wired-graphics /&gt;&lt;ref name=map-porn /&gt;

NECSI has been called "a pioneer in using mathematics, computation and other quantitative methods to analyse topics like ethnic violence, economic crises and healthcare systems" by the press.&lt;ref name="The Economic Times"/&gt;

An '''occupational exposure limit''' is an upper limit on the acceptable [[concentration]] of a [[hazardous substance]] in workplace [[air]] for a particular material or class of materials. It is typically set by competent national authorities and enforced by legislation to protect [[occupational safety and health]]. It is an important tool in [[risk assessment]] and in the management of activities involving handling of dangerous substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work | title=Occupational Exposure Limits | url=http://osha.europa.eu/good_practice/topics/dangerous_substances/oel | accessdate=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many dangerous substances for which there are no formal occupational exposure limits. In these cases, hazard banding or [[control banding]] strategies can be used to ensure safe handling.

== Background ==
[[File:Hierarchies of Exposure Assessment and Management.JPG|thumb|Simple representation of exposure risk assessment and management hierarchy based on available information]]

Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) have been established for airborne workplace chemicals by multiple regulatory and authoritative organizations around the world for well over 60 years now.  With the changing regulatory arena, shifting centers of manufacturing growth, and the move towards a more global view on occupational hygiene issues, it is important for the [[Occupational hygiene|Occupational Hygiene]] profession to understand the current and growing issues impacting the continued viability of OEL’s in our professional practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IOHA | title=International OEL Issues and Activities \ | url=http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010958/http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html | archivedate=2015-08-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although peer-reviewed health-based OELs are preferred for establishing safe levels of exposure or for implementing adequate controls to provide worker protection, the lack of publicly available OELs have led to other sources of safe levels to protect workers.  Industrial or Occupational Hygienists are often on the front line of anticipating and recognizing the hazards of chemical exposure for workers, and must assess the risk of exposure through the use of OELs so that proper control strategies can be implemented to keep workers below the OEL values.  In the absence of OELs however, there are a variety of tools that can and should be used to assess exposure potential of workers.  The "Hierarchy of OELs" provides a continuum of occupational exposure limit values that allow assessment of the risk of exposure in order to apply adequate controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=AIHA | title=Webinar:  The New Era of Global Exposure Limit Setting Processes - Harmonization on an OEL Hierarchy Approach |url=http://www.aiha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hierarchy of Occupational Exposure Limits.JPG|thumb|Hierarchy of occupational exposure limits (OELs)]]
[[File:Analysis of air sampling data using IHSTAT.JPG|thumb|Illustration of statistical output from IHSTAT using air sampling data]]
Personal air sampling is routinely conducted on workers to determine whether exposures are acceptable or unacceptable.  These samples are collected and analyzed using validated sampling and analytical methods.  These methods are available from OSHA Technical Manual and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/ NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistical tools are available to assess exposure monitoring data against OELs.  The statistical tools are typically free but do require some previous knowledge with statistical concepts.  A popular exposure data statistical tool called "IH STAT" is available from AIHA ([[American Industrial Hygiene Association]]).  IHSTAT has 14 languages including English and is available for free.&lt;ref&gt;"Link to freeware version IHSTAT via AIHA Exposure Assessment Strategies website" https://www.aiha.org/get-involved/VolunteerGroups/Pages/Exposure-Assessment-Strategies-Committee.aspx/&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in "A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock".&lt;ref&gt;"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock AIHA Press" http://iweb.aiha.org/iweb/Purchase/ProductDetail.aspx?Product_code=AEAK06-327/{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
* [[Permissible exposure limit]], set by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]
* [[Recommended exposure limit]], set by the U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]
* [[Indicative limit value]], set by the European Union
* [[Threshold Limit Value|Threshold limit value]], set by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]]
* [[Occupational exposure banding]], a process that can be used when not enough data are available to determine quantiative exposure limits

== International limit values ==
The [[database]] ″GESTIS - International limit values for chemical agents″&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance: GESTIS – International limit values for chemical agents (Occupational exposure limits, OELs), http://www.dguv.de/ifa/gestis/gestis-internationale-grenzwerte-fuer-chemische-substanzen-limit-values-for-chemical-agents/index-2.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; contains a collection of occupational limit values for hazardous substances collected from over 30 countries: various [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], [[China]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]]. The database comprises values of more than 2,000 substances.

The present database was elaborated in co-operation with experts from various international [[occupational safety and health]] institutions. It aims to give an overview of limit values in different countries. Since the limit values vary in their handling, the level of protection, and their legal relevance, the original lists of limit values and the explanations there should be considered as primary sources. Also the [[chemical nomenclature]] is diverging, [[synonym]]s can for example be found in the [[GESTIS Substance Database]].

The database is also available as app for mobile terminals with Android or iOS operating systems.

==Electron excitation==
[[Image:Energy levels.svg|thumb|210px|right| After absorbing energy, an electron may jump from the ground state to a higher energy excited state.]]

[[Electron excitation]] is the movement of an [[electron]] to a higher [[energy state]]. This can either be done by photoexcitation (PE), where the original electron absorbs the photon and gains all the photon's energy or by electrical [[Excited state|excitation]] (EE), where the original electron absorbs the energy of another, energetic electron. Within a semiconductor crystal lattice, thermal excitation is a process where lattice vibrations provide enough energy to move electrons to a higher [[energy band]]. When an excited electron falls back to a lower energy state again, it is called electron relaxation. This can be done by radiation of a photon or giving the energy to a third spectator particle as well.&lt;ref name=2-electron&gt;

In physics there is a specific technical definition for [[energy level]] which is often associated with an atom being excited to an [[excited state]]. The excited state, in general, is in relation to the [[ground state]], where the excited state is at a higher [[energy level]] than the ground state.

==Photoexcitation==
{{See also|Photoelectric effect}}

[[Photoexcitation]] is the mechanism of [[electron excitation]] by [[photon]] absorption, when the energy of the photon is too low to cause photoionization. The absorption of the photon takes place in accordance with Planck's quantum theory.

Photoexcitation plays role in photoisomerization. Photoexcitation is exploited in [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s, [[photochemistry]], [[luminescence]], optically [[laser pumping|pumped]] lasers, and in some [[photochromic]] applications.

==Photoisomerization==
[[File:Azobenzene isomerization.svg|thumb|Photoisomerization of azobenzene]]
In [[chemistry]], '''photoisomerization''' is [[molecule|molecular]] behavior in which structural change between [[isomer]]s is caused by photoexcitation. Both reversible and irreversible photoisomerization reactions exist. However, the word "photoisomerization" usually indicates a reversible process. Photoisomerizable molecules are already put to practical use, for instance, in [[pigment]]s for [[CD-RW|rewritable CDs]], [[DVD-RW|DVDs]], and [[3D optical data storage]] solutions. In addition, recent interest in photoisomerizable molecules has been aimed at molecular devices, such as molecular switches,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and molecular electronics.

Photoisomerization behavior can be roughly categorized into several classes. Two major classes are ''trans-cis'' (or 'E-'Z) conversion, and open-closed ring transition. Examples of the former include [[stilbene]] and [[azobenzene]]. This type of compounds has a double [[chemical bond|bond]], and rotation or inversion around the double bond affords isomerization between the two states. Examples of the latter include [[fulgide]] and [[diarylethene]]. This type of compounds undergoes bond cleavage and bond creation upon irradiation with particular wavelengths of light. Still another class is the [[Di-pi-methane rearrangement]].

==Photoionization==
{{See also|Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy}}

[[Photoionization]] is the physical process in which an incident [[photon]] ejects one or more [[electron]]s from an [[atom]], [[ion]] or [[molecule]]. This is essentially the same process that occurs with the photoelectric effect with metals. In the case of a gas or single atoms, the term photoionization is more common.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ejected electrons, known as [[photoelectron]]s, carry information about their pre-ionized states. For example, a single electron can have a [[kinetic energy]] equal to the energy of the incident photon minus the [[electron binding energy]] of the state it left. Photons with energies less than the electron binding energy may be absorbed or [[scattering|scattered]] but will not photoionize the atom or ion.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

For example, to ionize [[hydrogen]], photons need an energy greater than 13.6 [[electronvolt]]s, which corresponds to a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometer|nm]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For photons with greater energy than this, the energy of the emitted photoelectron is given by:

: &lt;math&gt; { mv^2 \over 2 } = h \nu - 13.6 eV&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''ν'' is the [[frequency]] of the photon.

This formula defines the [[photoelectric effect]].

Not every photon which encounters an atom or ion will photoionize it. The probability of photoionization is related to the [[Photoionisation cross section|photoionization cross-section]], which depends on the energy of the photon and the target being considered. For photon energies below the ionization threshold, the photoionization cross-section is near zero. But with the development of pulsed lasers it has become possible to create extremely intense, coherent light where multi-photon ionization may occur. At even higher intensities (around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of infrared or visible light), [[non-perturbative]] phenomena such as ''barrier suppression ionization''&lt;ref&gt;

===Multi-photon ionization===
{{See also|Fluorescence spectroscopy| Fluorescence| Photoionization mode}}

Several photons of energy below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom. This probability decreases rapidly with the number of photons required, but the development of very intense, pulsed lasers still makes it possible. In the perturbative regime (below about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at optical frequencies), the probability of absorbing ''N'' photons depends on the laser-light intensity ''I'' as ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''N'' &lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

The excess energy gives the released electron higher [[kinetic energy]] than the usual case of just-above threshold ionization. More precisely, the system will have multiple peaks in its [[photoelectron spectrum]] which are separated by the photon energies, this indicates that the emitted electron has more kinetic energy than in the normal (lowest possible number of photons) ionization case. The electrons released from the target will have approximately an integer number of photon-energies more kinetic energy.

{{Main|Photo-Dember}}

In semiconductor physics the [[Photo-Dember]] effect (named after its discoverer H. Dember) consists in the formation of a charge [[dipole]] in the vicinity of a [[semiconductor]] surface after ultra-fast photo-generation of charge carriers. The dipole forms owing to the difference of mobilities (or diffusion constants) for holes and electrons which combined with the break of symmetry provided by the surface lead to an effective charge separation in the direction perpendicular to the surface.&lt;ref name=photodember&gt;

==Grotthuss–Draper law==
The '''Grotthuss–Draper law''' (also called the '''Principle of Photochemical Activation''') states that only that light which is absorbed by a system can bring about a photochemical change. Materials such as [[dye]]s and [[phosphor]]s must be able to absorb "light" at optical frequencies. This law provides a basis for [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]]. The law was first proposed in 1817 by [[Theodor Grotthuss]] and in 1842, independently, by [[John William Draper]].&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

This is considered to be one of the two basic laws of [[photochemistry]]. The second law is the [[Photoelectrochemical processes#Stark–Einstein law|Stark–Einstein law]], which says that primary chemical or physical reactions occur with each [[photon]] absorbed.&lt;ref name="Grotthuss–Draper-law"/&gt;

==Stark–Einstein law==
The '''Stark–Einstein law''' is named after German-born physicists [[Johannes Stark]] and [[Albert Einstein]], who independently formulated the law between 1908 and 1913. It is also known as the '''photochemical equivalence law''' or '''photoequivalence law'''. In essence it says that every photon that is absorbed will cause a (primary) chemical or physical reaction.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw&gt;
{{Cite web
 |title=Photochemical equivalence law
 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/457732/photochemical-equivalence-law
 |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]
 |accessdate=2009-11-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photon is a quantum of radiation, or one unit of radiation. Therefore, this is a single unit of EM radiation that is equal to Planck's constant (h) times the frequency of light. This quantity is symbolized by γ, hν, or ħω.

The photochemical equivalence law is also restated as follows: for every [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance that reacts, an equivalent mole of quanta of light are absorbed. The formula is:&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta E_{mol} = N_A h \nu &lt;/math&gt;

where N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Avogadro's number]].

The photochemical equivalence law applies to the part of a light-induced reaction that is referred to as the primary process (i.e. [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[fluorescence]]).&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

In most photochemical reactions the primary process is usually followed by so-called secondary photochemical processes that are normal interactions between reactants not requiring absorption of light. As a result, such reactions do not appear to obey the one quantum–one molecule reactant relationship.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

The law is further restricted to conventional photochemical processes using light sources with moderate intensities; high-intensity light sources such as those used in [[flash photolysis]] and in laser experiments are known to cause so-called biphotonic processes; i.e., the absorption by a molecule of a substance of two photons of light.&lt;ref name=StarkEinsteinlaw/&gt;

==Absorption==
{{Main|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}

In [[physics]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of electromagnetic radiation is the way by which the [[energy]] of a [[photon]] is taken up by matter, typically the electrons of an atom. Thus, the electromagnetic energy is transformed to other forms of energy, for example, to heat. The absorption of light during [[wave propagation]] is often called [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]]. Usually, the absorption of waves does not depend on their intensity (linear absorption), although in certain conditions (usually, in [[optics]]), the medium changes its transparency dependently on the intensity of waves going through, and the [[Saturable absorption]] (or nonlinear absorption) occurs.

==Photosensitization==
[[Photosensitization]] is a process of transferring the [[energy]] of absorbed light. After absorption, the energy is transferred to the (chosen) [[reactant]]s. This is part of the work of [[photochemistry]] in general. In particular this process is commonly employed where reactions require light sources of certain [[wavelength]]s that are not readily available.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization/&gt;

For example, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] absorbs radiation at 1849 and 2537 [[angstrom]]s, and the source is often high-intensity [[arc lamp|mercury lamps]]. It is a commonly used sensitizer. When mercury vapor is mixed with [[ethylene]], and the compound is [[irradiated]] with a mercury lamp, this results in the photodecomposition of ethylene to acetylene. This occurs on absorption of light to yield excited state mercury atoms, which are able to transfer this energy to the ethylene molecules, and are in turn deactivated to their initial energy state.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization/&gt;

[[Cadmium]]; some of the [[noble gas]]es, for example [[xenon]]; [[zinc]]; [[benzophenone]]; and a large number of organic dyes, are also used as sensitizers.&lt;ref name=Photosensitization&gt;
{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photosensitiser]]s are a key component of [[photodynamic therapy]] used to treat cancers.

==Sensitizer==
{{For|the particulate material used to create voids that aid in the initiation or propagation of an explosive's detonation wave|Explosive sensitiser}}

A '''sensitizer''' in [[chemiluminescence]] is a chemical compound, capable of [[light emission]] after it has received energy from a molecule, which became excited previously in the chemical reaction. A good example is this:

When an alkaline solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]] and a concentrated solution of [[hydrogen peroxide]] are mixed, a reaction occurs:

:ClO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*(g) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*is excited oxygen&amp;nbsp;– meaning, one or more electrons in the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule have been promoted to higher-energy [[molecular orbital]]s. Hence, oxygen produced by this chemical reaction somehow 'absorbed' the energy released by the reaction and became excited. This energy state is unstable, therefore it will return to the [[ground state]] by lowering its energy. It can do that in more than one way:

*it can react further, without any light emission
*it can lose energy without emission, for example, giving off heat to the surroundings or transferring energy to another molecule
*it can emit light

The intensity, duration and color of emitted light depend on [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] and [[chemical kinetics|kinetical]] factors. However, excited molecules are frequently less capable of light emission in terms of brightness and duration when compared to sensitizers. This is because sensitizers can store energy (that is, be excited) for longer periods of time than other excited molecules. The energy is stored through means of [[quantum vibration]], so sensitizers are usually compounds which either include systems of [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] rings or many conjugated double and triple [[covalent bond|bonds]] in their structure. Hence, if an excited molecule transfers its energy to a sensitizer thus exciting it, longer and easier to quantify light emission is often observed.

The color (that is, the [[wavelength]]), brightness and duration of emission depend upon the sensitizer used. Usually, for a certain chemical reaction, many different sensitizers can be used.

*[[Rubrene]]
*[[9,10-Diphenylanthracene]]
*[[Tetracene]]
*[[13,13'-Dibenzantronile]]
*[[Levulinic acid|Levulinic Acid]]

==Fluorescence spectroscopy==
[[Fluorescence spectroscopy]] aka fluorometry or spectrofluorometry, is a type of [[electromagnetic spectroscopy]] which analyzes [[fluorescence]] from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually [[ultraviolet light]], that excites the electrons in [[molecules]] of certain compounds and causes them to emit light of a lower energy, typically, but not necessarily, [[visible light]]. A complementary technique is [[absorption spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=Modern-spectroscopy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sym-spectroscopy/&gt;

Devices that measure [[fluorescence]] are called [[fluorometer]]s or fluorimeters.

==Absorption spectroscopy==
[[Absorption spectroscopy]] refers to [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques that measure the absorption of radiation, as a function of frequency or wavelength, due to its interaction with a sample. The sample absorbs energy, i.e., photons, from the radiating field. The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the [[absorption spectrum]]. Absorption spectroscopy is performed across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref name=Modern-spectroscopy&gt;

The deficit, or underproduction crisis, is a theoretical problem, arising from comparing observations of ultraviolet light emitted from known populations of [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s to theoretical predictions of the amount of ultraviolet light require to simulate the observed distribution of the hydrogen gas in the local universe in a cosmological simulation. The distribution of hydrogen gas was inferred using [[Lyman-alpha forest]] observations from [[Hubble Space Telescope]]’s [[Cosmic Origins Spectrograph]].&lt;ref&gt;Danforth et. al, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2655 "on arXiv"], ''Submitted to ApJ'',&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of light from galaxies and quasars can be estimated from its effect on the distribution of hydrogen and helium in the regions between galaxies. Highly energetic ultraviolet photons can convert electrically neutral hydrogen gas into ionized gas. A team led by [[Juna Kollmeier]] reported an unexpected deficit of roughly 400% between ionizing light from known sources and the actual observations of intergalactic hydrogen. Kollmeier and her team wrote in their scientific report, “We examine the statistics of the low-redshift [[Lyman-alpha forest]] from smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations in light of recent improvements in the estimated evolution of the cosmic ultraviolet background (UVB) and recent observations from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). We find that the value of the metagalactic photoionization rate required by our simulations to match the observed properties of the low-redshift Lyman-alpha forest is a factor of 5 larger than the value predicted by state-of-the art models for the evolution of this quantity.”&lt;ref name=ApJL&gt;{{cite journal |date=2014 | title=The Photon Underproduction Crisis | journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal|The Astrophysical Journal Letters]]| volume=798  | issue=2 | pages=L32  | doi=10.1088/2041-8205/789/2/L32 | first=Juna |last=Kollmeier|display-authors=4|last2=Weinberg  | first2=David H.  | last3=Oppenheimer  | first3=Benjamin D. | last4=Haardt | first4=Francesco  | last5=Katz | first5=Neal  | last6=Davé | first6=Romeel A.  | last7=Fardal  | first7=Mark  | last8=Madau  | first8=Piero | last9=Danforth | first9=Charles  | last10=Ford  | first10 =Amanda B. | last11=Peeples | first11=Molly S. | last12 =McEwen | first12 =Joseph  |arxiv = 1404.2933 |bibcode = 2014ApJ...789L..32K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmological simulations start at very high cosmological redshift z (such as z=100 or larger) and are evolved to z=0. According to Benjamin D. Oppenheimer, who is one of the report's coauthors, “The simulations fit the data beautifully in the early universe, and they fit the local data beautifully if we’re allowed to assume that this extra light is really there. It's possible the simulations do not reflect reality, which by itself would be a surprise, because intergalactic hydrogen is the component of the Universe that we think we understand the best.”&lt;ref name=CIS/&gt; Kollmeier and her team state that "... either conventional sources of ionizing photons (galaxies and quasars) must contribute considerably more than current observational estimates or our theoretical understanding of the low-redshift universe is in need of substantial revision.”&lt;ref name=ApJL/&gt; Similar study, led by Michael Shull, found that the deficit is only factor 2 large and not a factor 5 as previously claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Shull, Moloney, Danforth, Tilton 2015 [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/811/1/3/meta], ''Astrophysical Journal'',&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The photon underproduction crisis is resolved by a series of recent papers.  Khaire &amp; Srianand &lt;ref&gt;Khaire &amp; Srianand 2015, [http://mnrasl.oxfordjournals.org/content/451/1/L30], ''MNRAS Letters'',&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a factor 2 to 5 times large metagalactic photoionization rate can be easily obtained using updated quasar and galaxy observations. Recent observations of quasars indicate that the quasar contribution to ultraviolet photons is factor 2 large as compared to previous estimates. The revised galaxy contribution is also factor 3 higher. Furthermore, the Kollmeier GADGET-2 simulations did not include heating from [[active galactic nuclei]] (AGN) feedback. Including AGN feedback was shown to be an important element for heating in the low redshift [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM) (Gurvich, Burkhart, &amp; Bird 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03293&lt;/ref&gt;). This implies that the low redshift COS data can be used to calibrate AGN feedback models in cosmological simulations.

'''RAMP Simulation Software for Modelling Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM)''' is a computer software application developed by [[WS Atkins]] specifically for the assessment of the [[Reliability engineering#Reliability modelling|reliability]], [[availability]], [[maintainability]] and [[productivity]] characteristics of complex systems that would otherwise prove too difficult, cost too much or take too long to study analytically.  The name '''RAMP''' is an acronym standing for '''R'''eliability, '''A'''vailability and '''M'''aintainability of '''P'''rocess systems.

RAMP models reliability using failure [[probability distributions]] for system elements, as well as accounting for [[Common-cause and special-cause#In engineering|common mode failures]].  RAMP models availability using logistic repair delays caused by shortages of [[spare part]]s or [[manpower]], and their associated resource conditions defined for system elements.  RAMP models maintainability using repair probability distributions for system elements, as well as [[preventive maintenance]] data and fixed logistic delays between failure detection and repair commencement.

RAMP consists of two parts:

# RAMP Model Builder.  A front-end interactive [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).
# RAMP Model Processor.  A back-end [[discrete-event simulation]] that employs the [[Monte Carlo method]].

== RAMP Model Builder ==
The RAMP Model Builder enables the user to create a [[block diagram]] describing the dependency of the process being modelled on the state of individual elements in the system.

=== Elements ===
Elements are the basic building blocks of a system modelled in RAMP and can have user-specified failure and repair characteristics in the form probability distributions, typically of [[Mean Time Between Failure]] (MTBF) and [[Mean Time To Repair]] (MTTR) values respectively, chosen from the following:

# [[Weibull distribution|Weibull]]: Defined by scale and shape parameters (or optionally 50th and 95th [[percentiles]] for repairs).
# [[Negative exponential distribution|Negative exponential]]: Defined by [[mean average]].
# [[Lognormal]]: Defined by [[median average]] and dispersion (or optionally 50th and 95th percentiles for repairs).
# Fixed ([[Uniform distribution (continuous)|Uniform]]): Defined by a maximum time to failure or repair.
# Empirical (user-defined): Defined by a multiplier.

Elements can represent any part of a system from a specific [[failure mode]] of a minor component (e.g. isolation valve fails open) to major subsystems (e.g. compressor or power turbine failure) depending on the level and detail of the analysis required.

=== Deterministic elements ===
RAMP allows the user to define [[deterministic]] elements which are failure free and/or are unrepairable.  These elements may be used to represent parameters of the process (e.g. purity of feedstock or production demand at a particular time) or where necessary in the modelling logic (e.g. to provide conversion factors).

=== Q values ===
Each element of the model has a user-defined process 'q value' representing a parameter of interest (e.g. mass flow, generation capacity etc.).  Each element is considered to be either operating or not operating and has associated performance values q = Q or q = 0 respectively.  The interpretation of each 'q value' in the model depends on the parameter of interest being modelled, which is typically chosen during the system analysis stage of model design.

=== Groups ===
Elements with interacting functionality can be organised into groups.  Groups can be further combined (to any depth) to produce a Process Dependency Diagram (PDD) of the system, which is similar to a normal [[reliability block diagram]] (RBD) commonly used in [[reliability engineering]], but also allows complex logical relationships between groups and elements to permit a more accurate representation of the process being modelled.  The PDD should not be confused with a [[Data flow diagram|flow diagram]] since it describes dependency, not flow.  For example, an element may appear in more than one position in the PDD if this is required to represent the true dependency of the process on that element.  Groups may also be shown in full or may be compressed to allow the screen to show other areas to greater resolution.

=== Group types ===
Each group can be one of eleven group types, each with its own rule for combining 'q values' of elements and/or other groups within it to produce a 'q value' output.  Groups thus define how the behaviour of each element affects the reliability, availability, maintainability and productivity of the system.  The eleven group types are divided into two classes:

Five 'Flow' group types:

# Minimum (M): qM = min[q1, q2,...qn]
# Active Redundant (A): qA = min[Rating, (q1 + q2 + ... + qn)] unless qA &lt; Cut-off, then qA = 0
# Standby Redundant (S): qS = as for Active Redundant, but where the first component is always assumed to be duty equipment.
# Time (T): qT = 0 if component with 'q value' q1 is in a "down" state when time through mission t &lt; t0, otherwise qT = q1 + ... + qm if component with 'q value' q1 is in an "up" state when time t ≥ t0 + (m-1) x Time Delay, where m = 1 to n.
# Buffer (B): if the buffer is not empty qB = q2 else qB = min[q1,q2], where the buffer empties as output if component with 'q value' q2 is in an "up" state with level at time 0 = Initial Level, otherwise level at time t = level at time (t-1) - (q2 - q1), and the buffer fills as input if component with 'q value' q2 is in a "down" state with level at time 0 = Initial Level, otherwise level at time t = Capacity if level at time (t-1) + q1 &gt; C, otherwise level at time t = level at time (t-1) + (q2 - q1). Buffer input and output may also be limited by buffer constraints.

Six 'Logic' group types:

# Product (P): qP = q1 x q2 x ... x qn
# Quotient (Q): pQ = q1 / q2
# Conditionally Greater Than (G): if q1 &gt; q2 then qG = q1 else qG = 0
# Conditionally Less Than (L): if q1 &lt; q2 then qG = q1 else qG = 0
# Difference (D): max[q1 - q2, 0]
# Equality (E): q1 if q1 lies outside the range PA to PB, q2 if q1 lies inside the range PA to PB

Three group types (Active Redundant, Standby Redundant and Time) are displayed in parallel configurations (vertically down the screen).  All others are displayed in series configurations (horizontally across the screen).

Six group types (Buffer, Quotient, Conditionally Greater Than, Conditionally Less Than, Difference and Equality) contain exactly two components with 'q values' q1 and q2. All others contain two or more components with 'q values' q1, q2 to qn.

=== Element states ===
An element may be in one of five possible states and its 'q value' is determined by its state:

# Undergoing [[preventive maintenance]] (''q'' = 0).
# Being repaired following failure, including queueing for repair (''q'' = 0).
# Failed but undetected, dormant failure (''q'' = 0). (e.g. standby equipment unavailable in the event of failure of duty equipment.  Thus a problem may not be apparent until a failure of the duty equipment occurs.)
# Up but passive, available but not being used (''q'' = 0). (e.g. standby equipment available in the event of failure of duty equipment.)
# Up and active, being used (''q'' = ''Q'' &gt; 0). (i.e. operating as intended.)

Occurrence of a state transition for an element is determined largely by the user-defined parameters for that element (i.e. its failure and repair distributions and any preventive maintenance cycles).

=== Element resource and repair conditions ===
There is often a time delay between an element failing and the commencement of repair of the element. This may be caused by a lack of spare parts, the unavailability of manpower or the element cannot be repaired due to dependencies on other elements (e.g. a pump cannot be repaired because the isolating valve is defective and cannot be closed). In all of these cases, the element must be queued for repair.  RAMP allows the user to define multiple resource conditions per element, all of which must be satisfied to allow a repair to be commenced.  Each resource condition is one of five types:

# Repair Trade: a specified number of a repair trade must be available.
# Spare: a specified number of a spare part must be available.
# Group Q Value: a specified group must satisfy a condition regarding its 'q value'.
# Buffer Level: a specified buffer must satisfy a condition regarding its level.
# Element State: a specified element must satisfy a condition regarding its state.

==== Repair trades repair condition ====
Repair trades can be specified for the repair of any element, and they represent manpower in the form of a set of skilled maintenance workers with a particular trade.  A repair trade can be used for the duration of an element repair (i.e. logistic delay plus a time value drawn from the element repair distribution).  On completion of the repair, the Repair Trade becomes available to repair another element.  the number of repairs which can be performed simultaneously for elements requiring a particular repair trade depends on the number of repair trade resources allocated and the number of that repair trade specified as a requirement for the repair.

==== Spares repair condition ====
If a spare part is required for an element repair, then the spare part is withdrawn from stock at the instant the repair commences (i.e. as soon as the element leaves the repair queue).  The maximum number of spare parts of each type that may be held in stock is user-defined.  The stock may either be replenished periodically at a user-defined time interval, or when the stock falls below a user-defined level, in which case RAMP allows a user-defined a time delay that must occur between reordering and the actual replenishment of the stock.

==== Group Q value repair condition ====
RAMP allows the user to specify that an element cannot be repaired until the 'q value' of a nominated group satisfies one of six conditions (&gt;, ≥, &lt;, ≤, =, ≠) relative to a user-defined non-negative real number repair constraint.  These conditions may be used to model certain rules in a system (e.g. a pump cannot be repaired until a tank is empty).

==== Buffer level repair condition ====
Specifying a buffer level constraint means that preventive maintenance of an element can be restricted until the buffer level of a nominated buffer group satisfies one of six conditions (&gt;, ≥, &lt;, ≤, =, ≠) relative to a user-defined non-negative real number repair constraint.  These conditions may be used to model certain rules in a system (e.g. it may be a requirement for maintenance of a submersible pump that the tank it is in should be empty before repair work commences).

==== Element state repair condition ====
RAMP allows the user to specify that an element cannot be repaired until the state of another nominated element satisfies one of six conditions (&gt;, ≥, &lt;, ≤, =, ≠) relative to a user-defined non-negative real number repair constraint.

=== Repair policy ===
Each element has user-defined parameters that can affect how it is repaired:

# Logistic repair delay: A time period that must elapse before a repair can start on an element.  It is a fixed time that is added to the repair time sampled from the user-defined repair probability distribution for the element.  Typically, it represents a combination of the time taken for the repair team to reach the site of failure, time to isolate the failed item, and time taken to obtain the required spare part from store.
# Repair 'good-as-new' or 'bad-as-old': Refers to the failure rate of an element rather than its 'q-value'.  By default an element is restored to 'good-as-new' following repair, but there is an option to toggle a 'bad-as-old' state that simulates a quick-fix equivalent to restoring the element to the beginning of the wear-out phase of a Weibull bathtub curve, should a Weibull probability distribution with shape greater than one be used for repairs.
# Repair priority: Used only if element resource and repair conditions are specified (i.e. it is only used if an element has to queue for repair rather than going directly for repair).  The purpose of this field is to help determine the sequence in which elements are drawn from the repair queue as resources become available for element repair.  Elements are repaired according to their repair priority, where 1 is highest priority, 2 is next highest, and so on.  Elements with the same priority are repaired on a 'first come first served' basis.

In addition, each element in a Standby Redundant group has more parameters that can affect how it is repaired:

# Passive failure rate factor: Factor by which the element failure rate is multiplied when operating in the passive state as opposed to the active state.  By default this factor will be one and typically between zero and one, indicating a lower passive failure rate than active failure rate.
# Probability of switching failure: Percentage probability that the element will fail when switched from the passive state into the active state.  If such a switching failure occurs, the element must be repaired in the normal way before it can be used again.
# Startup delay: Startup of the element going from a passive state to an active state is delayed by a specified time.

==== Preventive maintenance ====
RAMP allows the user to model preventive maintenance for each system element by cycles expressed using the three parameters 'up-time'. 'down-time' and 'down-time' start time.  RAMP also has an option to toggle 'intelligent preventive maintenance' on each system element, which attempts to improve system performance by doing preventive maintenance when the element is already in 'down-time' for other reasons.

=== Common mode failures ===
Common mode failures (CMFs) that cause a number of elements to fail at the same time (e.g. due to the occurrence of a fire or some other catastrophic event, or the failure of a power supply that provides power to several separately defined elements).  RAMP allows the user to define CMFs by stating the set of affected elements and the frequency distribution for occurrences of the CMF.  When a CMF occurs, any elements which are affected by that particular CMF are placed in the failed state and must be repaired, being queued for repair if necessary. Any elements failed by a CMF will be repaired according to the repair distribution defined for that element.  Elements which are already being repaired, are in the repair queue, or are undergoing preventive maintenance remain unaffected by the occurrence of an associated CMF.

=== Criticalities ===
The criticality of an element is a measure of how much the element has affected the 'q value' (i.e. performance) of the group to which it belongs.  Elements with a high criticality cause more 'down-time' or unavailability on average and are thus critical to the performance of the group.  The criticality of an element may vary according to the level of the group (e.g. a motor failure may have a very high criticality for a group that contains failure modes for one pump, but a very low criticality for a group that contains several redundant pumps).

=== Time units ===
RAMP allows the user to set the time unit of interest, according to scale and fidelity considerations.  The only requirement is that time units should be used consistently across a model to avoid misleading results.  Time units are expressed in the following input data:

# Element failure probability distributions.
# Element repair probability distributions.
# Element logistic delay times (before repair).
# Element preventive maintenance 'up-times', 'down-times' and start points.
# Common mode failure probability distributions.
# Percentile times in empirical probability distributions (for failure or repair).
# Delay times in Time groups.
# Spare part replenishment intervals or re-order delay times.
# Rolling average span and increment.
# Histogram 'down-times'.
# Simulated time period of interest.

=== Element types ===
Elements that are assumed to have the same failure and repair characteristics and share a common pool of spare parts can be assigned the same user-defined element type (i.e. pump, motor, tank etc.).  This allows for faster construction of complex systems containing many elements that are similar in function since the entry of element data does not need to be repeated for such elements.

=== Import functionality ===
Previously built systems can be imported as subsystems of the system currently displayed.  This allows for faster construction of complex systems containing many subsystems since they can be constructed in parallel by multiple users before being imported into a common system.

== RAMP Model Processor ==
The RAMP Model Processor mimics the system operating over the time period of interest - known in RAMP as a mission - by sampling failure and repair times from probability distributions (with probabilities drawn from a [[pseudo-random number generator]]) and combining with other data defined in the RAMP Model Builder to determine state transition events for each element in the model.  The simulation uses discrete events that are queued in chronological order with each event being processed in turn to determine the states and thus the 'q values' of every element in the model at that discrete point in time.  Group combination rules are used to determine the 'q values' at successively higher levels of groups, culminating in 'q values' of the outermost groups that when averaged over the events of the simulation typically provide performance measures of the system, which are output in model results in terms of the chosen parameters of interest.

By running enough missions over the same time period of interest (different possible histories from the same starting point), RAMP can be used to generate [[statistically significant]] results that establish the likely distribution of the user-defined parameters of interest and thus objectively assess the system, with the confidence bands on the results dependent on the number of missions simulated.  On the other hand, by running a mission length that is long in comparison with the failure frequencies and repair times, and simulating only one mission, RAMP can be used to establish the [[steady-state]] performance of the system.

== History of RAMP ==
RAMP was originally developed by Rex Thompson &amp; Partners Ltd. in the mid-1980s as an availability simulation program, primarily used for plant and process modelling.&lt;ref&gt;http://rams.chez.com/TOOL_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The ownership of RAMP was transferred to T.A. Group&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epsilon-research.com/valuation-multiples/it-services/ws-atkins/advantage-business-group-former-ta-group?dealId=18344&lt;/ref&gt; upon its founding in January 1990,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enre.umd.edu/tools/rmp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and then to [[Fluor Corporation]] when it acquired T.A. Group in April 1996,&lt;ref&gt;http://investor.fluor.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=124955&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=14654&amp;highlight=&lt;/ref&gt; before passing to the Advantage Technical Consulting business of parent company Advantage Business Group Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22400278&lt;/ref&gt; formed in February 2001 by a management buy-out of the consulting and information technology businesses of Fluor Corporation, operating in the transport, defence, energy and manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Railways/Fluor-Global-Services-Consulting-United-Kingdom.html&lt;/ref&gt;  RAMP is currently owned by [[WS Atkins|Atkins]] following its acquisition of Advantage Business Group Ltd. in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epsilon-research.com/valuation-multiples/it-services/ws-atkins/advantage-business-group-former-ta-group?dealId=18344&lt;/ref&gt;  Extensive redevelopment by Atkins of the original RAMP application for [[DOS]] has produced a series of RAMP applications for the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform, with the RAMP Model Builder written in [[Visual Basic]] and the RAMP Model Processor written in [[FORTRAN]].

== Uses of RAMP ==
Due to its inherent flexibility, RAMP is now used to optimise system design and support critical decision making in many sectors&lt;ref&gt;Reliability, Maintainability and Risk: 7th Edition. Elsevier. David J. Smith BSc PhD CEng FIEE FIQA HonFSaRS MIGasE.&lt;/ref&gt;  RAMP provides the capability to model many factors that may affect a system such as changes in specification or procurement contracts, 'what if' studies, [[sensitivity analysis]], [[Redundancy (engineering)|equipment redundancy]], [[Criticality matrix|equipment criticality]], delayed failures, as well as allowing the generation of results that can be exported for failure mode, effects and criticality analysis ([[FMECA]]) and [[cost-benefit analysis]].

In [[Computational learning theory|statistical learning theory]], a '''representer theorem''' is any of several related results stating that a minimizer &lt;math&gt;f^{*}&lt;/math&gt; of a regularized [[Empirical risk minimization|empirical risk function]] defined over a [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]] can be represented as a finite linear combination of kernel products evaluated on the input points in the training set data.

The following Representer Theorem and its proof are due to [[Bernhard Schölkopf|Schölkopf]], Herbrich, and Smola:

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty set and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; a positive-definite real-valued kernel on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; with corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt;.  Given a training sample &lt;math&gt;(x_1, y_1), \dotsc, (x_n, y_n) \in \mathcal{X} \times \R&lt;/math&gt;, a strictly monotonically increasing real-valued function &lt;math&gt;g \colon [0, \infty) \to \R&lt;/math&gt;, and an arbitrary empirical risk function &lt;math&gt;E \colon (\mathcal{X} \times \R^2)^n \to \R \cup \lbrace \infty \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, then for any &lt;math&gt;f^{*} \in H_k&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;
 f^{*} = \operatorname{arg min}_{f \in H_k} \left\lbrace E\left( (x_1, y_1, f(x_1)), ..., (x_n, y_n, f(x_n)) \right) + g\left( \lVert f \rVert \right) \right \rbrace, \quad (*)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^{*}&lt;/math&gt; admits a representation of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;
 f^{*}(\cdot) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i k(\cdot, x_i),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \in \R&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''
Define a mapping

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \varphi \colon \mathcal{X} &amp;\to \R^{\mathcal{X} }\\
\varphi(x) &amp;= k(\cdot, x)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(so that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) = k(\cdot, x)&lt;/math&gt; is itself a map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} \to \R&lt;/math&gt;).  Since &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a reproducing kernel, then

:&lt;math&gt;
 \varphi(x)(x') = k(x', x) = \langle \varphi(x'), \varphi(x) \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the inner product on &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Given any &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt;, one can use orthogonal projection to decompose any &lt;math&gt;f \in H_k&lt;/math&gt; into a sum of two functions, one lying in &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{span} \left \lbrace \varphi(x_1), ..., \varphi(x_n) \right \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, and the other lying in the orthogonal complement:

:&lt;math&gt;
 f = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i) + v,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle v, \varphi(x_i) \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

The above orthogonal decomposition and the [[Reproducing kernel Hilbert space#The Reproducing Property|reproducing property]] together show that applying &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to any training point &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; produces

:&lt;math&gt;
 f(x_j) = \left \langle \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i) + v, \varphi(x_j) \right \rangle = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \langle \varphi(x_i), \varphi(x_j) \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;

which we observe is independent of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently, the value of the empirical risk &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in (*) is likewise independent of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.  For the second term (the regularization term), since &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is strictly monotonic, we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 g\left( \lVert f \rVert \right) &amp;= g \left(  \lVert \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i) + v \rVert \right) \\
&amp;= g \left( \sqrt{  \lVert \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i)  \rVert^2 + \lVert v \rVert^2} \right) \\
&amp;\ge g \left(  \lVert \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i) \rVert \right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore setting &lt;math&gt;v = 0&lt;/math&gt; does not affect the first term of (*), while it strictly decreasing the second term.  Consequently, any minimizer &lt;math&gt;f^{*}&lt;/math&gt; in (*) must have &lt;math&gt;v = 0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., it must be of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
 f^{*}(\cdot) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i \varphi(x_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i k(\cdot, x_i),
&lt;/math&gt;

which is the desired result.

==Generalizations==
The Theorem stated above is a particular example of a family of results that are collectively referred to as "representer theorems"; here we describe several such.

The first statement of a representer theorem was due to Kimeldorf and Wahba for the special case in which

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E\left( (x_1, y_1, f(x_1)), ...,  (x_n, y_n, f(x_n)) \right) &amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (f(x_i) - y_i)^2, \\
g(\lVert f \rVert) &amp;= \lambda \lVert f \rVert^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Schölkopf, Herbrich, and Smola generalized this result by relaxing the assumption of the squared-loss cost and allowing the regularizer to be any strictly monotonically increasing function &lt;math&gt;g(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; of the Hilbert space norm.

It is possible to generalize further by augmenting the regularized empirical risk function through the addition of unpenalized offset terms.  For example, Schölkopf, Herbrich, and Smola also consider the minimization

:&lt;math&gt;
 \tilde{f}^{*} = \operatorname{arg min} \left\lbrace E\left( (x_1, y_1, \tilde{f}(x_1)),  ...,  (x_n, y_n, \tilde{f}(x_n)) \right) + g\left( \lVert f \rVert \right) \mid \tilde{f} = f  + h \in H_k \oplus  \operatorname{span} \lbrace \psi_p \mid 1 \le p \le M \rbrace  \right \rbrace, \quad (\dagger)
&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., we consider functions of the form &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f} = f + h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f \in H_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is an unpenalized function lying in the span of a finite set of real-valued functions &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \psi_p \colon \mathcal{X} \to \R \mid 1 \le p \le M \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;.  Under the assumption that the &lt;math&gt;m \times M&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\left( \psi_p(x_i) \right)_{ip}&lt;/math&gt; has rank &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, they show that the minimizer &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;
admits a representation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
 \tilde{f}^{*}(\cdot) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i k(\cdot, x_i) + \sum_{p = 1}^M \beta_p \psi_p(\cdot)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i, \beta_p \in \R&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\beta_p&lt;/math&gt; are all uniquely determined.

The conditions under which a representer theorem exists were investigated by Argyriou, Miccheli, and Pontil, who proved the following:

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty set, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; a positive-definite real-valued kernel on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; with corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;R \colon H_k \to \R&lt;/math&gt; be a differentiable regularization function.  Then given a training sample &lt;math&gt;(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n) \in \mathcal{X} \times \R&lt;/math&gt; and an arbitrary empirical risk function &lt;math&gt;E \colon (\mathcal{X} \times \R^2)^m \to \R \cup \lbrace \infty \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, a minimizer

:&lt;math&gt;
f^{*} =  \operatorname{arg min}_{f \in H_k} \left\lbrace E\left( (x_1, y_1, f(x_1)), ...,  (x_n, y_n, f(x_n)) \right) + R(f) \right \rbrace \quad (\ddagger)
&lt;/math&gt;

of the regularized empirical risk minimization problem admits a representation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
 f^{*}(\cdot) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i k(\cdot, x_i),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \in \R&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if there exists a nondecreasing function &lt;math&gt;h \colon [0, \infty) \to \R&lt;/math&gt; for which

:&lt;math&gt;
R(f) = h(\lVert f \rVert).
&lt;/math&gt;

Effectively, this result provides a necessary and sufficient condition on a differentiable regularizer &lt;math&gt;R(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; under which the corresponding regularized empirical risk minimization &lt;math&gt;(\ddagger)&lt;/math&gt; will have a representer theorem.  In particular, this shows that a broad class of regularized risk minimizations (much broader than those originally considered by Kimeldorf and Wahba) have representer theorems.

==Applications==
Representer theorems are useful from a practical standpoint because they dramatically simplify the regularized empirical risk minimization problem &lt;math&gt;(\ddagger)&lt;/math&gt;.  In most interesting applications, the search domain &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt; for the minimization will be an infinite-dimensional subspace of &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathcal{X})&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore the search (as written) does not admit implementation on finite-memory and finite-precision computers.  In contrast, the representation of &lt;math&gt;f^{*}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; afforded by a representer theorem reduces the original (infinite-dimensional) minimization problem to a search for the optimal &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector of coefficients &lt;math&gt;\alpha = (\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n) \in \R^n&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can then be obtained by applying any standard function minimization algorithm.  Consequently, representer theorems provide the theoretical basis for the reduction of the general machine learning problem to algorithms that can actually be implemented on computers in practice.

'''Satirical hip hop''' (also known as '''[[Internet meme|meme]] rap''')&lt;ref name="Know Your Meme"&gt;[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/satirical-hip-hop-meme-rap], [[Know Your Meme]]: "Satirical Hip Hop / Meme Rap".&lt;/ref&gt; is a subgenre of [[hip hop music]] done in a [[sarcastic]], [[parodic]], or [[tongue in cheek]] way.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snobsmusic.net/2011/01/kemo-treats-do-satirical-hip-hop-like.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1502506.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Satirical hip hop in many ways is a [[parody]] and a [[criticism]] of the whole genre of hip hop, but more specifically to subgenres like [[gangsta rap]], [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap rap]], and [[mumble rap]]. According to [[Know Your Meme]], the genre was created with the intent of becoming viral. Some common characteristics of satirical hip hop include [[lo-fi]] production, simplistic music videos, lazy rhymes, and intentionally stereotypical lyrics/topics.&lt;ref name="Know Your Meme" /&gt; Another major characteristic associated with meme rap is the use of [[Alter ego|alternate personas]], which is also a staple in comedy. Internet personality [[George Miller (entertainer)|George "Joji" Miller]] (better known as Filthy Frank), for example, occasionally performed under the alter ego "Pink Guy," a main character in his now-defunct ''Filthy Frank'' YouTube series. The character of Pink Guy is known for performing many absurdist [[comedy rap]] songs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==History and examples==

The earliest example of satirical hip hop can be traced back to the works of [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], who has made parody tracks of popular hip hop songs since the [[1990s (decade)|1990s]]. Another early example is with Southern California-based rapper [[Afroman]], with his two well-known tracks "[[Crazy Rap]]" and "[[Because I Got High]]," both released in 2001, featuring comedic lyrics.

In 2008, Odd Future members Tyler, the Creator and Jasper Dolphin released [[I Smell Panties#I Smell Panties EP|the sole EP]] under their short-lived comedy group name "I Smell Panties."&lt;ref&gt;[https://oddfuture.bandcamp.com/album/i-smell-panties], Bandcamp link for the "I Smell Panties" EP.&lt;/ref&gt; The duo utilized elements of gangsta rap and [[Southern hip hop]] in a satirical way when performing as I Smell Panties. Tyler then released a track in 2011 called "Come Through Looking Clean", a joke song performed under a character named "Young Nigga." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rap-up.com/2011/09/23/odd-future-drops-debut-single-from-new-artist-young-nigga/], Rap-Up.&lt;/ref&gt; It's a parody of the "Bling Era" of hip hop that was popular during the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] and draws heavy inspiration from the music of [[Lil B]]. The Young Nigga character would later be re-used on various skits in the 2012 [[Adult Swim]] program [[Loiter Squad]], which was created by and starred members of Odd Future. In February 2016, Tyler revealed that his 2011 breakout viral single "[[Yonkers (song)|Yonkers]]" was made as a joke song attempting to parody the style of [[East Coast hip hop|New York rappers]] (hence the title of "Yonkers").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tyler, the Creator: "Yonkers" Was Made As a Joke|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/63619-tyler-the-creator-yonkers-was-made-as-a-joke/|website=Pitchfork|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan-based Internet celebrity and rapper [[Rucka Rucka Ali]] became famous in the late 2000s/early 2010s for creating pop song parodies (including parodies of popular hip hop songs) containing lyrics for [[shock value]]. He often includes juvenile references to [[ethnic stereotypes]], topical subject matter, and [[Black comedy|dark humor]]. His music also tends to make use of comedic portrayals of celebrities in the same vein to the animated comedy series ''[[South Park]]'', and his several alter egos espouses stereotypical qualities of specific ethnic groups; his alter egos include DJ Not Nice (Asian), Seymour Schwartz (Jewish), and Toby Queef (White-American [[redneck]]). Some critics have labeled Ali as a [[racist]] as a reaction to his songs, although his humor seems heavily influenced by mainstream comedy television shows, such as ''South Park'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', and has jokingly defended his brand of humor by claiming that he's "stating objective facts" when he references stereotypes in his songs.&lt;ref&gt;http://ruckasworld.com/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; His videos and [[YouTube]] channels are frequently removed (since he started creating music videos he has had 17 YouTube channels deleted for terms of service violations&lt;ref&gt;http://ruckasworld.com/&lt;/ref&gt;), but are [[Streisand effect|reuploaded by his fans]].

In the mid-2010s, Ryan Harryman, a [[San Jose State University]] student and member of [[San Jose State Spartans|the school's water polo club team]],&lt;ref name="The Mercury News"&gt;{{cite web|title=San Jose State student dies several days after water polo practice at campus pool|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/10/18/san-jose-state-student-dies-several-days-after-water-polo-practice-at-campus-pool/|website=The Mercury News|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a viral sensation on the Internet under the stage name "3PAC."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuwE5TDU8ANzIvqqSZcgUig], YouTube: 3PACTVHD.&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his self-produced music videos, bombastic and aggressive comedic rap songs, and [[diss tracks]] targeting mainstream rappers like [[Eminem]] and [[2 Chainz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/3pac], [[Know Your Meme]] page on 3PAC.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as YouTube gaming channel [[PewDiePie]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/3pac-pewdiepie-is-a-child-rapist-song-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "PewDiePie is a Child Rapist" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; 3PAC made a guest appearance on ''[[The New CALassic]]'', a comedy hip hop mixtape performed by Internet music critic [[The Needle Drop|Anthony Fantano]] (under his "Cal Chuchesta" alter ego) that was released in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theneedledrop.com/articles/2015/8/cal-chuchesta-the-new-calassic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite web|title=3Pac: To Live and Die on 4chan|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/3pac-ryan-harryman-profile-death-rapper|website=Spin Magazine|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harryman died at the age of 24 in October 2015 after suffering severe brain damage during a water polo practice.&lt;ref name="The Mercury News" /&gt;

The seventh track of underground rapper [[Hopsin]]'s 2015 album ''[[Pound Syndrome]]'', entitled "No Words", is a skit meant to both satirize and criticize the trend of [[mumble rap]] that was popular during that time, calling rappers (specifically to artists like [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Young Thug]], and [[Migos]]) who are a part of that subgenre "[[Intellectual disability|mentally retarded]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Hopsin-no-words-skit-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "No Words" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; and also mocking fans of mumble rap.

In 2017, [[YouTube]] personality [[George Miller (entertainer)|Filthy Frank]] released a music project titled ''[[Pink Season (Pink Guy album)|Pink Season]]'', the second album performed under the name "Pink Guy", with some songs poking fun at hip hop music as a whole, among other things. The track "Hand On My Gat" for example, features a character named PolitikZ that acts as a caricature for [[Hardcore hip hop|hardcore]] [[Underground hip hop|underground rappers]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Pink-guy-hand-on-my-gat-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "Hand On My Gat" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; that character's previous appearance was on the Filthy Frank video "BAD INTERNET RAPPERS" (uploaded in November 2014),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6iefP8lf3o], YouTube: "BAD INTERNET RAPPERS" by TVFilthyFrank.&lt;/ref&gt; where he performed a song called "Real Hip Hop" that directly parodied the stereotypical anti-mainstream and [[Political hip hop|politically charged]] attitudes of underground rappers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Politikz-real-hip-hop-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "REAL HIP HOP" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHYwprmWMfY], YouTube: "PolitikZ - 'REAL HIP HOP'" by TooDamnFilthy.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Pink Season'' album reached number one on the [[iTunes]] charts and peaked at 70 on the [[Billboard 200]].&lt;ref name="Billboard 200"&gt;{{cite web|title=Billboard 200|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/2017-01-28|website=Billboard|access-date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, nearly a month after the retirement of the "Filthy Frank" project,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pigeonsandplanes.com/news/2017/12/joji-quits-pink-guy-filthy-frank-comedy], [[Pigeons and Planes]]: "Joji Explains Decision to Quit Filthy Frank and Pink Guy as He Pursues Music Career."&lt;/ref&gt; George Miller returned to performing as Pink Guy to co-star in a music video made by Lil Toenail, a Florida-based meme rapper who performs with a giant foot costume and ski mask to maintain his anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpjwhH4Joio], YouTube: "Lil Toenail - Go Out (Official Music Video)"&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Internet personality and music critic [[The Needle Drop|Anthony Fantano]] began releasing more satirical hip hop tracks under his Cal Chuchesta alter ego, releasing the tracks "Coin Star"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B2NEVbP20&lt;/ref&gt; and "Don't Talk To Me."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqWi01SBfmw&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Banksia serrata2.jpg|thumb|right|Fire has triggered the opening of the [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]] and the release of seed in this ''[[Banksia serrata]]'' fruiting structure]]
'''Serotiny''' is an [[ecological]] adaptation exhibited by some [[seed plant]]s, in which seed release occurs in response to an environmental trigger, rather than spontaneously at seed maturation.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamont|first=B.|author2=Lemaitre, D. |author3=Cowling, R. |author4=Enright, N. |title=Canopy seed storage in woody-plants|journal=Botanical Review|year=1991|volume=57|issue=4|pages=277–317 |doi=10.1007/bf02858770}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common and best studied trigger is [[fire]]. However, the term ''serotiny'' refers more broadly to plants that release their seeds over a long period of time, irrespective of the trigger or whether release is spontaneous.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"/&gt; In this sense, the term is synonymous with [[bradyspory]].

Possible triggers include:
* Death of the parent plant or branch (necriscence, this death can be caused by fire)
* Wetting (hygriscence)
* Warming by the sun (soliscence)
* Drying atmospheric conditions (xeriscence)
* Fire (heat, essentially: pyriscence)
* Fire followed by wetting (pyrohydriscence)
Fire is the most common and best studied case.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"/&gt; Some plants may respond to more than one of these triggers. For example, ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'' exhibits primarily fire-mediated serotiny,&lt;ref name=Hernandez2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hernández-Serrano|first=A|author2=Verdú M. |author3=González-Martínez S.C. |author4=Pausas J.G. |title=Fire structures pine serotiny at different scales|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2013|doi=10.3732/ajb.1300182|url=http://www.uv.es/jgpausas/papers/Hernandez-2013-AmJBot-serotiny.pdf |volume=100 |pages=2349–2356 |pmid=24222682}}&lt;/ref&gt; but responds weakly to drying atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nathan|first=R|author2=Safriel, U. |author3=Noy-Meir, I. |author4=Schiller, G. |title=Seed release without fire in Pinus halepensis, a Mediterranean serotinous wind-dispersed tree|journal=Journal of Ecology|year=1999|volume=87|issue=4|pages=659–669 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00382.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sierras sequoias and some ''[[Banksia]]'' species are strongly serotinous with respect to fire, but also release some seed in response to plant or branch death.

Serotiny can occur in various degrees. Plants that retain all of their seed indefinitely in the absence of a trigger event are strongly serotinous. Plants that eventually release some of their seed spontaneously in the absence of a trigger are weakly serotinous. Finally, some plants release all of their seed spontaneously after a period of seed storage, but the occurrence of a trigger event curtails the seed storage period, causing all seed to be released immediately; such plants are essentially non-serotinous, or facultatively serotinous.

==Fire-mediated serotiny==
In the [[southern hemisphere]], fire-mediated serotiny is found in [[angiosperms]] in fire-prone parts of [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. It is extremely common in the [[Proteaceae]] of these areas, and also occurs in other taxa, such as ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' ([[Myrtaceae]]) and even exceptionally in ''[[Erica sessiliflora]]'' ([[Ericaceae]]). In the northern hemisphere, it is found in a range of [[conifer]] taxa, including species of ''[[Pinus]]'',&lt;ref name=He2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=T|author2=Pausas JG |author3=Belcher CM |author4=Schwilk DW |author5=Lamont BB. |title=Fire-adapted traits of Pinus arose in the fiery Cretaceous|journal=New Phytologist|year=2012|volume=194|pages=751–759|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04079.x|url=http://www.uv.es/jgpausas/papers/He-2012-NewPhytol_fire-adapted-Pinus.pdf |pmid=22348443}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cupressus]]'',  ''[[Sequoiadendron]]'', and more rarely ''[[Picea]]''.

Since even non-serotinous [[conifer cone|cones]] and woody [[fruits]] can provide protection from the heat of fire,&lt;ref name=Michaletz2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michaletz|first=ST|author2=Johnson EA |author3=Mell WE |author4=Greene DF|title=Timing of fire relative to seed development may enable non-serotinous species to recolonize from the aerial seed banks of fire-killed trees|journal=Biogeosciences|year=2013|volume=10|pages=5061–5078|doi=10.5194/bg-10-5061-2013|url=http://www.biogeosciences.net/10/5061/2013/bg-10-5061-2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pounden2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pounden|first=E|author2=Greene DF |author3=Michaletz ST |title=Non-serotinous woody plants behave as aerial seed bank species when a late-summer wildfire coincides with a mast year|journal=Ecology and Evolution|year=2014|volume=4|pages=3830–3840|doi=10.1002/ece3.1247|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1247/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the key adaptation of fire-induced serotiny is seed storage in a canopy seed bank, which can be released by fire.&lt;ref name=Lamont2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamont|first=BB|author2=Enright NJ|title=Adaptive advantages of aerial seed banks|journal=Plant Species Biology|year=2000|volume=15|pages=157–166|doi= 10.1046/j.1442-1984.2000.00036.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1442-1984.2000.00036.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire-release mechanism is commonly a [[resin]] that seals the fruit or cone scales shut, but which melts when heated.&lt;ref name=Beaufait1960&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beaufait|first=WR|title=Some Effects of High Temperatures on the Cones and Seeds of Jack Pine|journal=Forest Science|year=1960|volume=6|pages=194–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=EA|author2=Gutsell SL|title=Heat budget and fire behaviour associated with the opening of serotinous cones in two Pinus species|journal=Journal of Vegetation Science|year=1993|volume=4|pages=745–750|doi = 10.2307/3235610}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism is refined in some ''Banksia'' by the presence inside the [[follicle (fruit)|follicle]] of a winged [[seed separator]] which blocks the opening, preventing the seed from falling out. Thus the follicles open after fire, but seed release does not occur. As the cone dries, wetting by rain or humidity causes the cone scales to expand and reflex, promoting seed release.&lt;ref name=Dawson1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawson|first=C|author2=Vincent JFV |author3=Rocca A-M |title=How pine cones open|journal=Nature|year=1997|volume=390|pages=668–668|doi=10.1038/37745|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v390/n6661/abs/390668a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seed separator thus acts as a lever against the seeds, gradually prying them out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles. The effect of this adaptation is to ensure that seed release occurs not in response to fire, but in response to the onset of rains following fire. Flammability is also related to serotinous species such as Gamba Grass.

The relative importance of serotiny can vary among populations of the same plant species. For example, North American populations of lodgepole pine (''[[Pinus contorta]]'') can vary from being highly serotinous to having no serotiny at all, opening annually to release seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muir | first1 = P. S. | last2 = Lotan | first2 = J. E. | year = 1985 | title = Disturbance history and serotiny of Pinus contorta in western Montana | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 1658–1668 | doi=10.2307/1938028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different levels of cone serotiny have been linked to variations in the local fire regime: areas that experience more frequent crown-fire tend to have high rates of serotiny, while areas with infrequent crown-fire have low levels of serotiny.&lt;ref name=Hernandez2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoennagel | first1 = T. | last2 = Turner | first2 = M. G. | last3 = Romme | first3 = W. H. | year = 2003 | title = The influence of fire interval and serotiny on postfire lodgepole pine density in Yellowstone National Park | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 2967–2978 | doi=10.1890/02-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, herbivory of lodgepole pines can make fire-mediated serotiny less advantageous in a population. Red squirrels (''[[Red squirrel|Sciurus vulgaris]]'') and red crossbills (''[[Red crossbill|Loxia curvirostra]]'') will eat seeds, and so serotinous cones, which last in the canopy longer, are more likely to be chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benkman | first1 = C.W. | last2 = Holimon | first2 = W.C. | last3 = Smith | first3 = J.W. | year = 2001 | title = The influence of a competitor on the geographic mosaic of coevolution between crossbills and lodgepole pine | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 282–294 | doi = 10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[0282:TIOACO]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Talluto | first1 = M. V. | last2 = Benkman | first2 = C. W. | year = 2014 | title = Conflicting selection from fire and seed predation drives fine-scaled phenotypic variation in a widespread North American conifer | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 9543–9548 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1400944111 | pmc = 4084486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serotiny occurs less frequently in areas where this seed predation is common.

Pyriscence can be understood as an adaptation to an environment in which fires are regular, and in which post-fire environments offer the best germination and seedling survival rates. In Australia, for example, fire-mediated serotiny occurs in areas that are not only prone to regular fires, but also possess [[oligotrophic]] soils and a seasonally dry climate. This results in intense competition for nutrients and moisture, leading to very low seedling survival rates. The passage of fire, however, reduces competition by clearing out undergrowth, and results in an [[ash bed]] that temporarily increases soil nutrition; thus the survival rates of post-fire seedlings is greatly increased. Furthermore, releasing a large number of seeds at once, rather than gradually, increases the possibility that some of those seeds will escape predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradshaw|first=S. Don |author2=Kingsley W. Dixon |author3=Stephen D. Hopper |author4=Hans Lambers |author5=Shane R. Turner |title=Little evidence for fire-adapted plant traits in Mediterranean climate regions|journal=Trends in Plant Science|year=2011|volume=16|issue=2|pages=69–76|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2010.10.007|pmid=21095155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar pressures apply in Northern Hemisphere conifer forests, but in this case there is the further issue of [[allelopathic]] leaf litter, which suppresses seed germination. Fire clears out this litter, eliminating this obstacle to germination.

==Evolution==
Serotinous adaptations occur in at least 530 species in 40 genera, in multiple (paraphyletic) lineages.  Serotiny likely evolved separately in these species, but may in some cases have been lost by the related non-serotinous species.

In the genus ''Pinus'', serotiny likely evolved because of the atmospheric conditions during the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref name="He2012" /&gt; The atmosphere during the Cretaceous had higher oxygen and carbon dioxide levels than our atmosphere. Fire occurred more frequently than it does currently, and plant growth was high enough to create an abundance of flammable material. Many ''Pinus'' species adapted to this fire-prone environment with serotinous pine cones.

A set of conditions must be met in order for long-term seed storage to be evolutionarily viable for a plant:
* The plant must be phylogenetically able (pre-adapted) to develop the necessary reproductive structures
* The seeds must remain viable until cued to release
* Seed release must be cued by a trigger that indicates environmental conditions that are favorable to germination,
* The cue must occur on an average timescale that is within the reproductive lifespan of the plant
* The plant must have the capacity and opportunity to produce enough seeds prior to release to ensure population replacement&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"/&gt;
* Serotiny must be heritable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hernández-Serrano|first1=Ana|title=Heritability and quantitative genetic divergence of serotiny, a fire-persistence plant trait|journal=Annals of Botany|date=2014|volume=114|pages=571–577|doi=10.1093/aob/mcu142|url=http://www.uv.es/jgpausas/papers/Hernandez-2014-AnnBot_heritability-serotiny.pdf|pmid=25008363|pmc=4204669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Text Encoding Initiative''' ('''TEI''') is a [[written language|text-centric]] [[community of practice]] in the [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] of [[digital humanities]], operating continuously since the 1980s. The community currently runs a mailing list, meetings and conference series, and maintains an [[eponymous]] [[technical standard]], a [[Scientific journal|journal]], a [[wiki]], a [[GitHub]] repository and a [[toolchain]].

==TEI guidelines==

The ''TEI Guidelines'', which collectively define an XML format, are the defining output of the community of practice. The format differs from other well-known [[open formats]] for text (such as [[HTML]] and [[OpenDocument]]) in that it's primarily semantic rather than presentational; the semantics and interpretation of every tag and attribute are specified.
Some 500 different textual components and concepts
(&lt;tt&gt;word&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-w.html|title=Element w (word)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;sentence&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-s.html|title=Element s (s-unit)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;character&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-c.html|title=Element c (character)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-g.html|title=Element g (character or glyph)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;person&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-person.html|title=Element person (person)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
etc.); each is grounded in one or more academic discipline and examples are given.

===Technical details===

The standard is split into two parts, a discursive textual description with extended examples and discussion and set of tag-by-tag definitions. Schemata in most of the modern formats ([[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[RELAX NG]] and [[W3C Schema]]) are generated automatically from the tag-by-tag definitions. A number of tools support the production of the guidelines and the application of the guidelines to specific projects.

A number of special tags are used to circumvent restrictions imposed by the underlying [[Unicode]]; &lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt; to allow representation of characters that don't qualify for Unicode inclusion&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; to allow overcome the required strict linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html|title=Element choice  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most users of the format do not use the complete range of tags but produce a customisation, using a project-specific subset of the tags and attributes defined by the Guidelines. The TEI defines a sophisticated customization mechanism known as ODD for this purpose. In addition to documenting and describing each TEI tag, an ODD specification specifies its content model and other usage constraints, which may be expressed using [[schematron]].

''TEI Lite'' is an  example of such a customization. It defines an [[XML]]-based [[file format]] for exchanging texts.  It is a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements available in the full TEI Guidelines.

===Examples===

The text of the TEI guidelines is rich in examples. There is also a samples page on the TEI wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Samples_of_TEI_texts |title=Samples of TEI texts |work=wiki.tei-c.org |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives examples of real-world projects which expose their underlying TEI.

====Prose tags====

TEI allows texts to be marked up syntactically at any level of granularity, or mixture of granularities. For example, this paragraph (p) has been marked up into sentences (s) and clauses (cl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILCW |title=17 Simple Analytic Mechanisms - TEI P5: — Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;

 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It was about the beginning of September, 1664,
  &lt;cl&gt;that I, among the rest of my neighbours,
       heard in ordinary discourse
   &lt;cl&gt;that the plague was returned again to Holland; &lt;/cl&gt;
   &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;for it had been very violent there, and particularly at
     Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;whither, &lt;cl&gt;they say,&lt;/cl&gt; it was brought,
  &lt;cl&gt;some said&lt;/cl&gt; from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods
  &lt;cl&gt;which were brought home by their Turkey fleet;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;others said it was brought from Candia;
     others from Cyprus. &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It mattered not &lt;cl&gt;from whence it came;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;but all agreed &lt;cl&gt;it was come into Holland again.&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Verse====

TEI has tags for marking up verse. This example (taken from the French translation of the TEI Guidelines) shows a sonnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/fr/html/ref-lg |title=TEI element lg (groupe de vers) |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;div type="sonnet"&gt;
 &lt;lg type="quatrain"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Les amoureux fervents et les savants austères&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Aiment également, dans leur mûre saison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Les chats puissants et doux, orgueil de la maison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Qui comme eux sont frileux et comme eux sédentaires.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="quatrain"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Amis de la science et de la volupté&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Ils cherchent le silence et l'horreur des ténèbres ;&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; L'Érèbe les eût pris pour ses coursiers funèbres,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; S'ils pouvaient au servage incliner leur fierté.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="tercet"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Ils prennent en songeant les nobles attitudes&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Des grands sphinx allongés au fond des solitudes,&lt;/l&gt;

 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="tercet"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Leurs reins féconds sont pleins d'étincelles magiques,&lt;/l&gt;

  &lt;l&gt;Étoilent vaguement leurs prunelles mystiques.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Choice tag====

The &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; tag is used to represent sections of text which might be encoded or tagged in more than one possible way. In the following example, based on one in the standard, &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; is used twice, once to indicate an original and a corrected year and once to indicate an original and regularised spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html |title=TEI element &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;p xml:id="p23"&gt;Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above
articles, the said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of
meat and drink sufficient for the support of &lt;choice&gt;
  &lt;sic&gt;1724&lt;/sic&gt;
  &lt;corr&gt;1728&lt;/corr&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt; of our subjects,
with free access to our royal person, and other marks of our
&lt;choice&gt;
  &lt;orig&gt;favour&lt;/orig&gt;
  &lt;reg&gt;favor&lt;/reg&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt;.

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Tools generate [[Internationalization and localization|localised and internationalised]] [[HTML]], [[ePub]], or [[PDF]] human-readable output and [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]s, [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax machine-readable output.

The Roma web application&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/ Roma web application].&lt;/ref&gt; is built around the ODD format and can use it to  generate schemas in [[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax formats, as used by many XML validation tools and services.

ODD is the format used internally by the Text Encoding Initiative for their [[eponymous]] [[Technical Standards and Safety Authority|technical standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2007|editor1-first=Lou|editor1-last=Burnard|editor2-first=Syd|editor2-last=Bauman|title=TEI P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange|publisher=TEI Consortium|location=Charlottesville, Virginia, USA|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ODD files generally describe the difference between a customized XML format and the full TEI model, ODD also can be used to describe XML formats that are entirely separate from the TEI.  One example of this is the [[W3C| W3C's]] [[Internationalization Tag Set]] which uses the ODD format to generate schemas and document its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/its/ W3C ITS] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/its/itstagset.xml TEI ODD file].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Best Practices for XML Internationalization|editor1-last=Savourel|editor1-first=Yves|editor2-last=Kosek|editor2-first=Jirka|editor3-last=Ishida|editor3-first=Richard|publisher=W3C Working Group|year=2008|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-i18n-bp/|contribution=5.2 ITS and TEI}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==TEI customizations==

TEI customizations are specializations of the TEI XML specification for use in particular fields or by specific communities.

* [[EpiDoc]] (Epigraphic Documents)
* [http://www.cei.lmu.de/ Charters Encoding Initiative]
* [http://www.menota.org/ Medieval Nordic Text Archive (Menota)]

Customization in the TEI is done through the ODD mechanism mentioned above. In truth since its P5 version, all so-called 'TEI Conformant' uses of the TEI Guidelines are based on a TEI customization documented in a TEI ODD file. Even when users choose one of the off-the-shelf pre-generated schemas to validate against, these have been created from freely available customization files.

==Projects==
The format is used by many projects worldwide. Practically all projects are associated with one or more universities. Some well-known projects that encode texts using TEI include:

==History==
Prior to the creation of TEI, humanities scholars had no common standards for encoding electronic texts in a manner which would serve their academic goals ([[Susan Hockey|Hockey]] 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;41).  In 1987, a group of scholars representing fields in humanities, linguistics, and computing convened at Vassar College to put forth a set of guidelines known as the “Poughkeepsie Principles”. These guidelines directed the development of the first TEI standard, "P1"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahronheim|first=J.R.|title=Descriptive metadata: Emerging standards.|journal=Journal of Academic Librarianship|year=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantara |first=L.|title=The text-encoding initiative: Part 1|journal=OCLC Systems &amp; Services|year=2005|volume=21|issue=1|pages=36–39|doi=10.1108/10650750510578136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1987''' Work on what would become the TEI started by  the  [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ach.org/ ach.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]], and the [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Historical background", [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AB.html#ABTEI section iv.2] of TEI P5:  Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange.&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the ''Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/SC/teipcp1.txt |title= Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference |work=tei-c.org |year=2009 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''1994''' TEI P3 released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/|title=TEI Guidelines|accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  co-edited by  Lou Burnard (at [[Oxford University]]) and [[Michael Sperberg-McQueen]] (then at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], later at the [[W3C]]).
* '''1999''' TEI P3 updated.
* '''2002''' TEI P4 released, moving from SGML to XML; adoption of [[Unicode]], which XML parsers are required to support.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=XML Basics|chapter=2|url=http://www.xmlnews.org/docs/xml-basics.html |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2007''' TEI P5 released, including integration with the &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xml:id&lt;/code&gt; attributes from the W3C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)|work=w3.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (these had previously been attributes in the TEI namespace), regularization of local pointing attributes to use the hash (as used in HTML) and unification of the ptr and xptr tags. Together these changes with many more new additions make P5 more regular and bring it closer to current xml practice as promoted by the [[W3C]] and as used by other XML variants. Maintenance and feature update versions of TEI P5 have been released at least twice a year since 2007.
* '''2011''' TEI P5 v2.0.1 released with support for [[Genetic editing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-2.0.1.html |title=P5 version 2.0.1 release notes |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (among many other additions the [[Genetic editing]] features allow encoding of texts without interpretation as to their specific semantics.)

The '''Thawri''' (Arabic:الثوري) [[Madhhab]] was a short lived school of [[Fiqh|Islamic Jurisprudence]]. Its founder was [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Sufyan Al-Thawri]], a great 8th Century [[alim|scholar]], jurist and hadith compiler.&lt;ref name=Judd&gt;Steven C. Judd, “Competitive hagiography in biographies of al-Awzaʿi and Sufyan al-Thawri”, Journal of the American Oriental Society 122:1 (Jan–March, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Ath-Thawri's]] move to Basra later in his life, his jurisprudential thought ([[Usul al-fiqh|usul]]) became more closely aligned to that of the [[Umayyads]] and of [[al-Awza'i|Al-Azwa'i]].&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt;

He spent the last year of his life hiding after a dispute between him and the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mahdi|Muhammad Ibn Mansur Al-Mahdi]]. After his death, the Thawri [[Madhhab]] was taken up by his students, including notably Yahya al-Qattan.&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt; However, his school did not survive, but his jurisprudential thought and especially hadith transmission are highly regarded in Islam, and have influenced all the major [[madh'hab|schools]].

'''''The Occult World''''' is a book originally published in 1881 in London; it was compiled by a member of the [[Theosophical Society]] [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]].{{sfn|Formats and editions}} It was the first [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] work by the author; according to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]], this book "gave sensational publicity to [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] [[Paranormal|phenomena]]" and the [[Mahatma Letters|letters]] from the [[mahatma]]s, and drew the attention of the London [[Society for Psychical Research]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Kuhn]] wrote that this book by Sinnett "was the first direct statement to the West of the existence of the [[mahatma|Masters]] and their activity as sponsors for the Theosophical Society." In his opinion, the author convincingly took over the major objective of confirming the "surpassing knowledge and sublime wisdom" of these "supermen."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=151}}}}

== History of compilation and publication ==
In September and October 1880 [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] visited Sinnett at [[Simla]].{{refn|group=note|P. Washington wrote that Blavatsky had been in sincere friendship with Sinnett and his wife Patience.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 3}}}} Sinnett expressed serious interest in the work and teachings of the Theosophical Society, and it prompted Blavatsky help him into contact and correspondence with two [[adept]]s who sponsored the Society, the mahatmas [[Kuthumi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].{{sfn|Theowiki}}{{refn|group=note|Goodrick-Clarke wrote that "the very concept of the Masters" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel Olcott claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} He was able to gather the material for his first theosophical book, which was based mostly on his notes of Blavatsky's [[occult]] work, and which "made her name widely known, though it contained nothing from her pen."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}

In the second half of 1880, Anglo-Indian newspaper [[The Pioneer (newspaper)|''The Pioneer'']] published several individual and collective reports of witnesses of Blavatsky's occult phenomena, in particular on 7 November 1880 a report which was written by Sinnett himself.{{sfn|Hanson|1980|loc=Ch. V}} In 1881, he incorporated these reports into his book. In February 1881 Kuthumi, writing that he is interested in Sinnett's book and its success, gave permission to use his letters: "I lay no restrictions upon your making use of anything I may have written to you..., having full confidence in your tact and judgment as to what should be printed and how it should be presented."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 8}} In March 1881 the Sinnetts went on vacation to England, expecting to find a publisher for ''The Occult World.''{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=18}}{{refn|group=note|1 March 1881 Kuthumi wished Sinnett to return from Europe "with a good book" in his hand.{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 107}}}} The book was published in June 1881 during the author's stay in London. In July 1881 Sinnett returned to India, and on the next day after the arrival he received a letter in which Kuthumi congratulated him on the publication.{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=19}} Kuthumi wrote: "When the first hum and ding-dong of adverse criticism is hushed, thoughtful men will read and ponder over the book."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 9}}

The book is dedicated by author "to '''the Mahatma [[Koot Hoomi]]''' whose gracious friendship has given the present writer his title to claim the attention of the European world."{{sfn|Sinnett|1895}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=90}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult philosophy ===
The book begins with the author's allegation that there is a school of thought which modern culture has forgotten, and that the metaphysics, and to a large degree the present physical science, "have been groping for centuries blindly after knowledge which occult philosophy has enjoyed in full measure all the while." Sinnett takes the liberty to express his belief that his knowledge is certainly true.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=152}} He argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I have come into some contact with persons who are heirs of a greater knowledge concerning the mysteries of Nature and humanity than modern culture has yet evolved... Modern science has accomplished grand results by the open method of investigation, and is very impatient of the theory that persons who ever attained to real knowledge, either in sciences or metaphysics, could have been content to hide their light under a bushel... But there is no need to construct hypotheses in the matter. The facts are accessible if they are sought for in the right way."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=2–4|Kuhn|1992|2p=152}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sinnett explains that "the ultimate development" of an occultist requires him to comply with "absolute physical purity." The candidate is obliged from the beginning to provide evidence that he is willing to comply with this requirement. Throughout the trial period, he should observe complete celibacy, and to refrain from all physical pleasures. However, this way of life does not presuppose any particular rigid discipline or hard asceticism, or "withdrawal from the world."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=153}} The author says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There would be nothing to prevent a gentleman in ordinary society from being in some of the preliminary stages of training for occult candidature without anybody about him being the wiser. For true occultism, the sublime achievement of the real adept, is not attained through the loathsome asceticism of the ordinary Indian fakir, the ''[[yogi]]'' of the woods and wilds, whose dirt accumulates with his sanctity—of the fanatic who fastens iron hooks into his flesh, or holds up an arm until it is withered."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=26–27|Kuhn|1992|2pp=153–154}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult correspondence ===
On 29 September 1880 during an evening walk with Mrs. Sinnett, Blavatsky, responding to the suddenly expressed desire of her companion to get a little note from one of the [[Mahatma|"Brothers"]], tore off a corner of a letter received that day, and held it in her hand until it disappeared. Then Blavatsky asked her to specify where there should be a note. Mrs. Sinnett pointed to a tree, and then among its branches, she found the same corner of the paper, but now it contained a brief message written in English and signed in Tibetan symbols.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=61–63|Kuhn|1992|2p=80}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. IV}}{{sfn|Olcott|2011|pp=231–232}}&lt;br/&gt;According to Barborka, this note was the first message of the mahatmas, which had come in response to an oral request, and after it Sinnett decided to write his first letter to the "Unknown Brother."{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. IV}}{{refn|group=note|This note is stored in the department of rare manuscripts of the [[British Library]]. Barborka wrote: "The folds of the paper and holes made when the note was pinned onto the twig are clearly visible."{{sfn|Barborka|1973|p=18}}}} The author says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One day, therefore, I asked Madame Blavatsky whether if I wrote a letter to one of the Brothers explaining my views, she could get it delivered for me. I hardly thought this was probable, as I knew how very unapproachable the Brothers generally are; but as she said that at any rate she would try, I wrote a letter, addressing it 'to the Unknown Brother', and gave it to her to see if any result would ensue. It was a happy inspiration that induced me to do this, for out of that small beginning has arisen the most interesting correspondence in which I have ever been privileged to engage."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=92–93|Barborka|1973|2p=59}}{{refn|group=note|[[Olav Hammer|Hammer]] noted that between 1880 and 1884 Sinnett received from the mahatmas circa one hundred twenty letters.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=381}} Kuhn wrote: "Sinnett was the channel of transmission, and to him the two Masters sent a long series of letters on philosophical and other subjects, they themselves remaining in the background."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=154}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult phenomena ===
During Blavatsky's first visit to the Sinnetts' house at [[Allahabad]], they were able to observe, in addition to the raps, one more phenomenon. For a few days they had gone with their guest to Benares, where they had settled at a house which had been lent by the maharaja of Vizianagaram. One evening after dinner, they sat in the great hall of the house. "Suddenly three or four flowers – cut roses – fell" right between them.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1p=51|Kuhn|1992|2p=80}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{refn|group=note|[[René Guénon|Guénon]] wrote that the many theosophical phenomena can be found in a book by Sinnett ''The Occult World,'' which mentions the following things: "knocking at will, tingling of invisible bells, the carrying and 'materialization' of all sorts of objects, and above all, 'precipitation' of letters sent by 'astral' means."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}}}}

At Simla a picnic was planned, and a group of six men had intended to go into the forest. The supplies were designed for six men, but a seventh person suddenly joined the group. In preparation for the midday meal, the lack of a coffee cup and saucer was revealed. Someone jestingly suggested to Blavatsky to materialize the additional cup. Blavatsky held a "mental conversation" with one of her outlying "Brothers" and then pointed to a specific place, overgrown with grass and bushes. One of the participants began to dig there with a knife. After some time a white object was found, which was a tea-cup, and near it was a saucer, and as such they were no different from the other six cups and saucers brought from the Sinnetts' house. Plant roots around the utensils were found intact, and it has reportedly been proved that no one pre-dug there. When Mrs. Sinnett reached the house she counted the cups and saucers of this design and found one extra cup and saucer. However, it was impossible to buy such utensils at Simla.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=66–68|Kuhn|1992|2pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|p=158}}{{refn|group=note|Olcott stated about the phenomenon with a tea-cup: "To complete this part of my narrative, I will state that Mrs. Sinnett and I, reaching the house first, on the return of our party, went straight to the butler's pantry, and found the three other cups of the nine which she had left of the original dozen, put away on an upper shelf with their handles broken, and otherwise dilapidated. The seventh cup produced at the picnic had, therefore, not formed pan {{sic}} of her broken set."{{sfn|Olcott|2011|p=234}}}}{{refn|group=note|It should be noted that Sinnett's reports on Blavatsky's phenomena at Simla "were the cause of much of the misunderstanding and suffering she had to endure for the rest of her life."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}} Nonetheless, [[Manly Palmer Hall|Hall]] stated: "Madam Blavatsky's greatest 'miracles' are her books, and by her writings she is elevated far beyond the reach of her calumniators. Her literary accomplishments and not materialized tea-cups are the hallmark of her genius."{{sfn|Hall|1931|p=92}}}}&lt;br/&gt; This outing had one more event, when it turned out that they could not make coffee because all the water bottles were empty, and the water in the nearest stream was dirty. Their servants, sent to the brewery, were unable to get water. Then Blavatsky put the empty bottle into one of the baskets, and then pulled it out, already filled with clean water.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=73–74|Kuhn|1992|2p=82}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{refn|group=note|The major disciple of Kuthumi known as the [[Djwal Khul|"Disinherited"]] made a postscript to the letter of his Master: "The bottle filled with water I filled with my own hand—was one of the four only that the servants had in the baskets."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 8}}}}

During another outing occurred the "incident with pillow." Blavatsky turned to Sinnett with the question of where he would like to find a thing that Kuthumi is going to send. Sinnett decided to choose the most inconvenient place and pointed to one of several cushions, but at the insistence of his wife, he chose another. Once the firmly sewn pillow was ripped, they found among the feathers a note from Kuthumi and the brooch, which Mrs. Sinnett left at home.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=109–111|Kuhn|1992|2p=83}}{{sfn|Melton|2001}}{{sfn|Barborka|1973|loc=Ch. X}}{{refn|group=note|"The skilled occultist is able to shift his consciousness from one to another plane of manifestation. In short, his control over the vibrational energies of the [[Akasha]] makes him veritably lord of all the physical creation."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=153}}}}

"While the letters [from the mahatmas] are the most valuable portion of the book," the most likely cause of its widespread popularity was the occult phenomena described by the author, which he observed personally.{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}{{refn|group=note|Lavoie wrote that ''The Occult World'' contains a description of the various phenomena, which were performed by Blavatsky in the presence of the author.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=33}} [[K. Paul Johnson|Johnson]] noted that while staying in the author's home, Blavatsky "performed an astounding series of paranormal phenomena" which were reported in ''The Occult World.''{{sfn|Johnson|1995|p=21}}}}

== Criticism ==
[[René Guénon|Guénon]] wrote that Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophism]] known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}} In the [[Hodgson Report]] Blavatsky's phenomena described in the book by Sinnett are discussed in a section "''The Occult World'' Phenomena".{{sfn|Hodgson|1885|pp=256–273}} At the end of this section, [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Hodgson]] claimed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think I am justified in saying that the phenomena relied upon by Mr. Sinnett in ''The Occult World'' can be accounted for much more satisfactorily than can the performances of any ordinary professional conjurer by the uninitiated observer, however acute; that the additional details which I have been enabled to furnish in connection with some of the incidents Mr. Sinnett has recorded, clearly show that he has not been in the habit of exercising due caution for the exclusion of trickery; and that he has not proceeded in accordance with those 'scientific modes of investigation' which he explicitly declares (''Occult World,'' p. 35) he regarded as necessary for the task he attempted."{{sfn|Hodgson|1885|p=273}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Vsevolod Solovyov|Solovyov]] (with irony in relation to Sinnett) stated that from the analysis of the phenomena described in ''The Occult World'' in the Hodgson Report, "we can draw a conclusion: what a 'serious and honest' ''researcher'' we are dealing with in the case of Mr. Sinnett, this 'famous apostle' of the modern Theosophy and main defender of H. P. Blavatsky."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1893|p=158}} Nevertheless, according to Goodrick-Clarke, "a thorough analysis of the Hodgson Report by [[Vernon Harrison]] of the SPR effectively demolished... the conclusions of the Report."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=14}}{{See also|Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky#Criticism}}

An American [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] [[Henry Kiddle]] addressed in 1883 in a London spiritualist magazine ''[[Light (spiritualist journal)|Light]]'' letter to the editor,{{sfn|Neff|2003|loc=Ch. X}} in which he said that after reading Sinnett's book ''The Occult World,'' he was "very greatly surprised,"{{sfn|Kiddle|1883}} when he discovered that one of Kuthumi's letters published in the book contains text which "was for the most part quite simply the copy of a lecture," which he made at Lake Pleasant 15 August 1880,{{sfnm|Guénon|2004|1p=40|Lavoie|2012|2p=253}} and published the same month in ''[[Banner of Light]].'' In this connection, Kiddle asked: "As Mr. Sinnett's book did not appear till a considerable time afterwards (about a year, I think), it is certain that I did not quote, consciously or unconsciously, from its pages. How, then, did it get into Kuthumi's mysterious letter?"{{sfn|Kiddle|1883}}&lt;br/&gt;
According to Guénon, "the Professor Kiddle incident" was the first strike to hit the Theosophical Society overtly. He wrote that Sinnett has presented in the fourth edition of ''The Occult World'' "a rather awkward explanation," which came from Kuthumi himself.{{refn|group=note|In December 1883 Sinnett received from the mahatma a clarification on the matter,{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 93}} and it was published in an appendix to the fourth edition of ''The Occult World''.}} Kuthumi stated that what looked like plagiarism was due to the awkwardness and carelessness of a pupil. The "Master" was forced to admit that he was negligent when he allowed his letter to be sent without checking and correction.{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=51}} He has written so:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The letter in question was framed by me while on a journey and on horseback. It was dictated mentally in the direction of and precipitated by a young ''chela'' not yet expert at this branch of psychic chemistry, and who had to transcribe it from the hardly visible imprint. Half of it, therefore, was omitted, and the other half more or less distorted by the 'artist'. When asked by him at the time whether I would look over and correct it, I answered—imprudently, I confess—'Anyhow will do, my boy; it is of no great importance if you skip a few words.' I was physically very tired by a ride of forty-eight hours consecutively, and (physically again) half asleep. Besides this, I had very important business to attend to psychically, and therefore little remained of me to devote to that letter. When I awoke I found it had already been sent on, and as I was not then anticipating its publication, I never gave it from that time a thought... Yet had I dictated my letter in the form it now appears in print, it would certainly look suspicious, and however far from what is generally called plagiarism, yet in the absence of any inverted commas it would lay a foundation for censure. But I did nothing of the kind, as the original impression now before me clearly shows."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1895|1pp=212–213|Lavoie|2012|2p=254}}{{refn|group=note|"When a Mr. Henry Kiddle, an American lecturer on Spiritualism, accused the writer of the Mahatma Letters of having plagiarized whole passages from his lecture delivered at Mt. Pleasant, New York, in 1880, a year prior to the publication of ''The Occult World'', the Master [[Kuthumi|K.H.]] explained in a letter to Mr. Sinnett that the apparent forgery of words and ideas came about through a bit of carelessness on his part in the precipitation of his ideas through a chela. While dictating the letter to the latter, he had caught himself 'listening in' on Mr. Kiddle's address being delivered at the moment in America; and as a consequence the chela took down portions of the actual lecture as reflected from the mind of K.H."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=157}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5927">'''Thorngate's postulate of commensurate complexity''',&lt;ref name="Weick01"/&gt; also referred to as '''Thorngate's impostulate of theoretical simplicity'''&lt;ref name=Weick03/&gt; is the description of a phenomenon in [[social science]] theorizing. [[Karl E. Weick]] maintains that research in the field of social psychology can – at any one time – achieve only two of the three [[Metatheory|meta-theoretical]] virtues of "Generality", "Accuracy" and "Simplicity." One of these aspects therefore must always be subordinated to the others.&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt; The postulate is named for the Canadian social psychologist Warren Thorngate of the [[University of Alberta]], whose work is quoted by Weick.&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"/&gt;

Thorngate described the problem this way: 
{{Quotation|'“In order to increase both ''generality'' and ''accuracy'', the ''complexity'' of our theories must necessarily be increased.”&lt;ref name=Weick03/&gt;}}

== Background ==
The postulate was a response to the debate among sociologists – mainly between [[Kenneth J. Gergen]]&lt;ref name="Gergen73"/&gt; and [[Barry R. Schlenker]]&lt;ref name="Schlenker74"/&gt; – revolving around the meaning of sociological research. Whilst Schlenker appeared to maintain the position, that context only superficially influenced social behavior, Gergen appeared to maintain that context penetrated everything in social behavior, rendering observations as specific to the very situation observed. Thus, simplifying the discussion, the observation of social behavior would be no more than collecting historical data, since context would never be the same and the results would remain unique. In fact, sociology would be some specialized kind of historical research.&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"/&gt; Considering this, Thorngate writes

{{Quotation|''It is impossible for a theory of social behaviour to be simultaneously general, simple or parsimonious, and accurate.''|Warren Thorngate&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"/&gt;}}

The statement was confirmed by Gergen:

{{Quotation|''The more general a simple theory, the less accurate it will be in predicting specifics.''|Kenneth J. Gergen&lt;ref name ="Gergen76"/&gt;}}

== Weick's Interpretation ==
Weick represents this model “as a clockface with general at 12:00, accurate at 4:00, and simple at 8:00 to drive home the point that an explanation that satisfies any two characteristics is least able to satisfy the third characteristic.”&lt;ref name=Weick03/&gt;

According to Weick, research operates in this continuum: 
* if research that aims to be accurate and simple (6-o'clock), results would not be generally applicable.
* if research that aims to be general and simple (10-o'clock), results would not be accurate and
* if research that aims to be general and accurate (2-o'clock), results would not be simple any more.

Basically, Weick maintains, that there is a "trade-off" between these three virtues in such a way that only two can be achieved at any given time. Research therefore must operate in different modes to capture reality in sufficient precision and granularity.&lt;ref name="Weick02"/&gt; The postulate therefore becomes descriptive of research and prescriptive of research methodology.

== Criticism ==
Though confirming the postulate in general, Fred Dickinson, Carol Blair and Brian L. Ott criticized Weicks use of the word "accurate".&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt; Accuracy is hard to achieve, especially if the topic is difficult to qualify, e.&amp;nbsp;g. in researching memory. They suggest replacing the term "accurate" with "interpretive utility".&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8324">'''Thorson's rule''' (named after [[Gunnar Thorson]] by S. A. Mileikovsky in 1971)
&lt;ref name="Mileikovsky"&gt;Mileikovsky, S. A. 1971. ''Types of larval development in marine bottom invertebrates, their distribution and ecological significance: a reevaluation.'' Marine Biology 19: 193-213&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Biological rules|ecogeographical rule]] which states that [[benthic]] [[marine invertebrates]] at low latitudes tend to produce large numbers of eggs developing to [[pelagic]] (often planktotrophic &lt;nowiki&gt;[plankton-feeding]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and widely dispersing larvae, whereas at high latitudes such organisms tend to produce fewer and larger lecithotrophic (yolk-feeding) eggs and larger offspring, often by [[viviparity]] or [[ovoviviparity]], which are often brooded.&lt;ref name="Thorson"&gt;Thorson, G. 1957 Bottom communities (sublittoral or shallow shelf). In "Treatise on Marine Ecology and Palaeoecology" (Ed J.W. Hedgpeth) pp. 461-534. Geological Society of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Groups involved ==
The rule was originally established for marine bottom invertebrates, but it also applies to a group of parasitic [[flatworms]], monogenean ectoparasites on the gills of marine fish.&lt;ref name="Rohde"&gt;Rohde, K. 1985. Increased viviparity of marine parasites at high latitudes. Hydrobiologia 127: 197-201.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most low-latitude species of [[Monogenea]] produce large numbers of [[ciliated]] [[larva]]e. However, at high latitudes, species of the entirely viviparous family Gyrodactylidae, which produce few nonciliated offspring and are very rare at low [[latitude]]s, represent the majority of gill [[Monogenea]], i.e., about 80–90% of all species at high northern latitudes, and about one third of all species in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters, against less than 1% in tropical waters. Data compiled by A.V. Gusev in 1978 indicates that Gyrodactylidae may also be more common in cold than tropical freshwater systems, suggesting that Thorson's rule may apply to freshwater invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Gusev"&gt;Gusev, A.V. 1978. Monogenoidea of freshwater fish. Principles of systematics, analysis of the world fauna and its evolution. Parasitologicheskij Sbornik 28: 96-198 (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions to the rule, such as ascoglossan [[snail]]s: tropical ascoglossans have a higher incidence of lecithotrophy and direct development than temperate species.&lt;ref name="Krug"&gt;Krug, P.J. 1998. Poecilogony in an estuarine opisthobranch: planktotrophy, lecithotrophy, and mixed clutches in a population of the ascoglossan Alderia modesta. Marine Biology 132:483-494.&lt;/ref&gt;
A study in 2001 indicated that two factors are important for Thorson's rule to be valid for marine gastropods: 1) the habitat must include rocky [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]]s, because soft-bottom habitats appear to favour non-pelagic development; and 2) a diverse assemblage of [[taxa]] need to be compared to avoid the problem of phyletic constraints, which could limit the evolution of different developmental modes.&lt;ref name="Gallardo"&gt;Gallardo, C.S. and Penchaszadeh, P.E. 2001. Hatching mode and latitude in marine gastropods: revisiting Thorson's paradigm in the southern hemisphere. Marine Biology 138 547-552&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application to deep-sea species ==

The [[temperature gradient]] from warm surface waters to the [[deep sea]] is similar to that along latitudinal gradients. A gradient as described by Thorson's rule may therefore be expected. However, evidence for such a gradient is ambiguous;&lt;ref name="Mileikovsky"/&gt; Gyrodactylidae have not yet been found in the deep sea.&lt;ref name="Rohde"/&gt;

== Explanations ==

Several explanations of the rule have been given. They include:
# Because of the reduced speed of development at low temperatures, most species cannot complete development during the short time of [[phytoplankton]] bloom, on which planktotrophic species depend;
# Most species cannot synchronize hatching with the phytoplankton bloom;
# Slower development increases the risk of predation on pelagic larvae;
# Non-pelagic larvae can settle close to the parent, i.e. in a favourable environment;
# Small pelagic larvae may have osmotic difficulties in Arctic and Antarctic summers, due to the melting ice;
# Small larvae may not be able to survive at very low temperatures;
# Cold temperature may select for large size at the beginning of development, resulting in non-pelagic larvae; and
# In cold waters it is more difficult to precipitate dissolved calcium, which results in reduced body size of animals supported by calcium skeletons, leading to viviparity.

Most of these explanations can be excluded for the Monogenea, whose larvae are never planktotrophic (therefore eliminating explanations 1 and 2), their larvae are always short-lived (3), Gyrodactylidae are most common not only close to melting ice but in cold seas generally (5). Explanation 6 is unlikely, because small organisms are common in cold seas, Gyrodactylidae are among the smallest Monogenea (7), and Monogenea do not possess calcareous skeletons (8). The conclusion is that the most likely explanation for the Monogenea (and by implication for other groups) is that small larvae cannot locate suitable habitats at low temperatures, where physiological including sensory processes are slowed down, and/or that low temperatures prevent the production of sufficient numbers of pelagic larvae, which would be necessary to find suitable habitats in the vast oceanic spaces.&lt;ref name="Rohde"/&gt;

== Implications for Rapoport's rule ==

[[Rapoport's rule]] states that latitudinal ranges of species are generally smaller at low than at high latitudes. Thorson's rule contradicts this rule, because species disperse more widely at low than at high latitudes, supplementing much evidence against the generality of Rapoport's rule and for the fact that tropical species often have wider geographical ranges than high latitude species.&lt;ref name="Rohde2"&gt;Rohde, K., Heap M. and Heap, D. 1993. Rapoport's rule does not apply to marine teleosts and cannot explain latitudinal gradients in species richness. American Naturalist 142: 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde3"&gt;Rohde, K. 1999. Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and Rapoport's rule revisited: a review of recent work, and what can parasites teach us about the causes of the gradients? Ecography 22: 593-613.

'''Tissue hydration''' is the process of absorbing and retaining [[water]] in [[Tissue (biology)|biological tissues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of tissue hydration on nanoscale structural morphology and mechanics of individual Type I collagen fibrils in the Brtl mouse model of Osteogenesis Imperfecta|date=December 2012|display-authors=etal|first1=Arika D. |last1=Kemp|journal=Journal of Structural Biology|doi= 10.1016/j.jsb.2012.09.012|volume=180|issue=3|pages=428-438|pmc=3685442|pmid=23041293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants==
Land plants maintain adequate tissue hydration by means of an outer waterproof layer.  In soft or green tissues, this is usually a waxy [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] over the outer [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]].  In older, [[wood]]y tissues, waterproofing chemicals are present in the secondary [[cell wall]] that limit or inhibit the flow of water.  [[Vascular plant]]s also possess an internal [[vascular system]] that distributes fluids throughout the plant.

Some [[xerophyte]]s, such as [[Cactus|cacti]] and other desert plants, have mucilage in their tissues.  This is a sticky substance that holds water within the plant, reducing the rate of dehydration.  Some [[seed]]s and [[spore]]s remain dormant until adequate moisture is present, at which time the seed or spore begins to germinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mucilage in Cacti: Its Apoplastic Capacitance, Associated Solutes, and Influence on Tissue Water Relations|first1=Park S. |last1=Nobel|first2=Jaime|last2=Cavelier|first3=Jose Luis|last3=Andrade|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=43|issue=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
Animals maintain adequate tissue hydration by means of (1) an outer [[skin]], [[Exoskeleton|shell]], or [[cuticle]]; (2) a fluid-filled [[coelom]] cavity; and (3) a [[circulatory system]].

In humans, a significant drop in tissue hydration can lead to the medical condition of [[dehydration]].  This may result from loss of water itself, loss of electrolytes, or a loss of blood plasma.  Administration of [[hydrational fluid]]s as part of sound [[Fluid replacement|dehydration management]] is necessary to avoid severe complications, and in some cases, death. 

Some invertebrates are able to survive extreme [[desiccation]] of their tissues by entering a state of [[cryptobiosis]].

'''''Tragic Lovers''''' is a classical music album by the [[Oregon Symphony]] under the [[Artistic director (music)|artistic direction]] of [[James DePreist]], released by the record label [[Delos Productions|Delos]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tragic-lovers-mw0001408043|title=Tragic Lovers|work=''AllMusic''|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains three works inspired by [[Tragedy|tragic]] love stories in literature: [[Richard Wagner]]'s Prelude and "Liebestod" from ''[[Tristan und Isolde|Tristan and Isolde]]'' (1865), [[Hector Berlioz]]'s "Love Scene" from ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]'', Op. 17, and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref name=WDAV&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdav.org/1_180_412.cfm?date=1/18/2009|title=New Classics|publisher=[[WDAV]]|accessdate=March 28, 2013|date=January 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amelia Haygood and Carol Rosenberger served as [[executive producer]]s of the album; the [[Record producer|recording producers]] were Michael Fine and Adam Stern. The album's creation was financially supported by the Gretchen Brooks Recording Fund, which supported two recording sessions per year for each of DePreist's final five years as music director.&lt;ref name=Liner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Keeping Score|date=June 16, 2001|page=37|accessdate=April 22, 2013|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Steve|last=Smith|volume=113|number=24|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tragic Lovers'' was the orchestra's final recording with DePreist — who left the Oregon Symphony in April 2003 — as [[Conducting|conductor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orsymphony.org/news/0203/apr18_CL14.html|title=James DePreist Finishes Classical Season with "Emperor" Piano Concerto Performed by Pianist Horacio Gutiérrez and Brahms' Symphony No. 4|date=April 18, 2003|publisher=Oregon Symphony|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its final contribution to Delos's "Virtual Reality Recording" series.

Compositions from the album have been broadcast on several stations, including [[Public Radio Exchange]], [[WDAV]], New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]]) and [[Northwest Public Radio]]. WFCR broadcast the Tchaikovsky recording in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday, and the Berlioz track in February 2013, following DePreist's death. The Classical Music Sentinel published a positive review of the album, comparing it to a three-movement symphony.

==Composition==
''Tragic Lovers'', released by the record label [[Delos Productions|Delos]] in 2008, contains three works inspired by [[Tragedy|tragic]] love stories in literature: [[Richard Wagner]]'s Prelude and "Liebestod" from ''[[Tristan und Isolde|Tristan and Isolde]]'', [[Hector Berlioz]]'s "Love Scene" from ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]'', Op. 17, and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]''. The album contains three tracks, each one comprising a single composition and running more than fifteen minutes in length.&lt;ref name=Liner&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Tragic Lovers|others=[[Oregon Symphony]]|year=2008|type=booklet|publisher=[[Delos Productions|Delos]]|first1=Harry J.|last1=Pack|first2=Jim|last2=Svejda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amelia Haygood and Carol Rosenberger served as [[executive producer]]s; the [[Record producer|recording producers]] were Michael Fine for the Wagner and Berlioz works and Adam Stern for the Tchaikovsky composition. The album was [[Audio engineer|engineered]] by John Eargle, with Andrés Villalta serving as associate engineer for the Wagner and Berlioz recordings. [[Digital audio editor|Editing]] was completed by Fine (Wagner, Berlioz) and Stern (Tchaikovsky).&lt;ref name=Liner/&gt; The album marked the orchestra's final recording with DePreist as conductor and its final contribution to Delos's "Virtual Reality Recording" series.&lt;ref name=Delos&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://browse.delosmusic.com/Tragic-Lovers-James-DePreist-p/de%203369.htm|title=Tragic Lovers|accessdate=March 28, 2013|publisher=Delos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasts==
All three compositions were featured on the [[Public Radio Exchange]] program "Compact Discoveries"; the Berlioz and Tchaikovsky recordings aired on an episode titled "Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet", and the Wagner recording was part of the following episode, titled "More Famous Lovers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prx.org/pieces/32486/transcripts/86770|title=Transcript for the Piece Audio version of Compact Discoveries 151: Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet|accessdate=April 18, 2013|publisher=[[Public Radio Exchange]]|first=Fred|last=Flaxman}} Note: Program 151: "Famous Lovers: Romeo &amp; Juliet".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prx.org/pieces/32686/transcripts/87170|title=Transcript for the Piece Audio version of Compact Discoveries 152: More Famous Lovers|accessdate=April 19, 2013|publisher=Public Radio Exchange|first=Fred|last=Flaxman}} Note: Program 152: "More Famous Lovers".&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Joe Brant featured the album on his [[WDAV]] program "New Classics", which highlights newly released classical music recordings.&lt;ref name=WDAV/&gt; New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]]) aired two tracks from the album: the Tchaikovsky recording was broadcast in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=726746&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 21, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio ([[WFCR]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Berlioz track aired in November 2010 and again on February 11, 2013, following DePreist's death on February 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=624057&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 02, 2010|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=624331&amp;eventID=11018|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Nov 03, 2010|accessdate=April 22, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wfcr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=847754&amp;eventID=209404|title=Classical Music: Hosted By: John Montanari and Walter Carroll: Feb 11, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2013|publisher=New England Public Radio (WFCR)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlioz recording also aired on the [[Northwest Public Radio]] program "Classical Music with Robin Rilette" on February 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guide.publicbroadcasting.net/nwpr/guide.guidemain?action=viewPlaylist&amp;playlistID=845309&amp;eventID=229836|title=NWPR Playlists: Classical Music with Robin Rilette: Robin Rilette: Feb 01, 2013|publisher=[[Northwest Public Radio]] ([[Washington State University]])|accessdate=April 19, 2013|date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Jean-Yves Duperron of the Classical Music Sentinel appreciated the continuity of the subject matter and compared the album to a three-movement symphony.&lt;ref name=Duperron&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicalmusicsentinel.com/collections/collection-lovers.html|title=Collection – Tragic Lovers – James DePreist (Conductor) – Oregon Symphony Orchestra – Delos DE3369|accessdate=March 28, 2013|first=Jean-Yves|last=Duperron|publisher=Classical Music Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the opener as the first movement of this hypothetical symphony, Duperron wrote that Wagner's composition "works perfectly" by setting the tone for the album. He appreciated the Berlioz composition as a "central movement" for its more "pleasant" mood and lighter musical textures, and Tchaikovsky's work as the finale for its dramatic and "tumultuous" qualities.&lt;ref name=Duperron/&gt; Duperron complimented DePreist and the orchestra for conveying the emotions depicted in each of the compositions "loud and clear", and specifically highlighted the "massive walls of sound" produced by the strings. He also commended Delos for effectively capturing the performances "with clean and powerful dynamics throughout" and concluded the review by quipping: "This perfectly coordinated collection should be part of every collection!"&lt;ref name=Duperron/&gt;

[[File:Uclanus.JPG|frame|UCLA-NUS Executive MBA Logo]]
The '''UCLA-NUS Executive MBA (EMBA) program''' is a management education program developed jointly by the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management|University of California, Los Angeles (Anderson)]] and the [[NUS Business School]], [[National University of Singapore]]. It allows senior executives from all around the world to participate in.

== About the schools ==

===UCLA Anderson School of Management===
[[UCLA Anderson School of Management]] was established in 1935 and provides management education to more than 1,300 students enrolled in full-time, part-time and executive [[MBA]] and doctoral programs.

===NUS Business School===
By invitation from the Board of Directors of [[Ally Financial|GMAC]] (the administrative body for GMAT), the School has been representing the Southeast Asian region as a governing school of GMAC since 2000. The School is also a "Non-European" member of the international network for excellence in management development ([[EFMD]]).

== Curriculum ==
The UCLA – NUS Executive MBA general management curriculum consists of 16 course modules and a two-part Management Practicum conducted via 6 two-week sessions spanning a 15-month period. Participants spend two sessions each at UCLA in Los Angeles and NUS in Singapore, and one each in Shanghai and Bangalore.

'''Xenia''' (also known as the '''Xenia effect''') in plants is the effect of pollen on seeds and fruit of the fertilized plant.&lt;ref name=Denny&gt;{{cite journal|author=Denney, J.O.|year=1992|title=Xenia includes metaxenia|journal=HortScience|volume=27|issue=722–728|pages=722–728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is separate to the contribution of the pollen towards the next generation.

The term was coined in 1881 by the botanist [[Wilhelm Olbers Focke]] to refer to effects on maternal tissues, including the seed coat and pericarp, but at that time [[endosperm]] was also thought to be a maternal tissue, and the term became closely associated with endosperm effects.&lt;ref name="Denny" /&gt; The term '''metaxenia''' was later coined and is still sometimes used to describe the effects on purely maternal tissues.&lt;ref name="Denny" /&gt;

==Endosperm effects in the seed==
One of the most familiar examples of xenia is the different colours that can be produced in [[maize]] (''Zea mays'') by assortment of alleles via individual pollen grains. Such maize cobs are cultivated for decorative purposes.

The [[endosperm]] tissue, which makes up most of the bulk of a maize seed, is not produced by the mother plant, but is the product of fertilization, and genetic factors carried by the pollen affect its colour. For example, a yellow-seeded race may have its yellow colour determined by a [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive allele]]. If it receives pollen from a purple-seeded race that has one copy of a dominant allele for purple colour and one copy of the recessive allele for yellow seed, the resulting cob will have some yellow and some purple seeds.

Qualities affected in the endosperm of [[sorghum]] may include starchiness, sweetness, waxiness, or other aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Investigation of a xenia effect for yield caused by the waxy gene in grain sorghum|url = http://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/2624|website = oaktrust.library.tamu.edu|access-date = 2016-01-11|language = en-US|first = Kuhlman, Leslie|last = Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fruit-growth effects==
[[File:Vaccinium corymbosum a2.jpg|thumb|Ripe and unripe fruit of ''Vaccinium corymbosum'']]
The vigour of the seeds forming inside a fruit can affect the growth of the fruit itself. For example, in two plant species whose fruit ripen asynchronously (''[[Vaccinium corymbosum]]'' and ''[[Amelanchier arborea]]'') the fruit with more seeds ripened faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gorchov, D.L.|year=1985|title=Fruit ripening asynchrony is related to variable seed number in ''Amelanchier'' and ''Vaccinium''|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=72|issue=12|pages=1939–1943|jstor=2443610|doi=10.2307/2443610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Xenia and genetically engineered crops==
Because there is concern about pollen from [[genetically modified crops|genetically modified]] (GM) crops, male-sterile forms are being considered, particularly of maize.&lt;ref name=Feil&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Euphytica |author1=B. Feil |author2=U. Weingartner |author3=P. Stamp |title=Controlling the release of pollen from genetically modified maize and increasing its grain yield by growing mixtures of male-sterile and male-fertile plants |volume=130 |pages=163–165 |year=2003 |doi=10.1023/a:1022843504598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male-fertile non-GM plants must then be grown with the GM crop to ensure pollination. In some cases, a xenia effect due to the genetic difference between the two strains has been observed that increases grain yield, and could make it financially viable to grow the male-sterile plants in such a mixture.&lt;ref name=Feil/&gt;
