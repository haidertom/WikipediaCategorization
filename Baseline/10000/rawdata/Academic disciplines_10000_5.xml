'''Abbreviations''' in music are of two kinds, namely, [[Glossary_of_musical_terminology|abbreviations of terms]] related to [[musical expression]], and the true musical abbreviations by the help of which certain passages, chords, etc., may be notated in a shortened form, to the greater convenience of both composer and performer. Abbreviations of the first kind are like most [[abbreviation]]s in language; they consist for the most part of the initial letter or first syllable of the word employed—as for instance, {{serif|'''''p'''''}} or {{serif|'''''f'''''}} for the [[dynamics (music)|dynamic markings]] piano and forte, ''cresc.'' for [[crescendo]], ''Ob.'' for [[oboe]], ''Fag.'' for [[bassoon]] ({{lang-it|fagotto}}). This article is about abbreviations used in [[music notation]]. For abbreviations of terms related to musical expression and music in general, see [[Glossary of musical terminology]].

==Repetition of a single note or chord==
The continued repetition of a note or chord is expressed by a stroke or strokes across the [[stem (music)|stem]], or above or below the note if it be a [[whole note]] or [[double whole note]]. The number of strokes denotes the subdivision of the written note into [[eighth note]]s, [[sixteenth note]]s, etc., unless the word [[tremolo]] or tremolando is added, in which case the repetition is as rapid as possible, without regard to the exact number of notes played. (When strokes are added to notes shorter than a quarter note, each beam counts as a stroke.) In the first bar of the example below, the half note with the single stroke across the stem in the ''written'' staff becomes 4 eighth notes in the ''played'' staff. Through the use of 2 strokes across the stem in the second bar, the next full note is expressed as a phrase of 16 sixteenth notes.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \new staff { c2:8^\markup { Written: } &lt;e c g&gt;: | c1:16 | \time 2/4 f,2:32 | \time 4/4 f4:8 a:8 c:16 f:16 | b,8:16 d:16 b:16 g:16 a:32 b:32 c:32 d:32 \bar "|." } \new staff { c8^\markup { Played: } c c c &lt;e c g&gt; &lt;e c g&gt; &lt;e c g&gt; &lt;e c g&gt; | c16 c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c | f,32 f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f | f8 f a a c16 c c c f f f f | b, b d d b b g g a32 a a a b b b b c c c c d d d d } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

On [[bowed instruments]] the rapid reiteration of a single note is easy, but in [[piano]] music an octave or chord becomes necessary to produce a tremolo, the manner of writing and performing of which is seen below.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 2/4 \new staff { &lt;g g'&gt;4:16 ^\markup { \italic tremolo } &lt;e' c g&gt;:16 | \repeat tremolo 4 { &lt;c e&gt;16^\markup { \italic tremolo } g } | s4 } \new staff { g'32*8/12 g, g' g, g' g, g' g, g' g, g' g, &lt;c e&gt;32*8/12 g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g | &lt;c e&gt;32 g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

In the abbreviation expressed by strokes, as above, the passage to be abbreviated can contain no note of greater length than an eighth note, but it is possible also to divide a long note into quarter notes, by means of dots (sometimes known as ''divisi'' dots) placed over it, as below.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { c2^\markup { .. } c2^\markup { .. } | c1^\markup { .... } | s2 } \new staff { c4 c c c | c c c c | s2 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

This is however seldom done, as only a small amount of space is saved. When a long note has to be repeated in the form of [[tuplet|triplets or sextuplets]], the figure 3 or 6 is usually placed over it in addition to the stroke across the stem, and the note is sometimes, though not necessarily, written dotted.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { c4:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } c4:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } c2:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 6 } } \bar "||" \time 4/4 \omit TupletNumber \tuplet 3/2 { c4.:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } } \tuplet 3/2 { c4.:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } } \tuplet 6/4 { c4.:16^\markup { \smaller { \italic 6 } } } \tuplet 6/4 { c4.:16^\markup { \smaller { \italic 6 } } } \bar "||" } \new staff { \tuplet 3/2 4 {c8 c c c c c c c c c c c} | \tuplet 3/2 4 {c8 c c c c c} \tuplet 6/4 4 {c16 c c c c c c c c c c c} } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==Alternation of two notes==

The repetition of a group of two notes is abbreviated by two notes (most often [[half note]]s or [[whole note]]s) connected by the number of strokes ordinarily used to express eighth notes, sixteenth notes, etc., according to the rate of movement intended, as below. It will be observed that a passage lasting for the value of one half note requires two half notes to express it, on account of the group consisting of two notes.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { \repeat tremolo 2 { f8 a } \repeat tremolo 4 { f16 a} | \repeat tremolo 4 { f8 a } | s4 } \new staff { f8 a f a f16 a f a f a f a | f8 a f a f a f a | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

As seen above, half notes are often written with the strokes beaming the notes together (which is unambiguous as white notes with beams are not otherwise used in music), but with quarter notes and shorter the strokes must be separated from the stems to prevent them being misread as a shorter note value.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 2/4 \new staff { \repeat tremolo 4 { c32 a } \repeat tremolo 4 { g64 c } \repeat tremolo 4 { g64 b } | s4 } \new staff { c32 a c a c a c a g64 [c g c g c g c] g [b g b g b g b] | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==Patterns of groups of three or more notes==

A group of three, four, or more notes is abbreviated by the repetition of the cross strokes without the notes as many times as the group has to be repeated.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { \repeat percent 2 { e8[ g c g] } | \repeat percent 4 { e16 g c g } \bar "||" } \new staff { e8 g c g e g c g | e16 g c g e g c g e g c g e g c g } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

This can also be written with the notes forming the group are written as a chord, with the necessary number of strokes across the stem. In this case the word ''simili'' or ''segue'' is added, to show that the order of notes in the first group (which must be written out in full) is to be repeated, and to prevent the possibility of mistaking the effect intended for the repetition of the chord as a whole.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { d16 f a f &lt;d f a&gt;2.:16^\markup { \italic simili } | s4 } \new staff { d16 f a f d f a f d f a f d f a f | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==Repetition marks==

Another sign of abbreviation of a group consists of an oblique line with two dots, one on each side; this serves to indicate the repetition of a group of any number of notes of any length. This can even apply to a passage composed of several groups, provided such passage is not more than two bars in length.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { \repeat percent 2 { e16 g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f } \bar "||" } \new staff { e16 g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f | e g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

A more usual method of abbreviating the repetition of a passage of the length of the above is to write over it the word ''bis'' (twice), or in some cases ''ter'' (three times), or to enclose it between the dots of an ordinary [[repeat sign]].

==Passages in octaves==
{{main|Octave}}
Passages intended to be played in octaves are often written as single notes with the words ''coll' ottava'' or ''coll' 8va'' placed above or below them, according as the upper or lower octave is to be added.

:&lt;score&gt;
&lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 2/4 \new Staff { c''8^\markup { \smaller { \italic "coll' 8" \super \italic "va" } } d'' e'' f'' \bar "||" \clef bass g_\markup { \smaller { \italic "coll' 8" \super \italic "va" } } e c4 \bar "||" s4 } \new Staff { &lt;c'' c'''&gt;8 &lt;d'' d'''&gt; &lt;e'' e'''&gt; &lt;f'' f'''&gt; | \clef bass &lt;g g,&gt; &lt;e e,&gt; &lt;c c,&gt;4 | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

The word ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;'' (or sometimes ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt; alta'' or ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt; bassa'') written above or below a passage does not add octaves, but merely transposes the passage an octave higher or lower. In [[clarinet]] music the word ''[[chalumeau]]'' is used to signify that the passage is to be played an octave lower than written.

:&lt;score&gt;
&lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new Staff { \ottava #1 f'''8 e''' d''' c''' \ottava #0 b''^\markup { \smaller \italic loco } a'' g''4 \bar "||" \clef bass \ottava #-1 a,,8 b,, c, d, \ottava #0 e_\markup { \smaller \italic loco } f g4 \bar "||" \clef treble \ottava #-1 \set Staff.ottavation = #"chalumeau" e8 g c' g f a c' a | g \ottava #0 e'_\markup { \smaller \italic clar. } g' c'' e''2 \bar "||" } \new Staff { f'''8 e''' d''' c''' b'' a'' g''4 | \clef bass a,,8 b,, c, d, e, f, g,4 | \clef treble e8 g c' g f a c' a | g e' g' c'' e''2 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

All these alterations (which can scarcely be considered abbreviations except that they spare the use of [[ledger line]]s) are counteracted, and the passage restored to its usual position, by the ending of the enclosing bracket, the word ''loco'', or in clarinet music ''clarinette''.

==Abbreviations in scores==

In [[orchestra]]l music it often happens that certain of the instruments play in [[unison]]; when this is the case the parts are sometimes not all written in the score, but the lines belonging to one or more of the instruments are left blank, and the words ''coi violini'' or ''col basso'', etc., are added, to indicate that the instruments in question have to play in unison with the violins or basses, as the case may be, or when two instruments of the same kind, such as first and second violins, have to play in unison, the word ''unisono'' or ''col primo'' is placed instead of the notes in the line belonging to the second. Where two parts are written on one staff in a score the sign ''[[a due|a 2]]'' denotes that both play the same notes; and ''a 1'' that the second of the two is resting. The indication ''a 3'' or ''a 4'' at the head of [[fugue]]s indicates the number of parts or voices in which the fugue is written.

An abbreviation which is often very troublesome to the conductor occurs in [[manuscript]] scores, when a considerable part of the composition is repeated without alteration, and the corresponding number of bars are left vacant, with the remark ''come sopra'' (as above). This is not met with in printed scores.

==Chord abbreviations used in music theory==
[[Image:Scale degree numbers.png|thumb|350px|Root position triads of the C major scale indicated using [[Roman numeral analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oswald Jonas|Jonas, Oswald]] (1982). ''Introduction to the Theory of Heinrich Schenker'' (1934: ''Das Wesen des musikalischen Kunstwerks: Eine Einführung in Die Lehre Heinrich Schenkers''), p.22. Trans. John Rothgeb. {{ISBN|0-582-28227-6}}. Shown all uppercase.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Root position triads from C major scale.mid|Play}}]]

There are also abbreviations relating to [[music analysis]], some of which are of great value. In [[figured bass]], for instance, the various chords are expressed by figures, and the several authors in the nineteenth century invented or availed themselves of various methods of shortly expressing the different chords and intervals, particularly using [[Roman numeral analysis]].

[[Gottfried Weber]] represents an interval by a number with one or two dots before it to express [[minor chord|minor]] or [[Diminished triad|diminished]], and one or two after it for [[major chord|major]] or [[augmented chord|augmented]].

[[Johann Anton André]] makes use of a [[right triangle]] to express a [[triad (music)|triad]], and a [[square]], for a [[seventh chord]], the inversions being indicated by one, two, or three small vertical lines across their base, and the classification into major, minor, diminished, or augmented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4, placed in the centre.

'''Absolute pitch''' (AP), widely referred to as '''''perfect pitch''''', is a rare auditory phenomenon characterized by the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given [[musical note]] without the benefit of a reference tone.&lt;ref name="phil-494"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch In D. Deutsch (Ed.) | journal=The psychology of music, 3rd Edition | volume= | pages=141–182 | year=2013 |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-381460-9.00005-5 | isbn=9780123814609}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/PsyMus_3_Ch5_Absolute_Pitch.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, W.D. |year=1998 |title=The Psychology of Music (Second Edition) |chapter=Absolute Pitch |editor=D. Deutsch |pages=265–298 |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn=0-12-213564-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AP can be demonstrated via linguistic labeling ("naming" a note), auditory imagery,{{clarify|reason=This is puzzling. How does the auditory imagery get out of the person's brain?|date=October 2016}} or sensorimotor responses. For example, an AP possessor can accurately reproduce a heard tone on a musical instrument without "hunting" for the correct pitch.&lt;ref name="Zatorre, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Zatorre |year=1989 |title=Multiple coding strategies in the retention of musical tones by possessors of absolute pitch|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume= 17 |issue=5 |pages=582–589 |doi=10.3758/BF03197081 |last2=Beckett |first2=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zatorre, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Zatorre |date=July 2003 |title=Absolute pitch: a model for understanding the influence of genes and development on neural and cognitive function |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=692–695 |doi=10.1038/nn1085 |pmid=12830161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers estimate the occurrence of AP to be 1 in 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="Sacks1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliver Sacks |date=May 1995 |title=Letters: Musical Ability |journal=Science |volume=268 |issue=5211 |pages=621–622 |doi=10.1126/science.7732360 |pmid=7732360|bibcode=1995Sci...268..621S |last2=Schlaug |last3=Jancke |last4=Huang |last5=Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, absolute pitch implies some or all of the following abilities, achieved without a reference tone:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Parncutt, R. |author2=Levitin, D. J. |year=2001 |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |chapter=Absolute Pitch |editor=Sadie, S. |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=1-56159-239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify by name individual [[pitch (music)|pitches]] (e.g. F{{music|sharp}}, A, G, C) played on various instruments.
* Name the [[key (music)|key]] of a given piece of tonal music.
* Reproduce a piece of tonal music in the correct key days after hearing it.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* Identify and name all the tones of a given [[chord (music)|chord]] or other tonal mass.
* Accurately sing a named pitch.
* Name the pitches of common everyday sounds such as [[vehicle horn|car horns]] and [[Alarm device|alarms]].
* Name the frequency of a pitch (e.g. that G{{music|#}}4  is 415Hz) after hearing it.

People may have absolute pitch along with the ability of [[relative pitch]], and relative and absolute pitch work together in actual musical listening and practice, but strategies in using each skill vary.&lt;ref name="Miyazaki, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken'ichi |last=Miyazaki |date=June 2004 |title=How well do we understand absolute pitch? |journal=Acoustical Science and Technology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=270–282 |doi=10.1250/ast.25.426 |url=http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816070421/http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with absolute pitch may train their relative pitch and there has been a reported case of 6 adults in China (with previous musical training) acquiring absolute pitch through specific tonal training.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/03/355933&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, two studies by Harvard and the University of Chicago have shown Valproate, a medication used to treat epilepsy and severe depression, may re-open the "critical period" of learning making the acquisition of absolute pitch, as well as languages, potentially as efficient for adults as for children.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.uchicago.edu/story/acquiring-perfect-pitch-may-be-possible-some-adults&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.uchicago.edu/story/acquiring-perfect-pitch-may-be-possible-some-adults&lt;/ref&gt; Adults who possess relative pitch but do not already have absolute pitch can also learn "pseudo-absolute pitch" and become able to identify notes in a way that superficially resembles absolute pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levitin, D.J. |year=2008 |title=Music Meets Medicine, Proceedings of the Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation |chapter=Absolute pitch: Both a curse and a blessing |editor1=Clockars, M. |editor2=Peltomaa, M. |pages=124–132 |publisher=Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation |location=Helsinki, Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, training absolute pitch can require considerable motivation, time, and effort, and learning is not retained without constant practice and reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meyer, M |title=On memorizing absolute pitch |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=28 |year=1956 |pages=718–719 |doi=10.1121/1.1908465 |issue=4|bibcode = 1956ASAJ...28..718M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific studies==

===History of study and terminologies===

Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color ''blue'' by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as [[light]], it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify, for example, the note C.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Takeuchi, A.

===Influence by music experience===
Absolute pitch sense appears to be influenced by cultural exposure to music, especially in the familiarization of the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] [[musical scale|C-major scale]]. Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C-major tones more reliably and, except for B, more quickly than the five "black key" tones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=The speed of musical pitch identification by absolute-pitch possessors |journal=Music Perception |volume=8 |year=1990 |pages=177–188 |doi=10.2307/40285495}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experience. One study of Dutch non-musicians also demonstrated a bias toward using C-major tones in ordinary speech, especially on syllables related to emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braun, M. |title=Absolute pitch in emphasized speech |journal=Acoustics Research Letters Online |volume=3 |year=2002 |pages=77–82 |doi=10.1121/1.1472336 |issue=2| url=http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=ARLOFJ000003000002000077000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;prog=normal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
Absolute pitch is more common among speakers of [[tonal language]]s, such as most dialects of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which often depend on pitch variation as the means of distinguishing words that otherwise sound the same—e.g., [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] with four possible tonal variations, [[Cantonese]] with six, [[Southern Min]] with seven or eight (depending on dialect), and Vietnamese with six.&lt;ref name=jasa138th&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Dolson | first3 = M. | title = Tone Language Speakers Possess Absolute Pitch | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |year=1999 | volume = 106 | issue = | page = 2267 |laysummary=http://www.acoustics.org/press/138th/deutsch.htm|laysource=Acoustics.org | doi=10.1121/1.427738|bibcode = 1999ASAJ..106.2267D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jasa148th&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Marvin | first3 = E. | last4 = Xu | first4 = H. | title = Perfect Pitch in Tone Language Speakers Carries Over to Music | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |year= 2005 | volume = 116 | issue = | page = 2580 |laysource=AIP|laysummary=http://www.aip.org/148th/deutsch.html | doi = 10.1121/1.4808626 |bibcode = 2004ASAJ..116.2580D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] have been reported to speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak a tonal language&lt;ref name="deu-2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Henthorn T. |author3=Dolson, M. |title=Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework |journal=Music Perception |volume=21 |pages=339–356 |year=2004 |doi=10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339 |issue=3|url=http://philomel.com/pdf/MP-2004-21_339-356.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak a [[Pitch accent|pitch-accent language]]).

Many native speakers of a tone language, even those with little musical training, are observed to sing a given song consistently with regard to pitch.

===Pitch memory related to musical context===

While very few people have the ability to name a pitch with no external reference, pitch memory can be activated by repeated exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ben-Haim|first1=Moshe Shay|last2=Eitan|first2=Zohar|last3=Chajut|first3=Eran|title=Pitch memory and exposure effects|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=Feb 2014|volume=40|issue=1|pages=24–32|doi=10.1037/a0033583|pmid=23875573|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xhp/40/1/24/|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who are not skilled singers will often sing popular songs in the correct key,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Levitin, D. |year=1994 |title=Absolute memory for musical pitch: evidence from production of learned melodies |journal=Perception and Psychophysics |volume=56 |pages=414–423 |pmid=7984397 |issue=4 |doi=10.3758/BF03206733 |url=http://ego.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/levitin/research/Levitin-PandP-1994-56-414.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706185225/http://ego.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/levitin/research/Levitin-PandP-1994-56-414.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can usually recognize when TV themes have been shifted into the wrong key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schellenberg, E.

This phenomenon is apparently unrelated to musical training. The skill may be associated more closely with vocal production. Violin students learning the [[Suzuki method]] are required to memorize each composition in a fixed key and play it from memory on their instrument, but they are not required to sing. When tested, these students did not succeed in singing the memorized Suzuki songs in the original, fixed key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Saah, Victoria |author2=Marvin, Elizabeth West |year=2004 |title=Absolute memory of learned melodies in children trained by the Suzuki violin method |journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition |pages=736–739 |url=http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810004816/http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |archivedate=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible problems===
Musicians with absolute perception may experience difficulties which do not exist for other musicians. Because absolute listeners are capable of recognizing that a musical composition has been transposed from its original key, or that a pitch is being produced at a nonstandard frequency (either sharp or flat), a musician with absolute pitch may become distressed upon perceiving tones believed to be "wrong" or hearing a piece of music "in the wrong key." This can especially apply to Baroque music that is recorded in Baroque tuning (usually A = 415&amp;nbsp;Hz as opposed to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, ''i.e.'', roughly a half step or semitone lower than standard concert pitch).&lt;ref name="Sacks, O. 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sacks, O. |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=1-4000-4081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An absolute listener may also use absolute strategies for tasks which are more efficiently accomplished with [[relative pitch|relative strategies]], such as transposition&lt;ref name="miy_1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=Absolute pitch as an inability: Identification of musical intervals in a tonal context |journal=Music Perception |volume=11 |year=1993 |pages=55–72 |doi=10.2307/40285599|jstor=40285599}}&lt;/ref&gt; or producing harmony for tones whose frequencies do not match standard [[equal temperament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, G. B. |year=1974 |title=Categorical perception and absolute pitch |publisher=University of Western Ontario |location=Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for some musicians to have displaced absolute pitch, where all notes are slightly flat or slightly sharp of their respective pitch as defined by a given convention.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This may arise from learning the pitch names from an instrument that was tuned to a concert pitch convention other than the one in use, ''e.g.'', A = 435&amp;nbsp;Hz (the [[Paris Opera]] convention of the late 19th and early 20th centuries) as opposed to the Anglo-American modern standard A = 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. When playing in groups with other musicians, this may lead to playing in a tonality that is slightly different from that of the rest of the group.

===Synesthesia===
Absolute pitch shows a genetic overlap with [[synesthesia]]/[[ideasthesia]],&lt;ref name=gregersen_2013/&gt;{{clarify|reason=This contradicts with earlier statements in the article, which imply that the genetic status of perfect pitch is not verified. Which is it?|date=October 2016}} and some individuals with music-related synesthesia also have perfect pitch.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} They may associate certain notes or keys with different colors, enabling them to tell what any note or key is. It is unknown how many people with perfect pitch are also synesthetes.

==Correlation with musical talent==
Absolute pitch is not a prerequisite for skilled musical performance or composition. However, musicians with absolute pitch tend to perform better on musical transcription tasks (controlling for age of onset and amount of musical training) compared with those without absolute pitch.&lt;ref name="phil-446"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dooley, K. |author2=Deutsch, D. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Absolute pitch correlates with high performance on musical dictation | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume= 128 | issue=2| pages= 890–3| year=2010 | pmid=20707458 | doi=10.1121/1.3458848 |bibcode = 2010ASAJ..128..890D}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2010_128_890-893.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that musicians with absolute pitch perform worse than those without absolute pitch on recognition of musical intervals.&lt;ref name="miyazaki"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Miyazaki K. | title=Perception of relative pitch with different references: Some absolute-pitch listeners can't tell musical interval names | journal=Perception and Psychophysics | volume=57 | issue=7 | pages= 962–970 | year=1995 | doi=10.3758/bf03205455| pmid=8532499}} [http://www.springerlink.com/content/d11h926866110564/fulltext.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; However, experiments on which this conclusion was based contained an artifact{{Clarify|reason=How defined and of what kind? A physical object designed to stimulate memory or generate a frame of reference? An intervening note serving as a confounding factor that people with absolute pitch might conceivably "latch onto" in ways that people without it would not?|date=April 2016}}, and when this artifact was removed, absolute pitch possessors were found to perform better than nonpossessors on recognition of musical intervals.&lt;ref name="phil-473"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dooley, K. |author2=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch correlates with high performance on interval naming tasks | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=130 | issue=6 |pages=4097–4104 | year=2011 | doi=10.1121/1.3652861 | pmid=22225064 | bibcode=2011ASAJ..130.4097D}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JAS004097.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to uncertainty in the historical record, it is often impossible to determine whether notable composers and musicians of the past had absolute pitch. Since absolute pitch is rare in European musical culture,&lt;ref name="deu_2006b"/&gt; claims that any particular musician possessed it are difficult to evaluate. Among composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical music era|Classical]] eras, evidence is available only for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who is documented to have demonstrated the ability at age 7.&lt;ref name="phil-45"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1121/1.2961141 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=The Enigma of Absolute Pitch | journal=Acoustics Today | volume=2 | pages=11–18 | year=2006 | issue=4}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/AT-2006_2_2.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have only surmised that [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] had it, as indicated from some excerpts from his letters. By the 19th century, it became more common for the presence of absolute pitch to be recorded, identifying the ability to be present in musicians such as [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[John Philip Sousa]].&lt;ref&gt; Naxos. (2018). "John Philip Sousa." Retrieved from https://www.naxos.com/person/John_Philip_Sousa_24864/24864.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relative pitch==
{{Main article|Relative pitch}}
Many musicians have quite good [[relative pitch]], a skill that can be learned through [[ear training]]. With practice, it is possible to listen to a single known pitch once (from a [[pitch pipe]] or a [[tuning fork]]) and then have stable, reliable pitch identification by comparing the notes heard to the stored memory of the tonic pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brady, P. T. |title=Fixed-scale mechanism of absolute pitch |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=48 |year=1970 |pages=883–887 |doi=10.1121/1.1912227 |pmid=5480385 |issue=4|bibcode = 1970ASAJ...48..883B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike absolute pitch, this skill is dependent on a recently perceived [[tonal center]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9142">'''Active living''' is a [[way of life]] that integrates [[physical activity]] into your everyday routines, such as walking to the store or biking to work.  Active living brings together [[urban planners]], [[architects]], [[transportation engineers]], [[public health]] professionals, activists and other professionals to build places that encourage active living and physical activity.  One example includes efforts to build sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian crossing signals and other ways for children to walk safely to and from school, as seen in the Safe Routes to School program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safe Routes|url=http://www.saferoutesinfo.org/|publisher=National Center for Safe Routes to School|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safe Routes To School|url=http://www.saferoutespartnership.org/|publisher=Safe Routes to School National Partnership|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recreational opportunities (parks, fitness centres etc.) close to the home or workplace, walking trails and bike lanes for transportation also encourage a more active lifestyle.  Active living is a combination of physical activity and recreation activities aimed at the general public to encourage a healthier lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Living |url=http://www.healthyalberta.com/155.htm |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403195030/http://www.healthyalberta.com/155.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Active living is a growing field that emerged from the early work of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) with the release of the Surgeon's General Report on Physical Activity and Health in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|url=https://www.cdc.gov/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997, the CDC began the development of an initiative called Active Community Environments (ACEs) coordinated by Rich Killingsworth (the founding director of active living by Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Living by Design|url=http://www.activelivingbydesign.org/|publisher=North Carolina Institute for Public Health|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) and Tom Schmid, a senior health scientist.  The main programming thrust of ACEs was an emerging initiative called Safe Routes to School that was catalyzed by a program designed by Rich Killingsworth and Jessica Shisler at CDC called KidsWalk-to-School. This program provided much needed attention to the connections of the built environment and health, especially obesity and physical inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACES - Active Community Environments |url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/professionals/environment/aces.html |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307013100/http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/professionals/environment/aces.html |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] formally launched their active living initiative which comprised three national programs - [[Active Living by Design]], Active Living Research, and Active for Life.  The main goal of these programs was to develop an understanding how the built environment impacted physical activity and what could be done to increase physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|url=http://www.rwjf.org/|publisher=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
There are many health related benefits to being physically active and living an active life.  Active living can help to reduce the risk of [[chronic diseases]], improve your overall health and well-being, reduce stress levels, minimize health related medical costs, help you to maintain a healthy weight, assist in proper balance and posture and the maintenance of healthy bones and strong muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Benefits of Physical Activity|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/alw-vat/intro/key-cle-eng.php|publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Active living can also improve your sleeping patterns and aid in the prevention of risk factors for [[heart disease]] such as [[blood cholesterol]] levels, [[diabetes]] and [[hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Living Benefits |url=http://asrpwf.ca/recreation-active-living/active-living.aspx |publisher=Alberta Sport, Recreation, Parks and Wildlife Foundation |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320014025/http://www.asrpwf.ca/recreation-active-living/active-living.aspx |archivedate=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits of Being Active|url=http://www.dairygoodness.ca/good-health/healthy-active-living/the-benefits-of-being-active|publisher=Dairy Goodness|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of physical activity==
There are three types of [[physical exercise]]s that a person can do to keep active: [[endurance]], [[flexibility]] and [[Physical strength|strength]] activities.  
* Endurance activities increase your heart rate and strengthen your heart and your lungs.  Examples include: dancing, skating, cycling, swimming and brisk walking.
* Flexibility activities improve your body’s ability to move and assist in keeping your muscles and joints relaxed.  Examples include: yard work, vacuuming, stretching and golf.
* Strength activities create and maintain muscle and keep bones strong.  Examples include: raking leaves, climbing stairs, lifting free weights and push-ups.
It is easy to incorporate endurance, flexibility and strength activities into your daily routine for active living.  Activities such as normal household chores can fit into more than one of the above categories, and it is simple enough to switch to using the stairs instead of taking the elevators at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Be Active at Work|url=http://www.peelregion.ca/health/workplace/employees/active/3groups.htm|publisher=Account for Health|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
In Canada, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] supported the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP) to review the  Canada's Physical Activity Guides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines|url=http://www.csep.ca/CMFiles/Guidelines/CSEP-InfoSheetsComplete-ENG.pdf|publisher=The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were updated and replaced with the Get Active Tip Sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips to Get Active|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hp-ps/hl-mvs/pa-ap/04paap-eng.php|publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Get Active Tip Sheets are broken down into 4 age categories (5-11, 12-17, 18-64 and 65 &amp; older).

The Get Active Tip Sheets recommend that children aged 5–11 and youth aged 12–17 should participate in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day.  The recommendation for adults 18-64 and for older adults 65 years and older is at least 2.5 hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. These minutes do not all need to be done at the same time, but the recommendation is a minimum of 10 minutes at a time.

==Initiatives==
In Canada, there are many active living initiatives currently in place.  One of the most well known programs is the [[ParticipACTION]] program, which aims to encourage Canadians to move more and increase their [[physical activity level]]s.  Their mission statement is "ParticipACTION is the national voice of physical activity and sport participation in Canada. 
Through leadership in communications, capacity building and knowledge exchange, we inspire and support Canadians to move more."  Since the 1970s, ParticipACTION has been motivating Canadians to live actively and participate in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ParticipACTION |url=http://www.participaction.com/en-us/About-Participaction/About-ParticipACTION.aspx |publisher=ParticipACTION |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403131834/http://www.participaction.com/en-us/About-Participaction/About-ParticipACTION.aspx |archivedate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active at old age==
To help be active at older ages you should look into programs like ALC(active living center)

&lt;/ref&gt;
on the basis of the [[Ancient greek#Modern use of Ancient Greek|Neoclassical Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄγνωσις}}, ''agnōsis'', "not knowing" (cf. [[Attic Greek]] ἄγνωτος "unknown"&lt;ref&gt;See: [[wikt:ἄγνωτος|Wiktionary entry on ἄγνωτος]].&lt;/ref&gt;), and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html |title= Conference to explore the social construction of ignorance |accessdate= 2007-08-12|date= 2005-10-04|first= Barbara |last= Palmer|publisher= Stanford News Service |quote= Proctor uses the term "agnotology" – a word coined from agnosis, meaning "not knowing" – to describe a new approach to looking at knowledge through the study of ignorance.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070724074303/http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html| archivedate= 24 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.  [[David Dunning]] of Cornell University is another academic who studies the spread of ignorance.  "Dunning warns that the internet is helping propagate ignorance – it is a place where everyone has a chance to be their own expert, he says, which makes them prey for powerful interests wishing to deliberately spread ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160105-the-man-who-studies-the-spread-of-ignorance |title= The Man Who Studies the Spread of Ignorance|last=Kenyon|first= Georgina|date= |website= |publisher= BBC|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 book ''The Erotic Margin'', Irvin C. Schick referred to ''unknowledge'' "to distinguish it from ignorance, and to denote socially constructed lack of knowledge, that is, a conscious absence of socially pertinent knowledge". As an example, he offered the labeling "terra incognita" in early maps, noting that "The reconstruction of parts of the globe as uncharted territory is ... the ''production of unknowledge'', the transformation of those parts into potential objects of Western political and economic attention. It is the enabling of colonialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schick |first=Irvin C. |title=The Erotic Margin: Sexuality and Spatiality in Alteritist Discourse |publisher=Verso |location=New York and London |year=1999 |pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many causes of culturally induced [[ignorance]]. These include the influence of the [[media (communication)|media]], either through neglect or as a result of deliberate misrepresentation and manipulation. [[Corporation]]s and governmental agencies can contribute to the subject matter studied by agnotology through [[secrecy]] and [[Censorship|suppression]] of information, document destruction, and myriad forms of inherent or avoidable culturopolitical selectivity, inattention, and forgetfulness.&lt;ref name=2005conf/&gt;

Proctor cites as a prime example of the deliberate production of ignorance the [[tobacco industry]]'s [[Tobacco advertising|advertising]] campaign to [[Merchants of Doubt|manufacture doubt]] about the [[cancer]]ous and other [[Health effects of tobacco|health effects]] of [[tobacco use]]. Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

At Stanford, we study how ignorance is manufactured. It is an art we call agnotology.)
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do ''not'' "come to be", or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about [[plate tectonics]] was [[censorship|censored]] and delayed for at least a decade because some evidence remained [[classified information|classified military information]] related to [[Submarine warfare|undersea warfare]].&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The term "agnotology" was first coined in a footnote in Proctor's 1995 book, ''The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer'': "Historians and philosophers of science have tended to treat ignorance as an ever-expanding vacuum into which knowledge is sucked – or even, as [[Johannes Kepler]] once put it, as the mother who must die for [[science]] to be born. Ignorance, though, is more complex than this. It has a distinct and changing political geography that is often an excellent indicator of the politics of knowledge. We need a political agnotology to complement our political epistemologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proctor |first=Robert |title=The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor was quoted using the term to describe his research "only half jokingly", as "agnotology" in a 2001 interview about his [[lapidary]] work with the colorful rock [[agate]]. He connected the two seemingly unrelated topics by noting the lack of [[geology|geologic]] knowledge and study of agate since its first known description by [[Theophrastus]] in 300 BC, relative to the extensive research on other rocks and minerals such as [[diamond]]s, [[asbestos]], [[granite]], and [[coal]], all of which have much higher commercial value. He said agate was a "victim of scientific disinterest", the same "structured apathy" he called "the social construction of ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rps.psu.edu/0109/agateer.html |title=The Agateer |accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=Research Penn State|first=Nancy Marie |last=Brown|date=September 2001| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070811131237/http://www.rps.psu.edu/0109/agateer.html| archivedate= 11 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later quoted as calling it "agnotology, the study of ignorance", in a 2003 ''[[The New York Times]]'' story on medical historians testifying as [[expert witness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/14/arts/14HIST.html?ex=1371009600&amp;en=e10e0387e68ab30f&amp;ei=5007 |title=History for Hire in Industry Lawsuits|date=2003-06-14 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |author =Cohen, Patricia |work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=Mr. Proctor, who describes his specialty as "agnotology, the study of ignorance", argues that the tobacco industry has tried to give the impression that the hazards of cigarette smoking are still an open question even when the scientific evidence is indisputable. "The tobacco industry is famous for having seen itself as a manufacturer of two different products," he said, "tobacco and doubt".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor co-organized a pair of events with [[Londa Schiebinger]], his wife, who is also a science history professor: the first was a workshop at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 2003 titled "Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bshs.org.uk/agnatology-the-cultural-production-of-ignorance |website=The British Society for the History of Science |title=Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance |accessdate=2014-07-15 |quote=Science, Medicine, and Technology in Culture Pennsylvania University Presents a Workshop: ... Robert N. Proctor and Londa Schiebinger, co-organizers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later a conference at [[Stanford University]] in 2005 titled "Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance".&lt;ref name=2005conf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPST/AgnotologyConference.html |title= Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance|accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political economy===

In 2004, [[Londa Schiebinger]]&lt;ref name="news-service.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/october13/londa-1013.html |title=IRWG director hopes to create 'go to' center for gender studies |accessdate=2007-08-12 |date=2004-10-13 |work=Stanford News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
gave a more precise definition of agnotology in a paper on 18th-century voyages of scientific discovery and gender relations, and contrasted it with [[epistemology]], the theory of knowledge, saying that the latter questions how we know while the former questions why we do not know: "Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of cultural and political struggle".&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2004&gt;{{cite journal

 | quote =  I develop a methodological tool that historian of science Robert Proctor has called “agnotology”—the study of {{sic|hide=y|culturally|-}}induced ignorances—that serves as a counterweight to more traditional concerns for epistemology, refocusing questions about "how we know" to include questions about what we do not know, and why not. Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of the cultural and political struggle.

Its use as a critical description of the political economy has been expanded upon by [[Michael Betancourt]] in a 2010 article titled "Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism"&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652 |title=CTheory |accessdate=2010-09-06 |quote="Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism", CTheory, Theory Beyond the Codes: tbc002, Date Published: 6/10/2010, Arthur and Marilouise Kroker, Editors| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101005143051/http://ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652| archivedate= 5 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded in the book ''The Critique of Digital Capitalism''.&lt;ref name="Betancourt2"&gt;{{cite book | last=Betancourt |first=Michael | authorlink = Michael Betancourt | title = [[The Critique of Digital Capitalism]]: An Analysis of the Political Economy of Digital Culture and Technology | publisher = [[Punctum Books]] | location = Brooklyn | year = 2016 | ISBN = 978-0692598443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis is focused on the housing bubble as well as the bubble economy of the period from 1980 to 2008. Betancourt argues that this political economy should be termed "agnotologic capitalism" because the systemic production and maintenance of ignorance is a major feature that enables the economy to function as it allows the creation of a "bubble economy".&lt;ref name="news-service.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Betancourt's argument is posed in relation to the idea of [[affective labor]]. He states that &lt;blockquote&gt;The creation of systemic unknowns where any potential "fact" is always already countered by an alternative of apparently equal weight and value renders engagement with the conditions of reality – the very situations affective labor seeks to assuage – contentious and a source of confusion, reflected by the inability of participants in bubbles to be aware of the imminent collapse until after it has happened. The biopolitical paradigm of distraction, what [Juan Martin] Prada calls "life to enjoy", can only be maintained if the underlying strictures remain hidden from view. If affective labor works to reduce alienation, agnotology works to eliminate the potential for dissent.&lt;ref name="Betancourt"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his view, the role of affective labor is to enable the continuation of the agnotologic effects that enable the maintenance of the capitalist status quo.

==Agnoiology==

A similar word from the same Greek roots, ''agnoiology'', meaning "the science or study of ignorance, which determines its quality and conditions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Agnoiology|volume=1|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the doctrine concerning those things of which we are necessarily ignorant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |editor= Porter, Noah | publisher= G &amp; C. Merriam Co.| year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a branch of philosophy studied by [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002832/James-Frederick-Ferrier |title=James Frederick Ferrier |accessdate=2007-08-12 |format= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ainigmology ==
Anthropologist Glenn Stone points out that most of the examples of agnotology (such as work promoting tobacco use) do not actually create a lack of knowledge so much as they create confusion.  A more accurate term for such writing would be "ainigmology", from the root ''ainigma'' (as in "enigma"); in Greek this refers to riddles or to language that obscures the true meaning of a story.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Glenn Davis 2014 Biosecurity in the Age of Genetic Engineering. In '''[http://pages.wustl.edu/files/pages/imce/stone/stone_2014_bioinsecurity.pdf Bioinsecurity and Human Vulnerability]''', ed Nancy Chen and Lesley Sharp, pp. 71-86.  Santa Fe: SAR Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media influence ==

The availability of such large amounts of knowledge in this information age may not necessarily be producing a knowledgeable citizenry. Instead it may be allowing many people to cherry-pick information in blogs or news that reinforces their existing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Study: Americans choose media messages that agree with their views

| pages=426–448}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and to be distracted from new knowledge by repetitive or base entertainments. There is conflicting evidence on how television viewing affects intelligence as well as values formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An emerging new scientific discipline that has connections to agnotology is [[cognitronics]]:
;cognitronics : aims (a) at explicating the distortions in the perception of the world caused by the information society and globalization and (b) at coping with these distortions in different fields. Cognitronics is studying and looking for the ways of improving cognitive mechanisms of processing information and developing emotional sphere of the personality - the ways aiming at compensating three mentioned shifts in the systems of values and, as an indirect consequence, for the ways of developing symbolic information processing skills of the learners, linguistic mechanisms, associative and reasoning abilities, broad mental outlook being important preconditions of successful work practically in every sphere of professional activity in information society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7913">'''Aliteracy''' (sometimes spelled alliteracy) is the state of being able to read but being uninterested in doing so. This phenomenon has been reported on as a problem occurring separately from [[illiteracy]], which is more common in the developing world, while aliteracy is primarily a problem in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/06/education/the-lost-book-generation.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Roger | last=Cohen | title=The Lost Book Generation | date=January 6, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, John Ramsey defined aliteracy as a loss of a reading habit usually since reading is slow and frustrating for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=John|title=Hell's Bibliophiles: The fifth way of looking at an aliterate|journal=Change|year=2002|volume=34|issue=1|pages=50–56|doi=10.1080/00091380209601835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unesco International Book Year report==
In a publication analyzing the 1972 [[International Book Year]], an estimate was given that as many as 57% of the citizens of an unnamed European nation known for their production of important books did not read books, or that 43% were book readers. Estimates for other industrialized nations' active readers ranged from 33 to 55%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000122/012250eo.pdf Anatomy of an International Year]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary from authors, businesses and educators==
[[Jim Trelease]], author of ''The Read-Aloud Handbook'', has stated that this trend away from the written word is more than worrisome, and that it's tearing apart culture. People who have stopped reading, he says, "base their future decisions on what they used to know...If you don't read much, you really don't know much...you're dangerous."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=The No-Book Report: Skim It and Weep|date=May 14, 2001|first=Linton|last=Weeks| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A23370-2001May13 | work=[[The Washington Post]]}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American historian [[Daniel Boorstin]], in 1984, while serving as [[librarian of Congress]], issued a landmark report: "Books in Our Future". Citing recent statistics that only about half of all Americans read regularly every year, he referred to the "twin menaces" of illiteracy and aliteracy. "In the United States today," Boorstin wrote, "aliteracy is widespread."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; In the United States, a 2008 study reported that 46.7% of adult Americans did not read a book not required for work or school during 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Endowment for the Arts|title=Reading on the Rise|url=http://www.nea.gov/research/readingonrise.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320151903/http://www.nea.gov/research/readingonrise.pdf|archivedate=March 20, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another alert to this phenomenon was a 1991 editorial in [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] by Stratford P. Sherman (with Laurie Kretchmar). It refers to a study by John P. Robinson, a sociology professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], showing that the average American at that time spent only 24 minutes per day in reading. [[Samuel Robert Lichter]], director of the [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]], is quoted on his preference for the ease of turning on the TV instead of reading a book.

Kylene Beers' 1996 study connected aliteracy with reading motivation in teens. She noted unmotivated readers complained about not connecting with the text and could not "see" or visualize what was happening in the book. The inability to relate to the characters reduced the desire to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beers|first=Kylene|title=No time, no interest, no way! The 3 voices of aliteracy|journal=[[School Library Journal]]|year=1996|volume=42|issue=2|pages=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Putnam]], in his book ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community'' argues that [[television]] has fragmented our society.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==Ways to create readers==
[[File:Reading time in Laos - Big Brother Mouse book corner.jpg|thumb|A boy in Laos selects a book to read for his school's new Sustained Silent Reading program.]][[Motorola]] is mentioned as making preparations to pay $5,000,000 to teach their workers reading skills, and [[Ford Motor Company]] is described as, since 1982, having already sent 32,000 workers to a similar program. Publisher [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] was quoted as predicting a market of $500,000,000 per year in the sales of remedial programs to corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1991/11/18/75745/index.htm | work=CNN | first=Stratford P. | last=Sherman | title=America won't win till it reads more and instead it's reading less. Yet reading is strongly connected to communicating, thinking, imagining -- the skills any country will need to compete globally | date=November 18, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Layne's book, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20120405012205/http://www.stenhouse.com/shop/pc/viewprd.asp?idProduct=9302 Igniting a Passion for Reading]" discusses several proven methods that readers can do to increase the desire to read in others.

One method is to read aloud, both to children and adults. Reading aloud allows the listener to hear the story without struggling through decoding the words and possible frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Steven L.|title=Igniting a Passion for Reading: Successful Strategies for Building Lifetime Readers |year=2009|publisher=Stenhouse Publishers|location=Portland, ME|isbn=978-1-57110-385-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method, used in schools, is to encourage students to read every day, choosing for themselves what to read, and reading simply for enjoyment. This is often referred to as [[Sustained Silent Reading]] (SSR). Dr. Stephen Krashen, a leading proponent of SSR, looked at 54 studies of such programs and found that in general they were successful at improving reading skills and building a reading habit.&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, Stephen D., 2011.

'''''Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years''''' is a 2012 book written by [[Jane Fortune]] and Linda Falcone through The [[Advancing Women Artists Foundation]] and published by The Florentine Press. ''Art by Women in Florence'' is adapted from the book ''[[Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence]]'' as a pocket-size guidebook through [[Florence, Italy|Florence's]] museums showcasing over eighty paintings and sculptures by more than sixty women artists.&lt;ref name="art by women in florence"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortune|first=Jane|title=Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years|year=2012|publisher=The Florentine Press|location=Florence, Italy|isbn=978-88-97696-01-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="art by women in florence site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art by Women in Florence|url=http://www.theflorentinepress.com/art-by-women-in-florence/|publisher=The Florentine Press|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years'' is divided into eight sections, including a brief segment on unexhibited paintings, and provides a fold-out map of Florence delineating twenty locations housing viewable artwork.&lt;ref name="AWA art by women in florence cite" /&gt;  (See full list below.)

The book points to a number of religious paintings in Florence's churches including works by [[Suor Plautilla Nelli]], the city's first known woman artist (2) such as her ''Lamentation with Saints'' in the [[San Marco Museum]]. Visitors to [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence|Santa Maria del Carmine]] will find a burial monument by Félice de Fauveau, considered to be one of the most preeminent marble sculptures of the nineteenth century. ''Art by Women in Florence'' spotlights [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], a seventeenth-century [[Baroque]] master known to depict historical and mythical heroines. A significant portion of the guide showcases self-portraiture in the [[Vasari Corridor]]. These protagonists include the wildly popular [[Angelica Kauffmann]] whose work inspired designs for high-class housewares at the peak of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[Cecilia Beaux]] the earliest American invited to contribute to the Corridor's self-portrait collection. (2) ''Art by Women in Florence'' guides the reader to the outskirts of Florence to explore various [[Medici]] villas hosting works by numerous women including [[Lavinia Fontana]], the first female painter to receive a public commission in Italy, and seventeenth-century court artist [[Giovanna Fratellini]].&lt;ref name="AWA art by women in florence cite" /&gt;

'''Auditory processing disorder''' ('''APD'''), also known as '''central auditory processing disorder''' ('''CAPD'''), is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that affect the way the brain processes [[Sound|auditory]] information.&lt;ref name="AAA, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Academy of Audiology|title=Clinical Practice Guidelines: Diagnosis, Treatment and Management of Children and Adults with Central Auditory|url=http://audiology-web.s3.amazonaws.com/migrated/CAPD%20Guidelines%208-2010.pdf_539952af956c79.73897613.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer, middle, and inner ear (peripheral hearing). However, they cannot process the information they hear in the same way as others do, which leads to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds, especially the sounds composing speech. It is thought that these difficulties arise from dysfunction in the [[central nervous system]].

The American Academy of Audiology notes that APD is diagnosed by difficulties in one or more auditory processes known to reflect the function of the central auditory nervous system.&lt;ref name="AAA, 2010" /&gt;

APD can affect both children and adults, although the actual prevalence is currently unknown. It has been suggested that males are twice as likely to be affected by the disorder as females,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/hcs/resources/capd/capd/index.html |title=(C)APD|author= La Trobe University |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Musiek |first1=Frank |authorlink1= |last2=Gail |first2=Chermak |authorlink2= |title=Handbook of central auditory processing disorder |trans-title=auditory neuroscience and diagnosis |year= 2007|publisher= Plural Publishing|isbn= 1-59756-056-1|pages= 448}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no good epidemiological studies.

==Presentation ==
CAPD can continue into adulthood. Cooper and Gates (1991) estimated the prevalence of adult APD to be 10 to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;(Cooper JC Jr., Gates GA. Hearing in the elderly – the Framingham cohort, 1983–1985: Part II.  Prevalence of central auditory processing disorders.

===Relation to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===

It has been discovered that APD and [[ADHD]] present overlapping symptoms. Below is a ranked order of behavioral symptoms that are most frequently observed in each disorder. Professionals evaluated the overlap of symptoms between the two disorders. The order below is of symptoms that are almost always observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chermak|first1=Gail D.|last2=Somers|first2=Erin K.|last3=Seikel|first3=J. Anthony|title=Behavioral signs of central auditory processing disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|journal=Journal of American Academy of Audiology|date=1998|page=78-84}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chart proves that although the symptoms listed are different, it is easy to get confused between many of them.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ADHD !! APD
|-
| 1. Inattentive || 1. Difficult hearing in background noise

There is a high rate of co-occurrence between AD/HD and CAPD. An article published in 1994 showed that 84% of children with APD have confirmed or suspected ADHD. Co-occurrence between ADHD and APD is 41% for children with confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, and 43% for children suspected of having ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RICCIO|first1=CYNTHIA A.|last2=HYND|first2=GEORGE W.|last3=COHEN|first3=MORRIS J.|last4=HALL|first4=JOSH|last5=MOLT|first5=LAWRENCE|title=Comorbidity of Central Auditory Processing Disorder and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=July 1994|volume=33|issue=6|pages=849–857|doi=10.1097/00004583-199407000-00011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''more recently published data is needed to support or refute this statement.'' 
===Relation to specific language impairment and developmental dyslexia===

There has been considerable debate over the relationship between APD and [[Specific language impairment|Specific language impairment (SLI)]].

SLI is diagnosed when a child has difficulties with understanding or producing spoken language for no obvious cause. The problems cannot be explained in terms of peripheral hearing loss. The child is typically late in starting to talk, and may have problems in producing speech sounds clearly, and in producing or understanding complex sentences. Some theoretical accounts of SLI regard it as the result of auditory processing problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=C. A.|year=2011|title= Auditory processing theories of language disorders: Past, present, and future.|journal=Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools|volume=42|issue=3|pages=309–319|doi= 10.1044/0161-1461(2011/10-0040)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1= M. A.|last2=Hall|first2=R. L.|last3= Riley|first3=A|last4= Moore|first4= D. R.|year=2011|title=Communication, listening, cognitive and speech perception skills in children with auditory processing disorder (APD) or specific language impairment (SLI)|journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research|volume= 54|issue=1|pages=211–227| doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2010/09-0167)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view of SLI is not universally accepted, and others regard the main difficulties in SLI as stemming from problems with higher-level aspects of language processing. Where a child has both auditory and language problems, it can be hard to sort out cause-and-effect.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"/&gt;

Similarly with [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]], there has been considerable interest in the idea that for some children reading problems are downstream consequences of difficulties in rapid auditory processing. Again, cause and effect can be hard to unravel. This is one reason why experts such as Moore&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt; have recommended using non-verbal auditory tests to diagnose APD. Specifically regarding the neurological factors of dyslexia, the disorder has been linked to [[polymicrogyria]] which causes cell migrational problems. This relates to APD because children that have polymicrogyri almost always present deficits on APD testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chermak|first1=Gail|last2=Musiek|first2=Frank|title=Handbook of central auditory processing disorder. comprehensive intervention|date=2014|publisher=Plural Publishing|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-59756-562-2|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that APD may be related to [[cluttering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pindzola, Rebekah H. |author2=Haynes, William O. |author3=Moran, Michael J. |title=Communication disorders in the classroom: an introduction for professionals in school setting |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2006 |pages=251 |isbn=0-7637-2743-1 |oclc=59401841 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fluency disorder marked by word and phrase repetitions.

It has been found that a higher than expected proportion of individuals diagnosed with SLI and dyslexia on the basis of language and reading tests also perform poorly on tests in which APD is tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=David R.|title=Auditory processing disorders: Acquisition and treatment|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=July 2007|volume=40|issue=4|pages=295–304|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2007.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; APD can be assessed using tests that involve identifying, repeating or discriminating speech, and a child may do poorly because of primary language problems.&lt;ref name='Dawes &amp; Bishop(2009)'/&gt; In a study comparing children with a diagnosis of dyslexia and those with a diagnosis of APD, they found the two groups could not be distinguished.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawes|first1=P|last2=Bishop|first2= D|year=2010|title=Psychometric profile of children with auditory processing disorder (APD) and children with dyslexia|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=95|pages=432–436|doi=10.1136/adc.2009.170118|pmid=20501538|pmc=3576918}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller|first1= C.A.|last2=Wagstaff|first2=D.A.|year=2011 |title=Behavioral profiles associated with auditory processing disorder and specific language impairment.|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=44|issue=6|pages=745–763 |doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2011.04.001|pmc=3174343}}&lt;/ref&gt; obtained similar findings in studies comparing children diagnosed with SLI or APD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corriveau K, Pasquini E, Goswami U |title=Basic auditory processing skills and specific language impairment: a new look at an old hypothesis |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=647–66 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17538107 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2007/046) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dlouha O, Novak A, Vokral J |title=Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) in children with specific language impairment (SLI).

This raises the worrying possibility that the diagnosis that a child receives may be largely a function of the specialist they see: the same child who would be diagnosed with APD by an audiologist may be diagnosed with SLI by a speech-language therapist or with dyslexia by a psychologist.&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt;

Acquired APD can be caused by any damage to or dysfunction of the central auditory nervous system and can cause auditory processing problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Musiek FE, Chermak GD, Weihing J, Zappulla M, Nagle S |title=Diagnostic accuracy of established central auditory processing test batteries in patients with documented brain lesions |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=342–58 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21864472 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.22.6.4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lew HL, Weihing J, Myers PJ, Pogoda TK, Goodrich GL |title=Dual sensory impairment (DSI) in traumatic brain injury (TBI)--An emerging interdisciplinary challenge |journal=NeuroRehabilitation |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=213–22 |year=2010 |pmid=20448311 |doi=10.3233/NRE-2010-0557 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an overview of neurological aspects of APD, see Griffiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=T.

===Hereditary and genetic characteristics of central auditory processing disorder===
The ability to listen to and comprehend multiple messages at the same time is a trait that is heavily influenced by our genes say federal researchers.&lt;ref&gt;("Genetics Influence Auditory Processing." Psych Central.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Dec. 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt; These "short circuits in the wiring" sometimes run in families or result from a difficult birth, just like any learning disability.&lt;ref&gt;(NCLD.org – NCLD." National Center for Learning Disabilities | NCLD.org.)&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory processing disorder can be associated with conditions affected by genetic traits, such as various developmental disorders. Inheritance of Auditory Processing Disorder refers to whether the condition is inherited from your parents or "runs" in families.&lt;ref&gt;("Inheritance and Genetics of Auditory Processing Disorder." – RightDiagnosis.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Dec. 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Central auditory processing disorder may be hereditary neurological traits from the mother or the father.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Developmental auditory processing disorder===
In the majority of cases of developmental APD, the cause is unknown. An exception is acquired epileptic [[aphasia]] or [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]], where a child's development regresses, with language comprehension severely affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fandiño M, Connolly M, Usher L, Palm S, Kozak FK |title=Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a rare auditory processing disorder series of cases and review of the literature |journal=Int.

In the 1980s and 1990s, there was considerable interest in the role of chronic [[Otitis media]] (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and literacy problems. Otitis media with effusion is a very common childhood disease that causes a fluctuating conductive hearing loss, and there was concern this may disrupt auditory development if it occurred during a sensitive period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitton JP, Polley DB |title=Evaluating the perceptual and pathophysiological consequences of auditory deprivation in early postnatal life: a comparison of basic and clinical studies |journal=J.

== Questionnaires for identifying or documenting listening problems. ==
Questionnaires can be used for the identification persons with possible auditory processing disorders, as these address common problems of listening. They can help in the decision for pursuing clinical evaluation. One of the most common listening problems is speech recognition in the presence of background noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jerger |first1=James |last2=Musiek |first2=Frank |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children. |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology |date=October 2000 |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467-74 |pmid=11057730 |url=https://www.audiology.org/sites/default/files/journal/JAAA_11_09_01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asha.org/policy/PS2005-00114/|author1=Working Group on Auditory Processing Disorders |website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|title=(Central) Auditory Processing Disorders—The Role of the Audiologist [Position Statement] |date=2005 |doi=10.1044/policy.PS2005-00114}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the respondents who participated in a study by Neijenhuis, de Wit, and Luinge (2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neijenhuis |first1=Karin |last2=de Wit |first2=Ellen |last3=Luinge |first3=Margreet |title=Perspectives of Dutch health professionals regarding auditory processing disorders; a focus group study |journal=International Journal of Audiology |date=13 July 2017 |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=942–950 |doi=10.1080/14992027.2017.1347290 |pmid=28701055}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following symptoms are characteristic in children with listening difficulties, and they are typically problematic with adolescents and adults. They include:

* Difficulty hearing in noise
* Auditory attention problems
* Better understanding in one on one situations
* Difficulties in noise localization
* Difficulties in remembering oral information

According to the New Zealand Guidelines on Auditory Processing Disorders (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Keith, W.J., Purdy, S.C., Baily, M., Kay, Flora.  Draft of New Zealand APD Guidelines on Auditory Processing Disorder (2018) Published by the Auditory Processing Disorders Reference Group, New Zealand Audiological Society.  &lt;/ref&gt; a checklist of key symptoms of APD or comorbidities that can be used to identify individuals who should be referred for audiological and APD assessment includes, among others:

* Difficulty following spoken directions unless they are brief and simple
* Difficulty attending to and remembering spoken information
* Slowness in processing spoken information
* Difficulty understanding in the presence of other sounds
*Overwhelmed by complex or “busy” auditory environments e.g. classrooms, shopping malls
*Poor listening skills
* Insensitivity to tone of voice or other nuances of speech
*Acquired brain injury
*History of frequent or persistent middle ear disease (otitis media, ‘glue ear’).
*Difficulty with language, reading or spelling
*Suspicion or diagnosis of dyslexia
*Suspicion or diagnosis of language disorder or delay

Finally, the New Zealand guidelines state that behavioral checklists and questionnaires should only be used to provide guidance for referrals, for information gathering (for example, prior to assessment or as outcome measures for interventions), and as measures to describe the functional impact of auditory processing disorder.  They are not designed for the purpose of diagnosing auditory processing disorders. The New Zealand guidelines indicate that a number of questionnaires have been developed to identify children who might benefit from evaluation of their problems in listening.  Examples of available questionnaires include the Fisher’s Auditory Problems Checklist (1976&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, L. I. (1976). ''Fisher’s Auditory Problems Checklist''. Tampa, FL . The Educational Audiology Association&lt;/ref&gt;), the Children’s Auditory Performance Scale (1998&lt;ref&gt;Smoski, W.J., Brung, M.A.. and Tannahill, J.C., (1998) Children’s Auditory Performance Scale,  Tampa, FL: The Educational Audiology Association&lt;/ref&gt;), the Screening Instrument for Targeting Educational Risk (1989&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, K. (1989). ''SIFTER: Screening instrument for targeting educational risk in children identified by hearing screening or who have known hearing loss''. Tampa, FL The Educational Audiology Association&lt;/ref&gt;), and the Auditory Processing Domains Questionnaire (O’Haraa and Mealings, 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O’Hara |first1=Brian |last2=Mealings |first2=Kiri |title=Developing the auditory processing domains questionnaire (APDQ): a differential screening tool for auditory processing disorder |journal=International Journal of Audiology |date=31 July 2018 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1080/14992027.2018.1487087 |pmid=30063869|url=https://dspace.nal.gov.au/xmlui/handle/123456789/931}}&lt;/ref&gt;) among others. All of the previous questionnaires were designed for children and none are useful for adolescents and adults.

(2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Del Zoppo|first=C.|last2=Sanchez, L.|last3=Lind, C.|date=2015|title=A long-term follow-up of children and adolescents referred for assessment of auditory processing disorder.|url=|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=54|pages=368-375|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a 34-item questionnaire was developed that investigates auditory processing abilities in each of the six common areas of complaint in APD (listening and concentration, understanding speech, following spoken instructions, attention, and other.)  The final questionnaire was standardized on normally achieving young adults ranging from 18 to 27 years of age.  Validation data was acquired from subjects with language-learning or auditory processing disorders who were either self-reported or confirmed by diagnostic testing.  A UCAPI  total score is calculated by combining the totals from the six listening conditions and provides an overall value to categorize listening abilities. Additionally, analysis of the scores from the six listening conditions provides an auditory profile for the subject. Each listening condition can then be utilized by the professional in making recommendation for diagnosing problem of learning through listening and treatment decisions.  The UCAPI provides information on listening problems in various populations that can aid examiners in making recommendations for assessment and management.

==Diagnosis==
APD is a difficult disorder to detect and diagnose. The subjective symptoms that lead to an evaluation for APD include an intermittent inability to process verbal information, leading the person to guess to fill in the processing gaps. There may also be disproportionate problems with decoding speech in noisy environments.

APD has been defined anatomically in terms of the integrity of the auditory areas of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rintelmann | first1 = W.F. | title = Assessment of central auditory dysfunction : foundations and clinical correlates | chapter = Monaural speech tests in the detection of central auditory disorders. | editors = Marilyn L Pinheiro and Frank E Musiek | publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 1985 | location = Baltimore  | pages = 173–200 | isbn = 978-0-683-06887-0 | oclc= 11497885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is made on the basis of performance on behavioral auditory tests. Auditory processing is "what we do with what we hear",&lt;ref name='Katz 1992'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Katz | first1 = Jack  | title = Central auditory processing : a transdisciplinary view  | chapter = Classification of auditory processing disorders | editors = Jack Katz and Nancy Austin Stecker and Donald Henderson  | publisher = Mosby Year Book | year = 1992 | location = St. Louis | pages = 81–92 | isbn = 978-1-55664-372-9| oclc= 25877287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in APD there is a mismatch between peripheral hearing ability (which is typically normal) and ability to interpret or discriminate sounds. Thus in those with no signs of neurological impairment, APD is diagnosed on the basis of auditory tests. There is, however, no consensus as to which tests should be used for diagnosis, as evidenced by the succession of task force reports that have appeared in recent years. The first of these occurred in 1996.&lt;ref name=cap1996/&gt; This was followed by a conference organized by the American Academy of Audiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Musiek F |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467–74 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11057730 |doi= |url=http://www.taracentar.hr/download/diagnosis_apd_school.pdf |format=pdf }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts attempting to define diagnostic criteria have to grapple with the problem that a child may do poorly on an auditory test for reasons other than poor auditory perception: for instance, failure could be due to inattention, difficulty in coping with task demands, or limited language ability. In an attempt to rule out at least some of these factors, the American Academy of Audiology conference explicitly advocated that for APD to be diagnosed, the child must have a modality-specific problem, i.e. affecting auditory but not visual processing. However, an ASHA committee subsequently rejected modality-specificity as a defining characteristic of auditory processing disorders.&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'/&gt;

Auditory processing disorder can be developmental or acquired. It may result from ear infections, head injuries or neurodevelopmental delays that affect processing of auditory information. This can include problems with: "...[[sound localization]] and lateralization (see also [[binaural fusion]]); auditory discrimination; auditory pattern recognition; temporal aspects of audition, including temporal integration, temporal discrimination (e.g., temporal gap detection), temporal ordering, and [[temporal masking]]; auditory performance in competing acoustic signals (including [[dichotic listening]]); and auditory performance with degraded acoustic signals".&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'&gt;{{cite web |title      = (Central) Auditory Processing Disorders.

The Committee of UK Medical Professionals Steering the UK Auditory Processing Disorder Research Program have developed the following working definition of Auditory Processing Disorder: "APD results from impaired neural function and is characterized by poor recognition, discrimination, separation, grouping, localization, or ordering of speech sounds. It does not solely result from a deficit in general attention, language or other cognitive processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebsa.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=29 |title= The British Society of Audiology and the UK APD Steering Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of testing===
1. The SCAN-C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Robert W.|date=2000|title=SCAN-C Test for Auditory Processing Dis- orders in Children|journal=Revised, Psychological Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; for children and SCAN-A&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keith|first=Robert|date=2009|title=SCAN-3:A Tests for Auditory Processing Disorders in Adolescents and Adults.|url=https://www.pearson.com/us/|journal=|publisher=Pearson US|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for adolescents and adults are the most common tool for screening and diagnosing APD in the USA.   Both tests are standardized on a large number of subjects and include validation data on subjects with auditory processing disorders.   The test batteries include screening tests: norm-based criterion-referenced scores; diagnostic tests: scaled scores, percentile ranks and ear advantage scores for all tests except the Gap Detection test.  The four tests include four subsets on which the subject scores are derived include: discrimination of monaurally presented single words against background noise (speech in noise), acoustically degraded single words (filtered words), dichotically presented single words and sentences. 

2. Random Gap Detection Test (RGDT) is also a standardized test. It assesses an individual’s gap detection threshold of tones and white noise. The exam includes stimuli at four different frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) and white noise clicks of 50 ms duration. It is a useful test because it provides an index of auditory temporal resolution. In children, an overall gap detection threshold greater than 20 ms means they have failed and may have an auditory processing disorder based on abnormal perception of sound in the time domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muluk|first=Nuray Bayar|last2=Yalçınkaya|first2=Fulya|last3=Keith|first3=Robert W.|date=February 2011|title=Random gap detection test and random gap detection test-expanded: Results in children with previous language delay in early childhood|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0385814610001446|journal=Auris Nasus Larynx|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6–13|doi=10.1016/j.anl.2010.05.007|issn=0385-8146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Robert W.|title=Random gap detection test|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Gaps in Noise Test (GIN) also measures temporal resolution by testing the patient's gap detection threshold in white noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musiek|first1=Frank E.|last2=Shinn|first2=Jennifer B.|last3=Jirsa|first3=Robert|last4=Bamiou|first4=Doris-Eva|last5=Baran|first5=Jane A.|last6=Zaida|first6=Elena|title=GIN (Gaps-In-Noise) Test Performance in Subjects with Confirmed Central Auditory Nervous System Involvement|journal=Ear and Hearing|date=December 2005|volume=26|issue=6|pages=608–618|doi=10.1097/01.aud.0000188069.80699.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. Pitch Patterns Sequence Test (PPT) and Duration Patterns Sequence Test (DPT) measure auditory pattern identification. The PPS has s series of three tones presented at either of two pitches (high or low). Meanwhile, the DPS has a series of three tones that vary in duration rather than pitch (long or short). Patients are then asked to describe the pattern of pitches presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musiek|first1=Frank|title=Frequency (Pitch) and Duration Pattern Tests|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|date=1994|page=265-268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modality-specificity and controversies===

The issue of modality-specificity has led to considerable debate among experts in this field.  Cacace and McFarland have argued that APD should be defined as a ''modality-specific'' perceptual dysfunction that is not due to peripheral hearing loss.&lt;ref name='Cacace McFarland 1995'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Opening Pandora's Box: The Reliability of CAPD Tests | journal = American Journal of Audiology | date = July 1995 | first = Anthony T. | last = Cacace | author2 = Dennis J.

It is also impractical, as audiologists do not have access to standardized tests that are visual analogs of auditory tests. The debate over this issue remains unresolved. It is clear, however, that a modality-specific approach will diagnose fewer children with APD than a modality-general one, and that the latter approach runs a risk of including children who fail auditory tests for reasons other than poor auditory processing. Although modality-specific testing has been advocated for well over a decade, to date no tests have been published which would allow audiologists to perform a modality-specific evaluation (i.e., no clinical versions of visual analogs to auditory processing tests exist).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Another controversy concerns the fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials.&lt;ref name="D.R.Moore (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=David R.|year=2006|title=Auditory processing disorder (APD): Definition, diagnosis, neural basis, and intervention|journal=Audiological Medicine|volume=4|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1080/16513860600568573}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2010-08-31--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The British Society of Audiology&lt;ref name='BSA2011'/&gt; has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of ''non-speech sounds''.&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt; The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.

In recent years there have been additional criticisms of some popular tests for diagnosis of APD. Tests that use tape-recorded American English have been shown to over-identify APD in speakers of other forms of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The SCAN-C in testing for auditory processing disorder in a sample of British children.|first1=P|last1=Dawes |first2=D.V.

In a recent review of such diagnostic issues, it was recommended that children with suspected auditory processing impairments receive a holistic psychometric assessment including general intellectual ability, auditory memory, and attention, phonological processing, language, and literacy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title= Controversies in central auditory processing disorder |veditors=Cacace AT, McFarland DJ |chapter= Putting the Auditory Processing Back into Auditory Processing Disorder in Children |vauthors=Cowan J, Rosen S, Moore DR |pages=187–197 |year=2009 |publisher= San Diego, Calif.; Abingdon: Plural. |isbn=978-159-756260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors state that "a clearer understanding of the relative contributions of perceptual and non-sensory, unimodal and supramodal factors to performance on psychoacoustic tests may well be the key to unravelling the clinical presentation of these individuals."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Depending on how it is defined, APD may share common symptoms with [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD/ADHD]], [[specific language impairment]], and [[autism spectrum]] disorders. A review showed substantial evidence for atypical processing of auditory information in children with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Connor K |title=Auditory processing in autism spectrum disorder: A review |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume= 36|issue= 2|pages= 836–54|date=December 2011 |pmid=22155284 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.11.008 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawes and Bishop noted how specialists in audiology and speech-language pathology often adopted different approaches to child assessment, and they concluded their review as follows: "We regard it as crucial that these different professional groups work together in carrying out assessment, treatment and management of children and undertaking cross-disciplinary research."&lt;ref name='Dawes &amp; Bishop(2009)'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dawes P, Bishop D |title=Auditory processing disorder in relation to developmental disorders of language, communication and attention: a review and critique |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=440–65 |year=2009 |pmid=19925352 |doi=10.1080/13682820902929073 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, this seems rare.

To ensure that APD is correctly diagnosed, the examiners must differentiate APD from other disorders with similar symptoms. Factors that should be taken into account during the diagnosis are: attention, [[auditory neuropathy]], fatigue, hearing and sensitivity, intellectual and developmental age, medications, motivation, motor skills, native language and language experience, response strategies and decision-making style, and [[visual acuity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jerger|first1=James|last2=Musick|first2=Frank|title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|date=2000|volume=11|issue=9|pages=467–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that children under the age of seven cannot be evaluated correctly because their language and auditory processes are still developing. In addition, the presence of APD cannot be evaluated when a child's primary language is not English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandstaetter|first1=Patt|last2=Hunter|first2=Lisa|last3=Kalweit|first3=Linda|last4=Kloos|first4=Eric|last5=Landrud|first5=Sherry|last6=Larson|first6=Nancy|last7=Packer|first7=Amy|last8=Wall|first8=Deb|title=Introduction to Auditory Processing Disorders|journal=Minnesota Department of Education Total Special Education System|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===

* have trouble paying attention to and remembering information presented orally, and may cope better with visually acquired information
* have problems carrying out multi-step directions given orally; need to hear only one direction at a time
* have poor [[listening]] skills
* need more time to process information
* have low academic performance 
* have behavior problems
* have language difficulties (e.g., they confuse syllable sequences and have problems developing vocabulary and understanding language)
* have difficulty with reading, comprehension, spelling, and vocabulary

APD can manifest as problems determining the direction of sounds, difficulty perceiving differences between speech sounds and the sequencing of these sounds into meaningful words, confusing similar sounds such as "hat" with "bat", "there" with "where", etc.  Fewer words may be perceived than were actually said, as there can be problems detecting the gaps between words, creating the sense that someone is speaking unfamiliar or nonsense words. In addition, it is common for APD to cause speech errors involving the distortion and substitution of consonant sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeVore|first1=Brooke|last2=Nagao|first2=Kyoko|last3=Pereira|first3=Olivia|last4=Nemith|first4=Julianne|last5=Sklar|first5=Rachele|last6=Deeves|first6=Emily|last7=Kish|first7=Emily|last8=Welsh|first8=Kelsey|last9=Morlet|first9=Thierry|title=Speech errors among children with auditory processing disorder|journal=Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics|date=2016|volume=29|issue=1|page=6|doi=10.1121/2.0000440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those suffering from APD may have problems relating what has been said with its meaning, despite obvious recognition that a word has been said, as well as repetition of the word.  Background noise, such as the sound of a radio, television or a noisy bar can make it difficult to impossible to understand speech, since spoken words may sound distorted either into irrelevant words or words that don't exist, depending on the severity of the auditory processing disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson S, Kraus N |title=Sensory-cognitive interaction in the neural encoding of speech in noise: a review |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=575–85 |date=October 2010 |pmid=21241645 |pmc=3075209 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.21.9.3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a telephone can be problematic for someone with auditory processing disorder, in comparison with someone with normal auditory processing, due to low quality audio, poor signal, intermittent sounds and the chopping of words.&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'/&gt; Many who have auditory processing disorder subconsciously develop visual coping strategies, such as lip reading, reading body language, and eye contact, to compensate for their auditory deficit, and these coping strategies are not available when using a telephone.

As noted above, the status of APD as a distinct disorder has been queried, especially by speech-language pathologists&lt;ref name='Kamhi2011'&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.G.|last=Kamhi|year=2011|title= What speech-language pathologists need to know about Auditory Processing Disorder.|journal=Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools|volume= 42|issue=3|pages=265–272|doi=10.1044/0161-1461(2010/10-0004)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychologists,&lt;ref name='Lovett2011'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovett|first=B.J.|year=2011|title=Auditory processing disorder: School psychologist beware?|journal=Psychology in the Schools|volume=48|pages=855–867|doi=10.1002/pits.20595}}&lt;/ref&gt; who note the overlap between clinical profiles of children diagnosed with APD and those with other forms of specific learning disability. Many audiologists, however, would dispute that APD is just an alternative label for dyslexia, SLI, or ADHD, noting that although it often co-occurs with these conditions, it can be found in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hearing Journal|year=

==Remediation and training==

{{See also|Alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities}}

Treatment of APD typically focuses on three primary areas: changing learning environment, developing higher-order skills to compensate for the disorder, and remediation of the auditory deficit itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellis|first1=Teri James|title=Auditory Processing Disorders (APD) in Children|url=https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Understanding-Auditory-Processing-Disorders-in-Children/|website=www.asha.org|publisher=ASHA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a lack of well-conducted evaluations of intervention using [[randomized controlled trial]] methodology. Most evidence for effectiveness adopts weaker standards of evidence, such as showing that performance improves after training. This does not control for possible influences of practice, maturation, or placebo effects. Recent research has shown that practice with basic auditory processing tasks (i.e. auditory training) may improve performance on auditory processing measures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chermak GD, Silva ME, Nye J, Hasbrouck J, Musiek FE |title=An update on professional education and clinical practices in central auditory processing |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=428–52; quiz 455 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17715652 |doi= 10.3766/jaaa.18.5.7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MooreDR2007 &gt;{{cite journal |author=Moore DR |title=Auditory processing disorders: acquisition and treatment |journal=J Commun Disord |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=295–304 |year=2007 |pmid=17467002 |doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2007.03.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and phonemic awareness measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moore DR, Rosenberg JF, Coleman JS |title=Discrimination training of phonemic contrasts enhances phonological processing in mainstream school children |journal=Brain Lang |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=72–85 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15896385 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.11.009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes after auditory training have also been recorded at the physiological level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russo NM, Nicol TG, Zecker SG, Hayes EA, Kraus N |title=Auditory training improves neural timing in the human brainstem |journal=Behav.

Treating additional issues related to APD can result in success. For example, treatment for phonological disorders (difficulty in speech) can result in success in terms of both the phonological disorder as well as APD. In one study, speech therapy improved auditory [[evoked potential]]s (a measure of brain activity in the auditory portions of the brain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leite RA, Wertzner HF, Matas CG |title=Long latency auditory evoked potentials in children with phonological disorder |journal=Pró-fono : Revista De Atualização Científica |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=561–6 |year=2010 |pmid=21271117 |doi= 10.1590/s0104-56872010000400034|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-56872010000400034&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is evidence that language training is effective for improving APD, there is no current research supporting the following APD treatments:
* [[Auditory Integration Training]] typically involves a child attending two 30-minute sessions per day for ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities|veditors=Jacobson JW, Foxx RM, Mulick JA |chapter= Auditory integration training: a critical review|vauthors=Mudford OC, Cullen C |pages=351–62|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-8058-4192-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lindamood-Bell Learning Processes (particularly, the Visualizing and Verbalizing program)
* Physical activities that require frequent crossing of the midline (e.g., [[occupational therapy]])
* Sound Field Amplification
* Neuro-Sensory Educational Therapy
*Neurofeedback

However, use of a FM transmitter has been shown to produce significant improvements over time with children.

==History==
The first research into APD began in 1954 with Helmer Myklebust's study, "Auditory Disorders in Children".&lt;ref&gt;Myklebust, H. (1954). Auditory disorders in children. New York: Grune &amp; Stratton.&lt;/ref&gt; Myklebust's work suggested auditory processing disorder was separate from [[language]] learning difficulties. His work sparked interest in auditory deficits after acquired brain lesions affecting the temporal lobes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocca E, Calearo C, Cassinari V |title=A new method for testing hearing in temporal lobe tumours; preliminary report |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=219–21 |year=1954 |pmid=13197002 |doi= 10.3109/00016485409128700|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocca E, Calearo C, Cassinari V, Migliavacca F |title=Testing "cortical" hearing in temporal lobe tumours |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=289–304 |year=1955 |pmid=13275293 |doi= 10.3109/00016485509124282|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and led to additional work looking at the physiological basis of auditory processing,&lt;ref name="Kimura1961"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimura|first1=Doreen|title=Cerebral dominance and the perception of verbal stimuli.|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology |

In 1977, the first conference on the topic of APD was organized by Robert W. Keith, Ph.D. at the University of Cincinnati.  The proceedings of that conference was published by Grune and Stratton under the title "Central Auditory Dysfunction" (Keith RW Ed.)  That conference started a new series of studies focusing on APD in children.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J., &amp; Illmer, R. (1972). Auditory perception in children with learning disabilities. In J.

These early researchers also invented many of the auditory training approaches, including interhemispheric transfer training and interaural intensity difference training. This period gave us a rough understanding of the causes and possible treatment options for APD.
Much of the work in the late nineties and 2000s has been looking to refining testing, developing more sophisticated treatment options, and looking for genetic risk factors for APD. Scientists have worked on improving behavioral tests of auditory function, [[neuroimaging]], [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic]], and [[electrophysiologic]] testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Thibodeau L, Martin J |title=Behavioral and electrophysiologic evidence of auditory processing disorder: a twin study |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=438–60 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12371661 |doi= |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Estes RI, Jerger J, Jacobson G |title=Reversal of hemispheric asymmetry on auditory tasks in children who are poor listeners |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=59–71 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11895008 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with new technology has led to a number of software programs for auditory training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chermak GD, Musiek FE |title=Auditory training: Principles and approaches for remediation and managing auditory processing disorders |journal=Seminars in Hearing  |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=287–295  |year=2002 |ISSN=0734-0451 |pmid= |doi=10.1055/s-2002-35878 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Musiek F |title=Habilitation and management of auditory processing disorders: overview of selected procedures |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=329–42 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10385875 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With global awareness of mental disorders and increasing understanding of [[neuroscience]], auditory processing is more in the public and academic consciousness than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Task Force on Central Auditory Processing Consensus Development |title=Central auditory processing: Current status of research and implications for clinical practice  [Technical Report] |journal=American Journal of Audiology |volume=5 |issue= |pages=41–54 |year=1996 |doi=10.1044/policy.TR1996-00241 |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/TR1996-00241.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004220836/http://www.asha.org/docs/html/TR1996-00241.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Musiek F |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467–74 |format=pdf |date=October 2000 |pmid=11057730 |doi= |url=http://www.bsnpta.org/geeklog/public_html/filemgmt/filemgmt_data/files/Auditory_Processing_Disorders_in_Children.pdf |access-date=2012-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621224822/http://www.bsnpta.org/geeklog/public_html/filemgmt/filemgmt_data/files/Auditory_Processing_Disorders_in_Children.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Keith, Robert W. |title=Central auditory and language disorders in children |publisher=College-Hill Press |location=San Diego, CA |year=1981 |pages= |isbn=0-933014-74-0 |oclc=9258682 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Katz, Jack |author2=Henderson, Donald |author3=Stecker, Nancy Austin |title=Central auditory processing: a transdisciplinary view |publisher=Mosby Year Book |location=St. Louis, MO |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=1-55664-372-1 |oclc= 2587728 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Katz, Jack |author2=Stecker, Nancy Austin |title=Central auditory processing disorders: mostly management |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-205-27361-0 |oclc=246378171 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for International Political Analysis''' ('''CIPA''') is a research center at the [[Policy Research Institute]] (PRI) at the [[University of Kansas]].
The primary project focus at present is on gathering information regarding the nature of inter-state relations during times of conflict in several localized areas: the [[Middle East]], Southern, Western, and Central Africa, and the [[Balkans]].

==Purpose==
Using filtered news leads in conjunction with a series of numeric codes, these inter-state relations can be quantified—both in number and intensity—through computer-aided coding.
In addition, CIPA employs several human coders to track mass atrocities throughout the world.
CIPA operates with funding from multiple sources with different research needs, although the overarching goal of the project is predictive in nature.
In all facets of the project's research, the intent is to advance efforts to understand and anticipate civil strife, [[genocide]], and mass killings.

== Project History ==

The Center for International Political Analysis is an outgrowth of [[Philip Schrodt]]'s and [[Deborah Gerner]]'s work on the [[Kansas Event Data System]] (KEDS). The initial focus of the KEDS project was the development of techniques for converting English-language reports of political events into event data.
&lt;br&gt;This replaced labor-intensive and error-prone process of human coding with inexpensive, transparent and reproducible automated coding.
&lt;br&gt;The centerpiece of this effort is the [[American Political Science Association|APSA]]-award-winning KEDS computer program, a [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] program with a user-friendly interface and a variety of output options. In support of KEDS, Schrodt and Gerner's staff produced several programs for filtering texts and aggregating the resulting event data so that it can be used in [[statistical analysis]]. The KEDS program has now been used in about half-a-dozen [[National Science Foundation]]-funded event data projects, as well as a number of dissertations and other smaller projects. The development and popularization of the KEDS software paved the way for CIPA's current framework, Tabari.

The early KEDS work focused primarily on the [[Levant]] region from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. Most of this research focused on the development of early warning techniques for political change, primarily using the Levant as a case study. The project experimented with a number of different methods, including factor analysis, discriminant analysis, an assortment of clustering algorithms, and [[hidden Markov]] models.

In recent years, grants from [[Science Applications International Corporation]] and the National Science Foundation have allowed CIPA to expand the scope of its research into [[Africa]], [[Yemen]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the former [[Yugoslavia]]. In addition, these grants have facilitated a shift in the CIPA project focus. Upcoming data sets will likely reflect a greater emphasis on contentious intrastate political relations.

'''Computational fluid dynamics''' ('''CFD''') is a branch of [[fluid mechanics]] that uses [[numerical analysis]] and [[data structure]]s to analyze and solve problems that involve [[fluid dynamics|fluid flows]].  Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the free-stream flow of the fluid, and the interaction of the fluid ([[Liquid|liquids]] and [[Gas|gases]]) with surfaces defined by [[Boundary value problem#Boundary value conditions|boundary conditions]]. With high-speed [[supercomputer]]s, better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as [[transonic]] or [[turbulence|turbulent]] flows. Initial validation of such software is typically performed using experimental apparatus such as  [[wind tunnel|wind tunnels]].  In addition, previously performed [[Closed-form solution|analytical]] or [[Empirical research|empirical]] analysis of a particular problem can be used for comparison.  A final validation is often performed using full-scale testing, such as [[flight test]]s.

CFD is applied to a wide range of research and engineering problems in many fields of study and industries, including [[aerodynamics]] and aerospace analysis, [[Numerical weather prediction|weather simulation]], natural science and [[environmental engineering]], industrial system design and analysis, [[biological engineering]] and fluid flows, and [[engine]] and [[combustion]] analysis.

==Background and history==
[[Image:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around the [[Space Shuttle]] during re-entry.]]
[[Image:X-43A (Hyper - X) Mach 7 computational fluid dynamic (CFD).jpg|thumb|right|A simulation of the [[Hyper-X]] scramjet vehicle in operation at [[Mach number|Mach]]-7]] The fundamental basis of almost all CFD problems is the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], which define many single-phase (gas or liquid, but not both) fluid flows.  These equations can be simplified by removing terms describing [[viscous]] actions to yield the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].  Further simplification, by removing terms describing [[vorticity]] yields the [[full potential equation]]s. Finally, for small [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]]s in subsonic and [[supersonic]] flows (not [[transonic]] or [[hypersonic]]) these equations can be [[Linearization|linearized]] to yield the linearized potential equations.

Historically, methods were first developed to solve the linearized potential equations. Two-dimensional (2D) methods, using [[conformal transformation]]s of the flow about a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] to the flow about an [[airfoil]] were developed in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milne-Thomson|first=L.M.|authorlink=L. M. Milne-Thomson|title=Theoretical Aerodynamics|year=1973|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-61980-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest type of calculations resembling modern CFD are those by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]], in the sense that these calculations used finite differences and divided the physical space in cells. Although they failed dramatically, these calculations, together with Richardson's book "Weather prediction by numerical process",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Weather prediction by numerical process|year=1965|publisher=Dover Publications|author=Richardson, L. F.|author2=Chapman, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; set the basis for modern CFD and numerical meteorology. In fact, early CFD calculations during the 1940s using [[ENIAC]] used methods close to those in Richardson's 1922 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|title=Lewis Fry Richardson and his contributions to mathematics, meteorology, and models of conflict|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|year=1997|volume=30|doi=10.1146/annurev.fluid.30.1.0|bibcode = 1998AnRFM..30D..13H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer power available paced development of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] methods.  Probably the first work using computers to model fluid flow, as governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, was performed at [[Los Alamos National Lab]], in the T3 group.&lt;ref name=legacy_T3&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legacy of Group T-3|url=https://www.lanl.gov/orgs/t/t3/history.shtml#early|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harlow2004fluid&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harlow|first=F.

Harlow]], who is widely considered as one of the pioneers of CFD. From 1957 to late 1960s, this group developed a variety of numerical methods to simulate transient two-dimensional fluid flows, such as 
[[Particle-in-cell]] method (Harlow, 1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Francis H. Harlow|F.H. Harlow]]|title=A Machine Calculation Method for Hydrodynamic Problems|publisher=Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory report LAMS-1956|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first paper with three-dimensional model was published by John Hess and [[A.M.O. Smith]] of [[Douglas Aircraft]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=J.L.|author2=A.M.O.

Their method itself was simplified, in that it did not include lifting flows and hence was mainly applied to ship hulls and aircraft fuselages.  The first lifting Panel Code (A230) was described in a paper written by Paul Rubbert and Gary Saaris of Boeing Aircraft in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Rubbert, Paul and Saaris, Gary, "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1972-188 Review and Evaluation of a Three-Dimensional Lifting Potential Flow Analysis Method for Arbitrary Configurations]," AIAA paper 72-188, presented at the AIAA 10th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, San Diego California, January 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  In time, more advanced three-dimensional Panel Codes were developed at [[Boeing]] (PANAIR, A502),&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, R. and Erickson, L.L., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1981-1255 PAN AIR - A Higher Order Panel Method for Predicting Subsonic or Supersonic Linear Potential Flows About Arbitrary Configurations]," AIAA paper 81-1255, presented at the AIAA 14th Fluid and Plasma Dynamics Conference, Palo Alto California, June 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] (Quadpan),&lt;ref&gt;Youngren, H.H., Bouchard, E.E., Coopersmith, R.M. and Miranda, L.R., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1983-1827 Comparison of Panel Method Formulations and its Influence on the Development of QUADPAN, an Advanced Low Order Method]," AIAA paper 83-1827, presented at the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Danvers, Massachusetts, July 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] (HESS),&lt;ref&gt;Hess, J.L. and Friedman, D.M., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1983-1828 Analysis of Complex Inlet Configurations Using a Higher-Order Panel Method]," AIAA paper 83-1828, presented at the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Danvers, Massachusetts, July 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonnell Aircraft]] (MACAERO),&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D.R., "[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800007773.pdf Development of Panel Methods for Subsonic Analysis and Design]," NASA CR-3234, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] (PMARC)&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, Dale L.; Dudley, Michael R.; Iguchi, Steve K.; Browne, Lindsey and Katz, Joseph, “[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19920023178.pdf Potential Flow Theory and Operation Guide for the Panel Code PMARC]”, NASA NASA-TM-102851 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and Analytical Methods (WBAERO,&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, F.A., Dvorak, F.A. and Geller, E.W., "[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/782202.pdf A Computer Program for Three-Dimensional Lifting Bodies in Subsonic Inviscid Flow]," USAAMRDL Technical Report, TR 74-18, Ft. Eustis, Virginia, April 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; USAERO&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. and Maskew, B., "Unsteady Low-Speed Aerodynamic Model for Complete Aircraft Configurations," AIAA paper 86-2180, presented at the AIAA Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Conference, Williamsburg Virginia, August 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and VSAERO&lt;ref&gt;Maskew, Brian, "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/3.57369 Prediction of Subsonic Aerodynamic Characteristics: A Case for Low-Order Panel Methods]," AIAA paper 81-0252, presented at the AIAA 19th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, St. Louis, Missouri, January 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maskew, Brian, “[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19900004884.pdf Program VSAERO Theory Document: A Computer Program for Calculating Nonlinear Aerodynamic Characteristics of Arbitrary Configurations]”, NASA CR-4023, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Some (PANAIR, HESS and MACAERO) were higher order codes, using higher order distributions of surface singularities, while others (Quadpan, PMARC, USAERO and VSAERO) used single singularities on each surface panel.  The advantage of the lower order codes was that they ran much faster on the computers of the time.  Today, VSAERO has grown to be a multi-order code and is the most widely used program of this class. It has been used in the development of many [[submarine]]s, surface [[ship]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[aircraft]], and more recently [[wind turbines]].  Its sister code, USAERO is an unsteady panel method that has also been used for modeling such things as high speed trains and racing [[yacht]]s.  The NASA PMARC code from an early version of VSAERO and a derivative of PMARC, named CMARC,&lt;ref&gt;Pinella, David and Garrison, Peter, “Digital Wind Tunnel CMARC; Three-Dimensional Low-Order Panel Codes,” Aerologic, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is also commercially available.

In the two-dimensional realm, a number of Panel Codes have been developed for airfoil analysis and design.  The codes typically have a [[boundary layer]] analysis included, so that viscous effects can be modeled.  Professor Richard Eppler of the [[University of Stuttgart]] developed the [http://www.pdas.com/eppler.html PROFILE] code, partly with NASA funding, which became available in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Eppler, R.; Somers, D. M., "[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800020753.pdf A Computer Program for the Design and Analysis of Low-Speed Airfoils]," NASA TM-80210, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was soon followed by [[MIT]] Professor Mark Drela's [[XFOIL]] code.&lt;ref&gt;Drela, Mark, "[http://www.web.mit.edu/drela/Public/papers/xfoil_sv.pdf XFOIL: An Analysis and Design System for Low Reynolds Number Airfoils]," in Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Engineering, No. 54, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both PROFILE and XFOIL incorporate two-dimensional panel codes, with coupled boundary layer codes for airfoil analysis work.  PROFILE uses a [[conformal transformation]] method for inverse airfoil design, while XFOIL has both a conformal transformation and an inverse panel method for airfoil design.

An intermediate step between Panel Codes and Full Potential codes were codes that used the Transonic Small Disturbance equations.  In particular, the three-dimensional WIBCO code,&lt;ref&gt;Boppe, C.W., "Calculation of Transonic Wing Flows by Grid Embedding," AIAA paper 77-207, presented at the AIAA 15th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Los Angeles California, January 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Charlie Boppe of [[Grumman Aircraft]] in the early 1980s has seen heavy use.

Developers turned to Full Potential codes, as panel methods could not calculate the non-linear flow present at [[transonic]] speeds.  The first description of a means of using the Full Potential equations was published by Earll Murman and [[Julian Cole]] of Boeing in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Murman, Earll and Cole, Julian, "Calculation of Plane Steady Transonic Flow," AIAA paper 70-188, presented at the AIAA 8th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, New York New York, January 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Frances Bauer, [[Paul Garabedian]] and [[David Korn (computer scientist)|David Korn]] of the Courant Institute at [[New York University]] (NYU) wrote a series of two-dimensional Full Potential airfoil codes that were widely used, the most important being named Program H.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, F., Garabedian, P., and Korn, D. G., "A Theory of Supercritical Wing Sections, with Computer Programs and Examples," Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems 66, Springer-Verlag, May 1972. {{ISBN|978-3540058076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further growth of Program H was developed by Bob Melnik and his group at [[Grumman Aerospace]] as Grumfoil.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, H. R.; Melnik, R. E., "[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19860002735.pdf GRUMFOIL: A computer code for the viscous transonic flow over airfoils]," NASA CR-3806, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Antony Jameson]], originally at Grumman Aircraft and the Courant Institute of NYU, worked with David Caughey to develop the important three-dimensional Full Potential code FLO22&lt;ref&gt;Jameson A. and Caughey D., "A Finite Volume Method for Transonic Potential Flow Calculations," AIAA paper 77-635, presented at the Third AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Conference, Alburquerque New Mexico, June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1975.  Many Full Potential codes emerged after this, culminating in Boeing's Tranair (A633) code,&lt;ref&gt;Samant, S.S., Bussoletti J.E., Johnson F.T., Burkhart, R.H., Everson, B.L., Melvin, R.G., Young, D.P., Erickson, L.L., Madson M.D. and Woo, A.C., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1987-34 TRANAIR: A Computer Code for Transonic Analyses of Arbitrary Configurations]," AIAA paper 87-0034, presented at the AIAA 25th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno Nevada, January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; which still sees heavy use.

The next step was the Euler equations, which promised to provide more accurate solutions of transonic flows.  The methodology used by Jameson in his three-dimensional FLO57 code&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, A., Schmidt, W. and Turkel, E., "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.464.3391&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Numerical Solution of the Euler Equations by Finite Volume Methods Using Runge-Kutta Time-Stepping Schemes]," AIAA paper 81-1259, presented at the AIAA 14th Fluid and Plasma Dynamics
Conference, Palo Alto California, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; (1981) was used by others to produce such programs as Lockheed's TEAM program&lt;ref&gt;Raj, P. and Brennan, J.E., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/3.45717 Improvements to an Euler Aerodynamic Method for Transonic Flow Simulation]," AIAA paper 87-0040, presented at the 25th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno Nevada, January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and IAI/Analytical Methods' MGAERO program.&lt;ref&gt;Tidd, D.M., Strash, D.J., Epstein, B., Luntz, A., Nachshon A. and Rubin T., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1991-3236 Application of an Efficient 3-D Multigrid Euler Method (MGAERO) to Complete Aircraft Configurations]," AIAA paper 91-3236, presented at the AIAA 9th Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Baltimore Maryland, September 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  MGAERO is unique in being a structured [[cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] mesh code, while most other such codes use structured body-fitted grids (with the exception of NASA's highly successful CART3D code,&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J.E., Berger, M.J., Aftosmis, M.J. and Wong, M.D., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1995-853 3D Application of a Cartesian Grid Euler Method]," AIAA paper 95-0853, presented at the 33rd Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, Reno Nevada, January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Lockheed's SPLITFLOW code&lt;ref&gt;Karmna, Steve L. Jr., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1995-343 SPLITFLOW: A 3D Unstructurted Cartesian Prismatic Grid CFD Code for Complex Geometries]," AIAA paper 95-0343, presented at the 33rd Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, Reno Nevada, January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]'s NASCART-GT).&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, D., and Ruffin, S.M., " [http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&amp;context=aero_fac An Embedded Boundary Cartesian Grid Scheme for Viscous Flows using a New Viscous Wall Boundary Condition Treatment],” AIAA Paper 2004-0581, presented at the AIAA 42nd Aerospace Sciences Meeting, January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antony Jameson]] also developed the three-dimensional AIRPLANE code&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, A., Baker, T.J. and Weatherill, N.P., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1986-103 Calculation of Inviscid Tramonic Flow over a Complete Aircraft]," AIAA paper 86-0103, presented at the AIAA 24th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno Nevada, January 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; which made use of unstructured tetrahedral grids.

In the two-dimensional realm, Mark Drela and Michael Giles, then graduate students at MIT, developed the ISES Euler program&lt;ref&gt;Giles, M., Drela, M. and Thompkins, W.T. Jr., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1985-1530 Newton Solution of Direct and Inverse Transonic Euler Equations]," AIAA paper 85-1530, presented at the Third Symposium on Numerical and Physical Aspects of Aerodynamic Flows, Long Beach, California, January 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; (actually a suite of programs) for airfoil design and analysis.  This code first became available in 1986 and has been further developed to design, analyze and optimize single or multi-element airfoils, as the MSES program.&lt;ref&gt;Drela, M. "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1990-1470 Newton Solution of Coupled Viscous/Inviscid Multielement Airfoil Flows],", AIAA paper 90-1470, presented at the AIAA 21st Fluid Dynamics, Plasma Dynamics and Lasers Conference, Seattle Washington, June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  MSES sees wide use throughout the world.  A derivative of MSES, for the design and analysis of airfoils in a cascade, is MISES,&lt;ref&gt;Drela, M. and Youngren H., "A User's Guide to MISES 2.53", MIT Computational Sciences Laboratory, December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Harold "Guppy" Youngren while he was a graduate student at MIT.

The Navier–Stokes equations were the ultimate target of development.  Two-dimensional codes, such as NASA Ames' ARC2D code first emerged.  A number of three-dimensional codes were developed (ARC3D, [[Overflow (software)|OVERFLOW]], CFL3D are three successful NASA contributions), leading to numerous commercial packages.

==Methodology==
In all of these approaches the same basic procedure is followed.
* During [[preprocessor (CAE)|preprocessing]]
** The [[geometry]] and physical bounds of the problem can be defined using [[Computer-aided design|computer aided design]] (CAD). From there, data can be suitably processed (cleaned-up) and the fluid volume (or fluid domain) is extracted.
** The [[volume]] occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non-uniform, structured or unstructured, consisting of a combination of hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal or polyhedral elements.
** The physical modeling is defined – for example, the equations of fluid motion + [[enthalpy]] + radiation + species conservation
** Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behaviour and properties at all bounding surfaces of the fluid domain. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.
* The [[computer simulation|simulation]] is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady-state or transient.
* Finally a postprocessor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resulting solution.

===Discretization methods===
{{further|Discretization of Navier–Stokes equations}}

The stability of the selected discretisation is generally established numerically rather than analytically as with simple linear problems.  Special care must also be taken to ensure that the discretisation handles discontinuous solutions gracefully.  The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] and [[Navier–Stokes equations]] both admit shocks, and contact surfaces.

Some of the discretization methods being used are:

The finite volume method (FVM) is a common approach used in CFD codes, as it has an advantage in [[Random-access memory|memory]] usage and solution speed, especially for large problems, high [[Reynolds number]] turbulent flows, and source term dominated flows (like combustion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patankar|first=Suhas V.|authorlink=Suhas Patankar|title=Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid FLow|year=1980|publisher=Hemisphere Publishing Corporation
|isbn=0891165223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the finite volume method, the governing partial differential equations (typically the Navier-Stokes equations, the mass and energy conservation equations, and the turbulence equations) are recast in a conservative form, and then solved over discrete control volumes. This [[discretization]] guarantees the conservation of fluxes through a particular control volume. The finite volume equation yields governing equations in the form,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iiint Q\, dV + \iint F\, d\mathbf{A} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of conserved variables, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of fluxes (see [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] or [[Navier–Stokes equations]]), &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the control volume element, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface area of the control volume element.

==== Finite element method ====

{{Main article|Finite element method}}

The finite element method (FEM) is used in structural analysis of solids, but is also applicable to fluids.  However, the FEM formulation requires special care to ensure a conservative solution. The FEM formulation has been adapted for use with fluid dynamics governing equations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Although FEM must be carefully formulated to be conservative, it is much more stable than the finite volume approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In this method, a weighted residual equation is formed:

:&lt;math&gt;R_i = \iiint W_i Q \, dV^e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is the equation residual at an element vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the conservation equation expressed on an element basis, &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; is the weight factor, and &lt;math&gt;V^{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the element.

==== Finite difference method ====

{{Main article|Finite difference method}}

The finite difference method (FDM) has historical importance{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and is simple to program.  It is currently only used in few specialized codes, which handle complex geometry with high accuracy and efficiency by using embedded boundaries or overlapping grids (with the solution interpolated across each grid).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} 
:&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+
\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}+
\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}+
\frac{\partial H}{\partial z}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of conserved variables, and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are the fluxes in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; directions respectively.

==== Spectral element method ====

{{Main article|Spectral element method}}

Spectral element method is a finite element type method. It requires the mathematical problem (the partial differential equation) to be cast in a weak formulation. This is typically done by multiplying the differential equation by an arbitrary test function and integrating over the whole domain. Purely mathematically, the test functions are completely arbitrary - they belong to an infinite-dimensional function space. Clearly an infinite-dimensional function space cannot be represented on a discrete spectral element mesh; this is where the spectral element discretization begins. The most crucial thing is the choice of interpolating and testing functions. In a standard, low order FEM in 2D, for quadrilateral elements the most typical choice is the bilinear test or interpolating function of the form &lt;math&gt;v(x,y) = ax+by+cxy+d&lt;/math&gt;. In a spectral element method however, the interpolating and test functions are chosen to be polynomials of a very high order (typically e.g. of the 10th order in CFD applications). This guarantees the rapid convergence of the method. Furthermore, very efficient integration procedures must be used, since the number of integrations to be performed in numerical codes is big. Thus, high order Gauss integration quadratures are employed, since they achieve the highest accuracy with the smallest number of computations to be carried out.
At the time there are some academic CFD codes based on the spectral element method and some more are currently under development, since the new time-stepping schemes arise in the scientific world.

==== Boundary element method ====

{{Main article|Boundary element method}}

In the boundary element method, the boundary occupied by the fluid is divided into a surface mesh.

==== High-resolution discretization schemes ====

{{Main article|High-resolution scheme}}

High-resolution schemes are used where shocks or discontinuities are present. Capturing sharp changes in the solution requires the use of second or higher-order numerical schemes that do not introduce spurious oscillations. This usually necessitates the application of [[flux limiters]] to ensure that the solution is [[total variation diminishing]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Turbulence models===

In computational modeling of turbulent flows, one common objective is to obtain a model that can predict quantities of interest, such as fluid velocity, for use in engineering designs of the system being modeled.  For turbulent flows, the range of length scales and complexity of phenomena involved in turbulence make most modeling approaches prohibitively expensive; the resolution required to resolve all scales involved in turbulence is beyond what is computationally possible.  The primary approach in such cases is to create numerical models to approximate unresolved phenomena.  This section lists some commonly used computational models for turbulent flows.

Turbulence models can be classified based on computational expense, which corresponds to the range of scales that are modeled versus resolved (the more turbulent scales that are resolved, the finer the resolution of the simulation, and therefore the higher the computational cost). If a majority or all of the turbulent scales are not modeled, the computational cost is very low, but the tradeoff comes in the form of decreased accuracy.

In addition to the wide range of length and time scales and the associated computational cost, the governing equations of fluid dynamics contain a [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] convection term and a non-linear and non-local pressure gradient term.  These nonlinear equations must be solved numerically with the appropriate boundary and initial conditions.

==== Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes ====
{{main article|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations}}

[[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes]] (RANS) equations are the oldest approach to turbulence modeling. An ensemble version of the governing equations is solved, which introduces new ''apparent stresses'' known as [[Reynolds stresses]]. This adds a second order tensor of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations do not apply to flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are 'time-averaged'. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid only as long as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time scales of the turbulent motion containing most of the energy.

RANS models can be divided into two broad approaches:

; [[Turbulence modeling|Boussinesq hypothesis]]: This method involves using an algebraic equation for the Reynolds stresses which include determining the turbulent viscosity, and depending on the level of sophistication of the model, solving transport equations for determining the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation. Models include k-ε ([[Brian Launder|Launder]] and [[Brian Spalding|Spalding]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Launder|first=B.E.|author2=D.B. Spalding|year=1974|title= The Numerical Computation of Turbulent Flows|journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering|pages=269–289|doi = 10.1016/0045-7825(74)90029-2|bibcode = 1974CMAME...3..269L|volume=3|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing Length Model ([[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl]]),&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=David C.|title=Turbulence Modeling for CFD|year=2006|publisher=DCW Industries, Inc.|isbn=978-1-928729-08-2|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zero Equation Model (Cebeci and [[Apollo M. O. Smith|Smith]]).&lt;ref name=wilcox /&gt; The models available in this approach are often referred to by the number of transport equations associated with the method. For example, the Mixing Length model is a "Zero Equation" model because no transport equations are solved; the &lt;math&gt;k-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a "Two Equation" model because two transport equations (one for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and one for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;) are solved.
; [[Reynolds stress model]] (RSM): This approach attempts to actually solve transport equations for the Reynolds stresses. This means introduction of several transport equations for all the Reynolds stresses and hence this approach is much more costly in CPU effort.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

====Large eddy simulation====
{{main article|Large eddy simulation}}

[[Image:LESPremixedFlame.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Volume rendering of a non-premixed swirl flame as simulated by LES.]]
[[Large eddy simulation]] (LES) is a technique in which the smallest scales of the flow are removed through a filtering operation, and their effect modeled using subgrid scale models.  This allows the largest and most important scales of the turbulence to be resolved, while greatly reducing the computational cost incurred by the smallest scales. This method requires greater computational resources than RANS methods, but is far cheaper than DNS.

====Detached eddy simulation====
{{main article|Detached eddy simulation}}

[[Detached eddy simulation]]s (DES) is a modification of a RANS model in which the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for LES calculations. Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent length scale is less than the maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent length scale exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. Therefore, the grid resolution for DES is not as demanding as pure LES, thereby considerably cutting down the cost of the computation. Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model (Spalart et al., 1997), it can be implemented with other RANS models (Strelets, 2001), by appropriately modifying the length scale which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. So while Spalart–Allmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions.

====Direct numerical simulation====
{{main article|Direct numerical simulation}}

[[Direct numerical simulation]] (DNS) resolves the entire range of turbulent length scales.  This marginalizes the effect of models, but is extremely expensive.  The computational cost is proportional to &lt;math&gt;Re^{3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Pope_2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=Turbulent Flows|author=Pope, S.B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-59886-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNS is intractable for flows with complex geometries or flow configurations.

====Coherent vortex simulation====

The coherent vortex simulation approach decomposes the turbulent flow field into a coherent part, consisting of organized vortical motion, and the incoherent part, which is the random background flow.&lt;ref name="Farge_2001"&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1023/A:1013512726409
|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decomposition is done using [[wavelet]] filtering.  The approach has much in common with LES, since it uses decomposition and resolves only the filtered portion, but different in that it does not use a linear, low-pass filter.  Instead, the filtering operation is based on wavelets, and the filter can be adapted as the flow field evolves.  [[Marie Farge|Farge]] and Schneider tested the CVS method with two flow configurations and showed that the coherent portion of the flow exhibited the &lt;math&gt;-\frac{40}{39}&lt;/math&gt; energy spectrum exhibited by the total flow, and corresponded to coherent structures ([[vortex stretching|vortex tubes]]), while the incoherent parts of the flow composed homogeneous background noise, which exhibited no organized structures.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied the FDV model to large eddy simulation, but did not assume that the wavelet filter completely eliminated all coherent motions from the subfilter scales.  By employing both LES and CVS filtering, they showed that the SFS dissipation was dominated by the SFS flow field's coherent portion.

====PDF methods====

[[Probability density function]] (PDF) methods for turbulence, first introduced by [[Thomas S. Lundgren|Lundgren]],&lt;ref name="Lundgren_1969"&gt;{{cite journal

This approach is analogous to the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases, in which the macroscopic properties of a gas are described by a large number of particles.  PDF methods are unique in that they can be applied in the framework of a number of different turbulence models; the main differences occur in the form of the PDF transport equation.  For example, in the context of [[large eddy simulation]], the PDF becomes the filtered PDF.&lt;ref name="Colucci_1998"&gt;{{cite journal

The PDF is commonly tracked by using Lagrangian particle methods; when combined with large eddy simulation, this leads to a [[Langevin equation]] for subfilter particle evolution.

====Vortex method====
The vortex method is a grid-free technique for the simulation of turbulent flows. It uses vortices as the computational elements, mimicking the physical structures in turbulence. Vortex methods were developed as a grid-free methodology that would not be limited by the fundamental smoothing effects associated with grid-based methods. To be practical, however, vortex methods require means for rapidly computing velocities from the vortex elements – in other words they require the solution to a particular form of the [[N-body problem]] (in which the motion of N objects is tied to their mutual influences). A breakthrough came in the late 1980s with the development of the [[fast multipole method]] (FMM), an algorithm by V. Rokhlin (Yale) and L. Greengard (Courant Institute). This breakthrough paved the way to practical computation of the velocities from the vortex elements and is the basis of successful algorithms.  They are especially well-suited to simulating filamentary motion, such as wisps of smoke, in real-time simulations such as video games, because of the fine detail achieved using minimal computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software based on the vortex method offer a new means for solving tough fluid dynamics problems with minimal user intervention.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  All that is required is specification of problem geometry and setting of boundary and initial conditions. Among the significant advantages of this modern technology;
* It is practically grid-free, thus eliminating numerous iterations associated with RANS and LES.
* All problems are treated identically. No modeling or calibration inputs are required.
* Time-series simulations, which are crucial for correct analysis of acoustics, are possible.
* The small scale and large scale are accurately simulated at the same time.

====Vorticity confinement method====

{{Main article|Vorticity confinement}}

The [[vorticity confinement]] (VC) method is an Eulerian technique used in the simulation of turbulent wakes. It uses a solitary-wave like approach to produce a stable solution with no numerical spreading. VC can capture the small-scale features to within as few as 2 grid cells. Within these features, a nonlinear difference equation is solved as opposed to the [[finite difference equation]]. VC is similar to [[shock capturing methods]], where conservation laws are satisfied, so that the essential integral quantities are accurately computed.

====Linear eddy model====

The Linear eddy model is a technique used to simulate the convective mixing that takes place in turbulent flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Steven K.|title=Linear Eddy Simulations Of Mixing In A Homogeneous Turbulent Flow|journal=Physics of Fluids|year=1993|volume=5|issue=4|pages=1023|bibcode = 1993PhFl....5.1023M |doi = 10.1063/1.858667 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it provides a mathematical way to describe the interactions of a scalar variable within the vector flow field. It is primarily used in one-dimensional representations of turbulent flow, since it can be applied across a wide range of length scales and Reynolds numbers. This model is generally used as a building block for more complicated flow representations, as it provides high resolution predictions that hold across a large range of flow conditions.

===Two-phase flow===

[[File:Bubble-rising.jpg|thumb|right|Simulation of bubble swarm using [[volume of fluid method]]]]

The modeling of [[two-phase flow]] is still under development. Different methods have been proposed, including the [[Volume of fluid method]], the [[level-set method]] and [[front tracking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hirt|last2=Nichols|first1=C.W.|first2=B.D.|title=Volume of fluid (VOF) method for the dynamics of free boundaries|year=1981|publisher=Journal of Computational Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Unverdi |first1=S.O.|last2=Tryggvason|first2=G.|authorlink2=Gretar Tryggvason|title=A Front-Tracking Method for Viscous, Incompressible, Multi-Fluid Flows|year=1992|publisher=J. Comput. Phys}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These methods often involve a tradeoff between maintaining a sharp interface or conserving mass {{According to whom|date=November 2010}}.  This is crucial since the evaluation of the density, viscosity and surface tension is based on the values averaged over the interface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Lagrangian multiphase models, which are used for dispersed media, are based on solving the Lagrangian equation of motion for the dispersed phase.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Solution algorithms===

Discretization in the space produces a system of [[ordinary differential equations]] for unsteady problems and algebraic equations for steady problems. Implicit or semi-implicit methods are generally used to integrate the ordinary differential equations, producing a system of (usually) nonlinear algebraic equations.  Applying a [[Newton's method#Nonlinear systems of equations|Newton]] or [[Fixed point iteration|Picard]] iteration produces a system of linear equations which is nonsymmetric in the presence of advection and indefinite in the presence of incompressibility. Such systems, particularly in 3D, are frequently too large for direct solvers, so iterative methods are used, either stationary methods such as [[Successive over-relaxation|successive overrelaxation]] or [[Krylov subspace]] methods. Krylov methods such as [[Generalized minimal residual method|GMRES]], typically used with [[Preconditioner|preconditioning]], operate by minimizing the residual over successive subspaces generated by the preconditioned operator.

[[Multigrid method|Multigrid]] has the advantage of asymptotically optimal performance on many problems. Traditional{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} solvers and preconditioners are effective at reducing high-frequency components of the residual, but low-frequency components typically require many iterations to reduce. By operating on multiple scales, multigrid reduces all components of the residual by similar factors, leading to a mesh-independent number of iterations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

For indefinite systems, preconditioners such as [[incomplete LU factorization]], [[Additive Schwarz method|additive Schwarz]], and [[Multigrid method|multigrid]] perform poorly or fail entirely, so the problem structure must be used for effective preconditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Biomedical engineering===

[[File:Vel-Streamline-FC.jpg|thumb|right|Simulation of blood flow in a human [[aorta]]]]
CFD investigations are used to clarify the characteristics of aortic flow in detail that are otherwise invisible to experimental measurements. To analyze these conditions, CAD models of the human vascular system are extracted employing modern imaging techniques. A 3D model is reconstructed from this data and the fluid flow can be computed. Blood properties like Non-Newtonian behavior and realistic boundary conditions (e.g.  systemic pressure) have to be taken into consideration. Therefore, making it possible to analyze and optimize the flow in the cardiovascular system for different applications.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, T.A.S., Graefe, R., Hormes, M., Schmitz-Rode, T. and Steinseiferand, U., "Computational Fluid Dynamics in Biomedical Engineering", Computational Fluid Dynamics: Theory, Analysis and Applications , pp. 109–136&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CPU versus GPU ===
Traditionally, CFD simulations are performed on CPU's&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=central processing unit|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_9750|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a more recent trend, simulations are also performed on GPU's&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Graphics processing unit|date=2018-06-23|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graphics_processing_unit&amp;oldid=847182694|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These typically contain slower but more processors. For CFD algorithms that feature good parallellisation performance (i.e. good speed-up by adding more cores) this can greatly reduce simulation times. Lattice-Boltzmann methods are a typical example of codes that scale well on GPU's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nvidia.com/content/intersect-360-HPC-application-support.pdf|title=Intersect 360 HPC application Support|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservation psychology''' is the scientific study of the reciprocal relationships between [[human]]s and the rest of [[nature]], with a particular focus on how to encourage [[conservation movement|conservation]] of the [[natural environment|natural world]].&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;Saunders, C.D. 2003. The Emerging Field of Conservation Psychology. Human Ecology Review, Vol. 10, No, 2. 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a specialty area within [[psychology]] itself, it is a growing field for scientists, researchers, and practitioners of all disciplines to come together and better understand the earth and what can be done to preserve it. This network seeks to understand why humans hurt or help the environment and what can be done to change such behavior. The term "conservation psychology" refers to any fields of psychology that have understandable knowledge about the environment and the effects humans have on the natural world. Conservation psychologists use their abilities in "greening" psychology and make society [[ecologically sustainable]].&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;[http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~gmyers/cp/ Myers, Gene. ''Conservation Psychology''. WWU. January 20, 2002.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219133545/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~gmyers/cp/ |date=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of conservation psychology is oriented toward environmental sustainability, which includes concerns like the conservation of [[natural resources|resources]], conservation of [[ecosystem]]s, and quality of life issues for humans and other [[species]].&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt;

One common issue is a lack of understanding of the distinction between conservation psychology and the more-established field of [[environmental psychology]], which is the study of transactions between individuals and all their physical settings, including how people change both the built and the natural environments and how those environments change them.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, R. 2007. Environmental Psychology: Principles and Practice (4th ed.). Colville, WA: Optimal Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental psychology began in the late 1960s (the first formal program with that name was established at the City University of New York in 1968), and is the term most commonly used around the world. Its definition as including human transactions with both the natural and built environments goes back to its beginnings, as exemplified in these quotes from three 1974 textbooks: "Environmental psychology is the study of the interrelationship between behavior and the built and natural environment"&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P.A., Fisher, J. D., &amp; Loomis, R.J.  1974. Environmental Psychology. Philadelphia PA: Saunders (p. 6).&lt;/ref&gt; and "...the natural environment is studied as both a problem area, with respect to [[environmental degradation]], and as a setting for certain recreational and psychological needs",&lt;ref&gt;Ittelson, W.H., Proshansky, H.M., Rivlin, L.G., Winkel, G.H. 1974. Environmental Psychology: An Introduction. New York: Hold, Rinehart, and Winston (p. 6),&lt;/ref&gt; and a third that included a chapter entitled The Natural Environment and Behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Heimstra, N.W. &amp; McFarling, L.H.  1974. Environmental Psychology. Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation psychology, proposed more recently in 2003 and mainly identified with a group of US academics with ties to zoos and environmental studies departments, began with a primary focus on the relations between humans and animals. Introduced in ecology, policy, and biology journals, some have suggested that it should be expanded to try to understand why humans feel the need to help or hurt the environment, along with how to promote conservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clayton|first=S|author2=Brook, A|title=Can Psychology Save the World?  A Model for Conservation Psychology|journal=[[Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy]] |date=Dec 2005|volume=5|issue=1|pages=87–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneers in this field==
Psychologists from all fields including philosophy, biology, sociology, industrial and organizational, health, and consumer psychology, along with many other subfields like environmental education and [[conservation biology]] come together to put their knowledge to practice in educating others to work together and encourage a congruous relationship between humans and the environment around them. These psychologists work together with places such as zoos and aquariums. Zoos and aquariums may seem to only be places of recreation and fun but are actually trying hard to put positive messages out and to educate the public on the homes and needs of the animals that live there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitgood|first=Stephen C.|title=Environmental psychology in museums, zoos, and other exhibition centers|year=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|location=NJ|isbn=0-471-40594-9|pages=461–480}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are trying to find ways to interact and teach the public the consequences of their day to day actions to the animals and the environment rather than simply viewing the animals. Psychologists and sociologists have been visiting workshops and think tanks at the zoos to evaluate if the animals are being viewed and shown to the best of their ability while still giving informative knowledge to the public.

==Research to consider==
What characterizes conservation psychology research is that in addition to descriptive and theoretical analyses, studies will explore how to cause the kinds of changes that lessen the impact of human behavior on the natural environment, and that lead to more sustainable and harmonious relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Zelezny, L.C. &amp; Schultz, P.W. (eds.). 2000. Promoting environmentalism. Journal of Social Issues 56, 3, 365–578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, C.M. 1999. Psychological perspectives on sustainability. In E. Becker and T. Jahn (eds.), Sustainability and the Social Sciences: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Integrating Environmental Considerations into Theoretical Reorientation, 223–42. London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research being done with respect to conservation is estimating exactly how much land and water resources are being used by each human at this point along with projected future growth.  Also important to consider is the partitioning of land for this future growth.  Additionally, conservation efforts look at the positive and negative consequences for the biodiversity of plant and animal life after humans have used the land to their advantage.  In addition to creating better conceptual models, more applied research is needed to: 1) identify the most promising strategies for fostering ways of caring about nature, 2) find ways to reframe debates and strategically communicate to the existing values that people have, 3) identify the most promising strategies for shifting the societal discourse about human–nature relationships, and 4) measure the success of these applications with respect to the conservation psychology mission.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; The ultimate success of conservation psychology will be based on whether its research resulted in programs and applications that made a difference with respect to environmental sustainability. We need to be able to measure the effectiveness of the programs in terms of their impact on behavior formation or behavior change, using tools developed by conservation psychologists.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt;

== Present research and future planning ==
Conservation psychology research has broken down the four most important tenets of promoting positive conservation attitudes into "the four 'I's".&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Vugt|first=Mark|title=Averting the Tragedy of the Commons: Using Social Psychological Science to Protect the Environment|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=1 June 2009|volume=18|issue=3|pages=169–173|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01630.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include: Information, Identity, Institutions, and Incentives.  Research has been done in all four categories.

=== Information ===
Studies have shown that the way in which crises are presented is a key predictor for how people will react to them.  When people hear that they personally can help to alleviate a crisis through their conservation efforts, just by simple actions with their personal energy use, they are more likely to conserve.  However, if people are told that the other people around them are overusing energy, it increases selfish behavior and causes people to actually consume more.&lt;ref name="SAUNDERS 702–705"&gt;{{cite journal|last=SAUNDERS|first=CAROL D. |author2=BROOK, AMARA T. |author3=EUGENE MYERS, OLIN|title=Using Psychology to Save Biodiversity and Human Well-Being|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 June 2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=702–705|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00435.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching people about the benefits of conservation, including easy ways to help conserve, is an effective way to inform about and promote more environmentally friendly behavior.&lt;ref name="Huber 409–425"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=Patrick R.|author2=Greco, Steven E. |author3=Thorne, James H. |title=Boundaries Make a Difference: The Effects of Spatial and Temporal Parameters on Conservation Planning*|journal=The Professional Geographer|date=24 June 2010|volume=62|issue=3|pages=409–425|doi=10.1080/00330121003788309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, research has shown that making sure people understand more about the boundaries of land they can help preserve actually improves positive attitudes towards conservation.  When people know more about local regions they can help protect, they will care more.  Knowing more about the regions includes knowing the extent of the [[biodiversity]] in that region, and being sure that the ecosystem will remain healthy and protected.  Cost analysis is another important factor.  People do not want to take risks on valuable lands, which in places like California, could be worth billions.&lt;ref name="Huber 409–425"/&gt;

=== Identity ===
In general, people like to fit in and identify with their peer social groups.  Studies have shown people identify more intimately with close friends and family, which is why conservation campaigns try to directly address the most people.&lt;ref name="SAUNDERS 702–705"/&gt;  The "think of the children" argument for conservation follows this logic by offering a group everyone can relate to and feel close to.  Studies have also shown that this need to fit in among peer social groups can be reinforced positively or negatively: giving positive feedback on energy bills for conserving in their homes encourages people to continue lower energy use.  Examples of negative [[reinforcement]] include the use of negative press against companies infamous for heavy pollution.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;

Another interesting line of research looks at how people identify positively or negatively with certain issues.  One relevant idea is the notion of "consistency attitudes".  Studies have shown that people tend to take a good association they have, and then use this to make positive or negative links with other, related things.  For example, if someone thinks it is a good idea to protect old Pacific forests, this will positively form a link to also want to protect smaller forests and even grasslands.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bright|first=Alan D.|author2=Barro, Susan C. |author3=Burtz, Randall T. |title=Attitudes Toward the Protection and Restoration of Natural Areas Across Three Geographic Levels: An Examination of Interattitude Consistency1|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=1 November 2001|volume=31|issue=11|pages=2301–2321|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb00177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This same line of thinking can cause someone who supports the protection of old Pacific forests to start thinking negatively about the creation of more logging roads.  Other studies on consistency attitudes have shown that, with one particular issue, people like to align their preferences with each other.  This has been shown repeatedly while looking at political ideologies and racial attitudes, and studies have shown that this can also include environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"/&gt;  Finally, other studies have shown that how people identify an ecosystem geographically can affect their concern for it.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"/&gt;  For instance, when people think of saving the rainforests, they often think of this as a global problem and support it more readily.  However, lesser known but still significant local ecosystems remain ignored and unprotected.

=== Institutions ===
Another approach that has been considered is the use of organized institutions and government as the leaders for promoting conservation.  However, these leaders can only be effective if they are trusted.  Studies from previous crises where conserving resources was extremely necessary showed that people were more likely to obey energy restrictions and follow certain leaders when they felt they could trust the people directing them.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  People need to understand that they are being encouraged to act a certain way out of necessity, and that they are not being misled.

=== Incentives ===
Incentivizing conservation through rewards and fines is another approach.  Studies have shown that people who identify more with their community need less incentives to conserve than those who do not identify strongly with their surrounding community.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  For corporations, monetary incentives have been shown to work for companies showing some effort to make their buildings and practices more "green".&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  Studies have also shown that doing something as simple as putting a water meter in homes has helped incentivize conservation by letting people track their energy consumption levels.  Finally, studies have shown that when giving fines, it is better to start with very small and then raise it for repeated violations.  If the fines are too high, the issue becomes too economic, and people start to mistrust the authorities enforcing the fines.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;

==Main concepts==
Conservation psychology assesses as a whole four different concepts. At the country's first Conservation Psychology conference these four things were discussed. The first is the main original topic of the field, and the other three are topics with a previous history in [[environmental psychology]].

The first topic being discussed is the connection of humans and animals. The Multi-Institutional Research Project (MIRP) works diligently on finding ways to develop a compassionate stance towards animals in the public eye. Many different questions were assessed to find answers to questions concerning ways to help develop loving attitudes for animals and the earth. With these questions and answers, effective educational and interpretive programs were made that would help review the progress.

The second concept that was discussed at the conference concerned connections of humans and places. A new language of conservation will be supported if there are abundant opportunities for meaningful interactions with the natural world in both urban and rural settings. Unfortunately, as biodiversity is lost, every generation has fewer chances to experience nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, P.K., Jr. 1999. The human relationship with nature. Development and culture. Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. 2006. Biodiversity conservation and the extinction of experience. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution: in press.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many questions asked concerning how humans in their everyday lives could be persuaded or educated well enough to make them want to join in programs or activities that help maintain biodiversity in their proximity. Local public and private organizations were asked to come together to help find ways to protect and manage local land, plants, and animals. Other discussions came to whether people on an individual or community level would voluntarily choose to become involved in maintaining and protecting their local biodiversity. These plus many other important questions were contemplated. Techniques in marketing are a key tool in helping people connect to their environment. If an identity could be connected from the environment to towns becoming more urbanized, maybe those living there would be more prone to keep it intact.

The third discussion covered the aspects of producing people who act [[environmentally friendly]]. Collectively, any activities that support sustainability, either by reducing harmful behaviors or by adopting helpful ones, can be called conservation behaviors. Achieving more sustainable relationships with nature will basically require that large numbers of people change their reproductive and consumptive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; Any action, small or large, that helps the environment in any way is a good beginning to a future of generations who only practice environmentally friendly behavior. This may seem to be a far-fetched idea but with any help at all in educating those who do not know the repercussions of their actions could help achieve this. Approaches to encouraging a change in behavior were thought about carefully. Many do not want to change their way of life. A more simplistic lifestyle rather than their materialistic, current lives hurt their environment around them rather than help, but could people willingly change? To take public transportation rather than drive a car, recycling, turning off lights when they are not needed, all these things are very simple yet a nuisance to actually follow through with. Would restructuring tax-code help people to want to change their attitudes? Any concept to reach the goal of helping people act ecologically aware was discussed and approached. Some empirical evidence shows that simply "being the change you want to see in the world" can influence others to behave in more environmentally friendly ways as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sussman, R., &amp; Gifford, R. (2013). Be the Change You Want to See: Modeling Food Composting in Public Places. Environment &amp; Behavior, 45, 323-343, DOI: 10.1177/0013916511431274.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth and final point at the first Conservation Psychology convention was the discussion of the values people have to their environment. Understanding our relationship to the natural world well enough so that we have a language to celebrate and defend that relationship is another research area for conservation psychology. According to the [[biophilia hypothesis]], the [[human]] species evolved in the company of other life forms, and we continue to rely physically, emotionally, and intellectually on the quality and richness of our affiliations with natural diversity.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; A healthy and diverse natural environment is considered an essential condition for human lives of satisfaction and fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;Kellert, S.R. &amp; Wilson E.O. (eds.). 1993. The Biophilia Hypothesis. Washington, DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Where did they get these values and are they ingrained to the point they cannot be changed? How can environmentally educated people convey value-based communication to a community, a nation, or even on a global level? National policy for this model is something that is desired but under such a strong political scrutiny this could be very challenging. Advocates for biodiversity and different programs came together to try to find methods of changing Americans' values concerning their environment and different methods to express and measure them.

==Connection of conservation in biology and psychology==
[[Conservation biology]] was originally conceptualized as a crisis-oriented discipline, with the goal of providing principles and tools for preserving biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Soule, M.E. (1987). History of the Society for Conservation Biology: How and why we got here. Conservation Biology, 1, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a branch of biology that is concerned with preserving genetic variation in plants and animals. This scientific field evolved to study the complex problems surrounding habitat destruction and species protection. The objectives of conservation biologists are to understand how humans affect biodiversity and to provide potential solutions that benefit both humans and non-human species. It is understood in this field that there are underlying fields of biology that could readily help to have a better understanding and contribute to conservation of biodiversity. Biological knowledge alone is not sufficient to solve conservation problems, and the role of the social sciences in solving these problems has become increasingly important.&lt;ref&gt;Mascia, M.B.; Brosius, J.P.; Dobson, T.A.; Forbes, B.C.; Horowitz, L.; McKean, M.A. &amp; N.J. Turner. 2003. Conservation and the social sciences. Conservation Biology 17: 649–50.&lt;/ref&gt; With the knowledge of conservation biology combined with other fields, much was thought to be gained. Psychology is defined as the scientific study of human thought, feeling, and behavior.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; Psychology was one of the fields that could take its concepts and apply them to conservation. It was also always understood that in the field of psychology there could be much aid to be given, the field only had to be developed. Psychology can help in providing insight into moral reasoning and moral functioning, which lie in the heart of human–nature relationships.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; Everyone that is now involved from the field of psychology had knowledge of ways to conceptualize the relationship of humans to their environment. Biology has always been involved in advances of conservation considering biodiversity, and the organisms in it are part of the main field of biology. Psychology has been absent from conservation for some time, but educators and scientists are realizing that with the help of both we can come to a better understanding of humans and their social interactions with their environment and everything in it.

The psychological coping mechanisms are commonly termed ''coping strategies'' or ''coping skills''. The term coping generally refers to adaptive (constructive) coping strategies. That is strategies which reduce stress. In contrast, other coping strategies may be coined as maladaptive, if they increase stress. Maladaptive coping is therefore also described, when looking at the outcome, as non-coping. Furthermore, the term coping generally refers to reactive coping, i.e. the coping response which follows the [[stressor]]. This differs from proactive coping, in which a coping response aims to neutralize a future stressor. Subconscious or non-conscious strategies (e.g. [[defence mechanism|defense mechanisms]]) are generally excluded from the area of coping.

The effectiveness of the coping effort depends on the type of stress, the individual, and the circumstances. Coping responses are partly controlled by [[personality]] (habitual traits), but also partly by the [[social environment]], particularly the nature of the stressful environment.&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100352 |title=Personality and Coping |year=2010 |last1=Carver |first1=Charles S. |last2=Connor-Smith |first2=Jennifer |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=61 |pages=679–704 |pmid=19572784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of coping strategies==
Hundreds of coping strategies have been identified.&lt;ref name ="Carver"/&gt; Classification of these strategies into a broader architecture has not been agreed upon. Common distinctions are often made between various contrasting strategies, for example: problem-focused versus emotion-focused; engagement versus disengagement; cognitive versus behavioral. Weiten for instance, identifies four types of coping strategies:&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;
* '''Appraisal-Focused''' (adaptive cognitive): directed towards challenging personal assumptions.
* '''Problem-Focused''' (adaptive behavioral): reducing or eliminating stressors.
* '''Emotion-Focused''': changing personal emotional reactions.
* '''Occupation-Focused''': directed towards lasting occupation(s), which generates positive feedback

'''Appraisal-focused strategies''' occur when the person modifies the way they think, for example: employing [[denial]], or distancing oneself from the problem. People may alter the way they think about a problem by altering their [[Objective (goal)|goals]] and [[values]], such as by seeing the [[humor]] in a situation: "some have suggested that humor may play a greater role as a stress moderator among women than men".&lt;ref&gt;J. Worell, ''Encyclopedia of Women and Gender'' Vol I (2001) p. 603&lt;/ref&gt;

People using '''problem-focused strategies''' try to deal with the cause of their problem. They do this by finding out [[information]] on the problem and learning new skills to manage the problem. Problem-focused coping is aimed at changing or eliminating the source of the stress. The three problem-focused coping strategies identified by Folkman and Lazarus are: taking control, information seeking, and evaluating the pros and cons.

'''Emotion-focused strategies''' involve:
* releasing pent-up emotions
* distracting oneself
* managing hostile feelings
* [[meditating]]
* using systematic relaxation procedures.
Emotion-focused coping "is oriented toward managing the emotions that accompany the perception of stress".&lt;ref name="Brannon &amp; Feist 2009 pp121-3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brannon |first1=Linda |last2=Feist |first2=Jess |chapter=Personal Coping Strategies |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfCDR_Yl7f0C&amp;pg=PA121 |pages=121–3 |title=Health Psychology: An Introduction to Behavior and Health: An Introduction to Behavior and Health |edition=7th |year=2009 |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-60132-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five emotion-focused coping strategies identified by Folkman and Lazarus&lt;ref name="Robinson 2005 p438"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jenefer |last=Robinson |title=Deeper Than Reason: Emotion and Its Role in Literature, Music, and Art |year=2005 |page=438 |isbn=978-0-19-926365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* disclaiming
* escape-avoidance
* accepting responsibility or blame
* exercising self-control
* and positive reappraisal.
Emotion-focused coping is a mechanism to alleviate distress by minimizing, reducing, or preventing, the emotional components of a stressor.&lt;ref name="Carver, C. S. 2011"&gt;. (Carver, C. S. (2011), Coping. In R. J. Contrada &amp; A. Baum (Eds.), The Handbook of Stress Science: Biology, Psychology, and Health. (220-229). New York: Springer Publishing Company.)&lt;/ref&gt;  This mechanism can be applied through a variety of ways, such as:
* seeking social support
* reappraising the stressor in a positive light
* accepting responsibility
* using avoidance
* exercising self-control
* and distancing.&lt;ref name="Carver, C. S. 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Folkman |first1=S. |last2=Lazarus |first2=R. S. |year=1988 |title=Coping as a mediator of emotion |url= |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=466–75 |pmid=3361419 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.466}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The focus of this coping mechanism is to change the meaning of the stressor or transfer attention away from it.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" /&gt; For example, reappraising tries to find a more positive meaning of the cause of the stress in order to reduce the emotional component of the stressor. Avoidance of the emotional distress will distract from the negative feelings associated with the stressor. Emotion-focused coping is well suited for stressors that seem uncontrollable (ex. a terminal illness diagnosis, or the loss of a loved one).&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C. S. (2011), Coping. In R. J. Contrada &amp; A. Baum (Eds.), The Handbook of Stress Science: Biology, Psychology, and Health. (220-229). New York: Springer Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mechanisms of emotion focused coping, such as distancing or avoidance, can have alleviating outcomes for a short period of time, however they can be detrimental when used over an extended period. Positive emotion-focused mechanisms, such as seeking social support, and positive re-appraisal, are associated with beneficial outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ben-Zur |first1=H. |year=2009 |title=Coping styles and affect |url= |journal=International Journal of Stress Management |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=87–101 |doi=10.1037/a0015731}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emotional approach coping]] is one form of emotion-focused coping in which emotional expression and processing is used to adaptively manage a response to a stressor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology |last=Stanton |first=A. L. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-986216-0 |location=New York |pages=16–17 |first2=A. |last2=Parsa |last3=Austenfeld |first3=J. L. |editor-first=C. R. |editor-last=Snyder |editor-first2=S. J. |editor-last2=Lopez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, people use a mixture of several types of coping strategies, which may change over time. All these methods can prove useful, but some claim that those using problem-focused coping strategies will adjust better to [[personal life|life]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2006"&gt;Taylor, S.E. (2006). ''Health Psychology, international edition''. McGraw-Hill Education, pg. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Problem-focused coping mechanisms may allow an individual greater perceived control over their problem, whereas emotion-focused coping may sometimes lead to a reduction in perceived control (maladaptive coping).

Lazarus "notes the connection between his idea of 'defensive reappraisals' or cognitive coping and [[Freud]]'s concept of 'ego-defenses'",&lt;ref name="Robinson 2005 p438"/&gt; coping strategies thus overlapping with a person's [[defense mechanisms]].

===Positive techniques (adaptive or constructive coping)===

One positive coping strategy, anticipating a problem, is known as ''proactive coping''.&lt;ref name="Brannon &amp; Feist 2009 pp121-3"/&gt; [[Anticipation (emotion)|Anticipation]] is when one reduces the stress of some difficult challenge by anticipating what it will be like and preparing for how one is going to cope with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robin |last1=Skynner |first2=John |last2=Cleese |title=Life and How to Survive It |location=London |year=1994 |page=55 |isbn=978-0-7493-1108-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two others are ''social coping'', such as seeking [[social support]] from others, and ''meaning-focused coping'', in which the person concentrates on deriving meaning from the stressful experience.&lt;ref name="Brannon &amp; Feist 2009 pp121-3"/&gt;

Adequate [[nutrition]], [[exercise]], [[sleep]] contribute to stress management, as do physical fitness and relaxation techniques such as [[progressive muscle relaxation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Madders, ''Stress and Relaxation'' (1981) p. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Humor used as a positive coping strategy may have useful benefits to emotional and mental health well-being. By having a humorous outlook on life, stressful experiences can be and are often minimized. This coping strategy corresponds with positive emotional states and is known to be an indicator of mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Rod. A|title=Humor, laughter, and physical health: methodological issues and research findings|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2001|volume=127 |issue=4|page=504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiological processes are also influenced within the exercise of humor. For example, laughing may reduce muscle tension, increase the flow of oxygen to the blood, exercise the cardiovascular region, and produce endorphins in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tariq|first1=Qudsia|last2=Khan|first2=Naima Aslam|title=RELATIONSHIP OF SENSE OF HUMOR AND MENTAL HEALTH: A COORELATIONAL STUDY|journal=Asian Journal of Social Sciences &amp; Humanities|date=2013|volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=331–337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using humor in coping while processing through feelings can vary depending on life circumstance and individual humor styles. In regards to grief and loss in life occurrences, it has been found that genuine laughs/smiles when speaking about the loss predicted later adjustment and evoked more positive responses from other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bonanno |first1= George |last2=Keltner |first2=Dacher |title= Facial expressions of emotion and the course of conjugal bereavement. |journal= Journal of Abnormal Psychology |date=1997 |volume=106 |issue=1 |page= 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person of the deceased family member may resort to making jokes of when the deceased person used to give unwanted “wet willies” (term used for when a person sticks their finger inside their mouth then inserts the finger into another person's ear) to any unwilling participant. A person might also find comedic relief with others around irrational possible outcomes for the deceased funeral service. It is also possible that humor would be used by people to feel a sense of control over a more powerless situation and used as way to temporarily escape a feeling of helplessness. Exercised humor can be a sign of positive adjustment as well as drawing support and interaction from others around the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Booth-Butterfield|first1=Melanie|last2=Wanzer|first2=Melissa Bekelja|last3=Krezmien|first3=Elyse|last4=Weil|first4=Nancy|title=Communication of humor during bereavement: Intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion management strategies|journal=Communication Quarterly|date=2014|volume=62|issue=4|pages=436–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While dealing with stress it is important to deal with your physical, mental, and social well being. One should maintain one's health and learn to relax if one finds oneself under stress. Mentally it is important to think positive thoughts, value oneself, demonstrate good time management, plan and think ahead, and express emotions. Socially one should communicate with people and seek new activities. By following these simple strategies, one will have an easier time responding to stresses in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lane|first1=Daniel|title=Anxiety Strategies|url=http://www.perthbraincentre.com.au/anxiety-strategies/|website=Perth Brain Centre|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips to Manage Anxiety and Stress|url=http://www.adaa.org/tips-manage-anxiety-and-stress|website=Anxiety &amp; Depression Association of America|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative techniques (maladaptive coping or non-coping)===

While adaptive coping methods improve functioning, a maladaptive coping technique will just reduce symptoms while maintaining and strengthening the disorder. Maladaptive techniques are more effective in the short term rather than long term coping process.

Examples of maladaptive behavior strategies include [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[sensitization]], [[safety behaviors (anxiety)|safety behaviors]], [[Avoidance coping|anxious avoidance]], and [[Escapism|escape]] (including [[self-medication]]).

These coping strategies interfere with the person's ability to unlearn, or break apart, the paired association between the situation and the associated [[anxiety]] symptoms. These are maladaptive strategies as they serve to maintain the disorder.

Dissociation is the ability of the mind to separate and compartmentalize thoughts, memories, and emotions. This is often associated with [[post traumatic stress syndrome]].

Sensitization is when a person seeks to learn about, rehearse, and/or anticipate fearful events in a protective effort to prevent these events from occurring in the first place.

Safety behaviors are demonstrated when individuals with anxiety disorders come to rely on something, or someone, as a means of coping with their excessive anxiety.

Anxious avoidance is when a person avoids anxiety provoking situations by all means. This is the most common strategy.

Escape is closely related to avoidance. This technique is often demonstrated by people who experience panic attacks or have phobias. These people want to flee the situation at the first sign of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacofsky|first=Matthew|title=The Maintenance of Anxiety Disorders: Maladaptive Coping Strategies|url=http://www.seabhs.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=38479|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people think that [[meditation]] "not only calms our emotions, but...makes us feel more 'together'", as too can "the kind of prayer in which you're trying to achieve an inner quietness and peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robin |last1=Skynner |first2=John |last2=Cleese |title=Life and How to Survive It |location=London |year=1994 |page=355 |isbn=978-0-7493-1108-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low-effort syndrome''' or '''low-effort coping''' refers to the coping responses of minority groups in an attempt to fit into the dominant culture. For example, minority students at school may learn to put in only minimal effort as they believe they are being discriminated against by the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="Ogbu"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ogbu |first1=John U. |year=1991 |title=Minority coping responses and school experience |journal=The Journal of Psychohistory |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=433–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical psychoanalytic theories==

===Otto Fenichel===
{{Main article|Otto Fenichel}}
Otto Fenichel summarized early psychoanalytic studies of coping mechanisms in children as "a gradual substitution of actions for mere discharge reactions...[&amp;] the development of the function of judgement" - noting however that "behind all active types of mastery of external and internal tasks, a readiness remains to fall back on passive-receptive types of mastery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Fenichel |title=The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis |location=London |year=1946 |pages=41–2; 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adult cases of "acute and more or less 'traumatic' upsetting events in the life of normal persons", Fenichel stressed that in coping, "in carrying out a 'work of learning' or 'work of adjustment', [s]he must acknowledge the new and less comfortable reality and fight tendencies towards regression, towards the misinterpretation of reality", though such rational strategies "may be mixed with relative allowances for rest and for small regressions and compensatory wish fulfillment, which are recuperative in effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Fenichel |title=The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis |location=London |year=1946 |page=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karen Horney===
{{Main article|Karen Horney}}
In the 1940s, the [[Germany|German]] [[Freudian]] [[psychoanalyst]] Karen Horney "developed her mature theory in which individuals cope with the anxiety produced by feeling unsafe, unloved, and undervalued by disowning their spontaneous feelings and developing elaborate strategies of defence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/horney-danielson-karen Bernard Paris, Horney-Danielson, Karen (1885–1952)]&lt;/ref&gt; She defined four so-called coping strategies to define interpersonal relations, one describing [[Mental health|psychologically healthy]] individuals, the others describing [[neurosis|neurotic]] states.

The healthy strategy she termed "Moving with" is that with which psychologically healthy people develop relationships. It involves compromise. In order to move with, there must be communication, agreement, disagreement, compromise, and decisions. The three other strategies she described – "Moving toward", "Moving against" and "Moving away" – represented neurotic, unhealthy strategies people utilize in order to protect themselves.

Horney investigated these patterns of neurotic needs (compulsive attachments).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Neurotic Needs According to Karen Horney|url=http://www.ptypes.com/neurotic_needs.html|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone needs these things, but the neurotics need them more than the normal person. The neurotics might need these more because of difficulties within their lives. If the neurotic does not experience these needs, he or she will experience anxiety. The ten needs are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boerre|first=George|title=Karen Horney|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/horney.html|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Affection and approval, the need to please others and be liked
# A partner who will take over one's life, based on the idea that love will solve all of one's problems
# Restriction of one's life to narrow borders, to be undemanding, satisfied with little, inconspicuous; to simplify one's life
# [[Power (social and political)|Power]], for control over others, for a facade of omnipotence, caused by a desperate desire for strength and dominance
# Exploitation of others; to get the better of them
# Social recognition or prestige, caused by an abnormal concern for appearances and popularity
# Personal admiration
# Personal achievement.
# Self-sufficiency and independence
# Perfection and unassailability, a desire to be perfect and a fear of being flawed.

In Compliance, also known as "Moving toward" or the "Self-effacing solution", the individual moves towards those perceived as a threat to avoid retribution and getting hurt, "making any sacrifice, no matter how detrimental."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Horney, ''The Neurotic Personality of Our Time'' (London 1977) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is, "If I give in, I won't get hurt." This means that: if I give everyone I see as a potential threat whatever they want, I won't be injured (physically or emotionally). This strategy includes neurotic needs one, two, and three.&lt;ref name="Boeree"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boeree|first=George|title=Karen Horney|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/horney.html|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Withdrawal, also known as "Moving away" or the "Resigning solution", individuals distance themselves from anyone perceived as a threat to avoid getting hurt – "the 'mouse-hole' attitude ... the security of unobtrusiveness."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Horney, ''New Ways in Psychoanalysis'' (London 1966) p. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is, "If I do not let anyone close to me, I won't get hurt." A neurotic, according to Horney desires to be distant because of being abused. If they can be the extreme introvert, no one will ever develop a relationship with them. If there is no one around, nobody can hurt them. These "moving away" people fight personality, so they often come across as cold or shallow. This is their strategy. They emotionally remove themselves from society. Included in this strategy are neurotic needs three, nine, and ten.&lt;ref name="Boeree" /&gt;

In Aggression, also known as the "Moving against" or the "Expansive solution", the individual threatens those perceived as a threat to avoid getting hurt. Children might react to parental in-differences by displaying anger or hostility. This strategy includes neurotic needs four, five, six, seven, and eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Horney|url=http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/horney.html|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to the work of Karen Horney, [[public administration]] scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tummers|first1=Lars|last2=Bekkers|first2=Victor|last3=Vink|first3=Evelien|last4=Musheno|first4=Michael|title=Coping During Public Service Delivery: A Conceptualization and Systematic Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Public Administration, Research &amp; Theory|doi= 10.1093/jopart/muu056|url=http://jpart.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/01/12/jopart.muu056|accessdate=30 July 2015|volume=25|issue=4|pages=1099–1126|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a classification of coping by frontline workers when working with clients (see also the work of [[Michael Lipsky]] on [[street-level bureaucracy]]). This coping classification is focused on the behavior workers can display towards clients when confronted with stress. They show that during public service delivery there are three main families of coping:

- Moving ''towards'' clients: Coping by helping clients in stressful situations. An example is a teacher working overtime to help students.&lt;br /&gt;
- Moving ''away from'' clients: Coping by avoiding meaningful interactions with clients in stressful situations. An example is a public servant stating "the office is very busy today, please return tomorrow." &lt;br /&gt;
- Moving ''against'' clients: Coping by confronting clients. For instance, teachers can cope with stress when working with students by imposing very rigid rules, such as no cellphone use in class and sending everyone to the office when they use a cellphone. Furthermore, [[aggression]] towards clients is also included here.

In their systematic review of 35 years of the literature, the scholars found that the most often used family is moving ''towards'' clients (43% of all coping fragments). Moving ''away from'' clients was found in 38% of all coping fragments and Moving ''against'' clients in 19%.

===Heinz Hartmann===
{{Main article|Heinz Hartmann}} 
In 1937, the psychoanalyst (as well as a physician, psychologist, and psychiatrist) Heinz Hartmann marked it as the evolution of [[ego psychology]] by publishing his paper, "Me" (which was later translated into English in 1958, titled, "The Ego and the Problem of Adaptation").&lt;ref name="Bendicsen2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bendicsen |first=Harold K |title=Guide to Psychoanalytic Developmental Theories |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |location=New York | isbn=978-0-387-88454-7 |pages=49–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartmann focused on the adaptive progression of the ego "through the mastery of new demands and tasks".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ruth L. Munroe, ''Schools of Psychoanalytic Thought'' (1957) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to his ''''adaptive point of view'''', once infants were born they have the ability to be able to cope with the demands of their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Bendicsen2009" /&gt;  In his wake, [[ego psychology]] further stressed "the development of the personality and of 'ego-strengths'...adaptation to social realities".&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object relations===
[[Emotional intelligence]] has stressed the importance of "the capacity to soothe oneself, to shake off rampant anxiety, gloom, or irritability....People who are poor in this ability are constantly battling feelings of distress, while those who excel in it can bounce back far more quickly from life's setbacks and upsets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daniel |last1=Goleman |title=Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-7475-2830-2 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, "the art of soothing ourselves is a fundamental [[life skill]]; some psychoanalytic thinkers, such as [[John Bowlby]] and [[D. W. Winnicott]] see this as the most essential of all psychic tools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daniel |last1=Goleman |title=Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-7475-2830-2 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Object relations theory]] has examined the childhood development both of "[i]ndependent coping...capacity for self-soothing", and of "[a]ided coping. Emotion-focused coping in infancy is often accomplished through the assistance of an adult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=E. Mark |editor1-last=Cummings |editor2-first=Anita L. |editor2-last=Greene |editor3-first=Katherine H. |editor3-last=Karraker |title=Life-span Developmental Psychology: Perspectives on Stress and Coping |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8058-0371-6 |pages=93–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==
Gender differences in coping strategies are the ways in which men and women differ in managing [[psychological stress]]. There is evidence that males often develop stress due to their careers, whereas females often encounter stress due to issues in interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Early studies indicated that "there were gender differences in the sources of stressors, but gender differences in coping were relatively small after controlling for the source of stressors";&lt;ref name="Billings"/&gt;  and more recent work has similarly revealed "small differences between women's and men's coping strategies when studying individuals in similar situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brannon |first1=Linda |last2=Feist |first2=Jess |title=Health Psychology: An Introduction to Behavior and Health: An Introduction to Behavior and Health |edition=7th |year=2009 |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-60132-6 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, such differences as exist indicate that women tend to employ emotion-focused coping and the "[[tend-and-befriend]]" response to stress, whereas men tend to use problem-focused coping and the "[[fight-or-flight]]" response, perhaps because societal standards encourage men to be more individualistic, while women are often expected to be [[interpersonal]]. An alternative explanation for the aforementioned differences involves genetic factors. The degree to which genetic factors and social conditioning influence behavior, is the subject of ongoing debate.&lt;ref name="Washburn"/&gt;

==Physiological basis==
Hormones also play a part in stress management. [[Cortisol]], a stress hormone, was found to be elevated in males during stressful situations. In females, however, cortisol levels were decreased in stressful situations, and instead, an increase in [[limbic]] activity was discovered. Many researchers believe that these results underlie the reasons why men administer a [[fight-or-flight]] reaction to stress; whereas, females have a [[tend-and-befriend]] reaction.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt; The "fight-or-flight" response activates the [[sympathetic nervous system]] in the form of increased focus levels, adrenaline, and epinephrine. Conversely, the "tend-and-befriend" reaction refers to the tendency of women to protect their offspring and relatives. Although these two reactions support a genetic basis to differences in behavior, one should not assume that in general females cannot implement "fight-or-flight" behavior or that males cannot implement "tend-and-befriend" behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6894">[[File:lake-tahoe.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lake Tahoe]], [[headwater]] sub-basin of the [[Truckee River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]]] 
The '''DSSAM Model''' (Dynamic Stream Simulation and Assessment Model) is a [[computer simulation]] developed for the [[Truckee River]] to analyze [[water pollution|water quality]] impacts from [[land use]] and [[wastewater]] management decisions in the Truckee River Basin. This area includes the cities of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Sparks, Nevada]] as well as the [[Lake Tahoe]] Basin. The model is historically and alternatively called the ''Earth Metrics Truckee River Model''.  Since original development in 1984-1986 under contract to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA),&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. ''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; the model has been refined and successive versions have been dubbed DSSAM II and DSSAM III.  This [[hydrology transport model]] is based upon a pollutant loading metric called ''[[Total maximum daily load]] (TMDL).'' The success of this flagship model contributed to the Agency’s broadened commitment to the use of the underlying TMDL protocol in its national policy for management of most river systems in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=April 1991 |title=Guidance for Water Quality-Based Decisions: The TMDL Process |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=00001KIO.TXT |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 440/4-91-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Truckee River has a length of over {{convert|115|mi|km}} and drains an area of approximately 3120 square miles,&lt;ref&gt; John Warwick, ''Truckee River spill model,'' University of Nevada-Reno (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; not counting the extent of its [[Lake Tahoe]] sub-basin. The DSSAM model establishes numerous stations along the entire river extent as well as a considerable number of monitoring points inside the  [[Great Basin]]'s [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], the receiving waters of this closed hydrological system.  Although the region is sparsely populated, it is important because Lake Tahoe is visited by 20 million persons per annum and Truckee River water quality affects at least two endangered species: the [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]] and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]].

==Development history==
[[File:Pyramid Lake sat.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite photo of  [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], September 1994]]
Impetus to derive a quantitative prediction model arose from a trend of historically decreasing river flow rates coupled with jurisdictional and tribal conflicts over water rights as well as concern for river biota.  When expansion of the Reno-Sparks Wastewater Treatment Plant was proposed, the EPA decided to fund a large scale research effort to create  simulation software and a parallel program to collect field data in the Truckee River and Pyramid Lake.  For river stations water quality measurements were made in the [[benthic zone]] as well as the topic zone; in the case of [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]] boats were used to collect grab samples at varying depths and locations.  Earth Metrics conducted the software development for the first generation [[computer model]] and collected field data on water quality and flow rates in the Truckee River.  After model calibration, runs were made to evaluate impacts of alternative land use controls and discharge parameters for treated [[effluent]]. 

The DSSAM Model is constructed to allow dynamic decay of most pollutants; for example, total nitrogen and phosphorus are allowed to be consumed by benthic [[alga]]e in each time step, and the algal communities are given a separate population dynamic in each river reach (e.g.metabolic rate based upon river temperature).  Sources throughout the watershed include non-point agricultural and urban stormwater as well as a multiplicity of point source discharges of treated municipal wastewater effluent.

Subsequent to the first generation of DSSAM  model development, calibration and application, later refinements were made.  These augmentations to model functionality focussed on increased flexibility in modeling the [[diel]] cycle and also allowed inclusion of analyzing particulate nitrogen and phosphorus.  In developing DSSAM III several changes in the model operation and scope were performed.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, J.T., C.L. Caupp, and H.M. Runke, '' Evaluation of water quality using DSSAM III under various conditions of nutrient loadings from municipal wastewater and agricultural sources: Truckee River, Nevada''.. Bureau of Water Quality Planning, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Carson City, Nevada (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cui-ui spawn (USFWS).jpg|thumb|right|[[spawn (biology)|Spawning]] [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]]]] --&gt;
Numerous different uses of the model have been made including (a)analysis of public policies for urban [[stormwater]] runoff, (b) researching agricultural methods for [[surface runoff]] minimization, (c) innovative solutions for non-point source control and d)engineering aspects of treated wastewater discharge.  Regarding stormwater runoff in [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], the specific elements within a new [[xeriscape]] ordinance were analyzed for efficacy using the model.  For the varied agricultural uses in the watershed, the model was run to understand the principal sources of adverse impact, and management practices were developed to reduce in river pollution. Use of the model has specifically been conducted to analyze survival of two [[endangered species]] found in the [[Truckee River]] and [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]: the [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]] (endangered 1967) and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]] (threatened 1970).  When the model is used for [[surface runoff]] reaching a stream, this pollutant input can be viewed as a [[line source]] (e.g., a continuous linear source of pollution entering the waterway).

'''Dada''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|d|ɑː}}) or '''Dadaism''' was an [[art movement]] of the European [[avant-garde]] in the early 20th century, with early centers in Zürich, Switzerland, at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] (circa 1916); [[New York Dada]] began circa 1915,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=SF5QAAAAMAAJ Francis M. Naumann, ''New York Dada, 1915-23''], Abrams, 1994, {{ISBN|0810936763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario de Micheli (2006). ''Las vanguardias artísticas del siglo XX.'' Alianza Forma. p.135-137&lt;/ref&gt; and after 1920 Dada flourished in Paris.  Developed in reaction to [[World War I]], the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the [[logic]], [[reason]], and [[aestheticism]] of modern [[capitalist society]], instead expressing [[nonsense]], [[irrationality]], and [[anti-bourgeois]] protest in their works.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trachtman|first1=Paul|title=A Brief History of Dada|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/dada-115169154/|website=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneede"&gt;{{Citation | last=Schneede | first=Uwe M. | year=1979 | title=George Grosz, His life and work | location = New York | publisher = Universe Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd"&gt;Budd, Dona, ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', Pomegranate Communications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of the movement spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including [[collage]], [[sound poetry]], [[cut-up technique|cut-up writing]], and sculpture. Dadaist artists expressed their discontent with violence, war, and nationalism, and maintained political affinities with the [[Far-left politics|radical left]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/dada Dada, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dada1.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of the publication ''Dada'' by [[Tristan Tzara]]; Zürich, 1917]]

There is no consensus on the origin of the movement's name; a common story is that the German artist [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] slid a [[paper knife]] (letter-opener) at random into a dictionary, where it landed on "dada", a colloquial French term for a [[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]. Others note that it suggests the first words of a child, evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group. Still others speculate that the word might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning (or no meaning at all) in any language, reflecting the movement's internationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-dada.htm ''Dada''] at thearthistory.org, retrieved March 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of Dada lie in pre-war avant-garde. The term [[anti-art]], a precursor to Dada, was coined by [[Marcel Duchamp]] around 1913 to characterize works which challenge accepted definitions of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/anti-art Anti-art, Art that challenges the existing accepted definitions of art, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cubism]] and the development of [[collage]] and [[abstract art]] would inform the movement's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention. The work of French poets, Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]] and the [[Expressionism|German Expressionists]] would influence Dada's rejection of the tight correlation between words and meaning.&lt;ref name=oxfordart&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000021094?&amp;mediaType=Article "Dada"], by [[Dawn Adès]] and Matthew Gale, ''[[Grove Art Online]]'', Oxford University Press, 2009 {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works such as ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' (1896) by [[Alfred Jarry]], and the ballet [[Parade (ballet)|''Parade'']] (1916–17) by [[Erik Satie]] would also be characterized as proto-Dadaist works.&lt;ref&gt;Roselee Goldberg, Thomas &amp; Hudson, ''L'univers de l'art'',  Chapter 4, ''Le surréalisme'', ''Les représentations pré-Dada à Paris'', {{ISBN|978-2-87811-380-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dada movement's principles were first collected in [[Hugo Ball]]'s [[wikisource:Dada Manifesto (1916, Hugo Ball)|Dada Manifesto]] in 1916.

The Dadaist movement included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/[[literary journals]]; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media. Key figures in the movement included [[Hugo Ball]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Emmy Hennings]], [[Hans Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Francis Picabia]], Huelsenbeck, [[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Man Ray]], [[Beatrice Wood]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]] among others. The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and [[downtown music]] movements, and groups including [[Surrealism]], ''[[nouveau réalisme]]'', [[pop art]] and [[Fluxus]].

==Overview==
[[File:Francis Picabia, Dame! Illustration for the cover of the periodical Dadaphone n. 7, Paris, March 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Picabia]], ''Dame!'' Illustration for the cover of the periodical ''Dadaphone'', n. 7, Paris, March 1920]]
Dada was an informal international movement, with participants in Europe and North America. The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I. For many participants, the movement was a protest against the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[colonialism|colonialist]] interests, which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war, and against the cultural and intellectual conformity—in art and more broadly in society—that corresponded to the war.&lt;ref name=RichterAntiArt&gt;{{Citation | last=Richter | first=Hans | year=1965 | title=Dada: Art and Anti-art | location= New York and Toronto | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avant-garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments. They had seen (or participated in) Cubist exhibitions held at [[Galeries Dalmau]], Barcelona (1912), Galerie [[Der Sturm]] in Berlin (1912), the [[Armory Show]] in New York (1913), [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts|SVU Mánes]] in Prague (1914), several [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring, Amsterdam (between 1911 and 1915). [[Futurism]] developed in response to the work of various artists. Dada subsequently combined these approaches.&lt;ref name=oxfordart /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA6&amp;lpg=RA1-PA6&amp;dq=%22Barcelona+and+developments+in+Zurich%22,+1916%E2%80%9320&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qbkgGKzLti&amp;sig=WSVSo0NVM_bSoiKAaOMb-e-ez_E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS_IGtzcHRAhUMaxQKHdWzBGwQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Barcelona%20and%20developments%20in%20Zurich%22%2C%201916%E2%80%9320&amp;f=false Joan M. Marter, ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1'', Oxford University Press, 2011], p. 6, {{ISBN|0195335791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Dadaists believed that the 'reason' and 'logic' of bourgeois [[capitalism|capitalist]] society had led people into war. They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace [[Randomness|chaos]] and [[irrationality]].&lt;ref name="Schneede"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd"/&gt; For example, [[George Grosz]] later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest "against this world of mutual destruction."&lt;ref name="Schneede" /&gt;

According to [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] Dada was not art: it was "[[anti-art]]."&lt;ref name=RichterAntiArt /&gt;  Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for. Where art was concerned with traditional [[aesthetics]], Dada ignored aesthetics. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend.

As [[Hugo Ball]] expressed it, "For us, art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=DADA: Cities | url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm | publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]] | accessdate=2008-10-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102003737/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm | archive-date=2008-11-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer from the ''[[ARTnews|American Art News]]'' stated at the time that "Dada philosophy is the sickest, most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man." Art historians have described Dada as being, in large part, a "reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide."&lt;ref name="gardners"&gt;{{Citation | author = Fred S. Kleiner | title = Gardner's Art Through the Ages | edition = 12th | year = 2006 | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | page = 754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Dada artists described the movement as "a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis, a savior, a monster, which would lay waste to everything in its path... [It was] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege."&lt;ref name="gardners"/&gt;

To quote Dona Budd's ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', &lt;blockquote&gt;Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of the First World War. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zürich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara's and Marcel Janco's frequent use of the words "da, da," meaning "yes, yes" in the Romanian language. Another theory says that the name "Dada" came during a meeting of the group when a [[paper knife]] stuck into a French–German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for '[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobbyhorse]]'.&lt;ref name="Budd" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The movement primarily involved [[visual arts]], [[literature]], [[poetry]], [[art manifesto]]s, [[aesthetics|art theory]], [[theatre]], and [[graphic design]], and concentrated its [[anti-war]] politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in [[art]] through anti-art cultural works.

The creations of Duchamp, Picabia, Man Ray, and others between 1915 and 1917 eluded the term Dada at the time, and "[[New York Dada]]" came to be seen as a post facto invention of Duchamp. At the outset of the 1920s the term Dada flourished in Europe with the help of Duchamp and Picabia, who had both returned from New York. Notwithstanding, Dadaists such as Tzara and Richter claimed European precedence. Art historian David Hopkins notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ironically, though, Duchamp's late activities in New York, along with the machinations of Picabia, re-cast Dada's history. Dada's European chroniclers—primarily Richter, Tzara, and Huelsenbeck—would eventually become preoccupied with establishing the pre-eminence of Zurich and Berlin at the foundations of Dada, but it proved to be Duchamp who was most strategically brilliant in manipulating the genealogy of this avant-garde formation, deftly turning New York Dada from a late-comer into an originating force.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=1118476182 Hopkins, David, ''A Companion to Dada and Surrealism''], Volume 10 of Blackwell Companions to Art History, John Wiley &amp; Sons, May 2, 2016, p. 83, ISBN 11184761828&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Zürich===
[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah Höch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90×144&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Berlin State Museums|Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin]]]]
In 1916, [[Hugo Ball]], [[Emmy Hennings]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Marcel Janco]], [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Sophie Taeuber]], and [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], along with others, discussed art and put on performances in the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] expressing their disgust with the war and the interests that inspired it.

Some sources state that Dada coalesced on October&amp;nbsp;6 at the Cabaret Voltaire. Other sources state that Dada did not originate fully in a Zürich literary salon but grew out of an already vibrant artistic tradition in Eastern Europe, particularly Romania, that transposed to Switzerland when a group of Jewish [[Modernism|modernist]] artists (Tzara, Janco, [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]], and others) settled in Zürich. In the years prior to the First World War similar art had already risen in Bucharest and other Eastern European cities; it is likely that Dada's catalyst was the arrival in Zürich of artists like Tzara and Janco.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sandqvist, ''DADA EAST: The Romanians of Cabaret Voltaire'', London MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having left Germany and Romania during the Great War, the artists found themselves in Switzerland, a country recognized for its neutrality. Inside this space of political neutrality they decided to use abstraction to fight against the social, political, and cultural ideas of that time. The Dadaists believed those ideas to be a byproduct of bourgeois society, a society so apathetic it would rather fight a war against itself than challenge the ''[[status quo]]''.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction: "Everybody can Dada"|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]|accessdate=10 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102003737/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/cities/index.shtm|archive-date=2 November 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janco recalled, "We had lost confidence in our culture. Everything had to be demolished. We would begin again after the ''[[tabula rasa]]''. At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense, public opinion, education, institutions, museums, good taste, in short, the whole prevailing order." &lt;ref&gt;Marcel Janco, "Dada at Two Speeds," trans. in Lucy R. Lippard, Dadas on Art (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1971), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabaret closed its doors in early July and then at the first public [[soirée]] at Waag Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dada-companion.com/cabaret/ |title=Cabaret Voltaire |publisher=DADA Companion |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on July 14, 1916, Ball recited the [[wikisource:Dada Manifesto (1916, Hugo Ball)|first manifesto]]. In 1917, Tzara wrote a second [[wikisource:Dada Manifesto|Dada manifesto]] considered one of the most important Dada writings, which was published in 1918. Other manifestos followed.

A single issue of the magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire'' was the first publication to come out of the movement.

After the cabaret closed down, Dada activities moved on to a new gallery, and [[Hugo Ball]] left for Bern. Tzara began a relentless campaign to spread Dada ideas. He bombarded French and Italian artists and writers with letters, and soon emerged as the Dada leader and master strategist. The Cabaret Voltaire re-opened, and is still in the same place at the Spiegelgasse 1 in the Niederdorf.

Zürich Dada, with Tzara at the helm, published the art and literature review ''Dada'' beginning in July 1917, with five editions from Zürich and the final two from Paris.

Other artists, such as [[André Breton]] and [[Philippe Soupault]], created “literature groups to help extend the influence of Dada.”&lt;ref&gt;Europe of Cultures. [http://fresques.ina.fr/europe-des-cultures-en/fiche-media/Europe00022/tristan-tzara-speaks-about-the-dada-movement.html "Tristan Tzara speaks of the Dada Movement."], September 6, 1963. Retrieved on July 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fighting of the First World War had ended in the armistice of November 1918, most of the Zürich Dadaists returned to their home countries, and some began Dada activities in other cities. Others, such as the Swiss native [[Sophie Taeuber]], would remain in Zürich into the 1920s.

===Berlin===
[[File:An Anna Blume.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Anna Blume, Dichtungen'', 1919]]
"Berlin was a city of tightened stomachers, of mounting, thundering hunger, where hidden rage was transformed into a boundless money lust, and men's minds were concentrating more and more on questions of naked existence... Fear was in everybody's bones "- Richard Hülsenbeck

The groups in Germany were not as strongly [[anti-art]] as other groups. Their activity and art were more political and social, with corrosive [[art manifesto|manifestos]] and propaganda, satire, public demonstrations and overt political activities. The intensely political and war-torn environment of Berlin had a dramatic impact on the ideas of Berlin Dadaists. Conversely, New York's geographic distance from the war spawned its more theoretically-driven, less political nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New York Dada|last = Naumann|first = Francis M.|publisher = Abrams|year = 1994|isbn = 0810936763|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1918, while the Great War was approaching its climax, Huelsenbeck gave his first Dada speech in Berlin, and he produced a Dada manifesto later in the year. Following the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], by then out of the war, [[Hannah Höch]] and [[George Grosz]] used Dada to express communist sympathies. Grosz, together with [[John Heartfield]], Höch and Hausmann developed the [[wikt:technique|technique]] of [[photomontage]] during this period.

After the war, the artists published a series of short-lived political magazines and held the ''First International Dada Fair'', 'the greatest project yet conceived by the Berlin Dadaists', in the summer of 1920.&lt;ref name="Dada, Dickermann p443"&gt;Dada, Dickermann, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2006 p443&lt;/ref&gt; As well as work by the main members of Berlin Dada – Grosz, [[Raoul Hausmann]], Hannah Höch, [[Johannes Baader]], Huelsenbeck and Heartfield – the exhibition also included the work of [[Otto Dix]], [[Francis Picabia]], Jean Arp, [[Max Ernst]], [[Rudolf Schlichter]], [[Johannes Theodor Baargeld|Johannes Baargeld]] and others.&lt;ref name="Dada, Dickermann p443"/&gt; In all, over 200 works were exhibited, surrounded by incendiary slogans, some of which also ended up written on the walls of the Nazi's ''[[Entartete Kunst]]'' exhibition in 1937. Despite high ticket prices, the exhibition lost money, with only one recorded sale.&lt;ref&gt;Dada, Dickermann, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2006 p99&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin group published periodicals such as ''Club Dada'', ''Der Dada'', ''[[Jedermann sein eigner Fussball|Everyman His Own Football]]'', and ''Dada Almanach''.

===Cologne===
In [[Cologne]], Ernst, Baargeld, and Arp launched a controversial Dada exhibition in 1920 which focused on nonsense and anti-bourgeois sentiments. Cologne's Early Spring Exhibition was set up in a pub, and required that participants walk past urinals while being read lewd poetry by a woman in a [[Eucharist|communion]] dress. The police closed the exhibition on grounds of obscenity, but it was re-opened when the charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===New York===
{{main|New York Dada}}
Like Zürich, New York City was a refuge for writers and artists from the First World War. Soon after arriving from France in 1915, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Francis Picabia]] met American artist [[Man Ray]]. By 1916 the three of them became the center of radical [[anti-art]] activities in the United States. American [[Beatrice Wood]], who had been studying in France, soon joined them, along with [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]. [[Arthur Cravan]], fleeing conscription in France, was also in New York for a time. Much of their activity centered in [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s gallery, [[291 (art gallery)|291]], and the home of [[Walter Conrad Arensberg|Walter and Louise Arensberg]].

The New Yorkers, though not particularly organized, called their activities ''Dada,'' but they did not issue manifestos. They issued challenges to art and culture through publications such as ''[[The Blind Man]]'', ''Rongwrong'', and ''New York Dada'' in which they criticized the traditionalist basis for ''museum'' art. New York Dada lacked the disillusionment of European Dada and was instead driven by a sense of irony and humor. In his book ''Adventures in the arts: informal chapters on painters, vaudeville and poets'' [[Marsden Hartley]] included an essay on "[[s:The Importance of Being Dada|The Importance of Being 'Dada']]".

[[File:Label for the Belle Haleine cropped.png|thumb|upright|[[Rrose Sélavy]], the alter ego of Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]]]]
During this time Duchamp began exhibiting "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]" (everyday objects found or purchased and declared art) such as a bottle rack, and was active in the [[Society of Independent Artists]]. In 1917 he submitted the now famous ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', a urinal signed R.&amp;nbsp;Mutt, to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition but they rejected the piece. First an object of scorn within the arts community, the ''Fountain'' has since become almost canonized by some&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/fountain-most-influential-piece-of-modern-art-673625.html, ''Fountain' most influential piece of modern art''], Independent, December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the most recognizable modernist works of sculpture. Art world experts polled by the sponsors of the 2004 [[Turner Prize]], Gordon's gin, voted it "the most influential work of modern art".&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4059997.stm "Duchamp's urinal tops art survey"], [[BBC News]] December&amp;nbsp;1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; As recent scholarship documents, the work is still controversial. Duchamp indicated in a 1917 letter to his sister that a female friend was centrally involved in the conception of this work: "One of my female friends who had adopted the pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture."&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp, Marcel trans. and qtd. in [[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]]. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2002, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is in line with the scatological aesthetics of Duchamp's neighbour, the [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven|Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]].&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 224–225.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to "pay homage to the spirit of Dada" a performance artist named [[Pierre Pinoncelli]] made a crack in a replica of ''The Fountain'' with a hammer in January 2006; he also urinated on it in 1993.

Picabia's travels tied New York, Zürich and Paris groups together during the Dadaist period. For seven years he also published the Dada periodical ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' in Barcelona, New York City, Zürich, and Paris from 1917 through 1924.

By 1921, most of the original players moved to Paris where Dada had experienced its last major incarnation.

===Paris===
[[File:Man Ray, Rencontre dans la porte tournante.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Man Ray]], c. 1921–22, ''Rencontre dans la porte tournante'', published on the cover of ''[[Der Sturm]]'', Volume 13, Number 3, 5 March 1922]]
[[File:Man Ray, Dessin.jpg|thumb|upright|Man Ray, c. 1921–22, ''Dessin'' (''Drawing''), published on page 43 of ''Der Sturm'', Volume 13, Number 3, 5 March 1922]]
The French [[avant-garde]] kept abreast of Dada activities in Zürich with regular communications from [[Tristan Tzara]] (whose pseudonym means "sad in country," a name chosen to protest the treatment of Jews in his native Romania), who exchanged letters, poems, and magazines with [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Breton]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Clément Pansaers]], and other French writers, critics and artists.

Paris had arguably been the classical music capital of the world since the advent of musical Impressionism in the late 19th century. One of its practitioners, [[Erik Satie]], collaborated with [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]] in a mad, scandalous ballet called ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]''. First performed by the [[Ballets Russes]] in 1917, it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky's ''[[Le Sacre du printemps]]'' had done almost five years earlier. This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself, something traditional ballet patrons would obviously have serious issues with.

Dada in Paris surged in 1920 when many of the originators converged there. Inspired by Tzara, Paris Dada soon issued manifestos, organized demonstrations, staged performances and produced a number of journals (the final two editions of ''Dada'', ''Le Cannibale'', and ''Littérature'' featured Dada in several editions.)&lt;ref&gt;Marc Dachy, {{lang|fr|Dada : La révolte de l'art}}, Paris, Gallimard / Centre Pompidou, collection "[[Découvertes Gallimard]]" (nº 476), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first introduction of Dada artwork to the Parisian public was at the ''[[Salon des Indépendants]]'' in 1921. [[Jean Crotti]] exhibited works associated with Dada including a work entitled, ''Explicatif''  bearing the word ''Tabu''. In the same year Tzara staged his Dadaist play ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' to howls of derision from the audience. When it was re-staged in 1923 in a more professional production, the play provoked a theatre riot (initiated by [[André Breton]]) that heralded the split within the movement that was to produce [[Surrealism]]. Tzara's last attempt at a Dadaist drama was his "[[Irony|ironic]] [[tragedy]]" ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' in 1924.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands the Dada movement centered mainly around [[Theo van Doesburg]], best known for establishing the [[De Stijl]] movement and magazine of the same name. Van Doesburg mainly focused on poetry, and included poems from many well-known Dada writers in ''De Stijl'' such as [[Hugo Ball]], [[Hans Arp]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. Van Doesburg and {{Interlanguage link multi|Thijs Rinsema|nl}} (a [[cordwainer]] and artist in [[Drachten]]) became friends of Schwitters, and together they organized the so-called ''Dutch Dada campaign'' in 1923, where van Doesburg promoted a leaflet about Dada (entitled ''What is Dada?''), Schwitters read his poems, [[Vilmos Huszár]] demonstrated a mechanical dancing doll and Nelly van Doesburg (Theo's wife), played [[avant-garde]] compositions on piano.

[[File:I.K. Bonset Voorbijtrekkende troep 2.jpg|thumb|A Bonset sound-poem, "Passing troop", 1916]]
Van Doesburg wrote Dada poetry himself in ''De Stijl'', although under a pseudonym, I.K.&amp;nbsp;Bonset, which was only revealed after his death in 1931. 'Together' with I.K.&amp;nbsp;Bonset, he also published a short-lived [[Dutch literature|Dutch]] Dada magazine called ''Mécano'' (1922–3). Another Dutchman identified by [[K. Schippers]] in his study of the movement in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;''Holland Dada'', Amsterdam, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Groningen]] typographer [[H. N. Werkman]], who was in touch with van Doesburg and Schwitters while editing his own magazine, ''The Next Call'' (1923–6). Two more artists mentioned by Schippers were German-born and eventually settled in the Netherlands. These were Otto van Rees, who had taken part in the liminal exhibitions at the Café Voltaire in Zürich, and [[Paul Citroen]].

===Georgia===
Although Dada itself was unknown in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] until at least 1920, from 1917 until 1921 a group of poets called themselves "41st Degree" (referring both to the latitude of [[Tbilisi]], Georgia and to the temperature of a high fever) organized  along Dadaist lines. The most important figure in this group was [[Ilia Zdanevich|Iliazd]], whose radical typographical designs visually echo the publications of the Dadaists. After his flight to Paris in 1921, he collaborated with Dadaists on publications and events.

===Yugoslavia===
In [[Yugoslavia]] there was significant Dada activity between 1920 and 1922, run mainly by [[Dragan Aleksić]] and including work by Mihailo S.&amp;nbsp;Petrov, [[Zenitism]]'s two brothers Ljubomir Micić and Branko Ve Poljanski.&lt;ref&gt;[https://monoskop.org/Zenit ''Zenit: International Review of Arts and Culture'']&lt;/ref&gt; Aleksić used the term "Yougo-Dada" and is known to have been in contact with [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], and [[Tristan Tzara]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubravka Djurić, Miško Šuvaković.

===Italy===
The Dada movement in Italy, based in [[Mantua]], was met with distaste and failed to make a significant impact in the world of art. It published a magazine for a short time and held an exhibition in Rome, featuring paintings, quotations from Tristan Tzara, and original epigrams such as "True Dada is against Dada". The most notable member of this group was [[Julius Evola]], who went on to become an eminent scholar of [[occultism]], as well as a right-wing philosopher and an assistant to [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/dada/dadas/evola.htm Julius Evola – International Dada Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:Dada in Ultraman.jpg|thumb|Dada, an iconic character from the Ultra Series. His design draws inspiration from the art movement.]]
A prominent Dada group in Japan was [[Mavo]], founded in July 1923 by [[Tomoyoshi Murayama]] and {{ill|Yanase Masamu|de||ja|柳瀬正夢}}. Other prominent artists were [[Jun Tsuji]], [[Eisuke Yoshiyuki]], [[Shinkichi Takahashi]] and [[Katsue Kitasono]].

In the [[Tsuburaya Productions]]'s ''[[Ultra Series]]'', an alien named Dada was designed after the Dadaism movement, with said character first appearing in episode 28 of the 1966 [[tokusatsu]] series, ''[[Ultraman]]'', and was designed by character artist [[Toru Narita]]. Dada's design is primarily monochromatic, and features numerous sharp lines and alternating black and white stripes, as a reference to the movement. On May 19, 2016, in celebration to the 100 year anniversary of Dadaism in Tokyo, the Ultra Monster was invited to meet the Swiss Ambassador Urs Bucher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-78.jp/news/n-3812/|title=「三面怪人 ダダ」が「ダダイズム100周年」を祝福！スイス大使館で開催された記者発表会に登場！|publisher=m-78.jp|language=ja|date=2016-05-19|accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tokusatsunetwork.com/2016/05/dada-celebrates-dadaisms-birthday/|title=Dada Celebrates Dadaism’s 100th Anniversary|publisher=tokusatsunetwork.com|date=2016-05-19|accessdate=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Dada in itself was relatively unknown in Russia, however, avant-garde art was widespread due to the [[Bolshevik]]'s revolutionary agenda. The {{ill|Nichevoki|ru|Ничевоки}}, a literary group sharing Dadaist ideals achieved infamy after one of its members suggested that [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] should go to the "Pampushka" (Pameatnik Pushkina – [[Pushkinskaya Square|Pushkin monument]]) on the "Tverbul" ([[Tverskoy Boulevard]]) to clean the shoes of anyone who desired it, after Mayakovsky declared that he was going to cleanse Russian literature.

==Poetry, music and sound==
In literature, Dadaism focused mainly on poetry, particularly the so-called sound poetry, which was invented by [[Hugo Ball]] and often performed on stage. The Dadaist poem is described as one that abolishes the traditional concept of poetry, including the structure, order, as well as the interplay of sound and meaning or the meaning of language itself. The belief is that the existing system by which information is articulated is said to rob language of its dignity. 

[[File:Dadaglobe Form Letter to Vagts (Nov 1920).jpg|thumb|Dadaglobe solicitation form letter signed by Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, and Walter Serner, c. week of November 8, 1920. This example was sent from Paris to Alfred Vagts in Munich.]]

Therefore, the dismantling of the language and the poetic conventions are considered attempts to restore language to its purest and most innocent form. "With these sound poem, we wanted to dispense with a language which journalism had made desolate and impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dadaism|last=Elger|first=Dietmar|last2=Grosenick|first2=Uta|publisher=Taschen|year=2004|isbn=9783822829462|location=London|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the offshoots of this type of poetry was the simultaneous poems, which were recited by a group of speakers, who collectively produce a chaotic and confusing set of voices. The poems are considered manifestations of modern society such as advertising, technology, and conflict, among others. However, unlike movements such as expressionism, Dadaism appreciated the dynamics of modernity and the urban life. The poetry produced by this genre does not consider the chaotic urban and futuristic world as negative, man-eating or hellish. Instead, there is a focus on how these serve as new natural terrain that opens up new ideas for life and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Text Into Image, Image Into Text: Proceedings of the Interdisciplinary|last=Morrison|first=Jeffrey|last2=Krobb|first2=Florian|publisher=Rodopi|year=1997|isbn=9042001526|location=Atlanta|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dadaism also blurred the line between the literary and visual arts. One of the Dadaist techniques, for instance, proposed the use of physical materials alongside words so that the newly created poem became a fruit of the written idea and the physical artifacts such as newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brazilian Literature as World Literature|last=Coutinho|first=Eduardo|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781501323263|location=New York|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Lowenthal, in ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, and Provocation'', writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to [[postmodernism]], an influence on [[pop art]], a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that laid the foundation for [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Lowenthal, translator's introduction to [[Francis Picabia]]'s ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, and Provocation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dada was not confined to the visual and literary arts; its influence reached into sound and music. [[Kurt Schwitters]] developed what he called ''[[Sound poetry|sound poems]]'', while [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] composed Dada music performed at the Festival Dada in Paris on 26 May 1920. Other composers such as [[Erwin Schulhoff]], Hans Heusser and [[Alberto Savinio]] all wrote ''Dada music'', while members of [[Les Six]] collaborated with members of the Dada movement and had their works performed at Dada gatherings. [[Erik Satie]] also dabbled with Dadaist ideas during his career, although he is primarily associated with musical [[Impressionism]].

In the very first Dada publication, Hugo Ball describes a "balalaika orchestra playing delightful folk-songs." [[African music]] and jazz were common at Dada gatherings.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Musician [[Frank Zappa]] was a self-proclaimed Dadaist after learning of the movement:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the early days, I didn't even know what to call the stuff my life was made of. You can imagine my delight when I discovered that someone in a distant land had the same idea—AND a nice, short name for it.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Zappa, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:En hod dada museum.jpg|thumb|The [[Janco Dada Museum]], named after [[Marcel Janco]], in [[Ein Hod]], Israel]]
While broadly based, the movement was unstable. By 1924 in Paris, Dada was melding into Surrealism, and artists had gone on to other ideas and movements, including Surrealism, [[social realism]] and other forms of [[modernism]]. Some theorists argue that Dada was actually the beginning of [[postmodern art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Locher| first=David| title=Unacknowledged Roots and Blatant Imitation: Postmodernism and the Dada Movement| journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology| volume=4| issue=1| year=1999| url=http://www.sociology.org/content/vol004.001/locher.html| accessdate=2007-04-25| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223045916/http://www.sociology.org/content/vol004.001/locher.html| archive-date=2007-02-23| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the dawn of the [[World War II|Second World War]], many of the European Dadaists had emigrated to the United States. Some ([[Otto Freundlich]], [[Walter Serner]]) died in death camps under [[Adolf Hitler]], who actively persecuted the kind of "[[degenerate art]]" that he considered Dada to represent. The movement became less active as post-war optimism led to the development of new movements in art and literature.

Dada is a named influence and reference of various [[anti-art]] and political and cultural movements, including the [[Situationist International]] and [[culture jamming]] groups like the [[Cacophony Society]]. Upon breaking up in July 2012, [[anarchist]] pop band [[Chumbawamba]] issued a statement which compared their own legacy with that of the Dada art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chumbawamba|url=http://www.chumba.com/|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time that the Zürich Dadaists were making noise and spectacle at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] was planning his revolutionary plans for Russia in a nearby apartment. [[Tom Stoppard]] used this coincidence as a premise for his play ''[[Travesties]]'' (1974), which includes Tzara, Lenin, and [[James Joyce]] as characters. French writer Dominique Noguez imagined Lenin as a member of the Dada group in his tongue-in-cheek ''Lénine Dada'' (1989).

The former building of the Cabaret Voltaire fell into disrepair until it was occupied from January to March 2002, by a group proclaiming themselves [[Neo-Dada]]ists, led by [[Mark Divo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/11/01/a-work-in-process.php 2002 occupation by neo-Dadaists] ''Prague Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The group included [[Leumund Cult|Jan Thieler]], [[Ingo Giezendanner]], Aiana Calugar, [[Lennie Lee]], and Dan Jones. After their eviction, the space was turned into a museum dedicated to the history of Dada. The work of Lee and Jones remained on the walls of the new museum.

Several notable [[retrospective]]s have examined the influence of Dada upon art and society. In 1967, a large Dada retrospective was held in Paris. In 2006, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City mounted a Dada exhibition in partnership with the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. and the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris. The [[LTM Recordings|LTM]] label has released a large number of Dada-related sound recordings, including interviews with artists such as Tzara, Picabia, Schwitters, Arp, and Huelsenbeck, and musical repertoire including Satie, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Picabia, and Nelly van Doesburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltmrecordings.com/fdrcat.html LTM Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art techniques developed==

===Collage===
The Dadaists imitated the techniques developed during the cubist movement through the pasting of cut pieces of paper items, but extended their art to encompass items such as transportation tickets, maps, plastic wrappers, etc. to portray aspects of life, rather than representing objects viewed as still life.

===Cut-up technique===
[[Cut-up technique]] is an extension of collage to words themselves, [[Tristan Tzara]] describes this in the Dada Manifesto:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.391.org/manifestos/19201212tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm |title=manifestos: dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love by tristan tzara, 12th december 1920 |publisher=391 |date=1920-12-12 |accessdate=2011-06-27}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;
TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM
Take a newspaper.
Take some scissors.
Choose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem.
Cut out the article.
Next carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag.
Shake gently.
Next take out each cutting one after the other.
Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.
The poem will resemble you.
And there you are – an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Photomontage===
[[File:ABCD-Hausmann.jpg|thumb|upright|Raoul Hausmann, ''ABCD'' (self-portrait), a photomontage from 1923–24]]
The Dadaists – the "monteurs" (mechanics) – used scissors and glue rather than paintbrushes and paints to express their views of modern life through images presented by the media. A variation on the collage technique, photomontage utilized actual or reproductions of real photographs printed in the press. In Cologne, [[Max Ernst]] used images from the First World War to illustrate messages of the destruction of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/techniques/index.shtm |title=DADA – Techniques – photomontage |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MechanicalHead-Hausmann.jpg|thumb|upright|Raoul Hausmann, ''Mechanischer Kopf (Der Geist unserer Zeit)'' (Mechanical Head [The Spirit of Our Age]), c. 1920]]

===Assemblage===
The [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]]s were three-dimensional variations of the collage – the assembly of everyday objects to produce meaningful or meaningless (relative to the war) pieces of work including war objects and trash. Objects were nailed, screwed or fastened together in different fashions.  Assemblages could be seen in the round or could be hung on a wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/dada/techniques/assemblage.shtm |title=DADA – Techniques – assemblage |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Readymades===
[[Marcel Duchamp]] began to view the manufactured objects of his collection as objects of art, which he called "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]". He would add signatures and titles to some, converting them into artwork that he called "readymade aided" or "rectified readymades". Duchamp wrote: "One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the 'readymade.' That sentence, instead of describing the object like a title, was meant to carry the mind of the spectator towards other regions more verbal. Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations, would be called 'readymade aided.'"&lt;ref&gt;"The Writings of Marcel Duchamp" {{ISBN|0-306-80341-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example of Duchamp's readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back, signed "R. Mutt", titled ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition that year, though it was not displayed.

The '''Damascus Pentateuch''' ({{lang-he| כֶּתֶר דַּמֶּשֶׂק}} '''''Keter Dameseq''''' or '''Crown of Damascus''') is a 10th century Hebrew Bible [[codex]] (Pentateuch),&lt;ref&gt;In the glosses of the very last page of Deuteronomy (458 in vol. 2), in the hand-writing of a second person (probably the owner of the codex), is appended a memorial of his wife’s passing in 4943 [[anno mundi]] (or what corresponds to 1183 CE).&lt;/ref&gt; containing the first Five Books of Moses. The codex was copied by an unknown scribe, replete with Masoretic annotations. The manuscript is defective in its beginning, as it starts with Genesis 9:26 (Exodus 18:1–23 is also missing). It was acquired by the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem National Library (Ms. Heb. 24°5702 ; Sassoon 507 (formerly). Microfilm no. F-8886&lt;/ref&gt; and published in a large, two-volume facsimile edition in 1978&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11364/view/1/1/ The Damascus Pentateuch] (ed. D.S. Loewinger), for the [[Jewish National and University Library]], Jerusalem, pub. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore 1978 (2 volumes)&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with another Damascus Keter, of medieval Spanish origin).

==History==
The Damascus Pentateuch came to renown owing largely to the works of the bibliophile, [[David Sassoon#Progeny|David Solomon Sassoon]], who bought the codex in Damascus in the early 20th century. It is one of the oldest extant Bible codices, ranking with that of the [[Aleppo Codex]] and [[Leningrad Codex]]. In many places, the Damascus Pentateuch follows the traditions of the masorete, [[Aaron ben Asher]], in ''plene'' and ''defective scriptum'', as well as in most large and small letters, being harmonious with the Masoretic variants prescribed by Ben-Asher up to 52% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible (A Study of its Vocalization and Accentuation)'', Jerusalem 1968, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Masoretic tradition of Ben Asher, the copyist of the Damascus Pentateuch also writes '''פצוע דכא''' in Deut. 23:2 with an ''aleph'', and writes '''תעשה''' in Exo. 25:31 in ''defective scriptum'', without a ''yod'', as also the word '''האפד''' in Exo. 28:26 is written by him in ''defective scriptum'', without a ''waw''. Such practices are also common with Aaron Ben Asher.&lt;ref&gt;As shown by early witnesses who saw the Aleppo Codex and described its content, such as Menashe Sathon, whose notes on the Aleppo Codex were sent to Jerusalem and later reviewed by M.D. Cassuto, who relayed the same unto Rabbi Yaakov Sapir (19th century). Yishai ben Amram ha-Cohen Amadi (late 16th century) had also seen the Aleppo Codex. See: Joseph Offer, ''M.D. Cassuto's Notes on the Aleppo Codex'', Sefunot: Studies and Sources on the History of the Jewish Communities in the East (pub. by the [[Ben-Zvi Institute]]), Jerusalem 1989, p. 309 [33].&lt;/ref&gt;  It is written on parchment, in three columns to the page, in large oriental square script typical of writing scripts used in the 9th century. Like other codices of its era, it bears [[micrography]] known as the ''Masora Magna'' (large ''Masora''), that is, the preservation of the [[Minutiae|minutiæ]] of the text-tradition written as a gloss on the top and bottom of each page, as well as the ''Masora Parva'' (small ''Masora'') written in between the columns. According to Sassoon, the writer of the ''[[Masoretic Text|Masora]]'' (critical notes of the Masoretic annotations) was a follower of Ben Asher, yet the Bible text (orthography and vocalization) follows that of [[Ben Naphtali]] and his school.&lt;ref name=london1932&gt;''Ohel Dawid – Descriptive Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library, London'', David Solomon Sassoon, vol. 1, London: Oxford University Press 1932, pp. [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37055&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=81&amp;hilite= 22–23]&lt;/ref&gt; As to the age of the Codex, Sassoon has posited that “the manuscript is probably older than the British Museum MS., No. Oriental 4445, which is supposed to have been written about 820–850 CE., of Babylonian origin.&lt;ref name=london1932 /&gt; The text is furnished with [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] vowel points, accents, and the ''[[Rafe]]h'' strokes, e.g. the horizontal line written above the non-accentuated letters of '''בג"ד כפ"ת''', including the '''א''' in some cases, as on p.&amp;nbsp;54 in vol. 1 (on Genesis 32:28&lt;ref&gt;In the Hebrew Bible, it is Genesis 32:29&lt;/ref&gt;), ישר'''א'''ל. The smaller divisions for the weekly biblical lections, otherwise known as ''Sedarim'', are marked throughout the codex by the writer of the ''Masora'' by a large ''samekh'' ('''ס''') in the margin with the number of the ''Seder'' below.&lt;ref name=london1932 /&gt;

The style of lettering follows an archaic style; the leg of the Hebrew character ''qof'' ('''ק''') is joined to its roof, while the ''he'' ('''ה''') is made like the ''ḥet'' ('''ח'''), with hardly any distinction between the two letters. The ''lamed'' ('''ל''') is written exceptionally long, and hooked towards the outside. The final ''nun'' ('''ן''') is written almost the same as the letter ''zayn''.

All the ''qərē''&lt;ref&gt;That is, what is not written in the text, but must be read aloud in the text.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kətiv''&lt;ref&gt;That this, what is actually written in the text, but is not read in the text. Instead, the word is replaced by a different reading.&lt;/ref&gt; are marked by the writer of the text with a final ''nun'' in the margin without any further direction as to what the reading should be.&lt;ref name=london1932 /&gt;

A summary of the Damascus Pentateuch was made by [[Israel Yeivin]], in connection with the problems of the Aleppo Codex.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible (A study of its vocalization and accentuation)'', Jerusalem 1968, pp. 361-362 (Hebrew: כתר ארם צובה : ניקודו וטעמיו).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yeivin, the ''textus receptus'' of the Damascus Pentateuch is mostly harmonious with the Leningrad Codex. As for the variants in vocalization it follows that of Ben Asher up to 52% of the time, and that of Ben Naphtali up to 46% of the time, for which diversity it has been called by him "a mixed manuscript where one can find in it a few 'improvements,' but which differs in several aspects regarding its vocalization and trope symbols from the Aleppo Codex."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible (A study of its vocalization and accentuation)'', Jerusalem 1968, pp. 361-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Dorra Bouzid was born in [[Sfax]]. After her father died, her mother Cherifa defied family expectation by moving to [[Nabeul]] in the early 1930s, riding a bicycle, teaching primary school and marrying the writer [[Mahmoud Messadi]]. Dorra and her sister were educated at a French [[Secondary_education_in_France#Lycée|lycée]].&lt;ref name="LorcinShepard2016"/&gt;

In the late 1940s Bouzid studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Tunis. However, her mother insisted she study [[pharmacy]] to be self-sufficient, and so she enrolled the Faculty of Pharmacy in Paris in 1951. There she joined the [[North African Muslim Students Association]] (AEMNA), and helped organize a newspaper combining nationalism and syndicalism, before returning to Tunis to practice pharmacy.&lt;ref name="LorcinShepard2016"/&gt;

The editor of the nationalist newspaper ''[[L'Action]]'' recruited Bouzid to write a women's column, which became a full page entitled "Feminine Action'. In 1955 she published there a 'Call for Emancipation Law' demanding full rights for women. The following year [[Habib Bourguiba]] promulgated the [[Code of Personal Status in Tunisia|Code of Personal Status]], modernizing the law with regard to women. In 1959 Bouzid became the head editor of the feminist magazine ''[[Faiza (magazine)|Faiza]]'', recently founded by [[Safia Farhat]]. In the early 1960s Dorra was sent by Bourguiba on an informal diplomatic mission to Morocco.&lt;ref name="LorcinShepard2016"/&gt;

Bouzid was the subject of a 2012 documentary by [[Walid Tayaa]], ''Dorra Bouzid, une Tunisienne, un combat''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maghrebdesfilms.fr/dorra-bouzid-une-tunisienne-un-combat.html Dorra Bouzid, une Tunisienne, un combat]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ellen Henrietta Swallow Richards''' (December 3, 1842 &amp;ndash; March 30, 1911) was an [[Industrial engineering|industrial]] and [[Safety engineering|safety engineer]], [[environmental chemist]], and university faculty member in the United States during the 19th century. Her pioneering work in sanitary engineering, and experimental research in domestic science, laid a foundation for the new science of [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2135&amp;ResourceType=Building |title=Richards, Ellen Swallow, Residence |date=April 7, 1991 |accessdate=2013-09-04 |quote= |publisher=[[National Historic Landmarks Program]] |location= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011063112/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2135&amp;ResourceType=Building |archivedate=October 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the founder of the home economics movement characterized by the application of science to the home, and the first to apply chemistry to the study of nutrition.&lt;ref name=mozans&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozans|first1=H.

Richards graduated from [[Westford Academy]] (second oldest secondary school in Massachusetts) in 1862. She was the first woman admitted to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. She graduated in 1873 and later became its first female instructor.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Campus Life: M.I.T.; Salute to Women At a School Once 99.6% Male |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/07/nyregion/campus-life-mit-salute-to-women-at-a-school-once-99.6-male.html |quote=When Ellen Swallow Richards came to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in January 1871, she was the first woman to attend the institute, then based in Boston. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= April 7, 1991|accessdate=2014-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Richards was the first woman in America accepted to any school of science and technology, and the first American woman to obtain a degree in [[chemistry]], which she earned from [[Vassar College]] in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Women and American Politics  |coauthors= |title=Ellen Swallow Richards |year= |publisher= |page= |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVtFJ5tvINsC&amp;pg=PA387&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;dq=%22first+woman+to+earn+a+degree+in+chemistry%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y_P1-rvlze&amp;sig=pfbf2WxVAO6HAxE5ff9nMr-gc_o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=arQXU5uGMIXq0AGY-oGYDw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22first%20woman%20to%20earn%20a%20degree%20in%20chemistry%22&amp;f=false |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowden|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Chemical achievers : the human face of the chemical sciences|date=1997|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780941901123|pages=156–158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCg5MgI2S54C&amp;pg=PA156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen H.

== Biography ==

=== Early childhood ===
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards 1848.jpg|thumb|upright|Daguerreotype of Ellen Henrietta Swallow, c. 1848]]
Richards was born in [[Dunstable, Massachusetts]]. She was the only child of Peter Swallow (b. June 27, 1813, Dunstable; d. March 1871, Littleton, Massachusetts) and Fanny Gould Taylor (b. April 9, 1817, [[New Ipswich, New Hampshire]]), both of whom came from established families of modest means and were believers in the value of education.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Early life and education ===
Swallow was home-schooled in her early years. In 1859 the family moved to Westford and she attended [[Westford Academy]].&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Caroline Louisa | title = The life of Ellen H. Richards | publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1912 | isbn = | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofellenhrich00huntrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies at the academy included mathematics, composition, and Latin, similar to other New England academies of the time.  Swallow's Latin proficiency allowed her to study French and German, a rare language north of New York.&lt;ref name="JuneKennedy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kennedy | first = June W. | title = Westford Recollections of Days Gone By: Recorded Interviews 1974-1975 A Millennium Update | publisher = Author House | edition = 1st | location = Bloomington, IN | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4259-2388-7 | lccn = 2006904814 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her language skills she was much in demand as a tutor, and the income earned doing this made it possible for Swallow to further her studies.

[[File:Old Westford Academy, MA.jpg|thumb|Old Westford Academy]]

In March 1862, she left the academy. Two months later, in May, she developed the [[measles]] which set her back physically and interrupted her preparations to begin teaching.

[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|upright|Miss Ellen Henrietta Swallow, c. 1864]]
In the spring of 1863 the family moved to Littleton, Massachusetts, where Mr. Swallow had just purchased a larger store and expanded his business. In June 1864, Swallow, now twenty-one, took a teaching position.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

She did not teach again in 1865 but spent that year tending the family store and taking care of her ill mother. During the winter of 1865–66, Swallow studied and attended lectures in Worcester.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== College education ===
In September 1868 she entered [[Vassar College]] classified as a special student.  Somewhat over a year later she was admitted to the senior class, graduating in 1870 with a bachelor's degree.  She then earned a Master of Art's degree with a thesis on the chemical analysis of iron ore. The strongest personal influences during her college years were [[Maria Mitchell]], the astronomer, and Professor Charles S. Farrar (1826-1908&lt;ref name="FarrarVassar"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/faculty/original-faculty/charles-farrar.html |title= Charles Farrar |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= Vassar Encyclopedia|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who was at the head of the Department of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

In 1870, she wrote to Merrick and Gray, commercial chemists in Boston, asking if they would take her on as an apprentice.  They replied that they were not in a position to take pupils, and that her best course was to try to enter the Institute of Technology of Boston as a student.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;
On December 10, 1870, after some discussion and a vote, the Faculty of the Institute of Technology recommend to the Corporation the admission of Miss Swallow as a special student in Chemistry.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt; Swallow thus became the first woman admitted to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where she was able to continue her studies, "it being understood that her admission did not establish a precedent for the general admission of females" according to the records of the meeting of the [[MIT Corporation]] on December 14, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-mit.html#corp Ellen Swallow Richards &amp; MIT: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1873, Swallow received a Bachelor of Science degree from MIT for her thesis, "Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-swallow.pdf Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt; She continued her studies at MIT and would have been awarded its first advanced degree, but MIT balked at granting this distinction to a woman and did not award its first advanced degree, a Master of Science in Chemistry, until 1886.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Richards served on the board of trustees of Vassar College for many years and was granted an honorary doctor of science degree in 1910.

=== Marriage and home ===
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards 1904.jpg|upright|thumb|Robert and Ellen Richards, 1904]]
On June 4, 1875, Miss Swallow married [[Robert Hallowell Richards|Robert H. Richards]] (1844-1945), chairman of the [[Mine Engineering]] Department at MIT, with whom she had worked in the mineralogy laboratory.  They took up residence in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. With her husband's support she remained associated with MIT, volunteering her services and contributing $1,000 annually to the "Woman's Laboratory," a program in which her students were mostly schoolteachers, whose training had lacked laboratory work, and who wanted to perform chemical experiments and learn mineralogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossiter|first1=Margaret W.|title=Women Scientists in America|date=1982|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801824435|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Her first post-college career was as an unpaid chemistry lecturer at MIT from 1873 to 1878.&lt;ref name=zierdt /&gt;

[[File:Lawrence Experiment Station - DSC03522.JPG|thumb|right|2011 addition to the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]]]]
From 1884 until her death, Swallow now Richards was an instructor at the newly founded laboratory of sanitary chemistry at the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]], the first in the United States, headed by her former professor [[William R. Nichols]].

In 1884 she was appointed as an instructor in sanitary chemistry at a newly formed MIT laboratory for the study of sanitation.&lt;ref name=ogilvie&gt;{{Cite book

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Richards was a consulting chemist for the Massachusetts State Board of Health from 1872 to 1875, and the Commonwealth's official water analyst from 1887 until 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/women-scientists/ellen-h-swallow-richards.html|title=Ellen H.

== Scientific experiments ==

=== Air and water quality ===

In the 1880s, her interests turned toward issues of sanitation, in particular air and water quality.&lt;ref name=zierdt /&gt; She performed a series of water tests on 40,000 samples of local waters which served as drinking water for their immediate populations.  These led to the so-called "Richards' Normal Chlorine Map" which was predictive of inland water pollution in the state of Massachusetts. This map plotted the chloride concentrations in waters of the state. It illustrated the natural distribution of chlorides from the ocean. (Her survey long preceded the practice of road de-icing with chlorine derivative salts.) Her map plotted greater than 6.5 parts per million (ppm) of chloride near the coast, with Cape Cod concentrations well in excess of 10 ppm and with a near-steady decreasing gradient to less than 1 ppm about the Berkshire Hills in the extreme western end of the state. Thereby waters with chloride concentrations that deviated from the plot could be suspected of human pollution. As a result, Massachusetts established the first water-quality standards in America, and the first modern [[sewage treatment plant]] was created.&lt;ref name=oakes /&gt;

=== Mineralogy ===
Richards' master's thesis at Vassar was an analysis of the amount of [[vanadium]] in iron ore.&lt;ref name=oakes&gt;{{Cite book

        }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She performed numerous experiments in mineralogy, including the discovery of an insoluble residue of the rare mineral [[Samarskite-(Y)|samarskite]]. This was later determined by other scientists to yield [[samarium]] and [[gadolinium]]. In 1879 she was recognized by the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers as their first female member.&lt;ref name=zierdt&gt;{{Cite book

        }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home sanitation ===
Richards applied her scientific knowledge to the home. Since women were responsible for the home and family nutrition at the time, Richards felt that all women should be educated in the sciences. She wrote books about science for use in the home, such as ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning'', published in 1882.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{Cite book

        }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book ''Food Materials and Their Adulterations''(1885) led to the passing of the first Pure Food and Drug Act in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=oakes /&gt;

She used her own home as a kind of experimental laboratory for healthier living through science. Concerned with air quality in her home, she moved from coal heating and cooking oil to gas. She and her husband installed fans to pull air from the home to the outside to create a cleaner air environment within the home. She also determined the water quality of the property's well through chemical testing, and to insure that waste water was not contaminating the drinking water.&lt;ref name=clarke /&gt;

=== Euthenics ===

Richards derived the term [[euthenics]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb Eutheneo, Εὐθηνέω (eu, well; the, root of tithemi, to cause). To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richards | first = Ellen H. Swallow | title = Euthenics: The Science of Controllable Environment : A Plea for Better Conditions As a First Step Toward Higher Human Efficiency | publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows | edition = 2nd | location = Boston | origyear = 1910 | year = 1912 | isbn = 0405098278 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt; The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]] - Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Euthenics: the science of controllable environment'' (1910),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
    |publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows

    |title = Euthenics, the science of controllable environment
    |publication-date = 1910
    }}&lt;/ref&gt; she defined the term as the betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings.

Vigorous debate about its exact meaning, confusion with the term [[eugenics]], followed by the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars, were among the many factors which led to the movement never really getting the funding, nor the attention needed to put together a lasting, vastly multidisciplinary curriculum as defined by Richards. Instead, different disciplines such as Child Study became one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that:&lt;blockquote&gt; Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richards was the first writer to use the term euthenics, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | editor-last = Birx | editor-first = H.J. | title = Euthenics | series = Encyclopedia of Anthropology | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | volume = 5 Vols. | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412952453 | doi = 10.4135/9781412952453 | url =http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/anthropology/n312.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laboratory work ===
After her first experience as water analyst under Professor Nichols, Richards began a large, private practice in sanitary chemistry, including testing water, air and food, and the testing wallpapers and fabrics for [[arsenic]]. In 1878 and 1879 she examined a large number of staple groceries for the state. The results of her investigation were published in the first annual report of the Board of Health, Lunacy and Charity, which had succeeded the earlier Board of Health.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

She also served as a consultant to the [[Zachariah Allen|Manufacturers Mutual Fire Insurance Company]] and in 1900 wrote the textbook ''Air, Water, and Food from a Sanitary Standpoint'', with A. G. Woodman. Her interest in the environment led her to introduce the word [[ecology]] into English around 1892. The word had been coined by German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to describe the "household of nature".

Richards' interests also included applying scientific principles to domestic situations, such as [[nutrition]], [[clothing]], [[physical fitness]], [[sanitation]], and efficient home management, creating the field of [[home economics]]. "Perhaps the fact that I am not a radical and that I do not scorn womanly duties but claim it as a privilege to clean up and sort of supervise the room and sew things is winning me stronger allies than anything else," she wrote to her parents. She published ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning: A Manual for House-keepers'' in 1881, designed and demonstrated model kitchens, devised curricula, and organized conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-rumford.html Ellen Swallow Richards: Rumford Kitchen: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's education ==

=== Woman's Laboratory assistant instructor ===
Mrs. Richards appeared before the [[American Association of University Women|Woman's Education Association]] of Boston on November 11, 1875, and in an address, which made a deep impression, set forth the needs of women. She expressed the belief that the governing board of the Institute of Technology would provide space for a woman's laboratory if the Association would supply the necessary money for instruments, apparatus, and books. She said that scholarships would be indispensable.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

The Woman's Education Association appointed a committee to enter into discussions with the Institute of Technology, which led to the creation of the MIT Woman's Laboratory in November 1876. The Institute provided a small building, planned for a gymnasium, as the location of the Laboratory.  Mrs. Richards became an unpaid assistant instructor in 1879 in [[chemical analysis]], [[industrial chemistry]], [[mineralogy]], and [[biology|applied biology]] under Professor John M. Ordway. The Woman's Education Association agreed to raise money to buy equipment for the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

A new building, erected by the Institute in 1883, reserved space for all laboratory students' use, women as well as men. The original Woman's Laboratory was closed and the building demolished.

In 1884, Mrs. Richards was appointed Instructor in Sanitary Chemistry in the Institute of Technology itself, a position which she filled until the time of her death. In addition to her faculty duties and instructional work, she was also the "untitled" Dean of Women.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== American correspondence school instructor ===
In January 1876, Mrs. Richards began a long association with the first American correspondence school, the [[Society to Encourage Studies at Home]], as an instructor, and developed its science department.&lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt;

In 1886, a new section promoted by Richards, Sanitary Science, was established by the Society. This was at a time when household conveniences employing water, gas, or electricity were becoming more common, but housekeepers seldom understood the dangers or difficulties inherent in using these new appliances. She saw that instruction was needed and the Society began to provide information on how to organize a house on truly scientific principles.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== American Association of University Women ===

[[File:AAUW Headquarters by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|upright|Headquarters of the AAUW in Washington DC]]
Richards and [[Marion Talbot]] (Boston University class of 1880) became the "founding mothers" of what was to become the [[American Association of University Women]] (AAUW) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://history.aauw.org/|website=AAUW.org|publisher=AAUW|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they invited fifteen other women college graduates to a meeting at Talbot's home in Boston, on November 28, 1881. The group envisioned an organization in which women college graduates would band together to open the doors of higher education to other women and to find wider opportunities for their training. The Association of Collegiate Alumnae (ACA), AAUW's predecessor organization, was officially founded on January 14, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of Collegiate Alumnae Records|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss323.html|publisher=Five College Archives &amp; Manuscript Collections|website=five colleges.edu|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teachers' School of Science ===
[[Lucretia Crocker]], along with women's clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a "[[Teachers' School of Science]]" in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society.  Along with Mrs. Richards, Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers.  Teacher found such education in the Boston area because of area scientist that would teach their courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kohlstedt, Sally Gregory. |title = Nature, Not Books: Scientists and the Origins of the Nature-Study Movement in the 1890s. Isis, Vol. 96, No. 3 |date = September 2005 |pages=324–352, p. 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New England Kitchen of Boston ===
In January 1, 1890, Richards collaborated with [[Mary Abel|Mary Hinman Abel]] (1850–1938) to found the New England Kitchen of Boston, at 142 Pleasant Street.  Using volunteers of modest circumstances, they experimented with ways to prepare the most inexpensive, tasty and nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Years later, Mrs. Richards, herself, wrote in her preface to part one of ''The Rumford kitchen leaflets: No. 17, The Story of the New England Kitchen; Part II; A study in social economics'', by Mary Abel:&lt;ref name="RumfordKitchen" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of the New England Kitchen ... is remarkable for two things: the new and valuable information which has been acquired, as the result of the daily work of the Kitchen, and the short time which has sufficed to put the enterprise on a business basis.

It is well to emphasize the causes of this success, that the lessons in social science and practical philanthropy be not lost. A large part of the credit is due ... to Mrs. Abel's hard work[.] [S]tarting the New England Kitchen ... was ... an experiment to determine the successful conditions of preparing, by scientific methods, from the cheaper food materials, nutritious and palatable dishes, which should find a ready demand at paying prices.

Mrs. Abel would doubtless give as the principal secret of her success, that she had everything necessary for the experiments, without giving a thought to the cost. ... In the New England Kitchen, the selection of the apparatus and material and the employment of labor have been without restriction. Without this freedom to carry on the experiments as seemed wise and prudent, the results detailed in the accompanying report could not have been attained.

The philanthropy of the scheme rests in the experimental stage of the development of the New England Kitchen. Whether the business can in the future take care of itself to the profit of those who conduct it remains to be seen ; but, in any event, kitchens of this kind cannot fail to be of great advantage to multitudes in moderate circumstances, who have hitherto been unable to buy good, nutritious, and tasteful cooked food.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Rumford Kitchen ===
[[File:CountRumfordFrontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Count Rumford]] frontispiece of the Rumford Kitchen leaflets]]
In 1893, when Richards was in charge of the Rumford Kitchen at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Fair in Chicago]], she accepted the added work and responsibility of arranging an exhibition of the work of Studies at Home.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

The opening statement of the ''Guide to the Rumford Kitchen: An Exhibit made by the State of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation'' ([[World's Columbian Exposition]], Chicago, 1893) by General [[Francis Amasa Walker|Francis A. Walker]] explains:&lt;ref name="RumfordKitchen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richards | first = Ellen H.  | title = Plain words about food: the Rumford kitchen leaflets, 1899. | publisher = Rockwell and Churchill Press | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1899 | isbn = | lccn = | url = http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/2936825?n=1&amp;imagesize=1200&amp;jp2Res=.5&amp;printThumbnails=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The exhibit known as the Rumford Kitchen is the outgrowth of the work, in the application of the principles of chemistry to the science of cooking, which has for three years been carried on as an educational agency by Mrs. Robert H. Richards and Mrs. Dr. John J. Abel, with pecuniary assistance from certain public-spirited citizens of Boston.

The Massachusetts Board of World's Fair Managers, ... believing that such practical demonstration of the usefulness of domestic science could not fail to be of advantage to multitudes of visitors to the Columbian Exposition, have invited the ladies named to open the Rumford Kitchen as a part of the exhibit of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation.

In order to reduce, in some degree, the expenses of this exhibit, the food cooked in the Rumford Kitchen will be sold under a concession from the administration of the Exposition ; but it should be understood that this is not a money-making exhibit ; that nothing is cooked for the sake of being sold ; and that the enterprise is to be regarded as absolutely a scientific and educational one.

The purpose of the exhibit in the Rumford Kitchen is two-fold : First, to commemorate the services to the cause of domestic science rendered by [[Count Rumford]] one hundred years ago[;] ... second, to serve as an incentive to further work in the same direction, as he expressed it," to provoke men to investigation," "to cause doubt, that first step toward knowledge."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first commercially available "modern" [[Rumford fireplace|kitchen ranges]] began to appear about 1800, they were the invention of an American named Sir Benjamin Thompson, [[Benjamin Thompson|Count von Rumford]].

=== American Public School Lunch Program ===
A first, major program was started in some Boston high schools in 1894 to provide nutritional meals at low prices to children who would not normally have them. Due in large part to Ellen Richards and [[Edward Atkinson (activist)|Edward Atkinson]], the New England Kitchen ran the program as a 'private enterprise' that paid for itself many times over. The lunches never became effective instruments for teaching the New Nutrition the founders had envisaged. But, because the program provided nutritious meals children would otherwise not have, it became the main justification for similar lunch programs in other cities."&lt;ref name="Levenstein"&gt;{{cite book | last = Levenstein | first = Harvey | title = Revolution at the Table: The Transformation of the American Diet | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | edition = | location = New York | year = 1988 | page = 116 | isbn =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed into law the [[National School Lunch Program]] to provide low-cost or free [[School meal|school lunch meals]] to qualified students through subsidies to schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1946-national-school-lunch-act/ Copy of the School Lunch Act As Enacted in 1946], Federal Education Policy History website&lt;/ref&gt; The program was established as a way to prop up food prices by absorbing farm surpluses, while at the same time providing food to school age children. It was named after Richard Russell, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/Lunch/AboutLunch/ProgramHistory_4.htm The National School Lunch Program Background and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lake Placid Conference ===
Early in September, 1899, trustees of the [[Lake Placid Club]] (Morningside, New York) thought it was the right time to bring together those most interested in home science, or household economics and sent out many invitations for the Lake Placid Conference scheduled to take place Sept. 19-25, 1899. [[Melvil Dewey]], one of the club's trustees, personally invited Richards to attend.  She gave a lecture on standards of living and was elected chairman of the conference.&lt;ref name="LakePlacidConference"&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Richards | editor-first = Ellen H. | title = Lake Placid Conference proceedings | series = Lake Placid Conference | year = 1901–1908 | pages =  | place = Lake Placid, NY | publisher = American Home Economics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Home Economics Association ===
In 1908, Richards was chosen as the first president of the newly formed American Home Economics Association, which was renamed the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]] in 1994. She also founded and funded the Association's periodical, the ''Journal of Home Economics'', which began publication in 1909. It was renamed the ''Journal of Family and Consumer Sciences'' in 1994 when the Association changed its name.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Her books and writings on this topic include ''Food Materials and their Adulterations'' (1886); ''Conservation by Sanitation''; ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning''; ''The Cost of Living'' (1899); ''Air, Water, and Food'' (1900); ''The Cost of Food''; ''The Cost of Shelter''; ''The Art of Right Living''; ''The Cost of Cleanness''; ''Sanitation in Daily Life'' (1907); and ''[[Euthenics]], the Science of Controllable Environment'' (1910). Some of these went through several editions.

== Death ==
Richards died on March 30, 1911 at her home in [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts]] after suffering with [[angina]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Mrs. Ellen H.

The '''Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland''' ({{lang-da|Danmarks og Grønlands Geologiske Undersøgelse, GEUS}}) is the independent [[Sector research institutes of Denmark|sector research institute]] under the Danish [[Ministry of Climate and Energy (Denmark)|Ministry of Climate and Energy]].  GEUS is an advisory, research and survey institute in [[hydrogeology]], [[geophysics]], [[geochemistry]], [[stratigraphy]], [[glaciology]], [[ore geology]], [[marine geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[climatology]], environmental history, air photo [[wikt:interpretation|interpretation]], [[geothermal energy]] fields concerning [[Denmark]] and [[Greenland]].

GEUS works in close corporation with [[Geologisk Institut]] and [[Geologisk Museum]], both part of [[University of Copenhagen]].

It publishes a service paper called ''Greenland Hydrocarbon Exploration Information Service''  (GHEXIS) and a newsletter called Greenland Mineral Exploration Newsletter  (MINEX) in co-operation with the [[Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum]] (Råstofdirektoratet), a secretariat for the Joint Committee on Mineral Resources under Greenland’s home rule.

==History==
In 1888 {{lang|da|Danmarks Geologiske Undersøgelse}} (DGU) was founded{{by whom?|date=January 2015}}. 

In 1946, {{lang|da|Grønlands Geologiske Undersøgelse}} was created.  

On 14 June 1965, law no. 238 created GGU.

On 23 December 1987, law no. 864 merged GGU into DGU, changing its name to DGGU ({{lang|da|Danmarks og Grønlands Geologiske Undersøgelse}}).

On 14 June 1995, Law no. 408  disbanded law no. 238. 

On 20 December 1995, law no. 1076 concerning Danish sector research institutes created GEUS by merging DGU and GGU.

[[File:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A gloss is a marginal notation regarding the main text in a document. Shown is a parchment page from the Royal Library of Copenhagen.]]
A '''gloss''' ({{ety|la|glossa}}; {{ety|gre|''γλῶσσα'' glōssa|language}}) is a brief notation, especially a [[marginalia|marginal]] one or an [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] one, of the meaning of a word or wording in a text. It may be in the language of the text, or in the reader's language if that is different. 

A collection of glosses is a ''[[glossary]].'' A collection of medieval legal glosses, made by [[glossators]], is called an ''apparatus''. The compilation of glosses into glossaries was the beginning of [[lexicography]], and the glossaries so compiled were in fact the first [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. In modern times a glossary, as opposed to a dictionary, is typically found in a text as an appendix of specialized terms that the typical reader may find unfamiliar. Also, satirical explanations of words and events are called glosses. The [[German Romanticism|German Romantic movement]] used the expression of gloss for poems commenting on a given other piece of poetry, often in the Spanish [[Décima]] style. 

Glosses were originally notes made in the margin or between the lines of a text in a [[classical language]]; the meaning of a word or passage is explained by the gloss. As such, glosses vary in thoroughness and complexity, from simple marginal notations of words one reader found difficult or obscure, to interlinear [[translation]]s of a text with cross references to similar passages. Today [[bracket#Parentheses|parenthetical]] explanations in [[scientific writing]] and [[technical writing]] are also often called glosses. [[Hyperlink]]s to a [[glossary]] sometimes supersede them.

==Etymology==
The word "gloss" was first used in the 1570s to refer to the insertion of a word as an explanation. It began to be used to mean to "explain away" in the 1630s, and originated from the concept of a note being inserted in the margin of a text to explain a difficult word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.etymonline.com/word/gloss|title=Gloss|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Biblical gloss}}
Glosses and other marginal notes were a primary format used in medieval Biblical [[theology]], and were studied and memorized for their own merit. Many Biblical passages came to be associated with a particular gloss, whose truth was taken to be scriptural. Indeed, in one case, it is generally reckoned that an early gloss explicating the doctrine of the Trinity made its way into the Scriptural text itself, in the passage known as the "three heavenly witnesses" or the ''[[Comma Johanneum]]'', which is present in the Vulgate Latin and the third and later editions of the Greek [[Textus Receptus]] collated by Erasmus (the first two editions excluded it for lack of manuscript evidence), but is absent from all modern critical reconstructions of the New Testament text, such as [[Westcott and Hort]], [[Tischendorf]], and [[Nestle-Aland]].

==In law==
{{See also|Glossator}}
In the medieval legal tradition, the glosses on [[Roman law]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] created standards of reference, so-called ''sedes materiae'' (literally: seat of the matter). In [[common law]] countries, the term "judicial gloss" refers to what is considered an authoritative or "official" [[Statutory interpretation|interpretation]] of a statute or regulation by a [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial glosses are often very important in avoiding contradictions between statutes, and determining the [[constitutionality]] of various provisions of law.

==In literature==
A gloss, or ''glosa'', is a verse in traditional [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] literature and music which follows and comments on a refrain (the "''mote''"). See also [[villancico]].

==In philology==
[[Image:Codiceemil.jpg|thumb|The [[Glosas Emilianenses]] are glosses added to this Latin codex that are now considered the first phrases written in the [[Castilian language]].]]
Glosses are of some importance in [[philology]], especially if one language&amp;mdash;usually, the language of the author of the gloss&amp;mdash;has left few texts of its own. The [[Reichenau Glosses]], for example, gloss the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] [[Bible]] in an early form of one of the [[Romance languages]], and as such give insight into late [[Vulgar Latin]] at a time when that language was not often written down. A series of glosses in the [[Old English language]] to Latin Bibles give us a running translation of Biblical texts in that language; see ''[[Old English Bible translations]]''. Glosses of Christian religious texts are also important for our knowledge of [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]. Glosses frequently shed valuable light on the vocabulary of otherwise little attested languages; they are less reliable for [[syntax]], because many times the glosses follow the word order of the original text, and translate its [[idiom]]s literally.

==In linguistics{{anchor|In linguistics}}==
{{Main|Interlinear gloss}}
In [[linguistics]], a simple gloss in running text may be marked by quotation marks and follow the transcription of a foreign word. Single quotes are a widely used convention.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lyle. 2004. ''Historical Linguistics: An Introduction''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; For example: 

* A [[Cossack]] longboat is called a ''chaika'' 'seagull'.
* The [[moose]] gains its name from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] ''mus'' or ''mooz'' ('twig eater').

A longer or more complex transcription may rely upon an ''[[interlinear gloss]]''.  Such a gloss may be placed between a [[text corpus|text]] and its translation when it is important to understand the structure of the language being glossed, and not just the overall meaning of the passage.

===Glossing sign languages{{anchor|Glossing signed languages}}{{anchor|Glossing sign languages}}===
[[Sign language]]s are typically transcribed word-for-word by means of a gloss written in the predominant oral language in all capitals; [[American Sign Language]] and [[Auslan]] would be written in English. [[Prosody (linguistics)|Prosody]] is often glossed as superscript words, with its scope indicated by brackets. 

{{quotation|[I LIKE]&lt;sup&gt;NEGATIVE&lt;/sup&gt; [WHAT?]&lt;sup&gt;RHETORICAL&lt;/sup&gt;, GARLIC.
&lt;br&gt;"I don't like garlic."}}

Pure [[fingerspelling]] is usually indicated by hyphenation.  Fingerspelled words that have been lexicalized (that is, fingerspelling sequences that have entered the sign language as linguistic units and that often have slight modifications) are indicated with a hash.  For example, ''W-I-K-I'' indicates a simple fingerspelled word, but ''#JOB'' indicates a lexicalized unit, produced like ''J-O-B'', but faster, with a barely perceptible ''O'' and turning the "B" hand palm side in, unlike a regularly fingerspelled "B".

'''Hand-waving''' (with various spellings) is a [[pejorative]] label for attempting to be seen as effective – in word, reasoning, or deed – while actually doing nothing effective or substantial.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=hand wave |work=Dictionary.com |date=2016 |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hand-waving}} Cites the ''[[Random House Dictionary]]'' and ''The Dictionary of American Slang'' 4th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is most often applied to [[debate]] techniques that involve [[fallacies]], misdirection and the glossing over of details.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF"&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=handwave |work=The New Hacker's Dictionary |edition=3rd |editor1-first=Eric S.|editor1-last=Raymond|editor1-link=Eric S. Raymond |editor2-first=Guy L.|editor2-last=Steele|editor2-link=Guy L. Steele, Jr. |date=1996 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-68092-0}}  Online edition: {{cite web |title=The Jargon File |version=4.4.7 |url= http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/handwave.html &lt;!-- archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105200416/http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/ --&gt;}} [http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/ Homepage] mentions a ver. 4.4.8, but the text of the work says [http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/index.html 4.4.7].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used academically to indicate unproven claims and skipped steps in proofs (sometimes intentionally, especially in instructional materials), with some specific meanings in particular fields, including literary criticism and speculative fiction, mathematics and logic, and science and engineering. The term can additionally be used in work situations, when attempts are made to display productivity or assure accountability without actually resulting in them. The term can also be used as a self-admission of, and suggestion to defer discussion about, an allegedly unimportant weakness in one's own argument's evidence, to forestall an opponent dwelling on it. In [[debate competition]], certain cases of this form of hand-waving may be explicitly permitted.

''Hand-waving'' is an [[idiom]]atic [[metaphor]], derived in part from the use of excessive [[gesticulation]], perceived as unproductive, distracting or nervous, in communication or other effort.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The term also evokes the [[sleight-of-hand]] distraction techniques of [[stage magic]],&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt; and suggests that the speaker or writer seems to believe that if they, figuratively speaking, simply wave their hands, no one will notice or speak up about the holes in the reasoning.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt; This implication of misleading intent has been reinforced by the pop-culture influence of the [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' franchise]], in which mystically powerful hand-waving is fictionally used for [[mind control]], and some uses of the term in public discourse are explicit ''Star Wars'' references.&lt;ref name="CBS_Bronco"&gt;An example in the sports press of "Jedi mind trick": [http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25449738/one-bronco-thinks-roethlisbergers-injury-is-a-jedi-mind-trick One Bronco thinks Roethlisberger's injury is a 'Jedi mind trick']&lt;nowiki /&gt;&amp;thinsp;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual hand-waving motions may be used either by a speaker to indicate a desire to avoid going into details,&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt; or by critics to indicate that they believe the proponent of an argument is engaging in a verbal hand-wave inappropriately.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt;

== Spelling and history ==
The spelling of the [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] varies (both with regard to this idiom and the everyday human communication gesture of [[Wave (gesture)|waving]]). While ''hand-waving'' is the most common spelling of the unitary [[present participle]] and [[gerund]] in this usage, and ''hand-wave'' of the [[simple present]] verb, ''hand wave'' dominates as the [[Noun phrase|noun-phrase]] form. ''Handwaving'' and ''handwave'' may be preferred in some circles, and are well attested.&lt;ref name="note"&gt;Usage patterns are easily observable with Google and other search engines, which also reveal the difficulty of excluding false positives from various particular search terms.&lt;/ref&gt; "Hand waving" is mostly used otherwise, e.g. "she had one hand waving, the other on the rail", but is found in some dictionaries in this form.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt; A more arch, mock-antiquarian construction is ''waving of [the] hands''. [[Superlative]] constructions such as "vigorous hand-waving", "waved their hand[s] furiously", "lots of waving of hands", etc., are used to imply that the hand-waver lacks confidence in the information being conveyed, cannot convincingly express or defend the core of the argument being advanced. The descriptive epithet ''hand-waver'' has been applied to those engaging in hand-waving, but is not common.  The opposite of hand-waving is sometimes called '''nose-following''' in mathematics {{see below|In mathematics|short=y}}.

However it is spelled, the expression is also used the original literal meaning of gesturing in a greeting, departing, excited, or attention-seeking manner by waving the hands, as in "friendly were the hand-waving crowds ..." (— [[Sinclair Lewis]]),&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt; which dates to the mid-17th century as a hyphenated verb&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries.com UK"&gt;{{cite web |title=hand-wave |work=Oxford Dictionaries Online |edition=British and World English |date=2015 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url= https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/hand-wave |access-date=January 26, 2015}} This is an online edition of ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' with additional material.&lt;/ref&gt; and the early 19th century United States as a fully compounded verb.&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries.com US 1"&gt;{{cite web |title=handwave |work=Oxford Dictionaries Online |version=American English |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url= https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/handwave |access-date=January 26, 2015}} This is an online edition of the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear when the figurative usage arose. The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' lists it as "extended use",&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries.com UK" /&gt; and it appears primarily in modern American dictionaries, some of which label it "informal".&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt;

==In debate, generally==
{{anchor|Debate|In debate}}Handwaving is frequently used in low-quality [[debate]], including [[political campaign]]ing and [[Political criticism|commentary]], issue-based [[advocacy]], [[advertising]] and [[public relations]], [[tabloid journalism]], [[Op-ed|opinion piece]]s, [[Internet meme]]s, and informal discussion and writing. If the opponent in a debate or commentator on an argument alleges hand-waving, it suggests the proponent of the argument, position or message has engaged in one or more [[Fallacy|fallacies of logic]],&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt; usually [[Informal fallacy|informal]], and/or glossed over non-trivial details,&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt; and is attempting to {{em|wave away}} challenges and deflect questions, as if swatting at flies.  The ''distraction'' inherent in the sense of the term has become a key part of the meaning.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt; The fallacies in question vary, but often include one of the many variants of [[argument to emotion]], and in political discourse frequently involve unjustified assignment or transference of blame.  Hand-waving is not itself a fallacy; the proponent's argument may incidentally be correct despite their failure to properly support it.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt;  A tertiary meaning refers to use of poorly-reasoned arguments specifically to impress&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries.com US 2"&gt;{{cite web |title=hand-waving |work=Oxford Dictionaries Online |version=American English |date=2015 |url= https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/hand-waving |access-date=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or persuade.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionaries.com US 2" /&gt;

''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' (a.k.a. ''[[Jargon File|The Jargon File]]'') observes:
{{quote|If someone starts a sentence with "Clearly..." or "Obviously..." or "It is self-evident that...", it is a good bet he is about to handwave (alternatively, use of these constructions in a sarcastic tone before a paraphrase of someone else's argument suggests that it is a handwave). The theory behind this term is that if you wave your hands at the right moment, the listener may be sufficiently distracted to not notice that what you have said is bogus [i.e., incorrect]. Failing that, if a listener does object, you might try to dismiss the objection with a wave of your hand.&lt;ref name="NHD-JF" /&gt;}}

The implication that hand-waving is done with the specific intent to mislead has long been attached to the term, due to the use of literal waving of a hand – either natural-looking or showy, but never desperate – by [[Magic (illusion)|illusionists]] to distract audiences and [[Misdirection (magic)|misdirect]] their attention from the mechanisms of the [[sleight-of-hand]], [[Glossary of magic (illusion)#G|gimmicked]] props or other trick being used in the performance. This meaning has become reinforced in recent decades by the influence of ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and its sequels, in which the fictional [[Jedi mind trick]] involves a subtle hand wave with mystical powers – that only work on the weak-minded – to disguise reality and compel compliance.  Consequently, there is an implication in current usage that a hand-waver may be craftily intending to deceive, and has a low opinion of the intelligence of the opponent or (especially) an audience or the general public.  The labels "Jedi hand wave" and "Jedi mind trick" themselves are sometimes applied, in a tongue-in-cheek way, to this manipulation technique in public discourse;&lt;ref name="CBS_Bronco"/&gt; US Congressman [[Luke Messer]]'s use of it in reference to [[President Barack Obama]]'s 2016 [[State of the Union address]] generated headlines.&lt;ref name="Jedi 2"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35256156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fox59.com/2016/01/17/in-focus-rep-messer-calls-presidents-speech-jedi-mind-trick/&lt;/ref&gt;

In an unplanned debate or presentation, an off-the-cuff essay, or an informal discussion, the proponent may have little or no time for preparation. Participants in such exchanges may use the term in reference to their own arguments, in the same sense as an author admitting a minor plot flaw {{see below|In literary criticism|short=y}}. When the proponents use the term, they are conceding that they know an ancillary point of or intermediate step in their arguments is poorly supported; they are suggesting that such details aren't important and do not affect their key arguments or conclusions, and that the hand-waved details should be excluded from current consideration.  Examples include when they believe a statement is true but cannot prove it at that time, and when the sources upon which they are relying conflict in minor ways: "I'm hand-waving over the exact statistics here, but they all show at least a 20% increase, so let's move on".

In formal [[debate competition]], certain forms of hand-waving may sometimes be explicitly permitted. In [[policy debate]], the concept of ''[[Fiat (policy debate)|fiat]]'' allows a team to pursue a line a reasoning based on a scenario that is not presently true, if a judge is satisfied that the case has been that it could become true.

==In literary criticism==
{{anchor|Literary criticism}}
By extension, handwaving is used in [[Literary criticism|literary, film and other media criticism]] of [[speculative fiction]] to refer to a [[plot device]] (e.g., a scientific discovery, a political development, or rules governing the behavior of a fictional creature) that is left unexplained or sloppily explained because it is convenient to the story, with the implication that the writer is aware of the logical weakness but hopes the audience will not notice or will [[Suspension of disbelief|suspend disbelief]] regarding such a [[macguffin]], ''[[deus ex machina]]'', [[continuity error]] or [[plot hole]].

The fictional material "[[handwavium]]" (a.k.a. "unobtainium", among other humorous names) is sometimes referred to in situations where the plot requires access to a substance of great value and properties that cannot be explained by real-world science, but is convenient to solving, or central to creating, a problem for the characters in the story. Perhaps the best known example is the [[Melange (fictional drug)|spice melange]], a fictional drug with supernatural properties, in [[Frank Herbert]]'s far-future [[science-fantasy]] epic, ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]''.

''Hand-waving'' has come to be used in [[role-playing games]] to describe actions and conversations that are quickly glossed over, rather than acted out in full according to the rules. This may be done to keep from bogging down the play of the game with time-consuming but minor details.

==In mathematics (and formal logic, philosophy, theoretical science)==
{{anchor|Mathematics|In mathematics}}
In mathematics, and theory-dominated disciplines in which mathematics plays a major role, ''hand-waving'' refers to a reliance on heuristic, as opposed to rigorous, arguments. These may be useful in expository papers and seminar presentations, but fall short of the standard of proof needed to establish a result.

An accusation of mathematical hand-waving can be a professional attack, intended to denigrate the reliability of a speaker who has attempted to assert a proposition without being able to prove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gus Wiseman's answer to What do mathematicians mean by "hand-waving" and why is it important?|url=https://www.quora.com/What-do-mathematicians-mean-by-hand-waving-and-why-is-it-important/answer/Gus-Wiseman}}{{self-published inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical profession tends to be receptive to informed critiques from any listener, and a claimant to a new result is expected to be able to answer any such question with a logical argument, up to a full proof. Should a speaker apparently fail to give such an answer, anyone in the audience who can supply the needed demonstration may sometimes upstage the speaker. The objector in such a case might receive some measure credit for the theorem the hand-waver presented.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The opposite of hand-waving in mathematics and related fields is sometimes called '''nose-following''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Polycategories via pseudo-distributive laws|journal=Advances in Mathematics|volume=218|issue=3|pages=781|arxiv=math/0606735|last1=Garner|first1=Richard|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.aim.2008.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2016|reason=Implying what? This needs a contextual explanation, especially since this page also serves as the article for [[Nose-following]], which redirects here!}} meaning the unimaginative development of a narrow line of reasoning.

The rationale for this culture of hyper-critical scrutiny is suggested by a quote of [[G. H. Hardy]]: "[A mathematician's] subject is the most curious of all—there is none in which truth plays such odd pranks. It has the most elaborate and the most fascinating technique, and gives unrivalled openings for the display of sheer professional skill."&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Hardy (1940). "A Mathematician's Apology".&lt;/ref&gt;

==In applied science and engineering==
{{anchor|Science and engineering|In science and engineering}}
Hand-waving arguments in [[engineering]] and other [[applied sciences]] often include [[Orders of magnitude|order-of-magnitude]] estimates and [[dimensional analysis]], especially in the use of [[Fermi problem]]s in physics and engineering education. However, competent, well-intentioned researchers and professors also rely on explicitly declared hand-waving when, given a limited time, a large result must be shown and minor technical details cannot be given much attention&amp;mdash;e.g., "it can be shown that {{var|z}} is an even number", as an intermediary step in reaching a conclusion.

[[Back-of-the-envelope calculation]]s are approximate ways to get an answer by over-simplification, and are comparable to hand-waving in this sense.

==In business==

''Hand-waving'' has been used to describe work-related situations where productivity is seemingly displayed but deliverables are not produced, especially intentional engagement in [[busy work]] or pretend-work, vague claims of overwork or complications, impenetrably [[buzzword]]-laden rationalizations for delays or otherwise poor performance, and plausible-sounding but weak excuse-making and attention-deflecting tactics.  In employment situations, as in political discourse, a hand-waving effort may seek to shift blame to other parties.

Another use is in reference to fiscal problems, such as an inability to adequately explain accounting discrepancies or an avoidance of accountability for missing funds.

The '''Iconography of Gautama Buddha''' in [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]] is referred to as '''''pang phraputtarup''''' [[:th:ปางพระพุทธรูป]], and a given pose as ''pang'' {{lang-th|ปาง episode}}. These recall specific [[episode]]s during his [[Gautama Buddha#Travels and teaching|travels and teachings]] that are familiar to the Buddhists according to an '''[[iconography]]''' with specific rules; certain ones of these are considered particularly [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] for those born on particular days of the week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmta.com/Thai-Birthday.htm ''Thai birth day colors and Buddha image'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha is always represented with certain physical attributes, and in specified dress and specified poses. Each pose, and particularly the position and gestures of the Buddha's hands, has a defined meaning which is familiar to Buddhists.  In other Buddhist countries, different but related iconography is used, for example the [[mudra]]s in Indian art.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Buddha Reclining Bangkok Thailand by D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Reclining Buddha]]

For Buddhists, the correct depiction of the Buddha is not an [[wikt:anabolism|anabolistic]] matter; Buddhists believe that a properly rendered Buddha image is a [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostasis]]: an actual spiritual emanation of the Buddha, which possesses supernatural qualities. Although the Buddha is not a god, Buddhists seek to communicate with the supernatural world through Buddha images, making offerings to them and praying before them.
[[Image:Buddhistspraying.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Buddhists venerating a Buddha image ([[Wat Doi Suthep]], Chiang Mai, Thailand)]]

Buddha images are not intended to be naturalistic representations of what Gautama Buddha looked like. There are no contemporary images of him, and the oldest Buddha images date from 500 to 600 years after his lifetime. But Buddhists believe that Buddha images represent an ideal reality of the Buddha, and that every Buddha image stands at the end of a succession of images reaching back to the Buddha himself.

When creating a Buddha image, the artist is expected to be in a spiritual and mental state (''samādhi'') that will enable him to visualise this ideal reality. There is no requirement that every Buddha image be identical, and in fact there is a wide variety of artistic styles and national traditions in representing the Buddha. There are, however, certain rules of representation that must be adhered to.

==Development==
The current range of postures in which the Buddha may be shown, and the gestures which may be depicted, evolved over the first millennium of the Buddhist era (roughly 500 BCE to 500 CE), mainly in [[India]], the original homeland of Buddhism.  The tradition of images that reached South-East Asia had been changed in the later 5th century CE, apparently first at [[Sarnath]] in India.  The new "Sarnath image type" or "Gupta period Buddhist image" differs from earlier Buddha images, such as those in [[Greco-Buddhist art]], in a number of respects: the gaze is lowered, the clinging robes disclose no male genital bulge, the robe lacks folds, and there are different body proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robert L., pp. 318-319, "The Importance of Gupta-period Sculpture in Southeast Asian Art History", in ''Early Interactions Between South and Southeast Asia: Reflections on Cross-cultural Exchange'', Editors Pierre-Yves Manguin, A. Mani, Geoff Wade, 2011, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, {{ISBN|9814311162}}, 9789814311168, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FuCYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA318 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the early part of this period, the Buddha was usually shown giving a general gesture of benediction, with the right hand held at shoulder-height with the palm facing forward and the fingers together and slightly bent. By the end of the [[Gupta Empire]] (about 550 CE), the canon of representation had become more varied, with the seated meditative position (''dhyāna mudrā'' - see below) becoming common, particularly in [[Sri Lanka]]. By the 7th century CE the canon was largely as it is seen today.
[[Image:Phutthamonthon 001.jpg|thumb|222px|right|Statue of the Buddha with his hand upraised in the ''abhāya mudrā'' position. He is draped with monastic robes, with the right shoulder bare. ([[Phutthamonthon]], Thailand)]]

As Buddhism spread from India to other countries, variations in the depiction of the Buddha evolved. This article describes the canon of Buddha representation in Thailand and Laos. This canon was not formalised until the 19th century, as part of the general project of "modernisation" that followed the Buddhist world's encounter with Western civilisation. A key figure in this process was the Siamese royal prince and Buddhist monk [[Paramanuchit Chinorot]], a son of King [[Rama I]], who in 1814 was appointed administrator of the [[Wat Pho]] royal temple in [[Bangkok]]. At the request of King [[Rama III]], Paramanuchit described and represented 40 different postures of the Buddha in an illustrated treatise called ''Pathama Sambodhikatha''. Some of these, such as "Buddha threading a needle," were new, although justified through reference to the literary accounts of the Buddha's life. Paramanuchit's illustrations were later rendered as bronze miniatures, which can be seen today at [[Wat Phra Kaew]] in Bangkok and serve as templates for the creation of modern Buddhist imagery.

==Attributes of the Buddha==
[[Image:Buddhaimage3.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Reclining Buddha]] (Wat Xieng Thong, Luang Phrabāng, Laos)]] [[:th:ปางปรินิพพาน]]

The ''[[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha Nikāya]]'', a [[Pāli]] text of the 1st century BCE, gives a list of 32 physical attributes of the Buddha. Some of these are poetic or fanciful ("legs like an antelope's," "ankles like rounded shells"), while others are more specific: feet with level tread, projecting heels, long and slender fingers and toes, a tuft of hair between the eyebrows. Although it is not required that Buddha images reflect all of these attributes, many of them have acquired canonical status.

Most curiously, the Buddha is said to have had a protuberance on the top of his skull, the ''usnīsa''. This is sometimes shown as a spire or spike, and sometimes only as a small bump. The Buddha always has a serene expression or a faint smile. The Buddha is also always depicted with very [[Stretching (body piercing)|long earlobes]]. This is attributed to his earlier life as a prince, weighed down by material possession, but has since come to symbolize wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2714/why-do-statues-of-buddha-have-long-earlobes Why do statues of Buddha have long earlobes? What's the difference between fat Buddha and regular Buddha? (2007) ''Straight Dope'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posture and dress==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Buddhaimage1.JPG|thumb|250px|Modern statue of the Buddha near [[Pha That Luang]], Viang Chan, Laos. The Buddha's outstretched hand is in the ''vitarka mudrā'' position. The gesture is intended in this case to be read as an "appeal for peace."]] --&gt;

The Buddha may be depicted in one of four postures:
*Sitting: If seated, the Buddha may be shown in one of three different positions
:In the "heroic posture" (''vīrāsana''), with the legs folded over each other
:In the "adamantine posture" (''vajrāsana''; also known as "[[lotus position]]"), with the legs crossed so that the soles of both feet are turned up
:In the position of a person sitting in a chair (''pralambanāsana'')
*Standing: If standing, the Buddha may be shown either with his feet together, or with one foot forward
*Walking
*[[Reclining Buddha|Reclining]]: The reclining posture may represent the Buddha resting or sleeping, but more usually represents the ''mahāparinabbāna'': the Buddha's final state of enlightenment before his death

[[Image:Buddha Park.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Modern gigantic rendition of the ''reclining Buddha'' in [[Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat|Bunleua Sulilat]]'s [[Buddha Park]].]]
The Buddha is nearly always depicted wearing a monastic robe, of the type worn by Buddhist monks today. The robe may be shown as worn in the "covering mode" (draped over both shoulders) or in the "open mode" (leaving the right shoulder and breast uncovered). The robe is a representation of the Buddha's humility. (Gautama was originally a prince, who renounced the world to seek enlightenment, and his original robe was made from the shroud of a corpse.) The robe is sometimes shown as diaphanous, transparent or billowing mysteriously, suggesting the spiritual power emanating from the Buddha. Buddha images are often draped with real robes, which are renewed periodically, usually at major festivals. The Buddha may also be shown wearing royal attire, but this is uncommon.

==Hand gestures==
[[Image:Buddhaimage4.JPG|thumb|250px|Statue of "the Buddha meditating." The Buddha's hands are in the ''dhyāna mudrā'' position ([[Wat Xieng Thong]], Luang Phrabāng, Laos)]]

The most important aspect of the iconography of the Buddha is gestures made with the hands, known as ''[[Mudra|mudrā]]''. These gestures have meanings which are known throughout the Buddhist world, and when combined with the postures described above, give a complete representation, usually associated with a particular incident in the life of the Buddha.

The six ''mudrā'' associated with the Buddha are:
*[[Phra Mae Thorani|Touching the earth]] (''Bhūmiśparṣa mudrā'') [[:th:ปางมารวิชัย]] ''pang maa-rá-wí-chai'': the right arm rests on the right thigh with the fingers pointing downwards, but not always touching the earth (as can be seen in the image at the top of this page). The left hand rests in the ''dhyāna mudrā'' position in the Buddha's lap. This ''mudrā'' is called in [[Pali|Pāḷi]] and [[Sanskrit]] "calling the earth to witness (to his fulfilment of the perfections, [[parami|pāramī]]). In Thai it is known as "Buddha subduing [[Mara (demon)|Māra]]" (the demon who tried to prevent him attaining enlightenment by various means). This is by far the most commonly depicted ''mudrā''.
*Meditation (''Dhyāna mudrā'') [[:th:ปางสมาธิ]] ''pang sà-măa-tí'': the hands are shown lying flat in the Buddha's lap, palms upward. This ''mudrā'' is associated with a seated Buddha. It shows that the Buddha is disciplining his mind through mental concentration, a necessary step to achieving enlightenment.
*Charity (''Varana mudrā'') [[:th:ปางประทานพร]] ''pang bprà-taan pon'': the right arm is shown pendent (extended downwards), with the open palm turned to the front and the fingers extended. This ''mudrā'' is usually associated with a standing Buddha. This position can signify either that the Buddha is granting blessings or receiving charitable offerings.
*Fearlessness (''Abhāya mudrā'') [[:th:ปางประทานอภัย]] ''pang bprà-taan à-pai'': either one or both arms are shown bent at the elbow and the wrist, with the palm facing outwards and the fingers pointing upwards. It shows the Buddha either displaying fearlessness in the face of adversity, or enjoining others to do so. Right hand raised is also called "calming animals" [[:th:ปางโปรดสัตว์]] ''pang pròht sàt''; both hands raised is also called "forbidding the relatives" [[:th:ปางห้ามญาติ]] ''pang ham yat''. These '''mudrā'' are usually associated with a standing Buddha, but seated representations are not uncommon.

[[Image:Buddhaimage6.JPG|thumb|250px|Statue of "the Buddha preaching on reason," with the Buddha's hands in the double ''abhāya mudrā'' position (Luang Phrabāng, Laos)]]
*Reasoning and exposition (''Vitarka mudrā''): the arm and hand are positioned in the same manner as in the ''abhāya mudrā'', except that the thumb and forefinger are brought together. The gesture can be made with either the right or left hand (usually the right), but not both. This mudra signifies an appeal to reason, or the giving of instruction. Since the Buddha is appealing to reason, the gesture is often interpreted as an appeal for peace.
*Setting the wheel in motion (''Dharmachakrā mudrā''): the hands are held in front of the chest, with both hands in the ''vitarka mudrā'' position, with the fingers of the left hand resting in the palm of the right hand. This is a less common ''mudrā'' since it refers to a particular episode in the Buddha's life: his first sermon, when he "set the wheel (of his life's work) in motion." It can be used for both seated and standing images.

Over the centuries combinations and variations of these six ''mudrā'' have evolved. For example, the "double ''abhāya mudrā''", with both hands held up in the ''abhāya mudrā'' position, became common in Thailand and Laos in the 16th century, and is now one of the most common representations of the Buddha in south-east Asian countries. It is sometimes interpreted as "Buddha teaching on reason." As artists wished to depict more of the specific incidents in the life of the Buddha, new, secondary ''mudrās'' evolved, such as "Buddha holding an alms bowl", "Buddha receiving a mango" and Buddha performing various miracles. Many of these originated in [[Burma]] and then spread to other parts of the Buddhist world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21287">'''Interindividual differences in perception''' describes the effect that differences in brain structure or factors such as culture, upbringing and environment have on the [[perception]] of humans.
Interindividual (differing from person to person) variability is usually regarded as a source of noise for research. However, in recent years, it has become an interesting source to study sensory mechanisms and understand [[human behavior]]. With the help of modern [[neuroimaging]] methods such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], individual differences in perception could be related to the underlying brain mechanisms. This has helped to explain differences in  behavior and [[cognition]] across the population. Common methods include studying the perception of [[illusion]]s, as they can effectively demonstrate how different aspects such as [[culture]], [[Human genetics|genetics]] and the [[Human ecology|environment]] can influence human behavior.

A motion quartet is a [[Bistability|bistable]] stimulus - it consists of two dots that change their position from frame to frame. This position change can either be interpreted as horizontal or vertical movement by viewers, and this experience can switch during viewing between interpretations. Depending on the [[aspect ratio]] of the two dots' positions, one or the other state is perceived longer or more often. At an aspect ratio of one, the illusion is biased towards the vertical perception. The reason for this might be the way the human brain processes the signals from both eyes in the [[visual system]]. The right half of an eye's field of view is processed by the left hemisphere, and the left half by the right hemisphere. A stimulus moving vertically only involves one field of view and so one hemisphere, while a stimulus moving vertically from one field of view to the other involves both hemispheres, and requires communication between them. The delay caused by this additional signalling might be the cause for the bias.&lt;ref name="metastable anisotropy"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Metastable motion anisotropy. | author=Chaudhuri, Avi | journal=Visual Neuroscience | year=1991 | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=397–407 | pmid=1764411 | doi=10.1017/s0952523800009706}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also individual differences in the way the motion quartet is perceived: Some people require a different aspect ratio to perceive both axes of movement than others.
A study using diffusion tensor imaging further showed differences in the structure of the corpus callosum, the primary connection between the two hemispheres, might be the origin of these differences.&lt;ref name="Genç bistable"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211008773 | title=Interhemispheric Connections Shape Subjective Experience of Bistable Motion | author= Genç, Erhan | journal=Current Biology | year=2011 |  volume=21 | issue=17 | pages=1494–1499 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.003| pmid=21885284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object size estimation===
There exist a variety of illusions that make objects appear bigger or smaller compared to their real size. Two such illusions are the [[Ebbinghaus illusion|Ebbinghaus]] and the [[Ponzo illusion|Ponzo]] illusions. The Ebbinghaus illusion makes a dot seem bigger because it is surrounded by smaller dots, while the Ponzo illusion exploits human [[Perspective (visual)#Linear perspective|perspective]] processing by making a dot appear bigger because it seems farther away. Schwarzkopf et al.&lt;ref name="surface_V1" /&gt; found that the size of the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex .28V1.29|primary visual cortex (V1)]] has an effect on the magnitude of these illusions. The larger the subject's V1 surface area was, the less the subjects fell for the illusion. This is hypothesized to be due to the fact that a larger V1 dedicated to the same portion of the visual field means a lesser effect of later, fixed-size visual areas (which are the ones that are responsible for the illusion effect).&lt;ref name="surface_V1"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n1/full/nn.2706.html | title=The surface area of human V1 predicts the subjective experience of object size | author=Schwarzkopf, D Samuel | journal=Nature Neuroscience | volume=14 | year=2011 | issue=1 | pages=28–30 | doi=10.1038/nn.2706 | pmid=21131954 | pmc=3012031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditory Illusions==

===McGurk Effect===
The [[McGurk effect]] is an auditory illusion in which people perceive a different syllable when incongruent audiovisual speech is presented: an auditory syllable "ba" is presented while the mouth movement is "ga". As a result, the listener perceives the syllable "da". However, according to Gentilucci and Cattaneo (2005), not everyone perceives this illusion; only about 26% to 98% of the population are susceptible to this illusion.&lt;ref name="McGurk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gentilucci | first1 = M. | last2 = Cattaneo | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Automatic audiovisual integration in speech perception" ''Experimental Brain Research'' 167(1), 66-75. McGurk, H., &amp; MacDonald, J. (1976). Hearing lips and seeing voices | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 264 | issue = | pages = 746–748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the psychological models that explains the interindividual differences in speech perception is the [[fuzzy logic]] model of speech perception&lt;ref name="fuzzy speech"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oden | first1 = G. C. | last2 = Massaro | first2 = D. W. | year = 1978 | title = Integration of featural information in speech perception | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 172–191 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.85.3.172 | pmid=663005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, a categorization process is carried out when processing speech sounds. When listening to a stimulus, the features of the acoustic signal are analyzed. Subsequently, this signal is compared with the features that are stored in the memory; finally the sound is classified into the category that best fits. However, this classification may have a blurred boundary respectively to the category which the sound belongs to. As a result, the final decision may depend on integration of multiple sources of information. When the McGurk effect is presented the auditory and visual components of the speech are separately evaluated before being integrated. In those who perceive the McGurk effect, the visual information has a higher influence on the perception of the ambiguous audiovisual information and thus the sound is classified as "da".

Many studies have concluded that the area responsible for the perception of this phenomenon is the left [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulcus(STS)]].&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nath | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Beauchamp | first2 = M. S. | year = 2012 | title = A neural basis for interindividual differences in the McGurk effect, a multisensory speech illusion | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 781–787 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.024 | pmid=21787869 | pmc=3196040}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is critical for the [[multisensory integration]] of visual and auditory information during speech perception. Moreover,  there is a correlation between the activation of the STS and the perception of the McGurk effect. In that sense, if the left STS  correctly integrates the mismatched audiovisual information, a McGurk effect is perceived; if the left STS is not active, the visual and auditory information are not integrated and thus a McGurk effect is not perceived.

In one study&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath" /&gt; [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (BOLD fMRI) was used to measure the brain activity in perceivers and non-perceivers of the McGurk effect while presented with congruent audiovisual syllables, McGurk audiovisual syllables (auditory "ba" + visual "ga" producing perception of "da"),  and non-McGurk incongruent syllables( auditory "ga" + visual "ba" producing auditory perception of "ga"). The researchers found that there was a positive correlation between the amplitude of response in the left STS and the probability of perceiving the McGurk effect. In other words, the subject with the weakest STS activation to incongruent speech had the smallest probability of experiencing a McGurk percept; whereas the subject with the strongest STS response had the highest probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK3T7LWIkP8|title=McGurk effect: Auditory "ba" + Visual "ga"|first=|last=anathfMRI|date=18 February 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauchamp et al. (2010) highlight the critical role of the left STS in audiovisual integration.&lt;ref name="TMS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Nath | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Pasalar | first3 = S. | year = 2010 | title = fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals that the superior temporal sulcus is a cortical locus of the McGurk effect | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 7| pages = 2414–2417 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4865-09.2010 | pmid=20164324 | pmc=2844713}}&lt;/ref&gt; They applied single pulses of [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) to the STS of McGurk perceivers during presentation of McGurk stimuli. The perception of the McGurk effect decreased from 94% to 43% and the subjects reported perceiving only the auditory syllable. Following from that, Beauchamp et al. conclude that the left STS is crucial for the audiovisual integration and thus for the perception of the McGurk effect.

Moreover, another study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurler | first1 = D. | last2 = Doyle | first2 = N. | last3 = Walker | first3 = E. | last4 = Magnotti | first4 = J. | last5 = Beauchamp | first5 = M. | year = 2015 | title = A link between individual differences in multisensory speech perception and eye movements | url = | journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 77 | issue = 4| pages = 1333–1341 | doi=10.3758/s13414-014-0821-1| pmc = 4437244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the basis of the interindividual differences in the perception of McGurk effect lies in the eye movements of the subject when viewing the talker’s face. The experimenters carried out an [[eye tracking]] study and measured the eye movements of the participants while viewing audiovisual speech. They found that people who spent more time fixating the mouth of the talker were the more likely to perceive the McGurk effect than those who rarely fixated on the mouth of the speaker.

===Other auditory illusions===
[[File:Pitch class space.svg|thumb|right|Representation of the [[pitch class]] circle with respect to tone height]]
Interindividual differences have also been researched for the '''[[Tritone paradox]] illusion'''. In this illusion, the subject successively listens to two tones, which are separated by a half [[octave]]. Each tone is made of a set of [[harmonics]] which have an octave relation. The listener has to decide if the two tones have a descending or ascending relation. According to [[Diana Deutsch]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"&gt;Deutsch, D. (1991). The tritone paradox: An influence of language on music perception. Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 8(4), 335-347.&lt;/ref&gt; the perception of the tones is influenced by the language spoken by the listener. The listener has a circular representation of the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of sounds that are common in their culture and based on that develops a pitch range of their speaking voice, which determines the orientation of the [[pitch class]] with respect to the height; when a given tone is in this range, it is taken as the highest position along the circle and depending on the second tone, the person perceives the pattern as ascending or descending. Deutsch&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"/&gt; found that for people from [[California]], the tone in the highest position of the pitch-class circle is around C# and D whereas for people from southern [[England]] it is around G. According to those results, Deutsch hypothesized that the orientation of the pitch-class circle with respect to the height is similar for individuals from the same linguistic group and varies for individuals from different linguistic groups.

Other illusions found by Deutsch whose interpretation depends on interindividual differences is the '''phantom words illusion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=211|title=Diana Deutsch - Phantom Words|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illusion consists of the continuous presentation of two meaningless syllables. In order to experience the illusion, it is necessary that the listener sits between two loudspeakers, one to the left and the other to the right. The syllables are presented offset in time, in such a way that while one syllable is coming from the left, the other syllable is coming from the right loudspeaker. It was shown that after a period of time, people start hearing words. According to Deutsch, the perceived words depend on the language spoken by the listener, their knowledge and their expectations. According to Shinn-Cunningham (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shinn-Cunningham | first1 = B.G. | year = 2008 | title = Object-based auditory and visual attention | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 182–186 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.02.003| pmc = 2699558}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the information is incomplete or contradictory, the perceptual system often fills this gaps with plausible interpretations and in that way allows new information to be efficiently processed.

==Effect of Culture on Perception==
[[File:Frame_and_Line_Test.svg|thumb|height=width|right|The framed line test]]
Several studies have shown that differences between individuals play a significant role in determining how a stimulus is perceived. These differences among people, in turn, are greatly influenced by one's own socio-cultural contexts. The research indicates that cultural factors influence the process of perception not just on lower-level (such as [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|object perception]] and [[attention]] deployment), but also on the higher-order functions (such as [[theory of mind]] and [[emotion recognition]]).&lt;ref name= "Culture_and_self"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=Hazel R.|last2=Kitayama|first2=Shinobu|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1991|volume=98|issue=2|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name= "holistic vs nalytical"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masuda|first1=Takahiko|last2=Nisbett|first2=Richard E|title=Attending holistically versus analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=Nov 2001|volume= 81|issue=5|pages=922–934|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922|pmid=11708567}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name= "New Look"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitayama|first1=S.|last2=Duffy|first2=S.|last3=Kawamura|first3=T.|last4=Larsen|first4=J. T.|title=Perceiving an Object and Its Context in Different Cultures: A Cultural Look at New Look|journal=Psychological Science|date=1 May 2003|volume=14|issue=3|pages=201–206|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02432|pmid=12741741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major cultures analyzed in these studies were mostly [[Western World|Western]] and [[East Asia]]n cultures because of the considerable differences in the social structure and practices. Western culture was referred to as an ''analytical'' culture whereas Eastern culture was referred more as a ''holistic'' culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=JB|last2=Rule|first2=NO|last3=Ambady|first3=N|title=The cultural neuroscience of person perception|journal=Progress in Brain Research|date=2009|volume=178|pages=191–201|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17813-5|pmid=19874970|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444533616}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, [[individualism]] and [[freedom]] are the predominant values in Western societies, which in turn demand interpretation of an object in its absolute terms independent of its context. In contrast, Eastern culture is known for its emphasis on [[collectivism]] and [[interdependence]] on each other, where interpretation of an object is often in relation with its context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbett|first1=RE|last2=Peng|first2=K|last3=Choi|first3=I|last4=Norenzayan|first4=A|title=Culture and systems of thought: holistic versus analytic cognition.|journal=Psychological Review|date=April 2001|volume=108|issue=2|pages=291–310|pmid=11381831|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.2.291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pioneer study examining these cultural differences in visual perception was conducted by Kitmaya et al. (2003).&lt;ref name="New Look"/&gt; The findings of that study provide behavioural evidence on how cultural factors affect visual perception and attention deployment. For the study, [[United States|Americans]] and [[Japan]]ese were taken as subjects. The visual stimulus shown to the subjects consisted of a square figure with a line hanging from the centre (the framed line test). First was the absolute condition, where the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in its absolute length, to a new square box independent of its size. Second was the relative condition, in which the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in proportionally similar to context of the new square box. The results show that Americans perform better in the absolute task which requires analytical processing of stimulus independent of it context, whereas the Japanese performed better at the relative task which demands the holistic processing of the stimulus in relation to its context.

In line with these findings, Hedden and colleagues (2009)&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedden|first1=T.|last2=Mormino|first2=E. C.|last3=Amariglio|first3=R. E.|last4=Younger|first4=A. P.|last5=Schultz|first5=A. P.|last6=Becker|first6=J. A.|last7=Buckner|first7=R. L.|last8=Johnson|first8=K. A.|last9=Sperling|first9=R. A.|last10=Rentz|first10=D. M.|title=Cognitive Profile of Amyloid Burden and White Matter Hyperintensities in Cognitively Normal Older Adults|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=14 November 2012|volume=32|issue=46|pages=16233–16242|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2462-12.2012|pmid=23152607|pmc=3523110}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the same visual stimuli to investigate the neural activity with the help of fMRI. Participants of the study were asked to judge the length of a vertical line, either including the contextual information or ignoring it. The results revealed that separate brain regions were employed while performing  the task, either incorporating the contextual information or avoiding it, based on one's own culture. The areas associated with [[attentional control]] in the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal]] region of the brain were highly activated when the subjects performed the task which was incongruent to their cultural pattern. That is, the activity in the fronto-parietal region enhanced when East Asians had to ignore the contextual information, while similar enhancement happened for Americans when they had to incorporate the contextual information. These findings illustrate that the function of the neural mechanisms are also modulated to some extent by one's own culture.&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"/&gt;

A follow-up fMRI study by Gutchess, Welsh, Boduroglu, and Park (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutchess|first1=AH|last2=Welsh|first2=RC|last3=Boduroglu|first3=A|last4=Park|first4=DC|title=Cultural differences in neural function associated with object processing.|journal=Cognitive, affective &amp; behavioral neuroscience|date=June 2006|volume=6|issue=2|pages=102–9|pmid=17007231|doi=10.3758/cabn.6.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed the previous findings by using a rather complex stimulus, which consists of ''only the object'' pictures, ''object with background'' pictures and ''only the background'' pictures without the object. This particular study was done on East-Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans. Though the performance of both subject groups was equally good, the activity of the involved brain areas was significantly different. Non-Asian Americans had a higher activation in the object processing areas in the ventral visual cortex during the object recognition task whereas the East-Asian Americans exhibited higher activity in the left [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] and [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] areas which are associated with perceptual analysis.

The '''International Centre for Mathematical Sciences''' ('''ICMS''') is a mathematical research centre based in [[Edinburgh]]. According to its website, the Centre is "designed to bring together mathematicians and practitioners in science, industry and commerce for research workshops and other meetings." 

The Centre was jointly established in 1990 by the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[Heriot-Watt University]], under the supervision of Professor [[Elmer Rees]], with initial support from [[Edinburgh District Council]], the [[Scottish Development Agency]] and the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]]. In April 1994 the Centre moved to 14 India Street, Edinburgh, the birthplace of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and home of the [[James Clerk Maxwell Foundation]]. In 2010 it relocated to 15 South College Street to accommodate larger events. The current scientific director (appointed in 2016) is Professor Paul Glendinning.

[[File:LC ISR international relations.jpg|thumb|LC ISR international relations]]
The '''Lviv Centre of the Space Research Institute of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|NASU]] and [[National Space Agency of Ukraine|NSAU]]''' ({{lang-uk|Львівський центр Інституту космічних досліджень НАН України та НКА України}}) is a [[Lviv]] branch of the actual institute.

== Structure ==
At the present about 100 specialists work in the Centre. Among them 1 member of [[International Academy of Astronautics]], 1 Doctors of Sciences, and 9 Candidates of Sciences (PhD).

LC ISR consists of 3 scientific departments and 1 laboratory, and performs fundamental and applied researches in the following interdisciplinary scientific directions:
* propagation theory and experimental study of [[electromagnetic fields]] in conducting media (space plasma, ground, sea water);
* development of advanced sensors and systems for measuring the parameters of physical fields and data collection and processing for space industry and geophysical applications.

Development and production of flux-gate [[magnetometer]]s (FGM) and induction magnetometers (IM) with highest parameters values possible are of the main LC ISR activity areas.

Reduction of weight, energy loss and noise level can be placed among main directions of FGM and IM designing, which aims to reach world standards level. The Center with its engineering divisions has made significant contribution into solution of large-scale fundamental and applied scientific problems, including:
* development of theoretical substantiation of [[lithosphere]]-[[ionosphere]] coupling through the [[acoustics|acoustic]] and atmospheric [[gravity waves]] with the aim to clarify mechanism of ionospheric earthquakes precursors formation;
* development of the mechanism of [[earthquake]]s electromagnetic precursors recognition in focal area and designing specialized instruments for these precursors detection;
* studying of electronic circuits interaction process with the aim to provide as low as possible sensitivity threshold of measuring devices for space, ground and sea bed applications;
* development and adoption of new methodology to provide autonomous objects electromagnetic cleanliness, and to realize their [[calibration]] without operation process interruption;
* adoption of space instrumentation development technology for manufacturing advanced geophysical systems, used for scientific research and raw materials prospecting (oil, gas etc.).

== Significant scientific achievements and development ==
More than 10 spatial experiments were carried out with the participation of LC ISR specialists. LC ISR proposed scientific conception of the first national scientific experiment “Variant” (укр. Варіант) on the board of [[artificial satellite]] “Sich-1M” with international scientific payload.&lt;ref&gt;http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/sich-1m.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in the world practice direct density of space current in plasma measurements were performed.

A generalized approach to the recognition of the precursory signals of earthquakes preparation process when structural changes and anomalies occur in the Earth crust was proposed.

A new physical effect – gamma – magnetic normalization of alloys with high magnetic permeability was discovered and experimentally confirmed.

A general concept and theoretical basis of the construction of a high-sensitive geophysical system for active electromagnetic logging in wells to study anisotropy of rocks and to detect the near-surface inhomogeneities were created with the aim to develop the new methods of minerals exploration.

The scientific concept and realization plan of the ground-spatial experiments “Ionosphere” and “Potential” were developed. Technical documents substantiating the above experiments were prepared. They were included in the [[State Space Agency of Ukraine#Space program|National Space Program of Ukraine]] for 2013–2015 years.

== Membership of Professional Societies ==
The LC ISR scientists are cooperating actively with the world community, represent Ukraine in
* [[International Academy of Astronautics]] (IAA);
* [[COSPAR|Committee on Space Research]] (COSPAR);
* [[IAGA|International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy]] (IAGA);

== Current projects ==
There are now 8 international space projects in which LC ISR is participating: OBSTANOVKA and CHIBIS-M &lt;ref&gt;https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/chibis-m&lt;/ref&gt; scheduled for International Space Station and RADIOASTRON (launch in 2010), [[Fobos-Grunt|PHOBOS-GRUNT]] (launch in 2011), RESONANCE (launch in 2012) – all of them with Russian scientists. Also LC ISR is collaborating with scientists: from India in the preparation of SENSE microsatellite scientific program and payload, Italy (ESPERIA project) and China (CSES microsatellite).

=== POPDAT ===
Problem-Oriented Processing and Database Creation for Ionosphere Exploration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popdat.org/downloads/press/press-release/LCISR_Press-Release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (started on June 1, 2011) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.isr.lviv.ua/popdat.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variant===
The major goal of the VARIANT project onboard SICH-1M satellite is to carry out the study of field-aligned currens as a part of Space Weather program. It includes direct measurements of current density in the ionosphere combined with the measurements of the magnetic and electric field fluctuations that can serve as new elements in the data set of signatures of the solar wind-[[magnetosphere]]-[[ionosphere]] coupling. The secondary goal of VARIANT experiment is the statistical study of minor seismogenic effects in the [[ionosphere]] and their comparison with the background noise statistical data set ([http://www.popdat.org/images/download-lists/presentations/09.%20Lviv%20Centre%20of%20Institute%20of%20Space%20Research%20-%20UA.pdf Presentation]).

===International Space Station environment study===
LC ISR is Co-PI of the international experiment OBSTANOVKA-1 on board the Russian segment of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). The main goal of the experiment is to develop the methodology and instrumentation for EM phenomena investigation in the ISS environment. To fulfil this goal the automatic mini-buoys and necessary operation procedures are under development.

===Electromagnetic investigations at Ukrainian Antarctic Station “Akademik vernadsky”===
Three-component flux-gate magnetometer LEMI-008 was installed in the [[Vernadsky Research Base]] "Akademik Vernadsky" is a Ukrainian Antarctic Station at Marina Point on [[Galindez Island]] in the Argentine Islands, [[Antarctica]]. In January 2001, the equipment for satellite transmission of magnetometer, which provides the communication via geostationary satellite GOES-E, was installed. On March 11, 2001, the permanent transmission of the LEMI-008 [[magnetometer]] data has started. The data are being cumulated on FTP-server after processing in the Canadian information center. Early in 2002 new high-sensitivity system for magnetic field 0.3–300&amp;nbsp;Hz variations based on LEMI-112A sensors has been installed. It expands the range of on-site EMF studies and sets [[Vernadsky Research Base|Ukrainian Antarctic Station]] as one of the world's best equipped. LC ISR is responsible for the operation of electromagnetic polygon there.

[[File:Robert_Fitzroy.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy founder of the Met Office]] The Met Office was established in 1854 as a small department within the [[Board of Trade]] under Vice-Admiral [[Robert FitzRoy]] as a service to [[sailor|mariners]]. The loss of the passenger vessel, the [[Royal Charter (ship)|''Royal Charter'']], and 459 lives off the coast of [[Anglesey]] in a violent storm in October 1859 led to the first gale warning service. FitzRoy established a network of 15 coastal stations from which visual gale warnings could be provided for ships at sea.

The new [[electric telegraph]] enabled rapid dissemination of warnings and also led to the development of an observational network which could then be used to provide synoptic analysis. The Met Office started in 1861 to provide weather forecasts to newspapers.  FitzRoy requested the daily traces of the photo-[[barograph]] at [[Kew Observatory]] (invented by [[Francis Ronalds]]) to assist in this task and similar barographs and as well as instruments to continuously record other meteorological parameters were later provided to stations across the observing network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=June 2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Early Years of the Kew Observatory|url=|journal=Weather|doi=10.1002/wea.2739|pmid=|access-date=|volume=71|pages=131–134|bibcode=2016Wthr...71..131R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publication of forecasts ceased in May 1866 after FitzRoy’s death but recommenced in April 1879.

=== Connection with the Ministry of Defence ===
[[File:The Meteorological Office, Bracknell - geograph.org.uk - 489065.jpg|thumbnail|right|Former Met Office building in Bracknell, Berkshire before relocation to Exeter, since demolished]]
Following the [[First World War]], the Met Office became part of the [[Air Ministry]] in 1919, the weather observed from the top of [[Adastral House]] (where the Air Ministry was based) giving rise to the phrase "The weather on the Air Ministry roof". As a result of the need for weather information for aviation, the Met Office located many of its observation and data collection points on [[List of Royal Air Force stations|RAF airfields]], and this accounts for the large number of military airfields mentioned in weather reports even today. In 1936 the Met Office split with services to the [[Royal Navy]] being provided by its own forecasting services.

It became an [[executive agency]] of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in April 1990, a quasi-governmental role, being required to act commercially.

===Change in ownership===

Following a [[machinery of government]] change, the Met Office became part of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] on 18 July 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clickgreen.org.uk/news/national-news/122350-uk-met-office-switches-departments-in-whitehall-shake-up.html|title=UK Met Office switches departments in Whitehall shake-up|publisher=Clickgreen.org.uk|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently part of the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] following the merger of BIS and the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] on 14 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Machinery of Government Changes:Written statement - HCWS94|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-07-18/HCWS94|website=Hansard|publisher=Hansard|date=18 July 2016|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no longer part of the MOD, the Met Office maintains strong links with the military through its front line offices at RAF and Army bases both in the UK and overseas and its involvement in the Joint Operations Meteorology and Oceanography Centre (JOMOC) with the Royal Navy.  The [[Mobile Meteorological Unit|Mobile Met Unit]] (MMU) are a unit consisting of Met Office staff who are also [[RAF Reserve|RAF reservists]] who accompany forward units in times of conflict advising the armed forces of the conditions for battle, particularly the RAF.

== Locations ==
[[File:Ukmo-exeter-panorama.JPG|thumb|The 2003 headquarters building on the edge of Exeter]]

In September 2003 the Met Office moved its headquarters from [[Bracknell]] in Berkshire to a purpose-built £80m structure at [[Exeter]] Business Park, near junction 29 of the [[M5 motorway]]. The new building was officially opened on 21 June 2004 – a few weeks short of the Met Office's 150th anniversary – by [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford]]. 

It has a worldwide presence{{spaced ndash}}including a forecasting centre in [[Aberdeen]], and offices in [[Gibraltar]] and on the [[Falklands]].  Other outposts lodge in establishments such as the [http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/Research/jcmm/jcmm.html Joint Centre for Mesoscale Meteorology] (JCMM) at [[University of Reading]] in Berkshire, the [http://www.jchmr.org/ Joint Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Research] (JCHMR) site at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] in Oxfordshire, and there is a Met Office presence at Army and Air Force bases within the UK and abroad (including frontline units in conflict zones).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/defence/mmu.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070705161546/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/defence/mmu.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 July 2007 |title=Met Office defence: Supporting operations |publisher=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Navy]] weather forecasts are generally provided by naval officers, not Met Office personnel.

== Forecasts ==

=== Shipping forecast ===
{{main article|Shipping Forecast}}
The [[Shipping Forecast]] is produced by the Met Office and broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]], for those traversing the seas around the [[British Isles]].

=== Weather forecasting and warnings ===
The Met Office issues Severe Weather Warnings for the United Kingdom through the [[National Severe Weather Warning Service]] (NSWWS). These warn of weather events that may affect transport infrastructure and endanger people's lives.  In March 2008, the system was improved and a new stage of warning was introduced, the 'Advisory'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/uk/guide/colour_warnings.html |title=Met Office warning colours |publisher=Metoffice.gov.uk |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015 the Met Office established a "name our storms" project, the aim is to provide a single authoritative naming system for the storms that affect the UK and Ireland by asking the public to suggest names. On 10 November, the first named storm was [[Storm Abigail|Abigail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2015/storm-Abigail |title=10 November 2015 - The Met Office has named Abigail as the first storm as part of the Name Our Storms project. |publisher=Met Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weather prediction models ===
The main role of the Met Office is to produce forecast models by gathering information from [[weather satellite]]s in space and observations on earth, then processing it with a variety of models, based on a software package known as the [[unified model]]. The principal weather products for UK customers are 36-hour forecasts from the operational 1.5&amp;nbsp;km resolution [[Unified Model#UKV model|UKV model]] covering the UK and surroundings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/91Annual/webprogram/Paper177409.html |title=Experiences with a 1.5&amp;nbsp;km version of the Met Office Unified Model for short range forecasting |publisher=ametsoc.org |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (replacing the 4&amp;nbsp;km model), 48-hour forecasts from the 12&amp;nbsp;km resolution NAE model covering Europe and the North Atlantic, and 144-hour forecasts from the 25&amp;nbsp;km resolution global model (replacing the 40&amp;nbsp;km global model).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified-model/weather-forecasting |title=Met Office Atmospheric numerical model configurations |publisher=Metoffice.gov.uk |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Met Office's Global Model forecast has consistently been in the top 3 for global weather forecast performance (in the decades up to 2010) in independent verification to WMO standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmwf.int/publications/library/do/references/show?id=89984 |title=Verification statistics and evaluations of ECMWF forecasts in 2009–2010 – Figures 11–15 |date=October 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2011 |publisher=European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts ecmwf.int }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2013}} Products for other regions of the globe are sold to customers abroad, provided for [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]] operations abroad or provided free to developing countries in Africa. If necessary, forecasters may make adjustments to the computer forecasts. Data is stored in the Met Office's own [[PP-format]].

===Flood Forecasting Centre===
{{main article|Flood Forecasting Centre}}
Formed in 2009, the [[Flood Forecasting Centre]] (FFC) is a joint venture between the [[Environment Agency]] and the Met Office to provide flood risk guidance for England and Wales. The Centre is jointly staffed from both parent organisations and is based in the Operations Centre at the Met Office headquarters in Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exeterscience.org/news/33/129/Flood-Forecasting-Centre-moves-to-Exeter.html|title=Flood Forecasting Centre moves to Exeter|publisher=Exeter Science|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland this role is performed by the Scottish Flood Forecasting Service, a joint venture between the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] (SEPA) and the Met Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sepa.org.uk/flooding/flood_forecasting_service.aspx|title=Scottish Flood Forecasting Service|publisher=Sepa.org.uk|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seasonal forecasts ===
The Met Office makes seasonal and long range forecasts and distributes them to customers and users globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long-range global and regional forecasts|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/seasonal-to-decadal/long-range/forecasts|website=Met Office|accessdate=21 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Met Office was the first climate and weather forecast provider to be recognised as a Global Producing Centre of long range forecasts by the [[World Meteorological Organisation]] and continues to provide forecasts to the WMO for dissemination to other national meteorological services worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate research at the Met Office Hadley Centre|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/mohippo/pdf/b/1/informing.pdf|publisher=Met Office|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Met Office research has broken new ground in seasonal forecasting for the [[extratropics]] and has demonstrated its abilities in its seasonal predictions of the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] and winter climate for Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL059637/abstract | title=Seasonal Predictions of the North Atlantic Oscillation | doi=10.1002/2014GL059637 | volume=41 | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | pages=2514–2519| bibcode=2014GeoRL..41.2514S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knapton|first1=Sarah|title=The Met Office can now predict winter weather one year in advance|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/10/17/met-office-can-now-predict-winter-weather-one-year-in-advance/|work=The Telegraph|date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supply of forecasts for broadcasting companies ===
Two of the main media companies, the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] produce forecasts using the Met Office's data. At the BBC Weather Centre, they are continuously updated on the information by computer, [[fax]] and email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/bbcweather/features/producingweatherbroadcasts.shtml |title= Producing Weather Broadcasts |publisher=BBC Weather |date= |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/anniversary/broadcast.html |title=How the weather is forecast |publisher=The Met Office |date=11 January 1954 |accessdate=15 May 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070108153842/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/anniversary/broadcast.html |archivedate = 8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC Weather|BBC's new graphics]] are used on all of their television weather broadcasts. [[ITV Weather]] use animated weather symbols. The forecasters at the BBC Weather Centre are employed by the Met Office, not the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Met Office loses BBC weather forecasting contract|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34031785|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August 2015, it was announced that the BBC would be replacing the Met Office with [[MeteoGroup]], a competing provider,  as part of the corporation's legal obligation to provide best value for money for the [[Television licence|licence fee]] payers.

=== World Area Forecast Centre ===
{{main article|World Area Forecast Centre}}
The Met Office is one of only two World Area Forecast Centres or WAFCs, and is referred to as WAFC London. The other WAFC is located in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and known as WAFC Washington. WAFC data is used daily to safely and economically route aircraft, particularly on long-haul journeys. The data provides details of wind speed and direction, air temperature, cloud type and tops, and other features.

=== Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre ===
{{main article|Volcanic Ash Advisory Center}}
As part of its aviation forecast operation the Met Office operates the London [[Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre]] (VAAC).&lt;ref name=LVAAC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/aviation/vaac/index.html |title=London VAAC |publisher=Metoffice.gov.uk |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2010 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070108144933/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/aviation/vaac/index.html |archivedate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides forecasts to the aviation industry of [[volcanic ash]] clouds that could enter aircraft flight paths and impact aviation safety. The London VAAC, one of nine worldwide, is responsible for the area covering the [[British Isles]], the north east Atlantic and [[Iceland]]. The VAAC were set up by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO), an agency of the United Nations, as part of the International Airways Volcano Watch (IAVW).&lt;ref name=IAVW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/anb/iavwopsg/ |title=International Airways Volcano Watch |publisher=Icao.int |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London VAAC makes use of satellite images, plus seismic, radar and visual observation data from [[Volcanism of Iceland|Iceland]],&lt;ref name=Witham&gt;[http://sacs.aeronomie.be/workshop/talks1/Witham_VAAC_Oct2006.ppt Overview of VAAC Activities presentation]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the location of all of the active volcanoes in its area of responsibility.  The [[NAME (dispersion model)|NAME dispersion model]] developed by the Met Office is used to forecast the movement of the ash clouds 6, 12 and 18 hours from the time of the alert at different flight levels.

=== Air quality ===
{{Main article|UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau}}
The Met Office issues [[Air Quality Index#United Kingdom|air quality]] forecasts made using [[NAME (dispersion model)|NAME]], the Met Office's medium-to-long-range [[atmospheric dispersion modelling|atmospheric dispersion model]]. It was developed as a nuclear accident model following the [[Chernobyl accident]] in 1986, but has since evolved into an all-purpose dispersion model capable of predicting the transport, transformation and deposition of a wide class of airborne materials. NAME is used operationally by the Met Office as an emergency response model as well as for routine air quality forecasting. Aerosol dispersion is calculated using the [[UKCA]] model.

The forecast is produced for pollutants and their typical health effects are shown in the following table.

===IPCC===
{{main article|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}
Until 2001 the Met Office hosted the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] working group, chaired by [[John T. Houghton|John Houghton]], on climate science.  In 2001 the working group moved to the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;[[Fred Pearce|Pearce, Fred]], ''The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming'', (2010) [[Guardian Books]], {{ISBN|978-0-85265-229-9}}, p. XVI.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High performance computing ===
Due to the large amount of computation needed for [[Numerical Weather Prediction]] and the [[Unified model]], the Met Office has had some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. In November 1997 the Met Office supercomputer was ranked third in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.top500.org/site/49064|title=United Kingdom Meteorological Office {{!}} TOP500 Supercomputing Sites|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Top500.org|access-date=|author=Mark Twain, Kevin McCurley|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weather stations ==
Reports (observations) from [[weather station]]s can be [[Automatic weather station|automatic]] (totally machine produced), semi-automatic (part-machine and part manual), or manual. Some stations produce manual observations during business hours and revert to automatic observations outside these times. Many stations feature "present weather" sensors, [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]], etc.  There is also a network of 'upper air' stations, using [[Radiosondes]].

Some stations have limited reporting times, while other report continuously, mainly [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] stations where a manned met office is provided for military operations. The "standard" is a once-hourly reporting schedule, but automatic stations can often be "polled" as required, while stations at airfields report twice-hourly, with additional (often frequent in times of bad weather) special reports as necessary to inform airfield authorities of changes to the weather that may affect aviation operations.

Some stations report only [[CLIMAT]] data (e.g. maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall totals over a period, etc.) and these are usually recorded at 0900 and 2100 hours daily. Weather reports are often performed by observers not specifically employed by the Met Office, such as [[Air traffic control]] staff, coastguards, university staff and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5171">In cognitive psychology, the '''missing letter effect''' refers to the finding that, when people are asked to [[consciously]] detect target letters while reading text, they miss more letters in frequent, function words (e.g. the letter "h" in "the") than in less frequent, content words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The effect is usually measured using a paper-and-pencil procedure, where readers are asked to circle a target letter every time they come across it while reading a short passage.  The missing letter effect is more likely to appear when reading words that are part of a normal sequence, than when words are embedded in a mixed-up sequence (e.g. readers asked to read backwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Hypotheses==
Two primary hypotheses tried to explain the missing letter effect: [[Alice F. Healy|Healy]] (1994) emphasized identification processes playing a crucial role, almost entirely focusing on word frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Healy
  | first = A. F.

  | doi = 10.3758/BF03213975
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Koriat &amp; Greenberg (1994) viewed the structural role of the word within a sentence (i.e. function words vs. content words) to be crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A new model called the guidance-organization model was recently proposed to potentially explain the missing letter effect. It is a combination of the two models proposed by Healy, Koriat, and Greenberg.  As Greenberg et al. explain: "The time spent processing high-frequency function words at the whole-word level is relatively short, thereby enabling the fast and early use of these words to build a tentative structural frame."&lt;ref&gt;

They suggest that attention disengages faster from functional words than content words leading to the missing letter effect.

'''New Formalism''' is an [[architectural style]] that emerged in the United States during the mid 1950s and flowered in the 1960s. Buildings designed in that style exhibited many Classical elements including "strict symmetrical elevations"&lt;ref&gt;Wiffen, Marcus, American Architecture Since 1780: A Guide to the Styles, The M.I.T. Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; building proportion and scale, Classical columns, highly stylized [[entablature]]s and colonnades.  The style was used primarily for high-profile cultural, institutional and civic buildings. They were "typically constructed using rich materials such as marble, granite or man-made composites and also incorporated certain qualities of concrete that allowed for the creation of distinctive forms such as umbrella shells, waffle slabs and folded plates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccenter.org/about/About-The-Music-Center/Trivia/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011114909/http://www.musiccenter.org/about/About-The-Music-Center/Trivia/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-10-11|title=Music Center - Architecture and Design of The Music Center|work=musiccenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Edward Durrell Stone]]'s New Delhi American Embassy (1954), which blended the architecture of the east with modern western concepts, is considered to be the symbolic start of New Formalism architecture.&lt;ref name="fullertonheritage.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullertonheritage.org/Resources/archstyles/formalism.htm|title=Architectural Styles in Fullerton: New Formalism|work=fullertonheritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Common features of the New Formalism style, include:
* Use of traditionally rich materials, such as [[travertine]], marble, and granite or man-made materials that mimic their luxurious qualities
* Buildings usually set on a podium
* Designed to achieve modern monumentality
* Embraces classical precedents, such as arches, colonnades, classical columns and entablatures
* Smooth wall surfaces
* Delicacy of details
* Formal landscape; use of pools, fountains, sculpture within a central plaza"&lt;ref name="fullertonheritage.org"/&gt;

The '''Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies''' ({{lang-no|Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter om vold og traumatisk stress}}, '''NKVTS''') is a national, government-owned interdisciplinary research centre in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It is part of the [[University of Oslo]], but is established by, funded by and receives its assignments directly from the [[Government of Norway|central government]]. Its major focus areas are [[violence]] and [[sexual abuse]]; [[disaster]] management, [[terrorism]], [[armed conflicts]] and [[traumatic stress]]; and [[forced migration]] and [[Migrant health|refugee health]]. 

[[File:Day after Oslo bombing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|NKVTS is involved in major research projects on the psychological and social impact of [[terrorism]], such as the [[2011 Norway attacks]]]]
The centre was established in 2004 through the merger of a part of the former ''Division of Disaster Psychiatry'' (KKP) of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] medical service, the former ''Psychosocial Centre for Refugees'' at the University of Oslo (PSSF), the ''Norwegian Resource Centre for Information and Studies on Violence'' (VOS), and the ''Norwegian National Resource Center on Child Sexual Abuse'' (NRSB) at [[Aker University Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Malt |first=Ulrik |author-link= Ulrik Fredrik Malt |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |encyclopedia= Store medisinske leksikon |title= Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter om vold og traumatisk stress |trans-title= |url= http://sml.snl.no/Nasjonalt_kunnskapssenter_om_vold_og_traumatisk_stress |year= |publisher= |volume= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Refugee children from Syria at a clinic in Ramtha, northern Jordan (9613477263).jpg|thumb|Syrian refugee children in 2013.

[[File:Ullevål universitetssykehus.jpg|thumb|NKVTS was located at [[Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål]] 2004–2013]]
The centre is a joint initiative of the [[Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services|Ministry of Health]], the [[Ministry of Justice and Public Security]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of Defence|Ministry of Defence]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion|Ministry of Labour]], and the [[Norwegian Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion|Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion]], and is funded directly by these government departments while organizationally being part of the [[University of Oslo]]. The centre was located at [[Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål]] 2004–2013, and is now located in [[Nydalen]], [[Oslo]], in the immediate vicinity of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security and of the [[BI Norwegian Business School]].

The centre has 94 employees (2016). It employs experts in [[psychology]], [[medicine]] (including [[psychiatry]] and [[pediatrics]]), [[law]], [[sociology]], [[criminology]], [[social anthropology]] and other disciplines, with the main emphasis on psychology and psychiatry. Its academic staff include 6 [[Academic ranks in Norway#Research professor|research professors]] (corresponding to full professors), 2 research professors II (part-time), 32 senior researchers (corresponding to associate professors), 6 researchers (corresponding to assistant professors) and a number of postdoctoral fellows, research fellows (doctoral candidates) and research assistants. NKVTS cooperates closely with the [[Department of Psychology, University of Oslo|Department of Psychology]], the [[University of Oslo Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]] and the [[University of Oslo Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] at the University of Oslo, where several of its research professors also hold professorial chairs.&lt;ref name="Aarsrapport2016" /&gt;

[[Nora Sveaass]], then research director for refugee health and forced migration at NKVTS, was elected as a member of the [[United Nations Committee against Torture]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/norwegian-psychologist-to-sit-on-un-comm/id419790/ Norwegian psychologist to sit on UN Committee against Torture], [[Government of Norway]]&lt;/ref&gt;

NKVTS has major research projects on the psychological and social impact of [[terrorism]], including the [[2011 Norway attacks]]. NKVTS also has several research projects on the psychological impact of natural catastrophes such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], and on [[child soldier]]s in [[Africa]], [[torture]], traumatised refugees, [[war]] victims and [[soldier]]s, [[child sexual abuse]] and [[sexual violence]], and [[Domestic violence|violence in close relations]].

The current Director of the institute is [[Inger Elise Birkeland]], a former political adviser to Prime Minister [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]].

[[B.E. Saunders]] of the [[Medical University of South Carolina]] has described the institute as "one of the most highly respected research organizations in the world dedicated to research on violence and traumatic stress. Since its inception, it has conducted a series of highly sophisticated studies focusing on a wide array of topics, including the prevalence and impact of different forms of violence and abuse among children and adults, mental health treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related problems, and how best to implement and incorporate evidence-based interventions practices into community service agencies. These studies have had enormous impact not only in Norway, but internationally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nkvts.no/content/uploads/2018/11/Saunders_NKVTS_letter_11-9-18.pdf |title= To Bent Høie |last=Saunders |first=Benjamin E. |date=9 November 2018 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Occupational English Test logo.png|thumbnail|right]]
'''The Occupational English Test''' (also known as '''OET''') is an international [[English language]] test for the healthcare sector. It assesses the language communication skills of healthcare professionals who wish to register and practise in an English-speaking environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

OET is available for the following 12 professions: dentistry, dietetics, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physiotherapy, podiatry, radiography, speech pathology, and veterinary science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

OET was designed in the late 1980s by Professor [[Tim McNamara]], under the guidance of the [[Australian National Office for Overseas Skills Recognition]] (NOOSR), which administered the test at that time. The test has been researched and developed continuously since then to ensure that it has kept up with current theory and practice in language assessment. This work has been done primarily by the [[University of Melbourne|University of Melbourne’s]] Language Testing Research Centre and, more recently, also by [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]].

Since March 2013 the test has been owned by '''Cambridge Boxhill Language Assessment Trust (CBLA)''', a venture between [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]] and [[Box Hill Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
OET is recognised by regulatory healthcare bodies and councils in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], recently in [[UK]] and [[Ireland]]. Many organisations, including hospitals, universities and colleges, are using OET as proof of a candidate’s ability to communicate effectively in a demanding healthcare environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, OET is recognised by the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection for a number of visa categories, including work and student visas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Each recognising organisation determines which grade results mean that candidates meet the language competency standards to function in their profession.  A full list of regulatory organisations which accept OET can be seen on the [http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2434 official website].

==Format==
OET provides a valid and reliable assessment of all four language skills – Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking – with an emphasis on communication in medical and health professional settings.
OET consists of four sub-tests:
* Listening (approximately 50 minutes)
* Reading (60 minutes)
* Writing (45 minutes)
* Speaking (approximately 20 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Listening'''

The listening test consists of two parts. In Part A, candidates listen to a simulated consultation (dialogue) between a professional and a patient and are required to take notes under headings. In Part B, candidates listen to a health professional giving a short talk on a health-related topic and are required to complete a range of open-ended and fixed-choice questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=7592d58c-f766-4637-98c1-542133ab44f5] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=7592d58c-f766-4637-98c1-542133ab44f5 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reading'''

The reading test consists of two parts. In Part A, lasting 15 minutes, candidates are asked to skim read 3 or 4 short texts and complete a summary paragraph by filling in the missing words. It is designed to test the reader’s ability to scan texts within a time limit, source information from multiple texts, and synthesise information. In Part B, lasting 45 minutes, candidates are asked to read two passages on a general healthcare topic and answer 8–10 multiple choice questions for each text. It is designed to test the reader’s ability to read and comprehend longer texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=b5d05b93-a046-4d09-8e87-1e06ef2ef04c] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=b5d05b93-a046-4d09-8e87-1e06ef2ef04c Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Writing'''

The writing paper asks candidates to write a letter, usually a letter of referral. For some professions a different type of letter is required, e.g. a letter of transfer or discharge, or a letter to advise a patient, carer or group. Candidates are given case notes which must be included in their letter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2569[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=256] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2569 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speaking'''

The speaking test is in the form of one-to-one conversations with an interlocutor. It starts with a short warm-up interview about the candidate’s professional background. This is followed by two role plays. Candidates have 2–3 minutes to prepare for each role play.  Role plays last about five minutes and are based on typical interactions between a health professional and a patient. The candidate adopts their usual professional role (e.g. as a nurse) and the interviewer plays a patient or sometimes a relative or carer. For veterinary science the interviewer is the owner or carer of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2569] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2569 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
Each of the four sub-tests that make up OET are graded A to E, where A is the highest grade and E is the lowest. There is no overall grade.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! OET grade !! Description of ability
|-
| A || Very high level of performance
|-
| B || High level of performance, i.e. able to use English with fluency and accuracy adequate for professional needs
|-
| C || Good level of performance; however, not acceptable to a range of health and medical councils
|-
| D || Moderate level of performance; requires improvement
|-
| E || Low level of performance; requires considerable improvement
|}

'''Listening and reading'''

There is no fixed score-to-grade link for the listening and reading tests. Grade boundaries are continually reset because different test materials are used at each administration. A mean average of the percentage of candidates in each grade for the writing and speaking tests is applied to the spread of performances on the listening and reading tests to establish the grade boundaries.

'''Writing and speaking'''

In writing and speaking, the score is generated through statistical analysis of the two sets of scores from two independent assessors. This is converted, following established practice, to the final grade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2571] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2571 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timing and results==
OET is available up to 12 times a year and can be taken at test venues around the world. A full list is available on the [http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2537 official website].

Results are published online approximately 16 business days after the test. Official statements of results are sent out in the post following the release of online results. There is no overall grade – candidates receive separate grades for each sub-test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recognising organisations require candidates to have at least a B grade in each of the four sub-tests and recognise results as valid for up to two years. Most recognising organisations also require that candidates achieve the requisite grades for each sub-test in one sitting. However, candidates should check with the organisation that regulates their profession to confirm current requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2571] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2571 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals==
The Occupational English Test was plagued with criticism from an Australian Government's Parliamentary Enquiry in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=/haa/overseasdoctors/subs.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The broader community made negative statements about testing conditions and marking consistency to the Enquiry. One submission claimed that it is possible to get a pass by re-sitting the test multiple times as you will eventually be marked higher after 6 sittings of the OET test.

==Research==
OET is underpinned by over 30 years of research and the test is regularly updated to keep pace with changes in language testing in a healthcare context. There is strong emphasis on the ongoing validity and reliability of the test.  Leading language testing academics contribute to the continued development of the test, and subject matter experts are consulted to ensure that tasks are based on a typical workplace situations and the demands of the profession. A full list of research can be seen on the [http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2607 official website]

[[File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - 1556-1559.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] by [[Titian]] has a full provenance covering its passage through several owners and four countries since it was painted for [[Philip II of Spain]] in the 1550s.]]

'''Provenance''' (from the [[French language|French]] ''provenir'', 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'': "The fact of coming from some particular source or quarter; source, derivation"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally mostly used in relation to [[works of art]] but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[archive]]s, [[manuscript]]s, printed books and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, [[chain of custody|custody]] and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping [[Authentication|authenticate]] objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of [[document]]ation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term ''[[chain of custody]]''.

In [[archaeology]] and [[paleontology]], the derived term '''provenience''' is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210004312/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/terms.htm Selected Archeological Terms, National Park Service (Internet archive)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance.

==Works of art and antiques==
The provenance of works of [[fine art]], antiques and [[antiquities]] is of great importance, especially to their owner. There are a number of reasons why painting provenance is important, which mostly also apply to other types of fine art. A good provenance increases the value of a painting, and establishing provenance may help confirm the date, artist and, especially for portraits, the subject of a painting. It may confirm whether a painting is genuinely of the period it seems to date from. The provenance of paintings can help resolve ownership disputes. For example, provenance between 1933 and 1945 can determine whether a painting was looted by the Nazis. Many galleries are putting a great deal of effort into researching the provenance of paintings in their collections for which there is no firm provenance during that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/what-we-do/contributing-sector/spoliation/ National Museum Directors' Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Documented evidence of provenance for an object can help to establish that it has not been altered and is not a forgery, a reproduction, [[art theft|stolen]] or [[looted art]]. Provenance helps assign the work to a known artist, and a documented history can be of use in helping to prove ownership. An example of a detailed provenance is given in [[Arnolfini Portrait#Provenance|the Arnolfini portrait]].

The quality of provenance of an important work of art can make a considerable difference to its selling price in the market; this is affected by the degree of certainty of the provenance, the status of past owners as collectors, and in many cases by the strength of evidence that an object has not been illegally excavated or exported from another country. The provenance of a work of art may vary greatly in length, depending on context or the amount that is known, from a single name to an entry in a scholarly catalogue some thousands of words long.

An expert [[certification]] can mean the difference between an object having no value and being worth a fortune. Certifications themselves may be open to question. [[Jacques van Meegeren]] forged the work of his father [[Han van Meegeren]] (who in his turn had forged the work of [[Vermeer]]). Jacques sometimes produced a certificate with his forgeries stating that a work was created by his father.

[[John Drewe]] was able to pass off as genuine paintings, a large number of forgeries that would have easily been recognised as such by scientific examination. He established an impressive (but false) provenance and because of this galleries and dealers accepted the paintings as genuine. He created this false provenance by forging letters and other documents, including false entries in earlier exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/myatt-drewe.htm A 20th Century Master Scam]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes provenance can be as simple as a photograph of the item with its original owner. Simple yet definitive documentation such as that can increase its value by an order of magnitude, but only if the owner was of high renown. Many items that were sold at auction have gone far past their estimates because of a photograph showing that item with a famous person. Some examples include antiques owned by politicians, musicians, artists, actors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkauctions.com/a-2-6-million-lesson-about-provenance/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Researching the provenance of paintings===
[[File:SirWilliamPetre.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[William Petre|Sir William Petre]], 1567: artist unknown. By the turn of the 17th century, this portrait was in the [[Lumley inventories|collection]] of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|John, 1st Baron Lumley]], a fact indicated by the ''cartellino'' (a ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' representation of an inscribed label) added to the painting at upper right. It is now in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]
The objective of provenance research is to produce a complete list of owners (together, where possible, with the supporting documentary proof) from when the painting was commissioned or in the artist's studio through to the present time. In practice, there are likely to be gaps in the list and documents that are missing or lost. The documented provenance should also list when the painting has been part of an exhibition and a [[bibliography]] of when it has been discussed (or illustrated) in print.

Where the research is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location is known, it is important to record the physical details of the painting – style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Lisa, ''An Art Provenance Research Guide'' available at [http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 University of North Carolina Master's Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707092307/http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting. The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may also be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' the provenance of the painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' was investigated using a gallery sticker and shipping label on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a ''cartellino'' (a representation of an inscribed label) added to the front of a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/cartellino |title=Cartellino |publisher=The National Gallery |location=London |work=Glossary |accessdate=31 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these can be forged, or can fade or be painted over.

Auction records are an important resource to assist in researching the provenance of paintings. 
*The [[Witt Library]] houses a collection of cuttings from auction catalogs which enables the researcher to identify occasions when a picture has been sold. 
*The Heinz Library at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] maintains a similar collection, but restricted to portraits. 
*The National Art Library at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a collection of UK sales catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/study-guide-art-auction-sales-sales-catalogues-price-guides/ V&amp;A Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The University of York is establishing a web site with on-line resources for investigating art history in the period 1660–1735.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artworld.york.ac.uk/news.jsp The Art World in Britain 1660-1735]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes diaries, sales catalogues, bills, correspondence and inventories.  
*The [[Getty Research Institute]] in Los Angeles has a ''Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance'' (PSCP) which includes an on-line database, still being compiled, of auction and other records relating to painting provenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/charts.html Provenance Index Databases]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Frick Art Reference Library]] in New York has an extensive collection of auction and exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frick.org/library/index.htm Frick Library]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) has a number of databases related to artists from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.rkd.nl/Databases Netherlands Institute for Art History Databases]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a painting has been in private hands for an extended period and on display in a [[stately home]], it may be recorded in an inventory – for example, the [[Lumley inventories|Lumley inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dynasties'', a catalogue of an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, Karen Hearn, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; The painting may also have been noticed by a visitor who subsequently wrote about it. It may have been mentioned in a will or a diary. Where the painting has been bought from a dealer, or changed hands in a private transaction, there may be a bill of sale or sales receipt that provides evidence of provenance. Where the artist is known, there may be a [[catalogue raisonné]] listing all the artist's known works and their location at the time of writing. A database of catalogues raisonnés is available at the [http://www.ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research]. Historic photos of the painting may be discussed and illustrated in a more general work on the artist, period or genre. Similarly, a photograph of a painting may show inscriptions (or a signature) that subsequently became lost as a result of overzealous restoration. Conversely, a photograph may show that an inscription was not visible at an earlier date. One of the disputed aspects of the [[Ozias Humphry|"Rice" portrait]] of [[Jane Austen]] concerns apparent inscriptions identifying artist and sitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorynews.com/ Bendor Grosvenor blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
[[File:BRA stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section of the [[British Records Association]], a rescue service for archival material: the number indicates its earlier provenance]]
Provenance – also known as "custodial history" – is a core concept of [[archival science]] and [[archival processing]]. The term refers to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in an accumulation of records, and to the items' subsequent [[chain of custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kerstin |editor1-last=Abukhanfusa |editor2-first=Jan |editor2-last=Sydbeck |title=The Principle of Provenance: report from the First Stockholm Conference on Archival Theory and the Principle of Provenance, 2–3 September 1993 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Swedish National Archives |year=1994 |isbn=9789188366115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of provenance (sometimes also termed the principle of ''archival integrity'' or ''[[respect des fonds]]'') stipulates that records originating from a common source (or [[fonds]]) should be kept together – where practicable, physically; but in all cases intellectually, in the way in which they are catalogued and arranged in [[finding aid]]s. Conversely, records of different provenance should be preserved and documented separately. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an archival document or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain (because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody) will be considered to be severely compromised.

The principles of archival provenance were developed in the 19th century by both French and Prussian archivists, and gained widespread acceptance on the basis of their formulation in the ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives'' by Dutch state archivists Samuel Muller, J. A. Feith, and R. Fruin, published in the Netherlands in 1898 (often referred to as the "[[Archival appraisal#History of appraisal theory|Dutch Manual]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Jennifer |year=2010 |chapter=Origins: evolving ideas about the principle of provenance |title=Currents of Archival Thinking |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=Eastwood |editor1-link=Terry Eastwood |editor2-first=Heather |editor2-last=MacNeil |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781591586562 |pages=23-43 (27-28) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Ross has argued a case for adapting established principles and theories of archival provenance to the field of modern digital preservation and curation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Seamus |year=2012 |title=Digital Preservation, Archival Science and Methodological Foundations for Digital Libraries |journal=New Review of Information Networking |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=43-68 (esp. 50-53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Provenance'' is also the title of the journal published by the Society of Georgia Archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/provenance/ |title=Provenance, Journal of the Society of Georgia Archivists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In the case of books, the study of provenance refers to the study of the ownership of individual copies of books. It is usually extended to include study of the circumstances in which individual copies of books have changed ownership, and of evidence left in books that shows how readers interacted with them.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Pearson  | first = David  | title = Provenance Research in Book History: a Handbook  | publisher = British Library  | year = 1998 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-7123-4598-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pearson, David |chapter=Provenance and Rare Book Cataloguing: Its Importance and Its Challenges | pages=1–9|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Books and Their Owners: Provenance Information and The European Cultural Heritage |publisher=[[Consortium of European Research Libraries]] | year=2005 |isbn=0-9541535-3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance studies may shed light on the books themselves, providing evidence of the role particular titles have played in social, intellectual and literary history. Such studies may also add to our knowledge of particular owners of books. For instance, looking at the books owned by a writer may help to show which works influenced him or her.

Many provenance studies are historically focused, and concentrated on books owned by writers, politicians and public figures. The recent ownership of books is studied, however, as is evidence of how ordinary or anonymous readers have interacted with books.&lt;ref name="Curwen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Curwen, Tony  |author2=Jonsson, Gunilla  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Provenance and the Itinerary of the Book: Recording Provenance Data in On-line Catalogues | pages=31–47|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Imprints and Owners: Recording the Cultural Geography of Europe |publisher=Consortium of European Research Libraries | year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9541535-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jackson  | first = H. J.  | title = Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books  | publisher = Yale University Press  | year = 2001 | page=2 | isbn=978-0-300-08816-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance can be studied both by examining the books themselves (for instance looking at inscriptions, [[marginalia]], [[bookplate]]s, [[book rhyme]]s, and bindings) and by reference to external sources of information such as auction catalogues.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

==Wines==
In transactions of old wine with the potential of [[Storage of wine|improving with age]], the issue of provenance has a large bearing on the assessment of the contents of a bottle, both in terms of quality and the risk of [[wine fraud]]. A documented history of [[wine cellar]] conditions is valuable in estimating the quality of an older vintage due to the fragile nature of wine.&lt;ref name=OCW-ageing&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= ageing |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent technology developments have aided collectors in assessing the temperature and humidity history or the wine which are two key components in establishing perfect provenance. For example, there are devices available that rest inside the wood case and can be read through the wood by waving a smartphone equipped with a simple app. These devices track the conditions the case has been exposed to for the duration of the battery life, which can be as long as 15 years, and sends a graph and high/low readings to the smartphone user. This takes the trust issue out of the hands of the owner and gives it to a third party for verification.

==Science==

===Archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology===
[[Archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] researchers use ''provenience'' to refer to the exact location or '''find spot''' of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], a bone or other remains, a soil sample, or a feature within an ancient site,&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt; whereas ''provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience is recorded in three dimensions on a site grid with great precision, and may also be recorded on video to provide additional proof and context. In older work, often undertaken by amateurs, only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. The term ''provenience'' appeared in the 1880s, about a century after ''provenance''. Outside of academic contexts, it has been used as a [[synonym]]ous variant spelling of ''provenance'', especially in [[American English]].

Any given antiquity may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). A summary of the distinction is that "provenience is a fixed point, while provenance can be considered an itinerary that an object follows as it moves from hand to hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rosemary A. |last=Joyce |chapter=From Place to Place: Provenience, Provenance, and Archaeology |title=Provenance: An Alternate History of Art |editor1-first=Gail |editor1-last=Feigenbaum |editor2-first=Inge |editor2-last=Jackson Reist |date=2012 |page=48 |publisher=Getty Research Institute |series=Issues &amp; Debates |isbn=978-1606061220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another metaphor is that provenience is an artifact's "birthplace", while provenance is its "[[résumé]]",&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/provenience-vs-provenance-3971058 |first=K. Kris |last=Hirst |date=December 22, 2016 |title=Provenience, Provenance, Let's Call the Whole Thing Off: What is the difference in meaning between provenience and provenance? |work=ThoughtCo |publisher=Dotdash/IAC |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is imprecise (many artifacts originated as trade goods created in one region but were used and finally deposited in another).

Aside from scientific precision, a need for the distinction in these fields has been described thus:&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt;
{{blockquote|1=Archaeologists ... don't care who owned an object—they are more interested in the context of an object within the community of its (mostly original) users. ... [W]e are interested in why a Roman coin turned up in a shipwreck 400 years after it was made; while art historians don't really care, since they can generally figure out what mint a coin came from by the information stamped on its surface. "It's a Roman coin, what else do we need to know?" says an art historian; "The shipping trade in the Mediterranean region during late Roman times" says an archaeologist. ... [P]rovenance for an art historian is important to establish ownership, but provenience is interesting to an archaeologist to establish meaning.}}

In this context, the ''provenance'' can occasionally be the detailed history of where an object has been since its creation,&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt; as in art history contexts – not just since its modern finding. In some cases, such as where there is an inscription on the object, or an account of it in written materials from the same era, an object of study in archaeology or [[cultural anthropology]] may have an early provenance – a known history that predates modern research – then a provenience from its modern finding, and finally a continued provenance relating to its handling and storage or display after the modern acquisition.

Evidence of provenance in the more general sense can be of importance in archaeology. Fakes are not unknown, and finds are sometimes removed from the context in which they were found without documentation, reducing their value to science. Even when apparently discovered ''[[in situ]]'', archaeological finds are treated with caution. The provenience of a find may not be properly represented by the context in which it was found (e.g. due to [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic layers]] being disturbed by erosion, earthquakes, or ancient reconstruction or other disturbance at a site. Artifacts can also be moved through looting as well as trade, far from their place of origin and long before modern rediscovery. Further research is often required to establish the true provenance of a find, and what the relationship is between the exact provenience and the overall provenance.

In [[paleontology]] and [[paleoanthropology]], it is recognized that [[fossil]]s can also move from their primary context and are sometimes found, apparently ''in-situ'', in deposits to which they do not belong because they have been moved, for example, by the erosion of nearby but different [[outcrop]]s. It is unclear how strictly paleontology maintains the ''provenience'' and ''provenance'' distinction. For example, a short glossary at a website (primarily aimed at young students) of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] treats the terms as synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/24/glossary |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |work=PaleoPortal Collections Management |title=Glossary |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scholarly paleontology works make frequent use of ''provenience'' in the same precise sense as used in archaeology and paleoanthropology.

While exacting details of a find's provenience are primarily of use to scientific researchers, most natural history and archaeology museums also make strenuous efforts to record how the items in their collections were acquired. These records are often of use in helping to establish a chain of provenance.

===Data provenance===
{{see|Data lineage}}
[[Scientific research]] is generally held to be of good provenance when it is documented in detail sufficient to allow [[reproducibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Altintas, I.; Berkley, C.; Jaeger, E.; Jones, M.; Ludascher, B.; Mock S.

(2007) Ensuring reliable datasets for environmental models and forecasts. Ecological Informatics, 2(3):237–247&lt;/ref&gt; Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of data provenance. Examples of these initiatives are [[National Science Foundation]] [[Datanet]] projects, [[DataONE]] and Data Conservancy, as well as the [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]].&lt;ref name="Ma, et al."&gt;Ma, X.; Fox, P.; Tilmes, C.; Jacobs, K.; Waple, A. (2014) Capturing and presenting provenance of global change information. Nature Climate Change 4 (6), 409-413.&lt;/ref&gt; Some international academic consortia, such as the [[Research Data Alliance]], have specific group to tackle issues of provenance. In that case it is the Research Data Provenance Interest Group.&lt;ref&gt;https://rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-provenance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer science===
Within [[computer science]], [[Information science|informatics]] uses the term 'provenance'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Yu Shyang|last2=Ko|first2=Ryan K.L.|last3=Holmes|first3=Geoff|date=November 2013|title=Security and Data Accountability in Distributed Systems: A Provenance Survey|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6832103/|journal=2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications &amp; 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/hpcc.and.euc.2013.221|isbn=9780769550886}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mean the [[Data lineage|lineage of data]], as per data provenance, with research in the last decade extending the conceptual model of causality and relation to include processes that act on data and agents that are responsible for those processes. See, for example, the proceedings of the International Provenance Annotation Workshop (IPAW)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipaw.info/&lt;/ref&gt; and Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP).&lt;ref&gt;http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/tapp2015/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semantic web]] standards bodies, including the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] in 2014, have ratified a standard data model for provenance representation known as PROV&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; which draws from many of the better-known provenance representation systems that preceded it, such as the [[Proof Markup Language]] and the Open Provenance Model.&lt;ref&gt;http://openprovenance.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Interoperability is a design goal of most recent computer science provenance theories and models, for example the Open Provence Model (OPM) 2008 generation workshop aimed at "establishing inter-operability of systems" through information exchange agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau et al. (2008) The Open Provenance Model: An Overview, in J. Freire, D. Koop, and L. Moreau (Eds.): IPAW 2008, LNCS 5272, pp. 323–326, 2008. Springer. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.7394&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Data models and serialisation formats for delivering provenance information typically reuse existing metadata models where possible to enable this. Both the OPM Vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, J. (2010) "[http://purl.org/net/opmv/ns Open Provenance Model Vocabulary Specification]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; and the PROV Ontology&lt;ref&gt;Lebo et al. (eds.) "[https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ PROV-O: The PROV Ontology]", accessed 2016-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; make extensive use of metadata models such as [[Dublin Core]] and [[Semantic Web]] technologies such as the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL). Current practice is to rely on the W3C PROV data model, OPM's successor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khalidbelhajjame.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/w3c-prov-implementations/ "W3C PROV Implementations: Preliminary Analysis", Khalid Belhajjame, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrology===
{{See also|Provenance (geology)}}
[[Image:QFLtriangle.jpg|thumb|A [[QFL diagram]] (Quartz, Feldspar, Lithic fragments) used to determine [[tectonic]] provenance in sandstones]]
In the [[geologic]] use of the term, provenance instead refers to the origin or source area of particles within a rock, most commonly in [[sedimentary rocks]]. It does not refer to the circumstances of the collection of the rock. The provenance of sandstone, in particular, can be evaluated by determining the proportion of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments (see diagram).

===Seed provenance===
Seed provenance refers to the specified area in which plants that produced seed are located or were derived. Local provenancing is a position maintained by ecologists that suggests that only seeds of local provenance should be planted in a particular area. However, this view depends on the [[adaptationist program]] – a view that populations are universally locally adapted.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S. J.; Lewontin; R. C. (1979). "The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences'', 205: 581-598&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained that local seed is best [[Adaptation|adapted]] to local conditions, and that [[outbreeding depression]] will be avoided. [[Evolutionary biologists]] suggest that strict adherence to provenance collecting is not a wise decision because:
# Local adaptation is not as common as assumed.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"&gt;Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
# Background population [[maladaptation]] can be driven by natural processes.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"/&gt;
# Human actions of [[habitat fragmentation]] drive maladaptation up and adaptive potential down.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Y, Van Buskirk J, Hoffmann AA (2006) Limits to the adaptive potential of small populations. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 433-458.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Natural selection]] is changing rapidly due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Parmesan C (2006) Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 637-669.&lt;/ref&gt; and habitat fragmentation
# Population fragments are unlikely to divergence by natural selection since fragmentation (&lt;&amp;nbsp;500 years). This leads to a low risk of outbreeding depression.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham R, Ballou J, Eldridge M, Lacy R, Ralls K, et al. (2011) Predicting the probability of outbreeding depression. Conservation Biology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance trials, where material of different provenances are planted in a single place or at different locations spanning a range of environmental conditions, is a way to reveal [[genetic variation]] among provenances. It also contributes to an understanding of how different provenances respond to various climatic and environmental conditions and can as such contribute with knowledge on how to strategically select provenances for [[climate change adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konnert, M., Fady, B., Gömöry, D., A’Hara, S., Wolter, F., Ducci, F. Koskela, J., Bozzano, M., Maaten, T. and Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change|journal=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]] (EUFORGEN), Bioversity International, Rome, Italy|date=2015|page=xvi and 75 p|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers and law==
The term ''provenance'' is used when ascertaining the source of goods such as computer hardware to assess if they are genuine or counterfeit. [[Chain of custody]] is an equivalent term used in law, especially for evidence in criminal or commercial cases.

Software provenance encompasses the origin of software and its [[Software license|licensing terms]]. For example, when incorporating a free, open source or proprietary software component in an application, one may wish to understand its provenance to ensure that licensing requirements are fulfilled and that other software characteristics can be understood.

Data provenance covers the provenance of computerized data. There are two main aspects of data provenance: ownership of the data and data usage. Ownership will tell the user who is responsible for the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources. Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets.&lt;ref name="Ma, et al." /&gt;
The automated analysis of data provenance graphs has been described as a mean to verify compliance with regulations regarding data usage such as introduced by the EU [[General_Data_Protection_Regulation|GDPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pasquier |first1=Thomas |last2=Singh |first2=Jatinder |last3=Powles |first3=Julia |last4=Eyers |first4=David |last5=Seltzer |first5=Margo |last6=Bacon |first6=Jean |title=Data provenance to audit compliance with privacy policy in the Internet of Things |journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing |date=1 April 2018 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=333–344 |doi=10.1007/s00779-017-1067-4 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210921 |issn=1617-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure Provenance refers to providing integrity and confidentiality guarantees to provenance information. In other words, secure provenance means to ensure that history cannot be rewritten, and users can specify who else can look into their actions on the object.&lt;ref name="fast09"&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/fast09/tech/full_papers/hasan/hasan_html/index.html The Case of the Fake Picasso: Preventing History Forgery with Secure Provenance], Hasan et al., USENIX FAST 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Chaining for securing data provenance in distributed information networks | author=Xinlei (Oscar) Wang, Kai Zeng, Kannan Govindan and Prasant Mohapatra. | booktitle=In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference for Military Communications. | year=2012 | conference=MILCOM '12 | DOI=10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple method of ensuring data provenance in computing is to mark a file as [[File system permissions#Permissions|read only]]. This allows the user to view the contents of the file, but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally [[File deletion#Problem with accidental removal|deleting the file]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12693">In [[abstract algebra]], a '''residuated lattice''' is an [[algebraic structure]] that is simultaneously a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and a [[monoid]] ''x''•''y'' which admits operations ''x''\''z'' and ''z''/''y'', loosely analogous to division or implication, when ''x''•''y'' is viewed as multiplication or conjunction, respectively.  Called respectively right and left residuals, these operations coincide when the monoid is commutative.  The general concept was introduced by Ward and Dilworth in 1939.  Examples, some of which existed prior to the general concept, include [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s, [[Heyting algebra]]s, [[residuated Boolean algebra]]s, [[relation algebra]]s, and [[MV-algebra]]s.  [[Residuated lattice#Residuated semilattice|Residuated semilattices]] omit the meet operation &amp;and;, for example [[Kleene algebra]]s and [[action algebra]]s.

==Definition==

In [[mathematics]], a '''residuated lattice''' is an [[algebraic structure]] '''L''' = (''L'', ≤, •, '''I''') such that
:  (i) (''L'', ≤) is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]].
: (ii) (''L'', •, '''I''') is a [[monoid]].
:(iii)  For all ''z'' there exists for every ''x'' a greatest ''y'', and for every ''y'' a greatest ''x'', such that ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' (the residuation properties).

In (iii), the "greatest ''y''", being a function of ''z'' and ''x'', is denoted ''x''\''z'' and called the '''right residual''' of ''z'' by ''x''. Think of it as what remains of ''z'' on the right after "dividing" ''z'' on the left by ''x''.  Dually, the "greatest ''x''" is denoted ''z''/''y'' and called the '''left residual''' of ''z'' by ''y''.  An equivalent, more formal statement of (iii) that uses these operations to name these greatest values is

(iii)'  for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''L'', &amp;nbsp; ''y'' ≤ ''x''\''z'' &amp;nbsp; ⇔ &amp;nbsp; ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' &amp;nbsp; ⇔ &amp;nbsp; ''x'' ≤ ''z''/''y''.

As suggested by the notation, the residuals are a form of quotient.  More precisely, for a given ''x'' in ''L'', the unary operations ''x''• and ''x''\ are respectively the lower and upper adjoints of a [[Galois connection]] on '''L''', and dually for the two functions •''y'' and /''y''.  By the same reasoning that applies to any Galois connection, we have yet another definition of the residuals, namely,
:''x''•(''x''\''y'') ≤ ''y'' ≤ ''x''\(''x''•''y''), and
:(''y''/''x'')•''x'' ≤ ''y'' ≤ (''y''•''x'')/''x'',

together with the requirement that ''x''•''y'' be monotone in ''x'' and ''y''.  (When axiomatized using (iii) or (iii)' monotonicity becomes a theorem and hence not required in the axiomatization.)  These give a sense in which the functions ''x''• and ''x''\ are pseudoinverses or adjoints of each other, and likewise for •''x'' and /''x''.

This last definition is purely in terms of inequalities, noting that monotonicity can be axiomatized as ''x''•''y'' ≤ (''x''&amp;or;''z'')•''y'' and similarly for the other operations and their arguments.  Moreover, any inequality ''x'' ≤ ''y'' can be expressed equivalently as an equation, either ''x''&amp;and;''y'' = ''x'' or ''x''&amp;or;''y'' = ''y''.  This along with the equations axiomatizing lattices and monoids then yields a purely equational definition of residuated lattices, provided the requisite operations are adjoined to the signature (''L'', ≤, •, '''I''') thereby expanding it to (''L'', &amp;and;, &amp;or;, •, '''I''', /, \).  When thus organized, residuated lattices form an equational class or [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]], whose homomorphisms respect the residuals as well as the lattice and monoid operations.  Note that distributivity ''x''•(''y''&amp;or;''z'') = (''x''•''y'') &amp;or; (''x''•''z'') and ''x''•0 = 0 are consequences of these axioms and so do not need to be made part of the definition.  This necessary distributivity of • over &amp;or; does not in general entail distributivity of &amp;and; over &amp;or;, that is, a residuated lattice need not be a distributive lattice.  However it does do so when • and &amp;and; are the same operation, a special case of residuated lattices called a [[Heyting algebra]].
  
Alternative notations for ''x''•''y'' include ''x''&amp;#9702;''y'', ''x'';''y'' ([[relation algebra]]), and ''x''⊗''y'' ([[linear logic]]).  Alternatives for '''I''' include ''e'' and 1'.  Alternative notations for the residuals are ''x'' → ''y'' for ''x''\''y'' and ''y'' ← ''x'' for ''y''/''x'', suggested by the similarity between residuation and implication in logic, with the multiplication of the monoid understood as a form of conjunction that need not be commutative.  When the monoid is commutative the two residuals coincide.  When not commutative, the intuitive meaning of the monoid as conjunction and the residuals as implications can be understood as having a temporal quality: ''x''•''y'' means ''x'' ''and then'' ''y'', &amp;nbsp; ''x'' → ''y'' means ''had'' ''x'' (in the past) ''then'' ''y'' (now), &amp;nbsp; and ''y'' ← ''x'' means ''if-ever'' ''x'' (in the future) ''then'' ''y'' (at that time), as illustrated by the natural language example at the end of the examples.

== Examples ==
One of the original motivations for the study of residuated lattices was the lattice of (two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Given a ring ''R'', the ideals of ''R'', denoted Id(''R''), forms a complete lattice with set intersection acting as the meet operation and "ideal addition" acting as the join operation. The monoid operation • is given by "ideal multiplication", and the element ''R'' of Id(''R'') acts as the identity for this operation. Given two ideals ''A'' and ''B'' in Id(''R''), the residuals are given by
:&lt;math&gt;A/B:= \{r \in R \mid rB \subseteq A \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B\setminus A:=\{ r \in R \mid Br \subseteq A \}&lt;/math&gt;
It is worth noting that {0}/''B'' and ''B''\{0} are respectively the left and right [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilators]] of ''B''. This residuation is related to the ''[[conductor (ring theory)|conductor]]'' (or ''transporter'') in [[commutative algebra]] written as (''A'':''B'')=''A''/''B''. One difference in usage is that ''B'' need not be an ideal of ''R'': it may just be a subset.

[[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and [[Heyting algebras]] are commutative residuated lattices in which ''x''•''y'' = ''x''&amp;and;''y'' (whence the unit '''I''' is the top element 1 of the algebra) and both residuals ''x''\''y'' and ''y''/''x'' are the same operation, namely implication ''x'' → ''y''.  The second example is quite general since Heyting algebras include all finite [[distributive lattice]]s, as well as all chains or [[total order]]s forming a [[complete lattice]], for example the unit interval [0,1] in the real line, or the integers and ±&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

The structure ('''Z''', ''min'', ''max'', +, 0, &amp;minus;, &amp;minus;) (the integers with subtraction for both residuals) is a commutative residuated lattice such that the unit of the monoid is not the greatest element (indeed there is no least or greatest integer), and the multiplication of the monoid is not the meet operation of the lattice.  In this example the inequalities are equalities because &amp;minus; (subtraction) is not merely the adjoint or pseudoinverse of + but the true inverse.  Any totally ordered group under addition such as the rationals or the reals can be substituted for the integers in this example.  The nonnegative portion of any of these examples is an example provided ''min'' and ''max'' are interchanged and &amp;minus; is replaced by [[monus]], defined (in this case) so that ''x''-''y'' = 0 when ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and otherwise is ordinary subtraction.

A more general class of examples is given by the [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of all [[binary relations]] on a set ''X'',  namely the power set of ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, made a residuated lattice by taking the monoid multiplication • to be composition of relations and the monoid unit to be the identity relation '''I''' on ''X'' consisting of all pairs (''x'',''x'') for ''x'' in ''X''.  Given two relations ''R'' and ''S'' on ''X'', the right residual ''R''\''S'' of ''S'' by ''R'' is the binary relation such that ''x''(''R''\''S'')''y'' holds just when for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''zRx'' implies ''zSy'' (notice the connection with implication).  The left residual is the mirror image of this: ''y''(''S''/''R'')''x'' holds just when for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''xRz'' implies ''ySz''.

This can be illustrated with the binary relations &lt; and &gt; on {0,1} in which 0 &lt; 1 and 1 &gt; 0 are the only relationships that hold.  Then ''x''(&gt;\&lt;)''y'' holds just when ''x'' = 1, while ''x''(&lt;/&gt;)''y'' holds just when ''y'' = 0, showing that residuation of &lt; by &gt; is different depending on whether we residuate on the right or the left.  This difference is a consequence of the difference between &lt;•&gt; and &gt;•&lt;, where the only relationships that hold are 0(&lt;•&gt;)0 (since 0&lt;1&gt;0) and 1(&gt;•&lt;)1 (since 1&gt;0&lt;1).  Had we chosen ≤ and ≥ instead of &lt; and &gt;, ≥\≤ and ≤/≥ would have been the same because ≤•≥ = ≥•≤, both of which always hold between all ''x'' and ''y'' (since ''x''≤1≥''y'' and ''x''≥0≤''y'').

The Boolean algebra 2&lt;sup&gt;Σ*&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[formal language]]s over an alphabet (set) Σ forms a residuated lattice whose monoid multiplication is language concatenation ''LM'' and whose monoid unit '''I''' is the language {ε} consisting of just the empty string ε.  The right residual ''M''\''L'' consists of all words ''w'' over Σ such that ''Mw'' ⊆ ''L''.  The left residual ''L''/''M'' is the same with ''wM'' in place of ''Mw''.

The residuated lattice of all binary relations on ''X'' is finite just when ''X'' is finite, and commutative just when ''X'' has at most one element.  When ''X'' is empty the algebra is the degenerate Boolean algebra in which 0 = 1 = '''I'''.  The residuated lattice of all languages on Σ is commutative just when Σ has at most one letter.  It is finite just when Σ is empty, consisting of the two languages 0 (the empty language {}) and the monoid unit '''I''' = {ε} = 1.

The examples forming a Boolean algebra have special properties treated in the article on [[residuated Boolean algebra]]s.

In [[natural language]] residuated lattices formalize the logic of "and" when used with its noncommutative meaning of "and then."  Setting ''x'' = ''bet'', ''y'' = ''win'', ''z'' = ''rich'', we can read ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' as "bet and then win entails rich."  By the axioms this is equivalent to ''y'' ≤ ''x''→''z'' meaning "win entails had bet then rich", and also to ''x'' ≤ ''z''←''y'' meaning "bet entails if-ever win then rich."  Humans readily detect such non-sequiturs as "bet entails had win then rich" and "win entails if-ever bet then rich" as both being equivalent to the wishful thinking "win and then bet entails rich."  Humans do not so readily detect that [[Peirce's law]] ((''P''→''Q'')→''P'')→''P'' is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], an interesting situation where humans exhibit more proficiency with nonclassical reasoning than classical.

==Residuated semilattice==
A '''residuated semilattice''' is defined almost identically for residuated lattices, omitting just the meet operation &amp;and;.  Thus it is an [[algebraic structure]] L = (L, ∨, •, 1, /, \) satisfying all the residuated lattice equations as specified above except those containing an occurrence of the symbol &amp;and;.  The option of defining ''x'' ≤ ''y'' as ''x''&amp;and;''y'' = ''x'' is then not available, leaving only the other option ''x''&amp;or;''y'' = ''y'' (or any equivalent thereof).

Any residuated lattice can be made a residuated semilattice simply by omitting &amp;and;.  Residuated semilattices arise in connection with [[action algebra]]s, which are residuated semilattices that are also [[Kleene algebra]]s, for which &amp;and; is ordinarily not required.

== Secret law in the United States ==

Since about 2015 the branches of the United States federal government have accused one another of creating secret law.  Journalists, scholars, and anti-secrecy activists have also made similar allegations.  Scholarly analysis has shown that secret law is present in all three branches.  One scholar, Professor Dakota Rudesill, recommends that the country affirmatively decide whether to tolerate secret law, and proposes principles for governing it, including: public law’s supremacy over secret law; no secret criminal law; public notification of creation of secret law; presumptive sunset and publication dates; and availability of all secret law to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudesill|first1=Dakota|title=Coming to Terms With Secret Law|journal=Harvard National Security Journal|date=2015|volume=7|issue=1|pages=241–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =The new era secret law | work = | date =18 October 2016 | url = https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/new-era-secret-law| accessdate = 15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret regulations in UK public places==
In Britain many open places freely accessible by the public are actually [[privately owned public space]]s (POPS). Information on ownership is considered confidential, and not provided either by the owners, or by [[Local government in England|local councils]] that have the information. As in any private property the owner may require visitors to abide by specified rules; but people freely accessing the place are not informed of the rules, which may nevertheless be enforced by security guards. Typical prohibitions which do not apply to genuinely public spaces include protesting, and photography.

Councils mostly refused to provide information on existing and planned pseudo-public spaces. They also refused to say how information could be obtained, or to provide information on private restrictions on exercising the other rights people have on genuinely public land. Councils were criticised for being under the influence of property developers and corporate owners. A member of the London Assembly said "Being able to know what rules you are being governed by, and how to challenge them, is a fundamental part of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/sep/26/its-really-shocking-uk-cities-refusing-to-reveal-extent-of-pseudo-public-space#comment-105829422 |title='It's really shocking': UK cities refusing to reveal extent of pseudo-public space |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 September 2017  |author= |accessdate= 26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''self-regulatory organization''' ('''SRO''') is an organization that exercises some degree of regulatory authority over an industry or profession. The regulatory authority could exist in place of government regulation, or applied in addition to government regulation.  The ability of an SRO to exercise regulatory authority does not necessarily derive from a grant of authority from the government.

In United States securities law, a self-regulatory organization is a defined term. The principal federal regulatory authority—the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC)—was established by the Federal [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].  The SEC originally delegated authority to the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]] and to the [[List of stock exchanges#United States of America|national stock exchanges]] (e.g., the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]]) to enforce certain industry standards and requirements related to securities trading and brokerage. On July 26, 2007 the SEC approved a merger of the enforcement arms of the NYSE and the NASD, to form a new SRO, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  In addition, Congress created the [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB) as an SRO charged with adopting investor protection rules governing broker-dealers and banks that underwrite, trade and sell tax-exempt bonds, 529 college savings plans and other types of municipal securities.

The [[American Arbitration Association]] is also an SRO with official, statutory status.

Because of the prominence of the SROs in the securities industry, the term SRO is often used too narrowly to describe an organization authorized by statute or government agency to exercise control over a certain aspect of the industry.

The [[National Association of Realtors]] (NAR) is an example of an SRO that fills the vacuum left by the absence of government oversight or regulation.  The NAR sets the rules for [[multiple listing service]]s and how brokers use them.  Another example is the [[American Medical Association]] which sets rules for ethics, conflicts, disciplinary action, and accreditation in medicine.

'''Semiotics''' (also called '''semiotic studies''') is the study of [[sign process]] ([[semiosis]]). It is not to be confused with the [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] tradition called [[Ferdinand de Saussure#Semiology|semiology]], which is a subset of semiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.joensuu.fi/~whamalai/skc/semiology.html|title=Semiology vs. semiotics|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The science of communication studied through the interpretation of signs and symbols as they operate in various fields, esp. language", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotics includes the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, [[analogy]], [[allegory]], [[metonymy]], [[metaphor]], [[symbol]]ism, signification, and communication.

The semiotic tradition explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications. Different from linguistics, semiotics also studies non-linguistic [[sign system]]s.

Semiotics is frequently seen as having important [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] dimensions; for example, the Italian semiotician and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication.&lt;ref name=caesar&gt;{{cite book |last= Caesar |first= Michael |title= ''Umberto Eco: Philosophy, Semiotics, and the Work of Fiction'' |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |year= 1999 |isbn= 978-0-7456-0850-1 |page= 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some semioticians focus on the [[logic]]al dimensions of the science, however. They examine areas belonging also to the [[life sciences]]—such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic [[ecological niche|niche]] in the world (see [[semiosis]]). In general, semiotic theories take ''signs'' or sign systems as their object of study: the communication of information in living organisms is covered in [[biosemiotics]] (including [[zoosemiotics]]).

==Terminology==
The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σημειωτικός ''sēmeiōtikos'', "observant of signs"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dshmeiwtiko%2Fs σημειωτικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; (from σημεῖον ''sēmeion'', "a sign, a mark")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dshmei%3Don σημεῖον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and it was first used in English prior to 1676 by [[Henry Stubbes]]&lt;ref&gt;Stubbes, H.,''The Plus Ultra reduced to a Non Plus'' ... (London, England, 1670), page 75: "... nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick, but an exact knowledge of medicinal phisiology (founded on observation, not principles), '''semeiotics''', method of curing, and tried (not excogitated, not commanding) medicines ...."&lt;/ref&gt; (spelt ''semeiotics'') in a very precise sense to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs.&lt;ref&gt;"The branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of symptoms", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Greeks, "signs" occurred in the world of nature, "symbols" in the world of culture. Not until [[Augustine of Hippo]] would a thematic proposal for uniting the two under the notion of "sign" (''signum'') as transcending the nature-culture divide and identifying symbols as no more than a species (or sub-species) of ''signum'' be formally proposed. See the monograph study on this question, ''Le teorie del segno nell'antichità classica'' by Giovanni Manetti (Milan: Bompiani, 1987); trans. by Christine Richardson as ''Theories of the Sign in Classical Antiquity'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1993). Classic also is the article by Luigi Romeo, "The Derivation of 'Semiotics' through the History of the Discipline", in ''Semiosis'' 6, Heft 2 (1977), 37–49. See also Andrew LaVelle's discussion of Romeo on Peirce-l at [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.science.philosophy.peirce/3252].&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] used the term ''sem(e)iotike'' in book four, chapter 21 of ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/semiotics|title=semiotics {{!}} study of signs|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Locke used  the Greek word σημιωτική{{sic}}&lt;!--ι, not ει--&gt; in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=hGeKsjjtu6EC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s 4th ed. of 1700] (p. 437) of his ''Essay concerning Human Understanding''. He notably writes both (a) "σημιωτικὴ"&lt;!--non-capitalized first letter and featuring a grave-accented last vowel; see p. 437 (main text)--&gt; and (b) "Σημιωτική"&lt;!--capitalized first letter and featuring an acute-accented last vowel; see p. 437 (margins)--&gt;—when term (a) is followed by any kind of punctuation mark, it takes the form (b); see ''[[Ancient Greek accent]]''. The 1689/1690 first edition of Locke's ''Essay concerning Human Understanding'', in the concluding "Division of the Sciences" chapter, Locke introduces, in §4, "σημιωτική" as his proposed name synonymous with "''the Doctrine of Signs''" for the development of the future study of the ubiquitous role of signs within human awareness. In the 1689–1690 original edition, the "Division of the Sciences" chapter was Chapter XX. In the 4th ed. of 1700, a new Chapter XIX "Of Enthusiasm" is inserted into Book IV, after which the Chapter XX of the 1st ed. becomes Chapter XXI for all subsequent editions.&amp;nbsp;— see in John Deely, ''Why Semiotics?'' (Ottawa: Legas, 2004), 71–88, esp. 77–80 for the editions of Locke's ''Essay'' from 1689 through 1716. It is an important fact that Locke's proposal for the development of semiotics, with three passing exceptions as "asides" in the writings of [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Leibniz]], and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], "is met with a resounding silence that lasts as long as modernity itself. Even Locke's devoted late modern editor, [[Alexander Campbell Fraser]], dismisses out of hand 'this crude and superficial scheme of Locke'" (see "Locke's modest proposal subversive of the way of ideas, its reception, and its bearing on the resolution of an ancient and a modern controversy in logic" in Chap. 14 of Deely's ''Four Ages of Understanding'', pp. 591–606). In the 1975 Oxford University Press critical edition, prepared and introduced by Peter Harold Nidditch, Nidditch tells us, in his "Foreword", p. vii, that he presents us with "a complete, critically established, and unmodernized text that aims at being historically faithful to Locke's final intentions"; p. xxv tells us further that "the present text is based on the original fourth edition of the ''Essay''", and that "readings in the other early authorized editions are adopted, in appropriate form, where necessary, and recorded otherwise in the textual notes". The term "σημιωτική" appears in that 1700 4th edition, the last published (but not the last prepared) within Locke's lifetime, with exactly the spelling and final accent found in the 1689/1690 1st edition. Yet if we turn to (the final) chapter XXI of the 1975 Oxford edition, we find on p. 720 not "σημιωτικὴ" but rather do we find substituted the "σημειωτικὴ" spelling (and with final accent reversed). (Note that in [[Greek orthography|Modern Greek]] and in [[Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching|some systems for pronouncing classical Greek]], "σημ'''ι'''ωτική" and "σημ'''ει'''ωτική" are pronounced the same.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prior to Locke, the notion of "sign" as transcending the nature/culture divide was introduced by [[Augustine of Hippo]]—see John Deely, ''Augustine &amp; Poinsot: The Protosemiotic Development'' (Scranton: University of Scranton Press, 2009) for full details of Augustine's originality on this point—a specialized study was firmly established. Himself a man of [[medicine]], Locke was familiar with this "semeiotics" as naming a specialized branch within medical science. In his personal library were two editions of Scapula's 1579 abridgement of [[Henri Estienne|Henricus Stephanus]]' ''Thesaurus Graecae Linguae'', which listed σημειωτική as the name for "diagnostics", the branch of medicine concerned with interpreting symptoms of disease ("[[symptomatology]]"). Indeed the English physician and scholar [[Henry Stubbes]] had transliterated this term of specialized science into English precisely as "semeiotic" in his 1670 work, ''The Plus Ultra Reduced to a Non Plus'' (p.&amp;nbsp;75).&lt;/ref&gt; Here he explains how science may be divided into three parts:

{{quote|All that can fall within the compass of human understanding, being either, first, the nature of things, as they are in themselves, their relations, and their manner of operation: or, secondly, that which man himself ought to do, as a rational and voluntary agent, for the attainment of any end, especially happiness: or, thirdly, the ways and means whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these is attained and communicated; I think science may be divided properly into these three sorts.|Locke, 1823/1963, p. 174}}

[[John Locke|Locke]] then elaborates on the nature of this third category, naming it Σημειωτική (''Semeiotike'') and explaining it as "the doctrine of signs" in the following terms:

{{quote|Nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick,&lt;ref&gt;A now-obsolete term for the art or profession of curing disease with (herbal) medicines or (chemical) drugs; especially [[purgative]]s or [[cathartic]]s. Also, it specifically refers to the treatment of humans.&lt;/ref&gt; but an exact knowledge of medicinal physiology (founded on observation, not principles), semiotics, method of curing, and tried (not excogitated,&lt;ref&gt;That is, "thought out", "contrived", or "devised" (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; not commanding) medicines.|Locke, 1823/1963, 4.21.4, p. 175}}

In the nineteenth century, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] defined what he termed "semiotic" (which he sometimes spelled as "semeiotic") as the "quasi-necessary, or formal doctrine of signs", which abstracts "what must be the characters of all signs used by&amp;nbsp;... an intelligence capable of learning by experience",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', vol. 2, paragraph 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and which is philosophical logic pursued in terms of signs and sign processes.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1902), "Logic, Considered as Semeiotic", Manuscript L75, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/l75.htm transcription] at ''Arisbe: The Peirce Gateway'', and, in particular, its "On the Definition of Logic" (Memoir 12), [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m12 transcription] at ''Arisbe''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peircean semiotic is triadic (sign, object, interpretant), as opposed to the dyadic Saussurian tradition (signifier, signified), and is conceived of as philosophical logic studied in terms of signs that are not always linguistic or artificial, and sign processes, modes of inference, and the inquiry process in general, with emphases not only on symbols but also on signs that are semblances ("icons") and signs that are signs by being factually connected ("indices") to their objects.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peirce scholar and editor Max H. Fisch&lt;ref&gt;Max Fisch compiled Peirce-related bibliographical supplements in 1952, 1964, 1966, 1974; was consulting editor on the 1977 microfilm of Peirce's published works and on the ''Comprehensive Bibliography'' associated with it; was among the main editors of the first five volumes (published 1981–1993) ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce''; and wrote a number of published articles on Peirce, many collected in 1986 in ''Peirce, Semeiotic, and Pragmatism'', Ketner and Kloesel, eds., Indiana University Press: [http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=19748 catalog page], Bloomington, IN, 480 pages. See [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography]].&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1978&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Max H. (1978), "Peirce's General Theory of Signs" in ''Sight, Sound, and Sense'', ed. T. A. Sebeok. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 31–70.&lt;/ref&gt; that "semeiotic" was Peirce's own preferred rendering of Locke's σημιωτική.

[[Charles W. Morris]] followed Peirce in using the term "semiotic" and in extending the discipline beyond human communication to animal learning and use of signals.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], however, founded his semiotics, which he called [[Ferdinand de Saussure#Semiology|semiology]], in the social sciences:

{{quote|It is... possible to conceive of a science which studies the role of signs as part of social life. It would form part of social psychology, and hence of general psychology. We shall call it semiology (from the Greek ''semeîon'', 'sign'). It would investigate the nature of signs and the laws governing them. Since it does not yet exist, one cannot say for certain that it will exist. But it has a right to exist, a place ready for it in advance. Linguistics is only one branch of this general science. The laws which semiology will discover will be laws applicable in linguistics, and linguistics will thus be assigned to a clearly defined place in the field of human knowledge. |Cited in [[Daniel Chandler|Chandler's]] "Semiotics for Beginners", Introduction.}}

While the Saussurean semiotic is dyadic (sign/syntax, signal/semantics), the Peircean semiotic is triadic (sign, object, interpretant), being conceived as philosophical logic studied in terms of signs that are not always linguistic or artificial. The Peircean semiotic addresses not only the external communication mechanism, as per Saussure, but the internal representation machine, investigating not just sign processes, or modes of inference, but the whole inquiry process in general. Peircean semiotics further subdivides each of the three triadic elements into three sub-types. For example, signs can be icons, indices, and symbols.

[[Yuri Lotman]] introduced Eastern Europe to semiotics and adopted Locke's coinage as the name to subtitle (''Σημειωτική'') his founding at the [[University of Tartu]] in [[Estonia]] in 1964 of the first semiotics journal, ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]''.

[[Thomas Sebeok]] assimilated "semiology" to "semiotics" as a part to a whole,&lt;ref&gt;The whole anthology, ''Frontiers in Semiotics'', was devoted to the documentation of this ''pars pro toto'' move of Sebeok.&lt;/ref&gt; and was involved in choosing the name ''Semiotica'' for the first international journal devoted to the study of signs.

Saussurean semiotics have been challenged with serious criticism, for example by [[Jacques Derrida]]'s assertion that signifier and signified are not fixed, coining the expression ''différance'', relating to the endless deferral of meaning, and to the absence of a 'transcendent signified'. For Derrida, 'il n'y a pas de hors-texte' ("there is nothing outside the text"). He was in obvious opposition to materialists and marxists who argued that a sign has to point towards a real meaning, and cannot be controlled by the referent's closed-loop references.

==History==

The importance of signs and signification has been recognized throughout much of the history of [[philosophy]], and in psychology as well. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] both explored the relationship between signs and the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem02.html|title=Semiotics for Beginners: Signs|website=visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Augustine considered the nature of the sign within a conventional system. These theories have had a lasting effect in [[Western philosophy]], especially through [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophy. (More recently, Umberto Eco, in his ''[[Umberto Eco#Semiotics|Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language]]'', has argued that semiotic theories are implicit in the work of most, perhaps all, major thinkers.)

The general study of signs that began in Latin with Augustine culminated in Latin with the 1632 ''Tractatus de Signis'' of [[John Poinsot]], and then began anew in late modernity with the attempt in 1867 by Charles Sanders Peirce to draw up a "new list of categories". Peirce aimed to base his new list directly upon experience precisely as constituted by action of signs, in contrast with the list of Aristotle's categories which aimed to articulate within experience the dimension of being that is independent of experience and knowable as such, through human understanding.

The estimative powers of animals interpret the environment as sensed to form a "meaningful world" of objects, but the objects of this world (or "Umwelt", in [[Jakob von Uexküll]]'s term,&lt;ref&gt;See "Umwelt", ''Semiotica'' 134–1/4 (2001), 125–135; Special Issue on "Jakob von Uexküll: A paradigm for biology and semiotics" Guest-Edited by Kalevi Kull.&lt;/ref&gt;) consist exclusively of objects related to the animal as desirable (+), undesirable (–), or "safe to ignore" (0).

In contrast to this, human understanding adds to the animal "Umwelt" a relation of self-identity within objects which transforms objects experienced into ''things'' as well as +, –, 0 objects.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Martin Heidegger]] (1927), in the 1962 trans. by John Macquarrie &amp; Edward Robinson, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (New York, NY: Harper &amp; Row), p. 487: "The distinction between the being of existing Dasein and the Being of entities, such as Reality, which do not have the character of Dasein...is nothing with which philosophy may tranquilize itself. It has long been known that ancient ontology works with 'Thing-concepts' and that there is a danger of 'reifying consciousness'. But what does this 'reifying' signify? Where does it arise? Why does Being get 'conceived' 'proximally' in terms of the present-at-hand ''and not'' in terms of the ready-to-hand, which indeed lies ''closer'' to us? ''Why'' does reifying always keep coming back to exercise its dominion?" This is the question that the Umwelt/Lebenswelt distinction as here drawn answers to.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the generically animal objective world as "Umwelt", becomes a species-specifically human objective world or "Lebenswelt" (life-world), wherein linguistic communication, rooted in the biologically underdetermined "Innenwelt" (inner-world) of humans, makes possible the further dimension of cultural organization within the otherwise merely social organization of non-human animals whose powers of observation may deal only with directly sensible instances of objectivity. This further point, that human culture depends upon language understood first of all not as communication, but as the biologically underdetermined aspect or feature of the human animal's "Innenwelt", was originally clearly identified by Thomas A. Sebeok.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Sebeok, "The Evolution of Communication and the Origin of Language", lecture in the 1984 June 1–3 International Summer Institute for Semiotic and Structural Studies 1984 Colloquium on "Phylogeny and Ontogeny of Communication Systems", published under the title "Communication, Language, and Speech. Evolutionary Considerations", in Sebeok's ''I Think I Am A Verb. More Contributions to the Doctrine of Signs'' (New York: Plenum Press, 1986), pp. 10–16. For subsequent context, see the "Afterword" to the volume of Sebeok's ''Semiotic Prologues'', ed. John Deely and Marcel Danesi (Ottawa, Canada: Legas, 2012), pp. 365–383; version online at [http://www.augustoponzio.com/files/12._Deely.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Sebeok also played the central role in bringing Peirce's work to the center of the semiotic stage in the twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Detailed demonstration of Sebeok's role of the global emergence of semiotics is recorded in at least three recent volumes. (1) ''Semiotics Seen Synchronically. The View from 2010'' (Ottawa: Legas, 2010). (2) ''Semiotics Continues To Astonish. Thomas A. Sebeok and the Doctrine of Signs'' (Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2011)—a 526-page assemblage of essays, vignettes, letters, pictures attesting to the depth and extent of Sebeok's promotion of semiotic understanding around the world, including his involvement with Juri Lotman and the Tartu University graduate program in semiotics (currently directed by P. Torop, M. Lotman and K. Kull). (3) Sebeok's ''Semiotic Prologues'' (Ottawa: Legas, 2012)—a volume which gathers together in Part I all the "prologues" (i.e., introductions, prefaces, forewords, etc.) that Sebeok wrote for other peoples' books, then in Part 2 all the "prologues" that other people wrote for Sebeok.&lt;/ref&gt; first with his expansion of the human use of signs ("anthroposemiosis") to include also the generically animal sign-usage ("zoösemiosis"),&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas A. Sebeok, "Communication in Animals and Men", review article covering three books: Martin Lindauer, ''Communication among Social Bees'' (Harvard Books in Biology, No. 2; Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1961, pp. ix + 143); Winthrop N. Kellogg, Porpoises and Sonar (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1961, pp. xiv + 177); and John C. Lilly, ''Man and Dolphin'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday), in ''Language'' 39 (1963), 448–466.&lt;/ref&gt; then with his further expansion of semiosis (based initially on the work of Martin Krampen,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Krampen, "Phytosemiotics", ''Semiotica'', 36.3/4 (1981), 187–209.&lt;/ref&gt; but taking advantage of Peirce's point that an interpretant, as the third item within a sign relation, "need not be mental"&lt;ref&gt;Peirce c. 1907: Excerpt from "Pragmatism (Editor [3])", published under the title "A Survey of Pragmaticism" in ''The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', Vol. 5, ed. Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1934), 5.473. See also the part of Peirce's letter of to Lady Welby dated 23 December 1908, in ''Semiotic and Significs: The Correspondence between C.&amp;nbsp;S. Peirce and Victoria Lady Welby'', ed. Charles S. Hardwick with the assistance of James Cook (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1977), pp. 73–86. And "Semiosis: The Subject Matter of Semiotic Inquiry", Chap. 3 of ''Basics of Semiotics'' by John Deely (5th ed.: Tartu, Estonia: Tartu University Press, 2009), 26–50, esp. 31 &amp; 38– 41).&lt;/ref&gt;) to include the vegetative world ("phytosemiosis").

Peirce's distinguished between the interpretant and the interpreter. The interpretant is the internal, mental representation that mediates between the object and its sign. The interpreter is the human who is creating the interpretant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://courses.logos.it/EN/2_18.html|title=LOGOS - Multilingual Translation Portal|website=courses.logos.it|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce's "interpretant" notion opened the way to understanding an action of signs beyond the realm of animal life (study of "phytosemiosis" + "zoösemiosis" + "anthroposemiosis" = ''biosemiotics''), which was his first advance beyond Latin Age semiotics. Other early theorists in the field of semiotics include [[Charles W. Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;1971, orig. 1938, ''Writings on the general theory of signs'', Mouton, The Hague, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Black]] argued that the work of [[Bertrand Russell]] was seminal in the field.&lt;ref&gt;1944, Black M. ''The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell'', [[Library of Living Philosophers]], vol. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulations==
[[File:Kstovo-BusStation-Sinks-1444.JPG|thumb|[[Color code|Color-coding]] hot- and cold-water faucets (taps) is common in many cultures but, as this example shows, the coding may be rendered meaningless because of context. The two faucets (taps) probably were sold as a coded set, but the code is unusable (and ignored), as there is a single water supply.]]
Semioticians classify signs or sign systems in relation to the way they are transmitted (see [[modality (semiotics)|modality]]). This process of carrying meaning depends on the use of [[code (semiotics)|codes]] that may be the individual sounds or letters that humans use to form words, the body movements they make to show attitude or emotion, or even something as general as the clothes they wear. To [[neologism|coin]] a word to refer to a ''thing'' (see [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] words), the [[community]] must agree on a simple meaning (a [[denotation (semiotics)|denotative]] meaning) within their language, but that word can transmit that meaning only within the language's grammatical structures and codes (see [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]). Codes also represent the [[value (semiotics)|values]] of the [[culture]], and are able to add new shades of [[connotation (semiotics)|connotation]] to every aspect of life.

To explain the relationship between semiotics and [[communication studies]], [[communication]] is defined as the process of transferring data and-or meaning from a source to a receiver. Hence, communication theorists construct models based on codes, media, and contexts to explain the [[biology]], [[psychology]], and [[mechanics]] involved. Both disciplines recognize that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the receiver must [[decode (semiotics)|decode]] the data, i.e., be able to distinguish the data as [[Salience (semiotics)|salient]], and make meaning out of it. This implies that there is a necessary overlap between semiotics and communication. Indeed, many of the concepts are shared, although in each field the emphasis is different. In ''Messages and Meanings: An Introduction to Semiotics'', [[Marcel Danesi]] (1994) suggested that semioticians' priorities were to study [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] first, and communication second. A more extreme view is offered by [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1987; trans. 1990: 16), who, as a [[musicology|musicologist]], considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to his application of semiotics.

Semiotics differs from [[linguistics]] in that it generalizes the definition of a sign to encompass signs in any medium or sensory modality. Thus it broadens the range of sign systems and sign relations, and extends the definition of language in what amounts to its widest analogical or metaphorical sense. Peirce's definition of the term "semiotic" as the study of necessary features of signs also has the effect of distinguishing the discipline from linguistics as the study of contingent features that the world's languages happen to have acquired in the course of their evolutions. From a subjective standpoint, perhaps more difficult is the distinction between semiotics and the [[philosophy of language]]. In a sense, the difference lies between separate traditions rather than subjects. Different authors have called themselves "philosopher of language" or "semiotician". This difference does ''not'' match the separation between [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. On a closer look, there may be found some differences regarding subjects. Philosophy of language pays more attention to [[natural language]]s or to languages in general, while semiotics is deeply concerned with non-linguistic signification. Philosophy of language also bears connections to linguistics, while semiotics might appear closer to some of the [[humanities]] (including [[literary theory]]) and to [[cultural anthropology]].

Semiosis or ''semeiosis'' is the process that forms meaning from any organism's apprehension of the world through signs. Scholars who have talked about semiosis in their subtheories of semiotics include [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.&amp;nbsp;S. Peirce]], [[John Deely]], and [[Umberto Eco]]. Cognitive semiotics is combining methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with providing new information into human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices. The research on cognitive semiotics brings together semiotics from linguistics, cognitive science, and related disciplines on a common meta-theoretical platform of concepts, methods, and shared data.

[[Cognitive semiotics]] may also be seen as the study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences. This involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations. Cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the Center for Semiotics at [[Aarhus University]] ([[Denmark]]), with an important connection with the Center of Functionally Integrated Neuroscience (CFIN) at Aarhus Hospital. Amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are [[Per Aage Brandt]], Svend Østergaard, Peer Bundgård, Frederik Stjernfelt, Mikkel Wallentin, Kristian Tylén, Riccardo Fusaroli, and Jordan Zlatev. Zlatev later in co-operation with Göran Sonesson established CCS (Center for Cognitive Semiotics) at [[Lund University]], Sweden.

==Notable semioticians==
* [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914), a [[History of logic|noted logician]] who founded philosophical [[pragmatism]], defined ''semiosis'' as an irreducibly triadic process wherein something, as an object, logically determines or influences something as a sign to determine or influence something as an interpretation or ''interpretant'', itself a sign, thus leading to further interpretants.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of signs and semiosis, see under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/sign.html Sign]" and "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/semiosis.html Semiosis, semeiosy]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''; and "[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/access.htm 76 definitions of sign by C.&amp;nbsp;S. Peirce]" collected by Robert Marty. Peirce's "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/ep/ep2/ep2book/ch02/ep2ch2.htm What Is a Sign]" (MS 404 of 1894, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 4–10) provides intuitive help.&lt;/ref&gt; Semiosis is logically structured to perpetuate itself. The object may be quality, fact, rule, or even fictional ([[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]), and may be "immediate" to the sign, the object as represented in the sign, or "dynamic", the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. The interpretant may be "immediate" to the sign, all that the sign immediately expresses, such as a word's usual meaning; or "dynamic", such as a state of agitation; or "final" or "normal", the ultimate ramifications of the sign about its object, to which inquiry taken far enough would be destined and with which any interpretant, at most, may coincide.&lt;ref&gt;See Peirce, excerpt from a letter to William James, March 14, 1909, ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraph 314. Also see under relevant entries in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''. On coincidence of actual opinion with final opinion, see MS 218, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/logic/ms218.htm transcription] at ''Arisbe'', and appearing in ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 3, p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''semiotic''&lt;ref&gt;He spelt it "semiotic" and "semeiotic". See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/semeiotic.html Semeiotic] [etc.] in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; covered not only artificial, linguistic, and symbolic signs, but also semblances such as kindred sensible qualities, and indices such as reactions. He came c.&amp;nbsp;1903&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 243–263, written c.&amp;nbsp;1903.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|classify any sign]] by three interdependent trichotomies, intersecting to form ten (rather than 27) classes of sign.&lt;ref&gt;He worked on but did not perfect a finer-grained system of ten trichotomies, to be combined into 66 ([[Triangular number|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;]]) classes of sign. That raised for Peirce 59,049 classificatory questions (59,049 = 3&lt;SUP&gt;10&lt;/SUP&gt;, or 3 to the 10th power). See p. 482 in "Excerpts from Letters to Lady Welby", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Signs also enter into various kinds of meaningful combinations; Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his speculative grammar. He regarded formal semiotic as logic ''per se'' and part of philosophy; as also encompassing study of arguments ([[Abductive reasoning|hypothetical]], [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) and inquiry's methods including pragmatism; and as allied to, but distinct from logic's pure mathematics. In addition to pragmatism, Peirce provided a definition of the term "sign" as:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign. That sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the first sign. The sign stands for something, its object not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea." Peirce called the sign a ''representamen'', in order to bring out the fact that a sign is something that "represents" something else in order to suggest it (that is, "re-present" it) in some way.&lt;ref name="CREDO Reference"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Hoboken, NJ, USA|isbn=978-1-4051-8312-3|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/wileylitcul/semiotics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a summary of Peirce's contributions to semiotics, see Liszka (1996) or Atkin (2006).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913), the "father" of modern [[linguistics]], proposed a dualistic notion of signs, relating the ''signifier'' as the form of the word or phrase uttered, to the ''signified'' as the mental concept. According to Saussure, the sign is completely arbitrary—i.e., there is no necessary connection between the sign and its meaning. This sets him apart from previous philosophers, such as [[Plato]] or the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]], who thought that there must be some connection between a signifier and the object it signifies. In his ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'', Saussure credits the American linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]] (1827–1894) with insisting on the arbitrary nature of the sign. Saussure's insistence on the arbitrariness of the sign also has influenced later philosophers and theorists such as Jacques Derrida, [[Roland Barthes]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. Ferdinand de Saussure coined the term ''sémiologie'' while teaching his landmark "Course on General Linguistics" at the [[University of Geneva]] from 1906 to 1911. Saussure posited that no word is inherently meaningful. Rather a word is only a "signifier", i.e., the representation of something, and it must be combined in the brain with the "signified", or the thing itself, in order to form a meaning-imbued "sign". Saussure believed that dismantling signs was a real science, for in doing so we come to an empirical understanding of how humans synthesize physical stimuli into words and other abstract concepts.
* [[Jakob von Uexküll]] (1864–1944) studied the [[sign process]]es in animals. He used the German word for "environment", ''[[umwelt]]'', to describe the individual's subjective world, and he invented the concept of [[functional circle]] (''funktionskreis'') as a general model of sign processes. In his ''Theory of Meaning'' (''Bedeutungslehre'', 1940), he described the semiotic approach to [[biology]], thus establishing the field that now is called [[biosemiotics]].
* [[Valentin Voloshinov]] (1895–1936) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-Russian linguist, whose work has been influential in the field of [[literary theory]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Ideology|theory of ideology]]. Written in the late 1920s in the USSR, Voloshinov's ''Marxism and the Philosophy of Language'' (tr.: Marksizm i Filosofiya Yazyka) developed a counter-Saussurean linguistics, which situated language use in social process rather than in an entirely decontexualized Saussurean ''langue''.
* [[Louis Hjelmslev]] (1899–1965) developed a formalist approach to Saussure's structuralist theories. His best known work is ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'', which was expanded in ''Résumé of the Theory of Language'', a formal development of ''glossematics'', his scientific calculus of language.
* [[Charles W. Morris]] (1901–1979). In his 1938 ''Foundations of the Theory of Signs'', he defined semiotics as grouped into three branches:
*# Semantics: relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their signified denotata, or meaning
*# Syntactics/Syntax: relations among or between signs in formal structures
*# Pragmatics: relation between signs and sign-using agents or interpreters
&lt;blockquote&gt;Syntactics is the Morris'ean branch of semiotics that deals with the formal properties of signs and symbols; the interrelation of the signs, without regard to meaning. Semantics deals with the relation of signs to their designata and the objects that they may or do denote; the relation between the signs and the objects to which they apply. Finally, pragmatics deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, with all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena that occur in the functioning of signs; the relation between the sign system and its human (or animal) user. Unlike his mentor [[George Herbert Mead]], Morris was a behaviorist and sympathetic to the [[Vienna Circle]] [[positivism]] of his colleague, [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Morris was accused by [[John Dewey]] of misreading Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2019493 |jstor=2019493 |title=Peirce's Theory of Linguistic Signs, Thought, and Meaning |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=85 |year=1946 |last1=Dewey |first1=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Thure von Uexküll]] (1908–2004), the "father" of modern [[psychosomatic medicine]], developed a diagnostic method based on semiotic and biosemiotic analyses.
* [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980) was a French literary theorist and semiotician. He often would critique pieces of cultural material to expose how bourgeois society used them to impose its values upon others. For instance, the portrayal of wine drinking in French society as a robust and healthy habit would be a bourgeois ideal perception contradicted by certain realities (i.e. that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found semiotics useful in conducting these critiques. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were second-order signs, or connotations. A picture of a full, dark bottle is a sign, a signifier relating to a signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage—wine. However, the bourgeois take this signified and apply their own emphasis to it, making "wine" a new signifier, this time relating to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing wine. Motivations for such manipulations vary from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo. These insights brought Barthes very much in line with similar Marxist theory.
[[File:Exemple de signalement visuel du statut social chez un Cichlidé.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Signaling and communication between the ''[[Astatotilapia burtoni]]'']]
* [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]] (1917–1992) developed a structural version of semiotics named, "generative semiotics", trying to shift the focus of discipline from signs to systems of signification. His theories develop the ideas of Saussure, Hjelmslev, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].
* [[Thomas A. Sebeok]] (1920–2001), a student of Charles W. Morris, was a prolific and wide-ranging American semiotician. Although he insisted that animals are not capable of language, he expanded the purview of semiotics to include non-human signaling and communication systems, thus raising some of the issues addressed by [[philosophy of mind]] and coining the term [[zoosemiotics]]. Sebeok insisted that all communication was made possible by the relationship between an organism and the environment in which it lives. He also posed the equation between ''semiosis'' (the activity of interpreting signs) and ''life''—a view that the [[Copenhagen-Tartu biosemiotic school]] has further developed.
* [[Yuri Lotman]] (1922–1993) was the founding member of the [[Tartu]] (or Tartu-Moscow) [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School|Semiotic School]]. He developed a semiotic approach to the study of culture—[[semiotics of culture]]—and established a communication model for the study of text semiotics. He also introduced the concept of the [[semiosphere]]. Among his Moscow colleagues were [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Boris Uspensky]].
* [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] (1931–1993) pioneered the application of Saussurean semiotics to [[film theory]], applying [[syntagmatic analysis]] to scenes of films and grounding [[film semiotics]] in greater context.
* [[Eliseo Verón]] (1935–2014) developed his "Social Discourse Theory" inspired in the Peircian conception of "Semiosis".
* The Mu Group ([[Groupe µ]]) (founded 1967) developed a structural version of [[rhetorics]], and the [[visual semiotics]].
* [[Umberto Eco]] (1932–2016) was an [[Italy|Italian]] novelist, semiotician and academic. He made a wider audience aware of semiotics by various publications, most notably ''A Theory of Semiotics'' and his novel, ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', which includes (second to its plot) applied semiotic operations. His most important contributions to the field bear on interpretation, encyclopedia, and model reader. He also criticized in several works (''A theory of semiotics'', ''La struttura assente'', ''Le signe'', ''La production de signes'') the "iconism" or "iconic signs" (taken from Peirce's most famous triadic relation, based on indexes, icons, and symbols), to which he proposed four modes of sign production: recognition, ostension, replica, and invention.
* [[Paul Bouissac]] (1934–) A world renowned expert of circus studies, Bouissac is known for developing a range of semiotic interpretations of circus performances. This includes the multimodal dimensions of clowns and clowning, jugglers, and trapeze acts. He is the author of several books relating to the semiotics of the circus. Bouissac is the Series Editor for the Advances in Semiotics Series for Bloomsbury Academic. He runs the SemiotiX Bulletin which has a global readership, is a founding editor of the Public Journal of Semiotics, and was a central founding figure in the Toronto Semiotic Circle. He is Professor Emeritus of Victoria College, University of Toronto. The personal, professional, and intellectual life of Bouissac is recounted in the book, ''[[The Pleasures of Time: Two Men, A Life]]'', by his life-long partner, the sociologist Stephen Harold Riggins.
*[[Julia Kristeva]] (1941–), a student of [[Lucien Goldmann]] and Roland Barthes, Bulgarian-French semiotician, [[literary critic]], [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], [[French feminist|feminist]], and [[novelist]]. She uses psychoanalytical concepts together with the semiotics, distinguishing the two components in the signification, the symbolic and the semiotic''.'' Kristeva also studies the representation of women and women's bodies in popular culture, such as [[Misogyny in horror films|slasher films]] and has had a remarkable influence on feminism and feminist literary studies.

==Semiotics of dreaming==

The flexibility of human semiotics is well demonstrated in dreams. [[Sigmund Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1900) ''The Interpretation of Dreams.'' London: Hogarth&lt;/ref&gt; spelled out how meaning in dreams rests on a blend of images, affects, sounds, words, and kinesthetic sensations. In his chapter on "The Means of Representation" he showed how the most abstract sorts of meaning and logical relations can be represented by spatial relations. Two images in sequence may indicate "if this, then that" or "despite this, that". Freud thought the dream started with "dream thoughts" which were like logical, verbal sentences. He believed that the dream thought was in the nature of a taboo wish that would awaken the dreamer. In order to safeguard sleep, the mindbrain converts and disguises the verbal dream thought into an imagistic form, through processes he called the "dream-work".

==Current applications==
[[File:Chart Semiotics of Social Networking.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Chart [[semiotics of social networking]]]]
Applications of semiotics include:
*It represents a [[methodology]] for the analysis of "texts" regardless of [[modality (Semiotics)|the medium in which it is presented]]. For these purposes, "text" is any message preserved in a form whose existence is independent of both sender and receiver;
*It may improve [[ergonomic]] design in situations where it is important to ensure that human beings are able to interact more effectively with their environments, whether it be on a large scale, as in [[architecture]], or on a small scale, such as the configuration of instrumentation for human use.

In some countries, its role is limited to [[literary criticism]] and an appreciation of audio and visual media. This narrow focus may inhibit a more general study of the social and political forces shaping how different media are used and their dynamic status within modern culture. Issues of technological [[determinism]] in the choice of media and the design of communication strategies assume new importance in this age of mass media.

Publication of research is both in dedicated journals such as ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'', established by [[Yuri Lotman]] and published by [[Tartu University Press]]; ''[[Semiotica]]'', founded by [[Thomas A. Sebeok]] and published by [[Mouton de Gruyter]]; ''Zeitschrift für Semiotik''; ''European Journal of Semiotics''; ''[[Versus (journal)|Versus]]'' (founded and directed by [[Umberto Eco]]), et al.; ''[[The American Journal of Semiotics]]''; and as articles accepted in periodicals of other disciplines, especially journals oriented toward philosophy and cultural criticism.

The major semiotic book series "Semiotics, Communication, Cognition", published by [[De Gruyter Mouton]] (series editors Paul Cobley and [[Kalevi Kull]]) replaces the former "Approaches to Semiotics" (more than 120 volumes) and "Approaches to Applied Semiotics" (series editor [[Thomas A. Sebeok]]). Since 1980 the [[Semiotic Society of America]] has produced an annual conference series: ''[[Semiotics: The Proceedings of the Semiotic Society of America]]''.

[[Marketing communications|Marketing]] is another application of semiotics. Epure, Eisenstat and Dinu (2014) said, "semiotics allows for the practical distinction of persuasion from manipulation in marketing communication" (p.&amp;nbsp;592).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Epure |first1=M. |last2=Eisenstat |first2=E. |last3=Dinu |first3=C. |year=2014 |title=Semiotics And Persuasion In Marketing Communication |journal=Linguistic &amp; Philosophical Investigations |volume=13 |pages=592–605 |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=30143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotics are used in marketing as a [[Marketing strategy|persuasive device]] to influence buyers to change their attitudes and behaviors in the market place. Two ways that Epure, Eisenstat and Dinu (2014) state that semiotics are used are:
# Surface: signs are used to create personality for the product; creativity plays its foremost role at this level.
# Underlying: the concealed meaning of the text, imagery, sounds, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Semiotics analysis is used by scholars and professional researchers as a method to interpret meanings behind symbols and how the meanings are created. Below is an example of how semiotic analysis is utilized in a research paper published in an academic journal: Educational Research and Reviews.

==Branches==
Semiotics has sprouted subfields including, but not limited to, the following:
* [[Biosemiotics]]: the study of semiotic processes at all levels of biology, or a semiotic study of living systems (e.g., [[Copenhagen–Tartu School]]).
* [[Semiotic anthropology]].
* [[Cognitive semiotics]]: the study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences. This involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations. Cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the Center for Semiotics at [[Aarhus University]] (Denmark), with an important connection with the Center of Functionally Integrated Neuroscience (CFIN) at Aarhus Hospital. Amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are [[Per Aage Brandt]], Svend Østergaard, Peer Bundgård, Frederik Stjernfelt, Mikkel Wallentin, Kristian Tylén, Riccardo Fusaroli, and Jordan Zlatev. Zlatev later in co-operation with Göran Sonesson established the Center for Cognitive Semiotics (CCS) at [[Lund University]], Sweden.

===Pictorial semiotics===
Pictorial semiotics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pictorial Semiotics|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100326357|website=Oxford Index|publisher=Oxford University Press, n.d. Web.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is intimately connected to art history and theory. It goes beyond them both in at least one fundamental way, however. While [[art history]] has limited its visual analysis to a small number of pictures that qualify as "works of art", pictorial semiotics focuses on the properties of pictures in a general sense, and on how the artistic conventions of images can be interpreted through pictorial codes. Pictorial codes are the way in which viewers of pictorial representations seem automatically to decipher the artistic conventions of images by being unconsciously familiar with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pictorial Codes|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100326343?rskey=TyYRDS&amp;result=6|website=Oxford Index|publisher=Oxford University Press, n.d. Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Göran Sonesson, a Swedish semiotician, pictures can be analyzed by three models: (a) the narrative model, which concentrates on the relationship between pictures and time in a chronological manner as in a comic strip; (b) the rhetoric model, which compares pictures with different devices as in a metaphor; and (c) the laokoon (or laocoon) model, which considers the limits and constraints of pictorial expressions by comparing textual mediums that utilize time with visual mediums that utilize space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonesson|first1=Göran|title=Methods and Models in Pictorial Semiotics|date=1988|pages=2–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break from traditional art history and theory—as well as from other major streams of semiotic analysis—leaves open a wide variety of possibilities for pictorial semiotics. Some influences have been drawn from phenomenological analysis, cognitive psychology, structuralist, and cognitivist linguistics, and visual anthropology and sociology.

One of the many ways that pictorial semiotics has been changing has been through the use of emojis in email, text or other online conversations. Though not seen as works of art, these small images of happy, sad, winking faces or even a smiling poo image, have made their way into our everyday communication through digital devices. In the early advances of mobile technology and the increasing manner in which such devices are used, many in the linguistic community felt that vital communication cues, such as the importance of nonverbal cues, would be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7575/aiac.alls.v.7n.6p.56 |title=Are Emojis Creating a New or Old Visual Language for New Generations? A Socio-semiotic Study |journal=Advances in Language and Literary Studies |volume=7 |issue=6 |year=2016 |pages=56–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that with the high use of these symbols would begin to oversimplify our language to where the language's strength would be lost.

However, others have said that the use of emojis in digital conversation has helped to give more clarity to a conversation. Since the ability to read another person's facial expressions, nonverbal cues or tone of voice isn’t possible in a typed message, emojis allow a communicator to convey attitudes and emotions to their message receiver. As for oversimplifying our language, some have argued that perhaps our language is not being simplified, but that new generations are revitalizing the early forms of semiotics like cave paintings or hieroglyphics. As technology advances, so will the use of emojis or possibly a more advanced form of pictorial symbols to use in digital communication.

===Globalization===
Studies have shown that semiotics may be used to make or break a [[brand]]. [[Culture code]]s strongly influence whether a population likes or dislikes a brand's marketing, especially internationally. If the company is unaware of a culture's codes, it runs the risk of failing in its marketing. [[Globalization]] has caused the development of a global consumer culture where products have similar associations, whether positive or negative, across numerous markets.&lt;ref name="Alden"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1252002 |jstor=1252002 |title=Brand Positioning Through Advertising in Asia, North America, and Europe: The Role of Global Consumer Culture |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=63 |pages=75 |year=1999 |last1=Alden |first1=Dana L |last2=Steenkamp |first2=Jan-Benedict E. M |last3=Batra |first3=Rajeev }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistranslations may lead to instances of "[[Engrish]]" or "[[Chinglish]]", terms for unintentionally humorous cross-cultural slogans intended to be understood in English. This may be caused by a sign that, in Peirce's terms, mistakenly indexes or symbolizes something in one culture, that it does not in another.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Daniel. (2001/2007). ''Semiotics: The Basics''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it creates a connotation that is culturally-bound, and that violates some culture code. Theorists who have studied humor (such as [[Schopenhauer]]) suggest that contradiction or incongruity creates absurdity and therefore, humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00913367.1997.10673526 |title=Assessing the Use and Impact of Humor on Advertising Effectiveness: A Contingency Approach |journal=Journal of Advertising |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=17 |year=1997 |last1=Spotts |first1=Harlan E |last2=Weinberger |first2=Marc G |last3=Parsons |first3=Amy L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violating a culture code creates this construct of ridiculousness for the culture that owns the code. Intentional humor also may fail cross-culturally because jokes are not on code for the receiving culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/540503 |jstor=540503 |title=Why Do They Laugh? An Interactional Approach to Humor in Traditional Iranian Improvisatory Theater: Performance and Its Effects |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=94 |issue=374 |pages=506 |year=1981 |last1=Beeman |first1=William O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of branding according to cultural code is [[Disney]]'s international [[theme park]] business. Disney fits well with [[Japan]]'s cultural code because the Japanese value "cuteness", politeness, and gift giving as part of their culture code; [[Tokyo Disneyland]] sells the most souvenirs of any Disney theme park. In contrast, [[Disneyland Paris]] failed when it launched as [[Euro Disney S.C.A.|Euro Disney]] because the company did not research the codes underlying European culture. Its storybook retelling of European folktales was taken as [[Elitism|elitist]] and insulting, and the strict appearance standards that it had for employees resulted in discrimination lawsuits in France. Disney souvenirs were perceived as cheap trinkets. The park was a financial failure because its code violated the expectations of European culture in ways that were offensive.&lt;ref name="Brannen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5465/amr.2004.14497613 |jstor=20159073 |title=When Mickey Loses Face: Recontextualization, Semantic Fit, and the Semiotics of Foreignness |journal=Academy of Management Review |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=593–616 |year=2004 |last1=Brannen |first1=Mary Yoko }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some researchers have suggested that it is possible to successfully pass a sign perceived as a cultural icon, such as the [[Coca-Cola]] or [[McDonald's]] [[logo]]s, from one culture to another. This may be accomplished if the sign is migrated from a more economically-developed to a less developed culture.&lt;ref name="Brannen" /&gt; The intentional association of a product with another culture has been called Foreign Consumer Culture Positioning (FCCP). Products also may be marketed using global trends or culture codes, for example, saving time in a busy world; but even these may be fine-tuned for specific cultures.&lt;ref name="Alden" /&gt;

Research also found that, as airline industry brandings grow and become more international, their logos become more symbolic and less iconic. The iconicity and symbolism of a sign depends on the cultural convention and, are on that ground in relation with each other. If the cultural convention has greater influence on the sign, the signs get more symbolic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1470357207081002 |title=National pride, global capital: A social semiotic analysis of transnational visual branding in the airline industry |journal=Visual Communication |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=305 |year=2016 |last1=Thurlow |first1=Crispin |last2=Aiello |first2=Giorgia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gangs and graffiti==

{{Tone|section|date=March 2018}}

Graffiti is used by gang members to mark their territory and to warn off rivals. Graffiti is a great example of semiotics and the use of symbols. Police task forces are now starting to use a programming system called GARI, they upload pictures of gang symbols that they find and it helps them to decipher the meaning of the symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hadhazy |first1=Adam |date=September 27, 2012 |title=The Graffiti Code Breaker |journal=Discover |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=14 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2012/sep/25-the-graffiti-code-breaker }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gang members use semiotics and symbols for many different reasons, for example: Government-sanctioned graffiti from the city's Department of Public Works, in red, typically indicates an abandoned building, or the stylized SS stands for South Side, a faction of the 18th Street gang based in southern Indianapolis. A rival gang sprayed red Xs over the work as a sign of disrespect.&lt;ref name=Rollins&gt;Rollins, J. (2011). The lost boyz: a dark side of graffiti. Hook, Hampshire: Waterside Press.{{page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''The Lost Boyz: A Dark Side of Graffiti'' by Justin Rollins&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; it talks about how Rollins started writing on trains at a very early age, because it helped him find himself, he was now a graffiti writer – a somebody.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; This is true with a lot of symbols. People use symbols to express themselves by getting tattoos or wearing a symbol on their clothing. This helps them to feel like they belong to something or it helps them to express themselves. Gangs also use their clothing as a symbol, they do something unique for their group so that you aware of the gang you are encountering. An example could be a certain pant leg rolled up or wearing a certain color of bandana. The book also talks about how Rollins joined a graffiti gang that was called the WK which stands for Who Kares but it also had a different meaning which was Wanted Kriminals.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; Many symbols in semiotics theory have different meanings; these meanings can be different from country to country or even just from person to person depending on where and how a person was raised. For example, in the United States, waving is a form of "hello" but in other cultures this could mean something offensive.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Semiotics is anything that can stand for something else.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt; A symbol does not stand on its own, it is a part of something, a system perhaps. Symbols in gangs are used for different things. Not just to show which gang a person is associated with but to express what has happened in their gang and in their individual lives. Gangs were first created to strengthen a certain ethnic group.&lt;ref name=Dowe&gt;Dowe, D. (2011). Gangs: Slang, Words, Symbols. Hendon Media Group, Law Enforcement Publications and Conferences. Retrieved from http://www.hendonpub.com/resources/article_archive/results/details?id=1402&lt;/ref&gt; They are very territorial. To show which territory is theirs they will mark the streets so that other gangs are aware. There are special ways to read gang signs and their tattoos: left to right, top to bottom. They may also make the tattoo or graffiti cluttered so that it is hard to read.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Each gang has special hand signals or set of signs to identify themselves. There are some gangs who add a dot or something similar to their graffiti to stand as a phrase used in their specific gang.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt; Each gang is unique and has special symbols, and these symbols usually have some sort of meaning. For example, the gang called "Bloods" use the color red in their clothing to symbolize they are a part of this specific gang. They also are known to use the number 5 and have tattoos and graffiti of a five-point crown. The hand sign that they use mostly is a "b" which stands for bloods.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Some gangs use graffiti and tattoos more than others as well as using their clothing as a symbol of their gang. Gangs will also use codes to communicate on the streets. They will oftentimes use a number that will relate to a letter of the alphabet. Depending on the gang, they may use more complex codes.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Street gangs are known for using graffiti in their neighborhoods to mark their territory. Gangs are also using their graffiti to challenge other gangs and to disrespect them.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt; When they do this, they will somehow cross the other gang's symbol, and they will use their gang slang as well. They make sure to do it in a place that is clear and will leave a direct hit on the other gang.&lt;ref name=Dowe/&gt;

Semiotics and gang graffiti merge on the undercarriage of bridges, the face of billboards, on abandoned buildings, storefronts, the sides of railroad cars, and even in inconspicuous places found along dirt roads in small rural areas. The idea, is to communicate a message. A message that is part of a system.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Griffin |editor1-first=Em |year=2014 |edition=9th |chapter=Semiotics |first1=Roland |last1=Barthes |title=A First Look at Communication Theory |pages=327–38 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-784245-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not uncommon for those outside the culture of gangs to judge the meaning of graffiti and its direct connection to semiotics as completely negative. This kind of graffiti was branded "Graffiti of Grief" in an article by Gabrielle Luber.&lt;ref name="Lübbers"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=40341950 |last1=Lübbers |first1=Gabriele |year=2007 |title=The Graffiti of Grief: Violence, Death and Remembrance in Pittsburgh Gang Neighbourhoods |journal=Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde |volume=53 |pages=145–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a commemoration of mourning; a "funeral" for those who have died on the streets. The murals are often created by
members designated within the gang and the artwork is intended "provide glimpses of their lives, possessions, friends, and surroundings, and map out for us the identities of lost friends."&lt;ref name="Lübbers"/&gt; The symbols used in these murals are intentional and communicate significant meanings within the developed culture. It is an art, an expression of respect and loyalty. It is a portable headstone and is often layered (painted over) with the next memorial of death caused by street violence. In its own right, it is a historical timeline, a genealogy of grief, and it is rewritten every day with the same story and a new name. Poverty, marginalism, survival, perpetual crisis, inadequate housing, low or no job skills, poor education, and social constraints and constructs will continue to market for the consumption of lives on the streets. The symbol of grief portrayed in certain kinds of graffiti suggest a depth of meaning and a place or memorial far beyond what the eye can see. To an outsider, it may easily be interpreted without compassion.

==Main institutions==

A world organisation of semioticians, the [[International Association for Semiotic Studies]], and its journal ''[[Semiotica]]'', was established in 1969. The larger research centers together with teaching program include the semiotics departments at the [[University of Tartu]], [[Aarhus University]], and [[Bologna University]].

==In popular culture==
The discipline is mentioned in an episode of [[The Big Bang Theory]] called [[The Hamburger Postulate]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.psu.edu/kalelkarcas402/2015/09/14/semiotics/{{full citation needed|date=June 2018}}{{self-published inline|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snow science''' addresses how [[snow]] forms, its distribution, and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover and its effect on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover.  In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish [[ground truth]] and [[remote sensing]] techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Timeline of snowflake research}}
Snow was described in China, as early as 135 BCE in Han Ying's book "Disconnection, which contrasted the [[pentagon]]al symmetry of flowers with the hexagonal symmetry of snow.&lt;ref name=Darmouth &gt;{{cite web|url=http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/snowflakes1.pdf|title=The History of the Science of snowflakes|publisher=[[Dartmouth College]]|accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albertus Magnus]] proved what may be the earliest detailed European description of snow in 1250.  [[Johannes Kepler]] attempted to explain why snow crystals are hexagonal in his 1611 book, ''Strenaseu De Nive Sexangula''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kepler |first1=Johannes |authorlink1= Johannes Kepler |title= De nive sexangula |trans-title=The Six-sided Snowflake |url= |year= 1966 |origyear= 1611 |publisher= Clarendon Press |location= Oxford |isbn= |oclc=974730 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1675 [[Friedrich Martens]], a German physician, catalogued 24 types of snow crystal.

A. Sigson photographed snowflakes under a microscope, preceding [[Wilson Bentley]]'s series of photographs of individual snowflakes in the ''Monthly Weather Review''.

[[Ukichiro Nakaya]] began an extensive study on snowflakes in 1932. From 1936 to 1949, Nakaya created the first artificial snow crystals and charted the relationship between temperature and [[water vapor]] [[Dew point|saturation]], later called the ''Nakaya Diagram'' and other works of research in snow, which were published in 1954 by Harvard University Press publishes as ''Snow Crystals: Natural and Artificial''.

==Measurement==
Snow scientists typically excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees.Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks (together with their codes) that the ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' presents are:&lt;ref name = Classificationonground/&gt;
*''Height (H)'' is measured vertically from the ground surface, usually in centimeters.
*''Thickness (D)'' is snow depth measured at right angles to the slope on inclined snow covers, usually in centimeters.
*''Height of snowpack (HS)'' is the total depth of the snowpack, measured vertically in centimetres from base to snow surface.
*''Height of new snow (HN)'' is the depth in centimeters of freshly fallen snow that accumulated on a snow board during a period of 24 hours or some other, specified period. 
*''Snow water equivalent (SWE)'' is the depth of water that would result if the snow mass melted completely, whether over a given region or a confined snow plot, calculated as the product of the snow height in meters times the vertically-integrated density in kilograms per cubic meter.
*''Water equivalent of snowfall (HNW)'' is the snow water equivalent of snowfall, measured for a standard observing period of 24 hours or other period.
*''Snow strength (&amp;Sigma;)'' whether compressive, tensile, or shear, snow strength can be regarded as the maximum stress snow can withstand without failing or fracturing, expressed in [[pascals]] per second, squared.
*''Penetrability of snow surface (P)'' is the depth that an object penetrates into the snow from the surface, usually measured with a Swiss rammsonde, or more crudely by a person standing or on skis, in centimeters.
*''Surface features (SF)'' describes the general appearance of the snow surface, owing to deposition, redistribution and erosion by wind, melting and refreezing, sublimation and evaporation, and rain. The following processes have the corresponding results: smooth—deposition without wind; wavy—wind deposited snow;  concave furrows—melt and sublimation; convex furrows—rain or melt; random furrows—erosion.
*''Snow covered area (SCA)'' describes the extent of snow-covered ground, usually expressed as a fraction (%) of the total.
*''Slope angle (&amp;Phi;)''  is the angle measured from the horizontal to the plane of a slope with a clinometer.
*''Aspect of slope (AS)'' is the compass direction towards which a slope faces, normal to the contours of elevation, given either degrees from true North N = 0° = 360° or as N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.
*''Time (t)'' is usually given in seconds for a measurement duration or in longer units to describe the age of snow deposits and layers.

''Depth'' – Depth of snow is measured with a [[snowboard (meteorology)|snowboard]] (typically a piece of plywood painted white) observed during a six-hour period.  At the end of the six-hour period, all snow is cleared from the measuring surface.  For a daily total snowfall, four six-hour snowfall measurements are summed.  Snowfall can be very difficult to measure due to melting, compacting, blowing and drifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/iwx/program_areas/snow_spotters/SnowMeasurement.pdf|title=Snow Measurement Guidelines for National Weather Service Snow Spotters|author=National Weather Service Forecast Office Northern Indiana|author-link=National Weather Service|publisher=National Weather ServiceCentral Region Headquarters|date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' has a more extensive classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. A list of the main categories (quoted together with their codes) comprises:&lt;ref name = Classificationonground/&gt;
* ''Precipitation particles (PP)'' (See below)
* ''Machine-made snow (MM)'' – May be round polycrystalline particles from freezing of very small water droplets from the surface inward or crushed ice particles from crushing and forced distribution
* ''Decomposing and fragmented precipitation particles (DF)'' — Decomposition is caused by a decrease of surface area to reduce surface free energy initial break up by light winds. Wind causes fragmentation, packing and rounding of particles.
* ''Rounded Grains (RG)'' –  Vary from rounded, usually elongated particles of size around 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm, which are highly sintered. They may be wind packed or faceted rounded, as well.
* ''Faceted Crystals (FC)'' – Grow with grain-to-grain vapour diffusion driven by a large temperature gradient is the primary driver of faceted crystals within the dry snowpack.
* ''Depth Hoar (DH)'' – Grain-to-grain vapour diffusion driven by large temperature gradient is the primary driver of depth hoar within the dry snowpack.
* ''Surface Hoar (SH)'' – Rapid growth of crystals at the snow surface by transfer of water vapor from the atmosphere toward the snow surface, which is cooled by radiative cooling below ambient temperature.
*''Melt Forms (MF)'' – Range from clustered round grains of wet snow through melt-freeze rounded polycrystals when water in veins freezes to loosely bonded, fully rounded single crystals and polycrystals.to polycrystals from a surface layer of wet snow that refroze after having been wetted by melt or rainfall.
* ''Ice Formations (IF)'' – Encompass the following features: Horizontal layers, resulting from rain or meltwater from the surface percolating into cold snow and refreezing along layer barriers. Vertical fingers of frozen drained water. A basal crust resurgent from melt water ponding above a substrate and freezes. A glaze of ice on the snow surface, resulting from freezing rain on snow. A sun crust from melt water at the surface snow refreezes at the surface due to radiative cooling.

==Physical properties==
Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. The ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' lays out the following measurements of snow properties (together with their codes):&lt;ref name = Classificationonground&gt;

*''Microstructure'' of snow is complex and hard to measure, yet has a critical influence on the thermal, mechanical, and electromagnetic properties of snow. Although there are multiple means for characterizing microstructure, there is no standard method.
*''Grain shape'' (''F'' ) includes both natural and artificial depositions, which may have decomposed or include newly formed crystals freeze-thaw or from hoar frost.
*''Grain size'' (''E'' ) represents the average size of grains, each measured at its greatest extension, measured in millimetres.
*''Snow density'' (''&amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) is the mass per unit volume of snow of a known volume, calculated as kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Classification runs from very fine at below 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm to very coarse (2.0–5.0&amp;nbsp;mm) and beyond.
*''Snow hardness'' (''R'' ) is the resistance to penetration of an object into snow. Most snow studies use a fist or fingers for softer snows (very soft through medium) and a pencil (hard) or knife (very hard) below the hardness boundary of ice.
*''Liquid water content'' (''LWC'' ) (or ''free-water content'') is the amount of water within the snow in the liquid phase from either melt, rain, or both. Measurements are expressed as a volume or mass fraction in percent. Dry snow has a 0% mean volume fraction. Wet snow 5.5% and soaked is greater than 15%.
*''Snow temperature'' (''T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) is frequently measured at various elevations in and above the snow column: at the ground, at the surface and a reported height above the surface in °C.
*''Impurities'' (''J'' ) commonly are dust, sand, soot, acids, organic and soluble materials; each should be fully described and reported as mass fraction (%, ppm).
*''Layer thickness'' (''L'' ) of each stratum of a snowpack is measured in cm.

Satellite observations record a decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellite observations began. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover has been observed (from 1978 to 2006). These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less aea coverage. However, in some areas there may be an increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40°. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.&lt;ref name = Review&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dietz, A. |author2=Kuenzer, C. |author3=Gessner, U. |author4= Dech, S.  | year=2012 |title=Remote Sensing of Snow – a Review of available methods |journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing |doi=10.1080/01431161.2011.640964|bibcode = 2012IJRS...33.4094D |volume=33 |pages=4094–4134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite observation of snow relies on the usefulness of the physical and spectral properties of snow for analysing remotely sensed data. Dietz, et al. summarize this, as follows:&lt;ref name = Review/&gt;
*Snow reflects a high proportion of incident radiation in visible wavelengths.
*The Earth continuously emits microwave radiation from its surface that can be measured from space using passive microwave sensors.
*The use of active microwave data to map snow-cover characteristics is limited by the fact that only wet snow can be recognized reliably.

The most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Applicable techniques involve interpolation, using the known to infer the unknown. Passive microwaves sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.&lt;ref name = Review/&gt;

==Models==
[[File:Watercyclesummary.jpg|thumb|Snowfall and snowmelt are parts of the Earth's water cycle.]]
Snow science often leads to predictive models that include snow deposition, snow melt, and snow hydrology—elements of the Earth's [[water cycle]]—which help describe [[global climate change]].&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

===Global climate change===
[[Climate model|Global climate change models]] (GCMs) incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its albedo (reflectivity of light) and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snowmelt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models compute snow water equivalent (SWE) in some manner, such as:&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

SWE = [ –ln( 1 –  ''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' )] / ''D''

where:
* ''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' = fractional coverage of snow
* ''D'' = masking depth of vegetation (≈ 0.2 m worldwide)

===Snowmelt===
Given the importance of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent (SWE) as:&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

SWE = ''M'' (''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') when ''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''

::= 0 when ''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''

where:
*''M'' = melt coefficient
*''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = air temperature
*''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = snowpack temperature

More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute the energy available for melt (''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') as:&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''Q&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' +''Q&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''Q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''Q&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' – ''Q&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Theta;&lt;/sub&gt;''

where:
*''Q&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' = net radiation
*''Q&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' = convective transfer of sensible heat between snowpack and airmass
*''Q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = latent heat lost through evaporation from or condensation onto the snowpack
*''Q&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' = conduction of heat from the ground into the snowpack
*''Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = advection of heat through rain
*''Q&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Theta;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = rate of change of internal energy per unit of surface area

Calculation of the various heat flow quantities (''Q'' ) requires measurement of a much greater range of snow and environmental factors than just temperatures.&lt;ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/&gt;

*''Snow sliders'' – The ability of a [[ski]] or other runner to slide over snow depends on both the properties of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction, &lt;math&gt;F_{max} = \mu_\mathrm{s} F_{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;, for the ski/snow contact, where &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of static friction and &lt;math&gt; F_{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force of the ski on snow.

'''Sonido 13''' is a theory of [[microtonal music]] created by the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] composer [[Julián Carrillo]] around 1900&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;Randel, Don Michael, ed. (1996). "Carrillo (Trujillo), Julián (Antonio)", ''The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music'', p.138. {{ISBN|0-674-37299-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and described by [[Nicolas Slonimsky]] as "the field of sounds smaller than the twelve [[semitone]]s of the [[chromatic scale|tempered scale]]."&lt;ref&gt;Slonimsky, Nicolas (1945).

''Introduction to Twentieth Century Mexican Music'', p.34-36. {{ISBN|91-7222-050-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while he was experimenting with his [[violin]]. As he placed his finger over a violin string, he noticed that he could produce different sounds than the ones defined by musical convention. This way, he realized that the string could be divided into an infinite number of [[pitch (music)|pitches]], creating many more possibilities for [[musical composition|music composition]]. Though he became internationally recognized for his system of [[musical notation|notation]], it was never widely applied.&lt;ref name="Cultural"/&gt; His first composition in demonstration of his theories was ''[[Preludio a Colón]]'' (1922).&lt;ref name="Cultural"/&gt;

The Western musical convention up to this day divides an [[octave]] into twelve different pitches that can be arranged or [[Musical temperament|tempered]] in different [[Interval (music)|intervals]]. Carrillo termed his new system Sonido 13, which is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Thirteenth Sound" or Sound 13, because it enabled musicians to go beyond the twelve notes that comprise an octave in conventional [[Classical music|Western music]].

==History==

===Early life===

Julián Carrillo was a native of the state of [[San Luis Potosí]] in [[Mexico]]. He attended the [[National Conservatory of Music (Mexico)|National Conservatory of Music]] in [[Mexico City]], where he studied Violin, Composition, [[Physics]], [[Acoustics]], and [[Mathematics]]. The laws that define music intervals instantly amazed Carrillo, which led him to conduct experiments on his violin. He began analyzing the way the pitch of a string changed depending on the finger position, concluding that there had to be a way to split the string into an infinite number of parts. One day, Carrillo was able to divide the fourth string of his violin with a [[razor]] into 16 parts in the interval between the notes G and A, thus creating 16 unique sounds. This event was the beginning of Sonido 13 that led Carrillo to study more about physics and the nature of intervals.

===Professional life===

Carrillo became an excellent musician at the Conservatory and received a scholarship to study in Leipzig Royal Conservatory. After Carrillo returned to Mexico in 1918, he became [[Conducting|conductor]] of the National Symphony Orchestra and in 1920 he also became [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of the National Conservatory of Music. It was during this time that he began to invest a significant amount of time on Sonido 13. His achievements in this area were extensive and consisted of writing over 20 books, making more than 40 compositions, patenting fifteen pianos capable of producing small intervals, and organizing the Sonido 13 Symphonic Orchestra that performed in different parts of the world, playing microtonal music composed by Carrillo in different intervals. In 1933, Ahualulco, the town where Julián Carrillo was born, was renamed to Ahualulco del Sonido 13 in honor of Carrillo's work.

Carrillo was, "closely associated with the [[Díaz regime]]," and preferred [[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classicism]] to [[Musical nationalism|nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Cultural"&gt;Bethell, Leslie, ed. (1998). ''A Cultural History of Latin America: Literature, Music and the Visual Arts in the 19th and 20th Centuries'', p.95. {{ISBN|0-521-62626-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music theory==

===Introduction===

Julián Carrillo was a pioneer of microtonal music in the Western world. Julián Carrillo started dividing [[Major second|whole tones (major seconds)]] into 16 intervals, but he did not stop there. Through experiments, Carrillo noticed that he could divide the string into an infinite number of intervals, or into as many intervals as it is physically possible. Carrillo created intervals of 3 ({{audio|Third-tone on C.mid|Play}}), 4 ({{audio|Quarter tone on C.mid|Play}}), 5 ({{audio|Fifth-tone on C.mid|Play}}), 16 ({{audio|Sixteenth-tone on C.mid|Play}}), 32 ({{audio|Thirty-second tone on C.mid|Play}}), 64 ({{audio|Sixty-fourth tone on C.mid|Play}}), and 128 ({{audio|One-hundred and twenty-eighth tone on C.mid|Play}}) tones within a major second&lt;!--18, 24, 30, 96, 192, 384, 768 tone equal temperaments--&gt;, leaving the formula to create more, if desired. However, as the number of intervals increases it becomes harder to distinguish the notes from each other (see [[just noticeable difference]]).

===Music notation===

Because new sets of sounds were created, it was imperative to make a new notation system. Carrillo developed an easy method for notation, which would help people not familiar with previous forms of notation to quickly learn to read and write music.

To show how easy the new writing system was, Carrillo gave two [[New York (state)|New York]] [[elementary school]] boys, who had no prior knowledge of Sonido 13, a simple work by [[Bach]] to convert to his notation system. The boys accomplished the task in less than an hour, proving that the new writing method was easy to learn.

The new writing system is not as graphic as the conventional [[Staff (music)|staff or stave]], and instead of calling the notes by a letter or a syllable (Do, Re, Mi, etc.) they are represented by a number. The numbering system starts with a zero and increments by one until the last note of the octave is reached. Within this system, the number of notes in an octave is dependent on the number of intervals that one wishes to create within a whole tone.

[[File:Sonido13RegularOctave.png|frame|center|From Carrillo's "Teoría Lógica de la Música" ({{lang-en|Logical Theory of the Music}}) Converting current notes (above) to the new notation system (below). There are no smaller intervals in this case.]]

Carrillo used many intervals, although mainly in multiples of 4 such as 16, 32, and 64 so that between each of the whole tones, 16, 32, or 64 additional notes were created. Carrillo called these intervals 16hs of a tone, 32nds of a tone, and 64ths of a tone, respectively. As a result, C would be labeled 0, D flat would be labeled 8, D would be labeled 16, E flat would be labeled 24, E would be labeled 32, etc., for 16ths of a tone.

[[File:Sonido13WholeSixteenthTones.png|frame|center|From Carrillo's "Teoría Lógica de la Música" ({{lang-en|Logical Theory of the Music}}). Converting current notation (above) to sixteenths of a tone to the new notation system (below). 96-tet]]

When notating music, Carrillo used a staff.  However, instead of using lines to signify different notes, he used the lines to distinguish between octaves so that each line on the staff represents a different octave.  For example, if 0 on the second line of the staff denoted what conventional music terms [[middle C]], 0 on the third line would refer to C an octave higher, and 0 on the first line would refer to C an octave lower.

===Musical instruments===

This system added sounds unexplored by generations of musicians, so new adaptations of current instruments had to be made to support the small intervals, and for this reason the instruments were reduced in the number of octaves they contained. For example, a standard [[piano]] has 88 keys that cover more than 7 octaves, and a piano with 88 keys made for 16ths of a tone would not constitute a full octave. To have the same number of octaves as a conventional piano, a piano for 16ths of a tone would need 704 keys. So, using logic and innovative thoughts of modern [[luthier]]s, a traditional piano will be enriched infinitely. Every existing instrument has to be modified to adapt to the new rules of the Sonido 13 system, but also new instruments have to be designed and created. Thus, modern luthiers have an almost fantastic but still unexplored world in front of them, except by Carrillo's mind.

==Latest news==

New efforts are being done to resurrect the 13th Sound music and theory. In 2005 Mexican cellist Jimena Gimenez recently recorded the entire Carrillo's Cello Sonatas and Mexican-Quebecer guitarist Angélos Quetzalcóatl (The "Ambassador" of the 13th Sound) recorded almost all the guitar repertoire.

Besides these recording efforts, new music is being created using the Sonido 13 teachings and the Official Julián Carrillo Website was created by 13th sound musician Hugo Vargas. The website soon became extremely popular among Sonido 13 researchers and it gained the "Official" Status in 2009 thanks to the decision of Angel and Miguel Carrillo, executors of the Julián Carrillo Estate.

The "Ambassador of the 13th Sound" travels around the world promoting the 13th Sound principles which are:
1.- To Purify Music.
2.- To Enrich Music.
3.- To Facilitate Music.
He has achieved international recognition by Government Institutions, the executors of the Carrillo Estate and his peers due to his formidable commitment for totally resurrecting the Revolution of the 13th Sound.

[[File:Space syntax - Global Integration - Brasilia.svg|thumb|250px|Map of axis lines in Brasília. The colors show the global integration of the different streets, measuring the accessibility of a topological line for the entire system according to the spatial analysis of the space syntax. Created with Mindwalk 1.0]]
The term '''space syntax''' encompasses a set of theories and techniques for the analysis of spatial configurations. It was conceived by [[Bill Hillier]], [[Julienne Hanson]] and colleagues at [[The Bartlett]], [[University College London]] in the late 1970s to early 1980s as a tool to help urban planners simulate the likely social effects of their designs.

==Thesis==
The general idea is that spaces can be broken down into components, analyzed as networks of choices, then represented as maps and graphs that describe the relative connectivity and integration of those spaces. It rests on three basic conceptions of space:
*  an '''[[isovist]]''' (popularised by [[Michael Benedikt (urbanist)|Michael Benedikt]] at [[University of Texas]]), or viewshed or visibility polygon, the field of view from any particular point
*  '''axial space''' (idea popularized by Bill Hillier at UCL), a straight sight-line and possible path
*  '''convex space''' (popularized by John Peponis, and his collaborators at Georgia Tech), an occupiable void where, if imagined as a wireframe diagram, no line between two of its points goes outside its perimeter: all points within the polygon are visible to all other points within the polygon.

The three most popular ways of analysing a street network are '''Integration''', '''Choice''' and '''Depth Distance'''.
*  '''Integration''' measures how many turns have to be made from a street segment to reach all other street segments in the network, using shortest paths. If the number of turns required for reaching all segments in the graph is analyzed, the analysis is said to measure integration at radius 'n'. The first intersecting segment requires only one turn, the second two turns and so on. The street segments that require the fewest turns to reach all other streets are called 'most integrated' and are usually represented with hotter colors, such as red or yellow. Integration can also be analyzed in local scale instead of the scale of the whole network. In the case of radius 4, for instance, only four turns are counted departing from each street segment.

Theoretically, the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street, and is often argued to 'predict' the pedestrian use of a street: the easier it is to reach a street, the more popular it should be. While there is some evidence of this being true, the method is biased towards long, straight streets that intersect with lots of other streets. Such streets, as [[Oxford Street]] in London, come out as especially strongly integrated. However, a slightly curvy street of the same length would typically be segmented into individual straight segments, not counted as a single line, which makes curvy streets appear less integrated in the analysis.

*  The '''Choice''' measure is easiest to understand as a 'water-flow' in the street network. Imagine that each street segment is given an initial load of one unit of water, which then starts pours from the starting street segment to all segments that successively connect to it. Each time an intersection appears, the remaining value of flow is divided equally amongst the splitting streets, until all the other street segments in the graph are reached. For instance, at the first intersection with a single other street, the initial value of one is split into two remaining values of one half, and allocated to the two intersecting street segments. Moving further down, the remaining one half value is again split among the intersecting streets and so on. When the same procedure has been conducted using each segment as a starting point for the initial value of one, a graph of final values appears. The streets with the highest total values of accumulated flow are said to have the highest choice values.

Like Integration, Choice analysis can be restricted to limited local radii, for instance 400m, 800m, 1600m. Interpreting Choice analysis is trickier than Integration. Space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets, but, strictly speaking, Choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street. However, since flow values are divided (not subtracted) at each intersection, the output shows an exponential distribution. It is considered best to take a log of base two of the final values in order to get a more accurate picture.

*  '''Depth Distance''' is the most intuitive of the analysis methods. It explains the linear distance from the center point of each street segment to the center points of all the other segments. If every segment is successively chosen as a starting point, a graph of accumulative final values is achieved. The streets with lowest Depth Distance values are said to be nearest to all the other streets. Again, the search radius can be limited to any distance.

===Applications===
From these components it is thought to be possible to quantify and describe how easily navigable any space is, useful for the design of museums, airports, hospitals, and other settings where [[wayfinding]] is a significant issue. Space syntax has also been applied to predict the correlation between spatial layouts and social effects such as crime, traffic flow, and [[sales per unit area]].

Space syntax originated as a programme research in the early 1970's when Bill Hillier, Adrian Leaman and Alan Beattie came together at the School of Environmental Studies at UCL (now known as the Bartlett). Bill Hillier had been appointed Director of the Unit for Architectural Studies (UAS) as successor to John Musgrove. They established a new MSc programme in Advanced Architectural Studies and embarked on a programme of research aimed at developing a theoretical basis for architecture. Previously Bill Hillier had written papers with others as secretary to the RIBA, notably 'Knowledge and Design' and 'How is Design Possible'. These laid the theoretical foundation for a series of studies that sought to clarify how the built environment relates to society. One of the first cohort of students on the MScAAS was Julienne Hanson who went on to co-author The Social Logic of Space (SLS) with Bill Hillier (CUP, 1984). This brought together in one place a comprehensive review of the programme of research up to that point, but also developed a full theoretical account for how the buildings and settlements we construct an not merely the product of social processes, but also play a role in producing social forms. SLS also developed an analytic approach to representation and quantification of spatial configuration at the building and the settlement scale, making possible both comparative studies as well as analysis of the relationship between spatial configuration and aspect of social function in the built environment. These methods coupled to the social theories have turned out to have a good deal of explanatory power. Space syntax has grown to become a tool used around the world in a variety of research areas and design applications in [[architecture]], [[urban design]], planning, [[transport]] and [[interior design]]. In general, the analysis uses one of many [[Spatial network analysis software|software programs]] that allow researchers to analyse graphs of one (or more) of the primary spatial components.

Over the past decade, Space syntax techniques have been used for research in [[archaeology]], [[information technology]], urban and human [[geography]], and [[anthropology]]. Since 1997, the Space syntax community has held biennial conferences, and many journal papers have been published on the subject, chiefly in [http://www.envplan.com Environment and Planning B].

==Criticism==
Space syntax's mathematical reliability has come under scrutiny because of a seeming paradox that arises under certain geometric configurations with 'axial maps', one of the method's primary representations of spatial configuration. This paradox was proposed by [[Carlo Ratti]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], but comprehensively refuted in a passionate academic exchange with Bill Hillier and Alan Penn [2004]. There have been moves to combine space syntax with more traditional [[transport engineering]] models, using intersections as nodes and constructing [[visibility graph]]s to link them, by researchers including [[Bin Jiang]], Valerio Cutini and [[Michael Batty]]. Recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in [[Geographic Information System|GIS]], such as the [[place syntax]]-models developed by the research group [[Spatial Analysis]] and Design at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. A series of [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437106001282; http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/b32045 interdisciplinary works] published from 2006 by [http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~latora/ Vito Latora], [https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/portasergioprof/ Sergio Porta] and colleagues, proposing a network approach to [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-84996-396-1_6 street centrality analysis] and [http://www.placelogic.org.uk design], have highlighted Space Syntax' contribution to decades of previous studies in [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037015730500462X the physics of spatial complex networks].

'''Strategic geography''' is concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the [[national security|security]] and prosperity of [[nation]]s. Spatial areas that concern strategic geography change with human needs and development. This field is a subset of [[human geography]], itself a subset of the more general study of [[geography]].  It is also related to [[geostrategy]].

Strategic geography is that branch of science, which deals with the study of spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of a nation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6361">"'''The Complexity of Songs'''" is a journal article published by [[computer scientist]] [[Donald Knuth]] in 1977,&lt;ref name=knu /&gt; as an [[in-joke]] about [[computational complexity theory]]. The article capitalizes on the tendency of popular [[song]]s to devolve from long and content-rich [[ballad]]s to highly repetitive texts with little or no meaningful content.&lt;ref name=redux&gt;Steven Krantz (2005) "Mathematical Apocrypha Redux", {{ISBN|0-88385-554-2}}, pp.2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The article notes how some songs can reach a complexity level, for a song of length ''N'' words, as formula: {{nowrap|[[Big O notation|O]]([[logarithm|log]] ''N'')}}. The gist of the article is repeated below, maintaining the wit of the key concepts.

== Article summary ==
Knuth writes that "our ancient ancestors invented the concept of [[refrain]]" to reduce the [[space complexity]] of songs, which becomes crucial when a large number of songs is to be committed to one's [[memory]]. Knuth's [[Lemma (mathematics)|Lemma]] 1 states that if ''N'' is the length of a song, then the refrain decreases the song complexity to ''cN'', where the factor&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name="knu"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Knuth | first=Donald | title=The Complexity of Songs | journal=SIGACT News | date=Summer 1977 | pages=17–24}}
Reprinted in: {{cite journal | last=Knuth | first=Donald | title=The Complexity of Songs | journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] | year=1984 | volume=27 | issue=4 | pages=344–346 | doi=10.1145/358027.358042 | mr=784131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knuth further demonstrates a way of producing songs with [[Big O notation|O]](&lt;math&gt;\sqrt N&lt;/math&gt;) complexity, an approach "further improved by a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] farmer named [[Old McDonald Had a Farm|O. MacDonald]]".&lt;ref name=knu /&gt;

More ingenious approaches yield songs of complexity [[Big O notation|O]](&lt;math&gt;\log N&lt;/math&gt;), a class known as "[[99_Bottles_of_Beer#References_in_computer_science|''m'' bottles of beer on the wall]]".

Finally, the progress during the 20th century—stimulated by the fact that "the advent of modern drugs has led to demands for still less memory"—leads to the ultimate improvement: Arbitrarily long songs with space complexity [[Big O notation|O]](1), e.g. for a song to be defined by the [[recurrence relation]]&lt;ref name=knu /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_0=\epsilon, S_k = V_kS_{k-1},\, k\ge 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_k =&lt;/math&gt; '[[That's the Way (I Like It)|That's the way]],' &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; 'I like it,' &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt; k \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U=&lt;/math&gt; 'uh huh,' 'uh huh'

== Further developments ==
Prof. Kurt Eisemann of [[San Diego State University]] in his letter to the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''&lt;ref name=kurt /&gt; further improves the latter seemingly unbeatable estimate. He begins with an observation that for practical applications the value of the "hidden constant" ''c'' in the [[Big Oh]] notation may be crucial in making the difference between the feasibility and unfeasibility: for example a constant  value of 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; would exceed the capacity of any known device. He further notices that a technique has already been known in [[Mediaeval Europe]] whereby textual content of an arbitrary tune can be recorded basing on the recurrence relation &lt;math&gt;S_k = C_2S_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;C_2 = 'la'&lt;/math&gt;, yielding the value of the big-Oh constant ''c'' equal to 2. However it turns out that another culture achieved the absolute lower bound of O(0). As Prof. Eisemann puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the ''Mayflower'' voyagers first descended on these shores, the native Americans proud of their achievement in the theory of information storage and retrieval, at first welcomed the strangers with the complete silence. This was meant to convey their peak achievement in the complexity of songs, namely the demonstration that a limit as low as ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is indeed obtainable."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However the Europeans were unprepared to grasp this notion, and the [[Indian chief|chiefs]], in order to establish a common ground to convey their achievements later proceeded to demonstrate an approach described by the recurrent relation &lt;math&gt;S_k = C_1S_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;C_1 = 'i'&lt;/math&gt;, with a suboptimal complexity given by ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=redux /&gt;&lt;ref name=kurt&gt;Kurt Eisemann, "Further Results on the Complexity of Songs", ''Communications of the ACM'', vol 28 (1985), no. 3, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The O(1) space complexity result was also implemented by [[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]], perhaps challenged by Knuth's article.&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Neumann, "A further view of the first quarter century" ,''Communications of the ACM'', Volume 27, Issue 4, April 1984, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Steele's  ''[[TELNET]] Song'' used a completely different algorithm based on exponential recursion, a parody on some implementations of TELNET.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]], "The Telnet Song", ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'', April 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poppyfields.net/filks/00222.html Text of the TELNET Song] (retrieved January 5, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~nickz/dec/telnet-song.mid Telnet song in MIDI format]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the complexity analysis of human songs can be a useful pedagogic device for teaching students complexity theory.&lt;ref name=Chavey1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chavey|first=Darrah|title=Songs and the analysis of algorithms|journal=SIGCSE '96|year=1996|pages=4–8|doi=10.1145/236452.236475|url=http://dl2.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=236475&amp;CFID=248220371&amp;CFTOKEN=72224448|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "On Superpolylogarithmic [[subexponential time|Subexponential]] Functions" by Prof. [[Alan Sherman]]&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sherman, "On Superpolylogarithmic Subexponential Functions:, ''ACM SIGACT News'', vol. 22, no. 1, 1991, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Knuth's article was seminal for analysis of a special class of functions.

'''Tree-free paper''' or tree-free [[newsprint]] describes an alternative to [[wood-pulp paper]] by its [[raw material]] composition. It is claimed to be more [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] considering the product's [[life cycle assessment|entire life cycle]].

Sources of fiber for tree-free paper include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treefreepaper.com/treefree101.php|title=Treefree 101|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* agricultural residues (e.g. [[Bagasse|sugarcane bagasse]], [[husk]]s and [[straw]])
* [[fiber crop]]s and wild plants, such as [[bamboo]], [[kenaf]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], and [[flax]]
* [[textile]]s and [[Rope|cordage]] wastes

Non-fibre sources include:

* [[calcium carbonate]] bound by a non-toxic [[high-density polyethylene]] resin

[[Paper manufacturing]] is highly competitive, with historically tight margins and small operating profits. As a result, the raw materials used to make paper have to be very cost effective, using cheap, scalable renewable resources, coupled with relatively inexpensive ways to deliver large quantities to market. Until recently,{{when|date=January 2013}} commercial tree farming, has been shaped to account for these tight operating margins and supply cost limitations. Virtually all paper, however, requires massive [[logging|cutting]], [[replanting]] and re-cutting of wide swaths of forest. These limitations have made wood pulped farm grown supply stock the paper industry's overwhelming scalable raw material of choice.

The paper industry's answer to "tree free" paper has been focused on "[[paper recycling|recycled]] [[waste paper]]" as a tree free alternative even though the vast majority of "recycled waste paper" originally started its life cycle from tree grown pulp.

Fiber dense agricultural residues, have been known as a pulp substitute for years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Commercial low cost production technology coupled with limited resource abundancy plus low cost transportation to commercial business markets had created a barrier, virtually relegating true "tree free" paper from developing into anything more than small niche markets with even smaller niche market players. Furthermore, grasses and annual plants often have high [[silica]] contents. Silica is problematic as it consumes pulping chemicals and produces [[fly ash]] when burned.
