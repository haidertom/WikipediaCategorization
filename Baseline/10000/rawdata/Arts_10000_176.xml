The year '''1963 in film''' involved some significant events, including the big-budget epic ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', [[Alfred Hitchcock's]] horror [[The Birds (film)|''The Birds'']], and two films with all-star casts, ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''.

==Events==
* February 20 – The classic epic western ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' premieres.
* June 12 – ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Richard Burton]], premieres at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City. Its staggering production costs nearly bankrupted [[Twentieth Century Fox]] and the adulterous affair between Taylor and Burton made the publicity even worse. ''Cleopatra'' marked the only instance that a film would be the highest-grossing film of a year while still losing money, thus establishing it as, at the time, [[List of box office bombs|the biggest box office disaster in cinema history]]. The film's terrible reception harmed the reputation of director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], who had an esteemed career for directing classics like ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'', ''[[All About Eve]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'', ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'', and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer]]''. It effectively destroyed the career of its well-known producer [[Walter Wanger]], who never worked in Hollywood or on another film again; he died five years later at the age of 74 of a heart attack. Much of the blame of the film's failures could be pointed at Taylor's super-diva personality, her health issues, her and Burton's adulterous affair, and the studio's inadequate management. It wouldn't be until two years later that [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s adaptation of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' would help rescue Fox from bankruptcy by becoming [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|one of the highest-grossing motion pictures of all time]].
* November 7 – The classic comedy ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' premieres and it boasts one of the finest [[all-star]] ensemble casts ever, easily the most impressive for a comedy. It is also the first comedy film ever directed by [[Stanley Kramer]], best known for directing serious human drama films on controversial subjects like ''[[The Defiant Ones (film)|The Defiant Ones]]'', ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', and ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''.
* December 25 – [[Walt Disney]]'s production of ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' premieres. It is the second adaptation of [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' after the [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]] musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', the first cinematic adaptation of the novel, and the 13th film adaptation of the legend of [[King Arthur]].

'''Akan art''' is an [[art]] form that originated among the [[Akan people]] of [[West Africa]]. Akan art is known for vibrant artistic traditions, including textiles, sculpture, [[Akan goldweights]], as well as gold and silver [[jewelry]]. The Akan people are known for their strong connection between visual and verbal expressions and a distinctive blending of art and philosophy. Akan culture values [[gold]] above all other metals, so the artwork and jewelry made of gold reflects a great deal of value, whether it be made for appearance, artistic expression, or more practical trading purposes.

==Goldweights==
{{main|Akan goldweights}}
One of the most popular pieces of Akan art are the [[Akan goldweights]]. The gold weights were made of [[copper]], [[bronze]], and [[brass]]. They were cast using a method of casting known as lost-wax technique or "cire perdue". Goldweights were created  for economic transactions involving gold. Although it is not clear when the convention of weights were first introduced, scholars suggest that the Akan first traded gold with Muslim merchants from the West African interior, long before European contact. Their weight system correspond to the Islamic weight system of North Africa, and appear to be part of early sub-Saharan trade. 

The gold weights served a vast amount of roles in their culture and everyday life. Akan goldweights are used as [[counterbalance]]s on the scales used in gold trade, visual representations of oral tradition, representations of proverbs, as pictographic script in social and political system, and in the knowledge system of the Akan people. Goldweights were used in everyday trade and commerce, as well as in accounting, as a type of fraction or counter. According to the Akan scholar Nitecki, Akan gold weights were "created and used like spoken language to commemorate social or historical events or entities, to express philosophical or religious views, aspirations, and dreams, or simply to ask questions, or to express displeasure". The Akan pyramids were concrete testimonials to how the artist felt about themselves and major life events and dilemmas such as marriage, children, injustice, and personal and statewide conflicts.

There are four major categories of gold weights, based on what was depicted. The first kind of gold weights depict people. The second consist of the local flora and fauna. The third category are likened to man-made objects. The final category are abstract and open for interpretation by individual. 

==Jewelry==
Akan cultural jewelry has a variety of forms. The Akan people make neck-wear, wrist bands, elbow-wear, knee-wear, and ankle-wear. Gender-specific jewelry includes hat pins and headbands for men and earrings and hairpins for the women.

'''Angelo Jank''' (30 October 1868 in [[Munich]] – 9 October 1940 in Munich) was a German [[animal painter]], illustrator and member of the [[Munich Secession]]. He specialized in scenes with horses and riders.

== Biography ==
After graduating from the [[Wilhelmsgymnasium (Munich)|Wilhelmsgymnasium]] in 1888, he studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]] from 1891 to 1896 with [[Ludwig von Löfftz]] and [[Paul Hoecker]] and exhibited with several art societies at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]]. In 1898, he had his first showing with members of the Munich Secession.

From 1899 to 1907, he was a teacher at the Women's Academy of the Munich Artists' Association. He was then appointed a Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, succeeding [[Wilhelm von Diez]]. In 1922, following the retirement of [[Heinrich von Zügel]], Jank succeeded him as Professor of Animal Painting. Later, he was elected first Chairman of the "Association of Visual Artists" and presided over their exhibitions at the Glaspalast. For many years, he was also employed as an illustrator for the magazines ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]'' and ''[[Simplicissimus]]'',  And he was also an instructor at the Academy of Fine Arts, where his students included [[Karl Gatermann the Younger]].

He was married to Baroness Anna von Thüngen, from an old noble family, some of whose members became involved with the [[Nazi Party]]. His daughter, Ali, married [[Riedesel|Bertram Riedesel]], Freiherr zu Eisenbach. Another child of the marriage was their son Hans Jank (his wife was Märta, née Larsson), whose daughter Angela married Prince Albrecht of [[Oettingen-Spielberg]]. An affair with the painter, [[Marie Schnür]], produced a son named Klaus. Schnür later entered into a [[marriage of convenience]] with [[Franz Marc]] to provide legitimacy for the boy.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Salmen, ''Maria Marc. Leben und Lebenswerk'', from: ''Maria Marc im Kreis des "Blauen Reiter"'' (exhibition catalog), Schloßmuseum Murnau, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his canvases, he painted murals at the [[Justizpalast (Munich)|Justizpalast]] and scenes from history at the [[Reichstag building]] in Berlin. Among his best-known students were [[Louis Grell]], {{ill|Erma Bossi|de}}, [[Nina Arbore]], {{ill|Franz Xaver Stahl|de}} (also an animal painter), [[Henryk Gotlib]], {{ill|Käte Lassen|de}}, [[Carl Rabus]] and [[Adolf Ziegler]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://matrikel.adbk.de/07lehrer/lehrer/jank-angelo/ Angelo Jank] @ Matrikeldatenbank.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5331">'''Art''' and '''morality''' have been discussed, compared and linked for as long as they have been identified as concepts.

== History and ideas ==
In the PL7, Zio Nirchio ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Plato in Twelve Volumes'' cit. by PL7, Vols. 5 &amp; 6 translated by Paul Shorey. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1969. {{ISBN|0-674-99262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] saw the function of the [[actor]] as bogus, presenting a dangerous illusion of reality, and masking the truth of existence by the pretence of acting. [[Aristotle]], in ''[[The Poetics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Aristotle in 23 Volumes'', Vol. PL7, translated by W. H. Fyfe. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1932. {{ISBN|0-674-99563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the role of the actor somewhat differently, suggesting that by witnessing ''pity and fear'' (in his view the essence of [[tragedy]]) on stage, an audience could experience a [[catharsis]] of the emotions associated with real tragic events, without having to experience them as first-hand participants.

Since then, the 'stand-off' between those who have seen art as having a direct impact on morality, and those who have asserted its independence, has persisted. [[Tolstoy]] was ambivalent about the role of the artist (despite being one himself). In ''[[What is Art?]]'' he castigated now-[[Western canon|canon]]ical artists such as [[Shakespeare]], [[Goethe]] and [[Wagner]] for failing to express the 'simple truths' about morality (as he saw them), opting instead to show off their poetic cleverness. He saw their work as morally reprehensible, effectively a wasting of their talents through their failure to communicate moral truth to the masses.

Since the late nineteenth century and beyond, with the development of '[[the Arts]]' as a cultural concept, the debate about art and morality has intensified, with the ever more challenging activities of artists becoming targets for those who see art as an influence for bad or good, and it has been a mainstay of many art critics' negative reviews. [[John Ruskin]] accused [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] of "flinging a pot of paint in the face of the audience",&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, Adam.  "A Sense of Justice: Whistler, Ruskin, James, Impressionism", ''Victorian Studies'' Volume 42, Number 4&lt;/ref&gt; and several of the ballets of [[Diaghilev]] scandalised audiences with their explicit (at the time) sexual themes.

Whistler and Ruskin eventually went face-to-face in the courtroom. But in 1961, one of the most [[Lady Chatterley's Lover#Controversy|famous legal clashes]] between art and morality occurred when [[Penguin Books]] were taken to court over their publication of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Chatterley's Trial'', Penguin Books {{ISBN|0-14-102232-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1977 the Christian morality campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] successfully sued a magazine, ''[[Gay News]]'', under [[blasphemous libel]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[popular culture]], [[pornography]] (if seen in aesthetic terms) is used as an example of the [[objectification]] of women, and violent films have been cited as the influence for so-called ''[[Copycat crimes|copycat]]'' acts in reality. An example of this was the [[Hungerford Massacre]], where a gunman was alleged by the [[tabloid press]] to have been influenced by the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' series of films starring [[Sylvester Stallone]].

In September 2001, shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|World Trade Center Attack]], the German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] said of the atrocity that it was "Lucifer's greatest work of art."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osborne-conant.org/documentation_stockhausen.htm The Stockhausen Affair&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stockhausen.org/message_from_karlheinz.html Stockhausen's response&lt;/ref&gt; (However, Stockhausen's comments were taken out of context and misunderstood.) The responses were immediate and extreme, fuelled once again by the tabloid press. Some have found, here and elsewhere, art in the service of morality to be politically dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.necessaryprose.com/badart.htm Bad Art: The Iraq War out of Context&lt;/ref&gt;

In purely philosophical terms, the precise nature of art's links with morality have been long been questioned. Some have found no link between the aesthetic and the moral (i.e. being morally reprehensible does not deny an artwork its art status; it does not cease having aesthetic value no matter how depraved some might see it being), whereas others, who have not gone down the explicitly Platonist route, have argued that the relationship is one akin to [[supervenience]]. Here, it is argued that an essential component of the production of art, the human factor, can only be made sensible if taken along with the perceived moral codes which govern humanity.

The '''''Assumption of the Virgin between St. Miniato and St. Julian''''' is a painting by the Italian early Renaissance master [[Andrea del Castagno]], executed around 1449-1450. It is now housed in the [[Gemäldegalerie]] of [[Berlin]].

==History==
An inscription mentioned by [[Filippo Baldinucci]], dated 20 November 1449, reported that the altarpiece was commissioned by Leonardo di Francesco di Nardo Falladanzi, the rector of [[San Miniato tra le Torri]], a church in Florence. Falladanzi kept a notebook in which he noted that he paid "maestro Andrea, pintore" 104 lire for an altarpiece for the main altar of the church.&lt;ref&gt;John Richard Spencer, ''Andrea Del Castagno and His Patrons,'' Durham: Duke University Press, 1991, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was demolished around 1888 (it was located where the main post office is today), and its heritage was dispersed, after which Andrea del Castagno's ''Assumption'' was acquired by Berlin's Gemäldegalerie.

==Description==

The painting portrays Mary in a wide blue cloak, while she is lifted up from a sepulchre depicted in perspective. The cloak, as typical in Andrea del Castagno, is painted with a heavy use of [[chiaroscuro]]. The sepulchre contains roses, a flower usually associated with the Virgin. She is carried within a brilliant [[aureola#Mandorla|mandorla]] by three angels.

At Mary's sides, both with a red aureola, are [[Julian the Hospitaller|St. Julian]] (left, with a sword) and [[Minias of Florence|St. Minias of Florence]] (right, with a stick and a crown). While the Virgin is portrayed in a realistic posture, the two saints have a more mystic and static appearance. Both men are elegantly dressed in the most expensive of contemporary costumes.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only the damask fabrics, but also the saturated red color indicate the costliness of their garments.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Collier Frick, ''Dressing Renaissance Florence: Families, Fortunes, and Fine Clothing'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The background was painted in gold, with a blending effect in correspondence of the saints' aureolas.

'''''Bacchus and Ariadne''''' (1522–1523)&lt;ref name="keyfacts"/&gt; is an [[oil painting]] by [[Titian]]. It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]], for the [[Camerini d'alabastro|Camerino d'Alabastro]]&amp;nbsp;– a private room in his [[palazzo]] in Ferrara decorated with paintings based on classical texts. An advance payment was given to [[Raphael]], who originally held the commission for the subject of a ''Triumph of Bacchus''. At the time of Raphael's death in 1520, only a preliminary drawing was completed and the commission was then handed to Titian. In the case of ''Bacchus and Ariadne'', the subject matter was derived from the Roman poets [[Catullus]] and [[Ovid]]. 

The painting, considered one of Titian's greatest works, now hangs in the [[National Gallery]] in London. The other major paintings in the cycle are ''[[The Feast of the Gods]]'' (mostly by [[Giovanni Bellini]], now in the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C), and Titian's ''[[The Bacchanal of the Andrians]]'' and ''[[The Worship of Venus]]'' (both now in the [[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]]).

==Description==
[[Ariadne]] has been left on the island of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]], deserted by her lover [[Theseus]], whose ship sails away to the far left. She is discovered on the shore by the god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], leading a procession of revelers in a chariot drawn by two [[cheetah]]s (these were probably modelled on those in the Duke's menagerie and were [[tiger]]s in Ovid's original text&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi004.perseus-eng1:1 P. Ovidius Naso, ''Ars Amatoria'', Book I, Perseus Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt;). Bacchus is depicted  in mid-air as he leaps out of the chariot to protect Ariadne from these beasts. In the sky above the figure of Ariadne is the star constellation [[Corona Borealis]] (Northern crown). There are two possible variations of the story both going back to Ovid. In his Metamorphoses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph8.htm#482327660 Ovid, ''Metamorphoses''], translated by A. S. Kline, Book VIII:bv152–182 The Minotaur, Theseus, and Ariadne&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid has Bacchus throw the crown of Ariadne into the sky where it becomes the constellation Northern Crown. In Ars Amatoria,&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; Bacchus promises the entire sky to Ariadne where she then would become the constellation Northern Crown. The National Gallery's website states that in the painting, "Bacchus, god of wine, emerges with his followers from the landscape to the right. Falling in love with Ariadne on first sight, he leaps from his chariot, drawn by two cheetahs, towards her. Ariadne had been abandoned on the Greek island of Naxos by Theseus, whose ship is shown in the distance. The picture shows her initial fear of Bacchus, but he raised her to heaven and turned her into a constellation, represented by the stars above her head."

The composition is divided diagonally into two triangles, one of blue sky (using the expensive [[ultramarine]] pigment) and still but for the two lovers caught in movement, the other a riot of movement and predominantly green/brown in colour. The follower of Bacchus who struggles with a snake is sometimes falsely associated with the antique sculpture of ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' who had been killed by snakes. This statue had recently been discovered in Rome. But the satyr in Titian's painting is not in a mortal combat with the snakes, he is merely girding himself with them as is described in the original text by Catullus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/cat64.shtml Catullus, ''The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis'', 250–265, Translated by Thomas Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King Charles Spaniel]] that barks at the boy [[satyr]] is a common motif in Titian's work and was probably a court pet. The gold urn inscribed with the artist's signature (&lt;small&gt;TICIANVS&lt;/small&gt;) may also have been familiar to the Duke as one of the antiquities in his collection.

The analysis of pigments used by Titian in this painting has been undertaken by scientists at the National Gallery in London&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/pdf/lucas_plesters1978.pdf Lucas, A., Plesters, J. "Titian's 'Bacchus and Ariadne{{'"}}. ''National Gallery Technical Bulletin'' Vol. 2, pp. 25–47]&lt;/ref&gt; and this analysis is illustrated at ColourLex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/bacchus-ariadne-pigment-analysis/ "Titian, Bacchus and Ariadne, Pigment Analysis"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
The canvas on which ''Bacchus and Ariadne'' is painted was rolled up twice in the first century of its existence, which had consequences for the painting. From the turn of the 19th century onwards it was frequently being restored to stop paint from flaking off, with the most controversial restoration being that carried out at the National Gallery between 1967 and 1968. This greatly brightened the surface of the painting, and came as something of a shock to many viewers, used to a heavy [[varnish]] finish.  When discoloured [[varnish]] lying directly on top of the paint surface was removed, some of the paint itself came off as well and repainting was necessary. This has caused some critics to note that the expanse of blue sky on the left-hand side, one of the worst-affected areas of the painting, appears flat and pallid. It has also been argued that the removal of the varnish has left the painting tonally out of balance, since Titian is likely to have added some subtle glazes to the paint surface in order to tone down some of the more jarring colors. The National Gallery maintains that this was an unavoidable loss, because the accrued layers of later varnish had turned the painting brown and sludgy and had to be removed.  More recent examination has confirmed that the paint remains largely original.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, A., Plesters, J. 'Titian's "Bacchus and Ariadne"'. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 2, pp 25–47.  [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/technical-bulletin/lucas_plesters1978 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other paintings==
There are many other paintings of the subject in museum collections, including the following: 
*[[Giovan Battista Pittoni]] (1720–25), in the [[Louvre]]
*[[Guido Reni]] ([[Los Angeles]])
*[[Ferdinand Bol]], [[Hermitage Museum]]
*[[Eustache Le Sueur]], Boston MFA
*[[Sebastiano Ricci]], [[Chiswick House]]
*[[Jacopo Tintoretto]], ''Bacchus, Venus and Ariadne'', [[Doge's Palace]], Venice

==References in other media==
[[John Keats]] alluded to this painting (which was brought to England in 1806) in his "Ode to a Nightingale" ("''Away! away! for I will fly to thee, Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards''").

[[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] reviews this work in her poem ''Bacchus and Ariadne'', first published in 1822, as a ''Dramatic Scene'', being a dialogue between Leonardi and Alvine.

The painting was the basis for the cover of the album ''[[God Shuffled His Feet]]'' by rock band [[Crash Test Dummies]].  

The Indonesian composer [[Ananda Sukarlan]] has made a musical work for flute and piano, "Rescuing Ariadne" after being inspired by Titian's painting in the National Gallery of London.

In her novel [[Misalliance]], [[Anita Brookner]] alludes to Titian's painting and depicts the encounter between Ariadne and Bacchus as an "ecstatic moment of recognition  [...], so immediate that Bacchus' foot has not had time to touch the ground as he leaps from his chariot, so shocking that Ariadne flings up a hand protest."

'''Barefoot''' is the most common term for the state of not wearing any [[footwear]].

Wearing footwear is an exclusively human characteristic, however some animals held by humans are also issued with footwear, such as horses and, more rarely dogs and cats. There are health benefits and some risks associated with going barefoot. Footwear provides protection from cuts, abrasions, bruises, and impacts from objects on the ground or the ground texture itself, as well as from [[frostbite|frost]] or [[Thermal burn|heat burns]],  and parasites like [[hookworm]] in extreme situations. However, shoes can limit the flexibility, strength, and mobility of the foot and can lead to higher incidences of flexible flat foot, bunions, hammer toe, and [[Morton's neuroma]]. Walking and running barefoot results in a more natural gait, allowing for a more rocking motion of the foot, eliminating the hard heel strike and therefore generating less collision force in the foot and lower leg.&lt;ref name="Lieberman_DE"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nature08723| title = Foot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners| year = 2010| last1 = Lieberman | first1 = D.

There are many sports that are performed barefoot, most notably [[gymnastics]] and [[martial arts]], but also [[beach volleyball]], [[barefoot running]], [[barefoot hiking]], and [[barefoot waterskiing|water skiing]]. In modern language, someone who tends not to wear shoes in public or is participating in the aforementioned sports may be described as a '''barefooter'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Barefoot water skiing: an illustrated guide to learning and mastering the sport|year=1988|publisher=World Publications, Incorporated|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6I2WE5XWIQ8C&amp;q=barefooter&amp;dq=barefooter|author1=Scarpa, R |author2=Dorner, T. |isbn=978-0-944406-01-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallack|first=R.M.|title=Run for Life: The Anti-Aging, Anti-Injury, Super-Fitness Plan to Keep You Running to 100|year=2009|publisher=Sky Horse Publishing|isbn=978-1-60239-344-8|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pkjcENkpO6cC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=barefooter#v=onepage&amp;q=barefooter&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in ancient times, such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Hindu]]s, and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] often went barefoot, as the inhabited terrain mostly mandated no practical necessity for footwear.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The Egyptians and Hindus made some use of ornamental footwear, such as a soleless [[sandal]] known as a ''Cleopatra'', which did not provide any practical protection for the foot. Athletes in the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] participated barefoot and generally unclothed.&lt;ref name="ancient_olympics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unearthing the First Spartan Boys where not allowed to wear shoes to toughen their feet and allow stronger dexterity in their toes Olympics|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2004/jul/nemea/|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[NPR]]|date=July 19, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728000414/http://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2004/jul/nemea/|archivedate=2010-07-28|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the [[Twelve Olympians|gods]] and heroes were primarily depicted barefoot.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who eventually conquered the Greeks and adopted many aspects of their culture, did not adopt the Greek perception of footwear and clothing. [[Clothing in ancient Rome|Roman clothing]] explicitly including footwear was seen as a sign of power and as a necessity of living in a civilized world; accordingly slaves usually were to remain barefoot.&lt;ref name="Frazine_Richard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazine|first=Richard Keith|title=The Barefoot Hiker|year=1993|publisher=Ten Speed Press|isbn=0-89815-525-8|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/?id=edsITVCd2G0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=barefoot+hiker&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many references to shoes being worn in the [[Bible]]. During weddings of this period, a father would give his son-in-law a pair of shoes to symbolize the transfer of authority.&lt;ref name="ancient_weddings"&gt;{{cite web|title=77 Interesting Facts About Weddings|url=http://facts.randomhistory.com/interesting-facts-about-weddings.html|publisher=randomhistory.com|accessdate=July 1, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100723234251/http://facts.randomhistory.com/interesting-facts-about-weddings.html| archivedate= 23 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, both men and women wore [[Patten (shoe)|pattens]] in Europe, commonly seen as the predecessor of the modern [[high-heeled footwear|high-heeled shoe]],&lt;ref name="high_heels"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dangerous Elegance: A History of High-Heeled Shoes|url=http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/036heels.html|publisher=randomhistory.com|accessdate=July 1, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100728002338/http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/036heels.html| archivedate= 28 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while menial classes usually wore hand-made footwear out of available materials. Going barefoot was seen as a marker of poverty and the lowest social class, as well as being the mark of a prisoner (see below).&lt;ref name="Frazine_Richard"/&gt; In the 15th century, [[chopine]]s were created in [[Turkey]] and were usually 7–8&amp;nbsp;inches (17.7–20.3&amp;nbsp;cm) high. These shoes became popular in [[Venice]] and throughout Europe as a [[status symbol]] revealing wealth and social standing. During the 16th century royalty, such as [[Catherine de Medici]] and [[Mary I of England]], started wearing high-heeled shoes to make them look taller or larger than life. By 1580, even men wore them, and a person with authority or wealth was often referred to as "well-heeled".&lt;ref name="high_heels"/&gt;

The phrase ''[[barefoot and pregnant]]'' is now used to illustrate a woman's traditional role as a [[homemaker]] and thus her lack of opportunities to socialize or to have a career outside of the home.&lt;ref name="barefoot_and_pregnant"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Ruth I.|title=Ozarks Women: Ignorant, Barefoot, and Pregnant?|url=http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/periodicals/wrv/V9/N8/s87c.htm|accessdate=June 29, 2010|newspaper=West River Valley Historical Quarterly|date=December 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used in the early 20th century, possibly by Arthur E.

[[File:Udaipur girl.jpg|thumb|Barefoot girl in [[Udaipur]], India]]
Bare feet have come to symbolize innocence or childhood in a glorifying perception of freedom from real-life requirements. The connection to childhood and innocence, as well as the simple joys of country life, are embodied in the poem "[[The Barefoot Boy]]" by [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], published in 1855.&lt;ref name="Whittier_John"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ravitch|first=Diane|title=The American reader: words that moved a nation| year=2000| publisher=HarperCollins| isbn=0-06-273733-3| pages=140–43| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZhJQCsOCgGgC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=the+barefoot+boy+by+john+greenleaf+whittier&amp;q=the%20barefoot%20boy%20by%20john%20greenleaf%20whittier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the book ''[[Dancing Barefoot (book)|Dancing Barefoot]]'' by ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' actor [[Wil Wheaton]] features five short stories that chronicle his journey from childhood and youth through to maturity and self-acceptance.&lt;ref name="Wheaton_Wil"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheaton|first=Wil|title=Dancing Barefoot|year=2004|publisher=Monolith Press|isbn=0-596-00674-8|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gDG67vii624C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dancing+barefoot&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious aspects===
In most religions, the exposure of bare feet is regarded as a sign of humility and subjection. Some religious practitioners have taken a vow of Gospel poverty, while there are certain convents where going barefoot is obligatory ([[Convent of Las Descalzas Reales]], [[Poor Clares]], [[Colettine Poor Clares]]). With regard to the use of footwear as a display of status, the religious and common art of many cultures throughout the world shows a person without shoes symbolizing either extreme poverty or the state of captivity and unfree servitude.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMello|first=Margo|title=Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia|year=2009|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-313-35714-5|pages=30–32|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=barefoot+middle+ages&amp;q=barefoot%20middle%20ages}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thailand]], Master Jinshen, a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, walks {{convert|20|km|mi|sp=us}} per day barefoot as a reminder to others who pursue a material life to protect and be concerned for [[Mother Nature]]. He states that he does this to follow Buddhist rules, to lead the people to the path of virtue, and to develop his Buddhist spirit.&lt;ref name="Buddhist_Monk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lin|first=You Hsueh|title=Thai monk walks million miles on barefoot|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20100213-198496.html|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[Asia One News]]|date=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary in Judaism and some Christian denominations to go barefoot while mourning.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt; Some Christian churches practice barefoot [[pilgrimage]] traditions, such as the ascent of [[Croagh Patrick]] in Ireland at night while barefoot (although the nighttime part is no longer encouraged).&lt;ref name="Castlebar_News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayo Mountain Rescue Team appeal to pilgrims for safety on holy mountain|url=http://www.castlebar.ie/news/article_2671.shtml|accessdate=June 29, 2010|newspaper=Castlebar News|date=July 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many religions, it is common to remove shoes when entering a place considered holy. For example, in the [[Book of Exodus]], [[Moses]] was instructed to remove his shoes before approaching the burning bush:

{{cquote|Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest [is] holy ground ({{bibleverse|Exodus|3:5|KJV}}).}}

Anyone entering a [[mosque]] or a [[Hindu temple]], including a visitor, is expected to remove his or her shoes; racks for the storage of shoes are usually provided at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goseasia.about.com/od/travelplanning/a/mosque-dos-and-donts.htm|title=Mosque etiquette|work=Southeast Asia travel|publisher=about.com|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/pujaonline/puja/temples.html|title=Worship in Hindu temples|publisher=pujaonline|accessdate=10 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625094917/http://www.asia.si.edu/pujaonline/puja/temples.html#|archive-date=2012-06-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foot washing]], or ceremonial washing of others' feet, is associated with humility in Christianity, and Jesus Christ is recorded in the [[New Testament]] as washing the feet of his disciples to serve them during the [[Last Supper]]. Christians who practice foot washing today do so to bring them closer to Jesus and to fill them with a sense of humility and service. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] show their respect and humility for the [[Pope]] by kissing his feet. In a similar manner, Hindus show love and respect to a [[guru]] by touching his bare feet (called [[pranam]]). It is customary to show one's respect by walking barefoot around [[Raj Ghat]], the monument to [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt; Both United States President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] paid him this honor.&lt;ref name="Barefoot_Bush"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barefoot Bush pays tribute to Mahatma|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Barefoot-Bush-pays-tribute-to-Mahatma/articleshow/1436126.cms|accessdate=June 29, 2010|newspaper=The Times of India|date=March 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Imperial Japan]]ese period, removing one's shoes in the presence of a person of higher status was a sign of showing one's own humility, subordination, and respect towards their status.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt;

Christian congregations of men and women that go entirely barefoot or wear sandals include the [[Discalced]], like the [[Discalced Carmelites]] (1568), the [[Congregation of the Feuillants|Feuillants]] ([[Cistercians]], 1575), the [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarians]] (1594), the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarians]] (1604), and the [[Passionist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many branches of [[Romani culture]] across the world, it is traditional for women to dance barefoot.

===Firewalking===
[[Firewalking]] is the practice of walking barefoot over hot coals. It has been practiced by many people and cultures in all parts of the world, with the earliest known reference dating back to [[Iron Age India]] – c. 1200 BC.&lt;ref name="Willey_David"&gt;{{cite web|last=Willey|first=David|title=Firewalking Myth vs Physics|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dwilley/Fire/FireTxt/fire.html|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|accessdate=June 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100606040454/http://www.pitt.edu/~dwilley/Fire/FireTxt/fire.html| archivedate= 6 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used as a [[rite of passage]], as a test of an individual's strength and courage, or, in religion, as a test of one's faith. Today, it is often used in corporate and team-building seminars and self-help workshops as a confidence-building exercise. Firewalking implies the belief that the feat requires the aid of a supernatural force, strong faith, or on an individual's ability to focus on "mind over matter".&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt; Modern physics has largely debunked this, showing that the amount of time the foot is in contact with the ground is not enough to induce a burn, combined with the fact that [[coal]] is not a very good conductor of heat.&lt;ref name="Willey_David"/&gt;

==Barefoot customs by country==
{{globalize|date=June 2015}}

===Australia===
It is common for Australians, particularly young people, to be barefoot in public places, especially during summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/season-of-the-shoeless/story-e6frg8h6-1226732901337 |title=Season of the shoeless |publisher=Theaustralian.com.au |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonald's]] launched a summer advertisement in 2012 featuring a customer running barefoot through the hot carpark to the restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignbrief.com/2012/11/mcdonalds-gets-set-for-summer.html |title=McDonald's gets set for summer with launch of 'Do Summer' campaign via DDB Sydney  |publisher=Campaignbrief.com Australia|date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some rural and remote areas, such as the [[Northern Territory]], Western NSW, regional Queensland and many islands, students often attend school barefoot. On [[Lord Howe Island]] the [[Lord Howe Island Board]] has described the fact pupils at the government-run Lord Howe Island Central School are allowed to attend school barefoot as a part of the "island lifestyle" and a "community asset".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhib.nsw.gov.au/sites/lordhowe/files/public/images/documents/lhib/Community/lhi%20community%20strategy%20final%20august%202010.pdf |format=PDF |title=Lord Howe Island Community Strategy |publisher=Lhib.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===

Being barefoot in public is more common during warmer months, and often accepted as a social norm, however this does not extend to metropolitan cities such as London, but more for rural areas and more common for young children and teenagers. Some British schools also allow children to attend school barefoot in warmer months, and encourage it for indoor and outdoor physical education lessons. The [[National Health Service]] has recommended that people "go barefoot or wear open-toed sandals whenever you can in the hot weather...to help stop your feet getting sweaty and smelly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/foothealth/Pages/Summerfeet.aspx |title=Summer feet tips  |publisher=Nhs.uk Choices|date=2014-04-14 |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa barefoot walking in public is part of the predominantly white Afrikaans speaking culture, although English speaking people also often walk barefoot in public, especially in the summer months and in cities such as Cape Town.
The National Guidelines on School Uniform list shoes as an optional item&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=8NYok1lRKBs%3D&amp;tabid=453&amp;mid=469 |title=Schedule : National Guidelines on School Uniform |publisher=Education.gov.za |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Draft Guidelines state "Pupils, especially in lower grades, should also
be permitted to attend without shoes in hot weather". Most children attend school barefoot. In many schools, the dress codes either encourage kids to attend school barefoot or prefer kids to attend school barefoot, especially in the summer months.
Some South African schools have sport uniforms where bare feet are compulsory, such as primary school rugby. Another sport where bare feet for kids are compulsory is "tou trek" or tug of war. Being barefoot in public is generally tolerated.  In South African shopping malls, stores, and events, it is not an uncommon sight to see barefoot adults, kids and especially teenagers and young adults.

=== United States ===
In some parts of the United States, where [[taboos]] against barefoot walking are strong, it is common for people to wear the same shoes indoors and outdoors, and for guests to keep their shoes on when visiting other people's houses. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Removing the footwear and making a captive go barefoot has been one of the first conventional methods to tag and identify [[prisoner]]s in most civilizations. It was a usual feature and often the principle element of early [[prison uniform]]s. The visual aspect of bare feet is therefore used to contrast the conventional appearance as footwear is regarded an obligatory clothing feature in urbanized cultures.

Besides the indicatory aspect going in bare feet restricts the freedom of action in many situations. A barefooted person is therefore disadvantaged opposite a shod person in many practical respects. This aspect is often used to exercise physical control over individuals in captivity.

A barefoot person is usually disadvantaged in a physical confrontation against shod individuals. Drastically more severe injuries can be sustained especially by a kicking person outfitted with footwear in contrast to a person in bare feet. For this reason shoes are considered [[deadly weapon]]s by [[penal law]]s of most countries.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Bare feet on the other hand present an opportune and vulnerable target for the application of force. These effects are usually desired by correctional or police officers primarily in confrontational situations with antagonistic individuals. The risk of personal injury is therefore notably reduced and the situation can often be resolved more efficiently.

Another main objective is preventing and counteracting potential attempts of [[prison escape]].
Without the protection of the feet that shoes provide, the locomotion of an unshod person is more difficult in the majority of exterior environments, so a potential fugitive is easier to retrieve in many cases. Detainees are often discouraged from attempting escape by this measure alone.&lt;ref name="Tewksbury escape"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police capture man who escaped from Tewksbury police station.|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/breakingnews/ci_18259469|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A barefoot person experiences certain discomfort in daily life situations. The desire to be protected from the common inconveniences of the ground, mostly due to coarse textures or adverse temperatures, prompted humans to make use of footwear in [[ancient history]]. Incidentally the traditional visual appearance of civilized societies was established, including footwear as an obligatory feature.
A forced exclusion from the conveniences and also appearance of footwear typically creates an frequent awareness of being vulnerable, therefore it can have an intimidating effect on a person. The enforcement of bare feet often creates a consciousness of being powerless and degraded notably on prisoners, as they typically cannot relieve this situation on their own.&lt;ref name="zimbabwe_prisoners"&gt;{{cite news|title=Long hours in a Harare jail.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2018917.stm|accessdate=July 18, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=June 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the practical effects are typically achieved effortlessly, keeping captives or prisoners barefoot has been cross-culturally practiced since antiquity.&lt;ref name="Biblical studies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biblical studies: Footwear.|url=https://www.bibelwissenschaft.de/stichwort/27353/|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also commonly practiced to identify [[slavery|slaves]] in former times.

===Slave codes===
[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - The Slave Market - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Barefooted oriental slaves (''Jean-Léon Gérôme – The Slave Market'')]]
[[File:Slave dance to banjo, 1780s.jpg|thumb|Barefooted slaves in North America, 1780s]]

Since ancient times, it is a common practice in civil societies to wear footwear as a standard feature. In contrast to this convention, ''slave codes'' often decreed that slaves go barefoot. For example, the [[Cape Town]] slave code stated that "Slaves must go barefoot and must carry passes."&lt;ref name="WCG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Town and Surrounds.|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/public_info/P/82884/3/|publisher=westerncape.gov.za|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case in the majority of states that abolished slavery later in history, as most images from the respective historical period suggest that slaves were barefoot.&lt;ref name="slavery_brazil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery in Brazil.|url=http://histclo.com/act/work/slave/am/cou/bra/sab-sla.html|publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing]accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To quote Brother Riemer (1779): "[the slaves] are, even in their most beautiful suit, obliged to go barefoot. Slaves were forbidden to wear shoes. This was a prime mark of distinction between the free and the bonded and no exceptions were permitted." &lt;ref name="living_conditions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Living conditions of slaves.|url=http://surinamslavery.blogspot.com/2008/10/chapter-6-living-conditions-of-slaves.html|publisher=Historical Boys' Clothing]accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoes have been regarded as badges of freedom and signs of empowerment since early human history, while going barefoot designated a rather low social rank, often having the status of an unfree person. Using the symbolic meaning of shoes to display a respectable social status and also being vested with authority, people have ceremonially been issued with footwear as is mentioned in the bible "But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet ({{bibleverse|Luke|15:22|KJV}})". Forcing individuals to go barefoot by taking away their shoes and disallowing or hindering them to be worn accordingly has the reversed meaning. While since ancient societies the standard form of appearance commonly includes footwear as an implicit feature, the imagery or bare feet is often used to indicate submission, subjugation or dependence, in certain contexts also being disarmed or disempowered. &lt;br&gt;Therefore, this detail has become an informal and sometimes even formal law in societies practicing slavery. A barefooted human could be unmistakably identified as unfree and be attributed with the lowest social status on the spot. As a consequence appearing barefooted in any social situation was proscribed for common citizens and strictly avoided. &lt;br&gt;In many US states this perception is prevalent to this day as everyday shoes are typically also worn in the private space and being barefooted is effectively placed under taboo (see [[Barefoot#Cultural aspects|above]]).

In certain societies this rule pertains to this day where slavery is still unofficially practiced. The [[Tuareg]] are known still to practice slavery and force their slaves to go barefoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0/Doc~E19E0D1A29403492E9787E7A392A3FFAE~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Niger: Ehemalige Sklavin erhält Entschädigung |last=Scheen|first=Von Thomas|date=2008-10-31|website=faz.net|language=DE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031151116/http://www.faz.net/s/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0/Doc~E19E0D1A29403492E9787E7A392A3FFAE~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|archive-date=2008-10-31|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment===
In several countries of the world [[prison]] inmates have to remain barefoot under regulatory constraint.
In history this was common practice in most civilizations as bare feet were commonly received as a characteristic of unfree individuals. It also marked the first means of visually marking [[prisoner]]s in terms of a [[prison uniform]].

In [[Germany]] it was common practice during the [[Nazism|Nazi-era]] to keep especially female prisoners uniformly barefoot. In particular camps the women also had to perform forced labor in their bare feet, at times even under adverse weather conditions. This was implemented as means to intimidate the detained individuals and dampen renitency as well as to reduce the expenses for clothing items. It was also part of the then prevalent practice in Nazi-Germany to victimize prisoners.&lt;ref name="DeMello_Margo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jewish Women of Ravensbrück Concentration Camp"&gt;{{cite book |first=Rochelle G. |last=Saidel |title=The Jewish Women of Ravensbruck Concentration Camp |url=

Within women's penitentiaries in [[socialism|socialist]] [[East Germany]] (German Democratic Republic) especially [[political prisoner]]s who were regarded as opponents of the regime could have their footwear seized and be detained barefoot as an aggravation of their penalty.&lt;ref name="DDR-Gefängnis Hoheneck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/familie/article1924314/Das-Unrecht-verfolgt-mich-bis-an-mein-Lebensende.html|title=DDR-Gefängnis Hoheneck: 'Das Unrecht verfolgt mich – bis an mein Lebensende'  |author=Maggie Riepl|date=10 March 2012|work=Berliner Morgenpost |location= Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earmarking of captives by forcing them to go in bare feet was also practiced specifically on imprisoned women in parts of the United States until the early 20th century. It was then common practice by penal institutions particularly in [[Texas]] to exclude female prisoners from being issued with any kind of footwear, by this means keeping them barefoot throughout. Contrary to this measure adequate shoes were provided for male convicts as a matter of course. There were no apparent security motives for this unequal treatment; it was however practiced to point out the evident [[hierarchy]] between male and female detainees. The according structure of subordination of the female prisoners also towards the male convicts was therefore showcased in an evident and palpable way. It also conformed to the notion of the criminal courts, who widely saw prisoners as official slaves of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/criminal-justice/prisons-and-prisoners-rights/prisoners-rights|title=Prisoners' Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cliffsnotes.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522040456/http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/criminal-justice/prisons-and-prisoners-rights/prisoners-rights|archive-date=2016-05-22|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this an [[analogy]] to actual former slaves was drawn, who were often forced to remain barefoot as well (see above). As going shoeless is placed under a more or less strict social taboo in most regions of the US (see above), being forced to go entirely barefoot determined the degradation to the lowest social rank for the incarcerated women. This arbitrary and victimizing measure was an apparent token for the general [[discrimination]] against incarcerated women, who unlike male prisoners did not have the right to claim legal remedies at that time.&lt;ref name="Gendered Justice in the American West: Women Prisoners in Men's Penitentiaries"&gt;{{cite book |first=Anne M. |last=Butler |title=Gendered Justice in the American West: Women Prisoners in Men's Penitentiaries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4IdxKAdM8cC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=texas+worked+at+the+farm+camps+barefoot&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VZpMUar1Gsrfswa53YC4Ag&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20worked%20at%20the%20farm%20camps%20barefoot&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women in Prison: A Reference Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |title= Women in Prison: A Reference Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpSjVQ0u9zwC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=texas+worked+at+the+farm+camps+barefoot&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VZpMUar1Gsrfswa53YC4Ag&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20worked%20at%20the%20farm%20camps%20barefoot&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Women in the American West"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gordon Moris Bakken |author2=Brenda Farrington |title=Encyclopedia of Women in the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9zIeyugktEC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=texas+worked+at+the+farm+camps+barefoot&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VZpMUar1Gsrfswa53YC4Ag&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20worked%20at%20the%20farm%20camps%20barefoot&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present ISIS usually deprives their captives of footwear, presumably in order to identify them more readily and prevent escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestgore.com/execution/isis-video-truckloads-men-lead-to-slaughter-execution/|title=ISIS removes shoes of captives|work=smh.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bible there are multiple passages stating that a potent way to inflict humiliation on another human being lies in taking away his or her shoes and forcing the individual to go barefoot. Ritual customs therefore consisted of publicly taking away a disgraced person's shoes. This resulted in the individual being defamed as a "barefooter" culminating in the loss of social standing. On the other hand, taking off the shoes of one's own will and voluntarily exposing one's bare feet is regarded as a token of submission and humility by the bible. This included the subjection under higher powers as well as a mundane authority. Therefore, it was concluded to be imperative that prisoners or captives were to be kept barefoot and in light clothing as a token of their subjugation.&lt;ref name="Biblical studies"/&gt;

===Inquisition and witch trials===
During the era of the Catholic [[Inquisition]] it was commonly believed that women practicing [[witchcraft]] had their ability to use sinister powers largely diminished if they were forced to remain barefoot. As a consequence first of all the just arrested woman routinely had her footwear taken away, ensuring that her feet remained unclothed at all events. Due to interpretations of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' it was believed that in case a witch was not strictly kept in her bare feet she could still cast a spell on people by just looking at them. As the prosecutors wanted to avoid any risk, it was seen to it that the bare feet of the accused woman were constantly visible, so to convince themselves at any moment.

During questioning or in court the accused women often had to stand on a consecrated spot with the soles of their bare feet touching the sanctified area. This was believed to completely inhibit any of their purported magic powers. Accordingly, the women were forbidden to look at the prosecutors when their bare feet were not strictly in place. To further ensure safety they were often lead in walking backwards when facing the prosecution. They were allowed to turn around only if their bare feet could clearly be seen to be within the bounded spot.
As the accused women naturally could not use any magic while they were tried, this assumption became an accepted doctrine.
Accordingly, contemporary depictions about inquisition proceedings or similar situations portray the tried women barefooted in almost every case.&lt;ref name=Memminger&gt;''Das verhexte Kloster: Nach den Akten dargestellt'' (trans. ''The bewitched cloister: portrayed according to official records'') by [[Anton Memminger]], published 1904. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporal punishment==
[[File:Foot whipping.JPG|thumb|Demonstration of "bastinado"]]
The [[Sole (foot)|soles]] of a person's bare feet also serve as a target for [[corporal punishment]], commonly referred to as "bastinado" ([[foot whipping]]). This method is mainly used in the context of penal functions and situations of detention or incarceration.

The practice of foot whipping is still officially employed in several [[Middle East]]ern nations where the term ''falaka'' is customary. In history, bastinado was frequently practiced in Western countries as well. Among others, it was commonly used in [[Germany|German]] territories, where it was employed until the end of the [[Nazism|Nazi-era]], mainly within the [[reformatory]] and [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] system. In certain facilities it even continued to be used during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="kurier.at"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wimmersdorf: 270 Schläge auf die Fußsohlen|url=http://kurier.at/chronik/niederoesterreich/wimmersdorf-270-schlaege-auf-die-fusssohlen/30.980.261|work=kurier.at| accessdate=2014-03-03|trans-title=Wimmersdorf: 270 blows on the soles of the feet|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="krone.at"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krone.at/Oesterreich/Berichte_ueber_Folter_in_Kinder-Heim_auf_der_Hohen_Warte-Schwere_Vorwuerfe-Story-316489|title=Berichte über Folter in Kinder-Heim auf der Hohen Warte|work=krone.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rejali&gt;''Torture and Democracy'' von Darius Rejali. S. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cesereanu"&gt;Ruxandra Cesereanu: ''An Overview of Political Torture in the Twentieth Century''. pp. 124f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The beatings usually aim at the muscular tissue within the vaults of the foot ([[longitudinal arch of the foot]]), omitting the bone structure of the ball and the heel. The vaults are highly touch-sensitive and therefore susceptible to pain due to the tight clustering of [[nerve|nerve endings]].

As bastinado causes substantial suffering for the victim while [[physical evidence]] remains largely undetectable after some time, it is frequently used for [[interrogation]] and [[torture]] in rogue regimes as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Torture and Democracy'' by Darius Rejali. pp. 275f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and entertainment==
Many singers and dancers perform on stage barefoot. The classical dance of [[Cambodia]] had its roots in the holy dances of the legendary seductresses (''[[apsaras]]'') of ancient Cambodia and attained its high point during the [[Angkor]] period in its interpretations of the Indian epics, especially the ''[[Ramayana]]''. Cambodian dancers were well-born women of the king's harem and danced barefoot, with the feet turned outwards and the legs slightly bent at the knee to cushion the movements of the upper body. The unimpeded movement of the foot was essential to the art. When the land was invaded by the Thai, the dancers were taken to the Thai court, where their art was adapted and continued to flourish.&lt;ref name="Cambodian_Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |author=Colet, John|author2=Joshua Eliot|author3=Abigail Vertigan |year=2002 |title=Cambodian Handbook |publisher=Footprint |isbn=1-903471-40-0 |page=218 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3nVUxKL29ZwC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=cambodia+dance+bare+foot+feet&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambodia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Ian |year=2000 |title=Cambodia |publisher=Oxfam GB |isbn=0-85598-430-9 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bK11j2IdbC0C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=cambodia+dance+bare+foot+feet&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barefoot dance movement of the early 20th century challenged the received laws of classical dance and the broader laws of social decorum. For decades, the bare foot had been perceived as obscene, and no matter how determined barefoot dancers were to validate their art with reference to spiritual, artistic, historic, and organic concepts, barefoot dancing was inextricably linked in the public mind with indecency and sexual taboo. In 1908, [[Maud Allan]] shocked and fascinated London theatre-goers with her barefoot dance of desire in ''Salome'', and scandalous tributes positioned her as the embodiment of lust. For many, barefoot dancing represented not only the freedom and horror of modern sexuality but the progress and decline of high culture.&lt;ref name="Benstock"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Benstock, Shari |editor2=Ferriss, Suzanne |year=2001 |title=Footnotes: On Shoes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=0-8135-2870-4 |pages=276–78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tUK8BP7OOJQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Footnotes:+On+Shoes&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isadora Duncan (grayscale).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dancer [[Isadora Duncan]] performing barefoot during her 1915–18 American tour]]
[[California]]n [[Isadora Duncan]] revolutionized dance in the Western world by jettisoning the [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] and the [[pointe shoe]] of classical [[ballet]] and scandalized audiences by performing works of her own choreography in flowing draperies and bare feet. She anticipated the modern [[women's liberation movement]] by urging women to rid themselves of corsets and matrimony.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{cite book |author=Needham, Maureen |year=2002 |title=I See America Dancing: Selected Readings, 1685–2000 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-06999-4|page=174 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=powGjotbu9kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=I+See+America+Dancing:+Selected+Readings,+1685-2000&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan divorced the bare foot from perceptions of obscenity and made a conscious effort to link barefoot dancing to ideals such as "nudity, childhood, the idyllic past, flowing lines, health, nobility, ease, freedom, simplicity, order, and harmony". She believed her utopian dance vision and program would ameliorate the perceived ills of modern life and restore the world to the imagined perfection of Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name="Benstock" /&gt;

The 1954 film ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'' tells the fictional story of Maria Vargas (portrayed by [[Ava Gardner]]), a Spanish [[cabaret]] dancer of simple origins who frequently went barefoot. She was cast in a movie by writer and director Harry Dawes (portrayed by [[Humphrey Bogart]]) and became a major star. In 1978, [[Ina Garten]] purchased a specialty food store in [[The Hamptons]] named ''[[Barefoot Contessa]]'', after the movie. She liked the name because it went well with her simple and elegant cooking style. She sold the store in 1999 and wrote her first book, ''The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook'', which became one of the best-selling cookbooks of the year. She would go on to write more cookbooks and, in 2002, started production of a television show on the [[Food Network]], also named the ''Barefoot Contessa'', which continues to run.&lt;ref name="Ina_Garten"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ina Garten (biography)|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/ina-garten/index.html|publisher=[[Food Network]]|accessdate=July 10, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630134851/http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/ina-garten/index.html| archivedate= 30 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are risks and benefits associated with going barefoot. Footwear provides some protection from puncture wounds from glass, nails, rocks, or thorns as well as abrasions, bruises, heat burns, electrical shock, and [[frostbite]]—but studies of people who habitually walk barefoot have consistently found that these problems are minimal, with only about 0.89% of barefoot people having any kind of foot complaint linked to walking barefoot (including temporary conditions such as abrasions) or having the tops of the feet uncovered.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Feet that have never worn shoes rarely exhibit problems such as bunions, corns, and "[[Flat feet|fallen arches]]",&lt;ref name="2300 children"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao UB, Joseph B |title=The influence of footwear on the prevalence of flat foot.

Since there is no artificial protection of the bare foot, some of the possible issues include cuts, abrasions, bruises, or puncture wounds from glass, nails, rocks, or thorns, as well as poisonous plants, animals, or [[parasite]]s that can enter the body through the cuts on an injured bare foot.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Staheli LT |title=Shoes for children: a review |journal=Pediatrics |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=371–75 |year=1991 |pmid=1861942 |doi= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In people who are not habitually barefoot, [[Athlete's foot]] is spread by fungal spores coming into contact with skin that has been weakened and made moist. The fungus is known to only affect around 0.75% of habitually barefoot people in one study and can be prevented by reducing shoe use and keeping the feet dry, particularly after walking through a damp environment where people communally walk barefoot as the fungus only develops under the right conditions, such as when people fail to properly dry their feet after swimming or showering and then put on shoes. Wearing shoes such as flip flops or sandals in these areas can reduce the risk.&lt;ref name="athletes_foot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyde|first=Patricia|title=Athlete's Foot|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/health_problems/skin/athletes_foot.html|publisher=kidshealth.org|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the fungus is very unlikely to develop on a person who goes barefoot all the time.

The [[hookworm]] parasite, found only in warm, moist climates where human [[feces]] contaminated with hookworm larvae has been left in places where it might come into contact with human skin, can burrow through a bare human foot (or any part of the body that comes into contact with it).&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/hookworm/factsht_hookworm.htm |title=Hookworm Infection |date=September 11, 2008 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=August 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000301095412/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/hookworm/factsht_hookworm.htm |archivedate=March 1, 2000 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the parasite tends to occur mainly in mud and cesspools, its spread cannot be stopped by most standard shoes{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} since the larvae can penetrate fabric and small holes. The parasite may spread through contaminated material coming into contact with any part of the body, such as through flecks of mud splashing on an ankle or leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trop|first=Am J|title=Penetration by Infective Hookworm Larvae of the Materials Used in the Manufacture of Shoes|url=http://www.ajtmh.org/content/s1-9/1/79.citation|accessdate=26 October 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hookworm]] parasite is relatively mild, has few symptoms, and can pass completely unnoticed when the infestation level is low enough. Since the hookworm infection is very cheap and easy to treat, and since it requires infected feces to come into contact with human skin within a particular time period, eradicating hookworm is mainly a matter of hygiene (including the building of proper toilet and waste-disposal facilities) and mass-treatment. In very cold weather, shoes can provide thermal insulation, protecting against [[frostbite]].

Issues that can develop as a result of someone who has always worn shoes going barefoot include calf pain or [[Achilles tendinitis]] or [[plantar fasciitis]] due to shortening of the Achilles tendon and the foot being underdeveloped, due to regular use of shoes.

In the United States, during the period of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movement of the 1960s]], business establishments would deny admittance to barefoot [[hippie]]s arguing that health regulations required that shoes be worn.&lt;ref name="MillerJoe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/1088537.html |title=Going barefoot |last=Miller |first=Joe |date=May 29, 2008 |work=[[The News and Observer]] |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602011040/http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/1088537.html |archivedate=June 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a belief by many in nonexistent [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] or local health department regulations preventing people from going to stores, restaurants, and other establishments without shoes.

==Sports and recreation==
[[File:Blue leggings.jpg|thumb|right|A woman sitting in a library with her bare feet on a chair.]]
There are several recreational activities one can participate in while barefoot. Those involved in [[water sports]] such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[water polo]] almost always participate barefoot due to the difficulty of swimming with footwear.

Other common activities performed barefoot include yoga, pilates, [[hiking]], running, driving, water skiing, [[touch rugby]], [[soccer]], [[beach volleyball]], [[surfing]], [[tubing (recreation)|tubing]], [[gymnastics]], [[Slacklining]], and [[martial arts]]. [[Wrestling]] can be done barefoot. Although most modern [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] wrestlers wear shoes, [[sumo wrestling]], [[Yağlı güreş]] (oil or "Turkish" wrestling), and [[mud wrestling]] are commonly done while barefoot. [[Fiji]]an wrestler [[Jimmy Snuka|Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka]] of the WWE has wrestled barefoot as well.&lt;ref name="Traina_Jimmy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Traina |first=Jimmy |title=Favorite Wrestlers of All Time |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_blogs/scorecard/jimmys_blog/2006/06/favorite-wrestlers-of-all-time.html |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=June 12, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407185431/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_blogs/scorecard/jimmys_blog/2006/06/favorite-wrestlers-of-all-time.html |archivedate=April 7, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American football]] is not traditionally a barefoot sport, though several [[placekicker]]s have preferred to kick barefoot, including [[Tony Franklin (kicker)|Tony Franklin]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Rich Karlis]] of the [[Denver Broncos]].&lt;ref name="Gehman_Jim"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gehman|first=Jim|title=Where Are They Now: PK Tony Franklin|url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12521|accessdate=June 27, 2010|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Eagles]]|date=May 5, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100619135621/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12521| archivedate= 19 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss_Irv"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Irv|title=Karlis a standout as barefoot kicker|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_11559948?source=bb|accessdate=June 27, 2010|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two schools of thought involved in barefoot placekicking were that the lack of a shoe provided the kicker with a better "feel" for the ball and greater control over its trajectory. The second theory is that shoes and socks absorbed kinetic energy, and kicking flesh-to-leather created more [[torque]].&lt;ref name="Klosterman_Chuck"&gt;{{cite news|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|title=A brilliant idea!

===Hiking===
People of all ages all over the world can participate in barefoot hiking, gathering for walks through forest and hiking trails sans footwear. Barefoot hikers claim that they feel a sense of communion with the earth and enjoy the sheer pleasure of feeling more of the world with their feet.&lt;ref name="Todras-Whitehill"&gt;{{cite news|last=Todras-Whitehill|first=Ethan|title=Footloose and Boot Free: Barefoot Hiking.|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/09/22/travel/escapes/22hike.html|accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several clubs throughout North America practicing regular barefoot hikes, including the Barefoot Hikers of Minnesota, Seattle Barefoot Hikers, East Bay Barefoot Hikers, the Barefoot Hikers and Grass Walkers of Greater Kansas City, and the Barefoot Hikers of Connecticut.&lt;ref name="Todras-Whitehill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LADailyNews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pauly |first=Brett |title=Sole Survivors: New shoeless joes are hitting dusty trails around San Francisco Bay and beyond. |url=http://barefooters.org/hikers/publicity/la_daily_news.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961029205731/http://www.barefooters.org/hikers/publicity/la_daily_news.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 29, 1996 |accessdate=June 26, 2010 |newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News |date=March 21, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barefoot Hiking Groups|url=http://www.barefoothub.com/barefoot-hiking-groups/|website=The Barefoot Hub|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European nations, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, there are barefoot parks or walks.&lt;ref name="Todras-Whitehill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barefoot_walk 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Wena Alun|title=Challenge senses on barefoot walk. |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_west/7955356.stm|accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barfuss_park"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Barefoot Parks in Europe.|url=http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm|publisher=barfusspark.info|accessdate=June 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100605081950/http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm| archivedate= 5 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parks are kept clean and maintained on a regular basis, so that barefoot hiking can be done in an environment suitable for people who are habitually shod. Barefoot parks usually include a lot of adventure stations, allowing visitors to experience the feeling of soil textures underfoot; to wade through rivers, mud, brooks, or ponds; and to exercise [[foot gymnastics]], [[Equilibrioception|balancing]], and climbing. The ''Barfußpfad'' (barefoot trail) at Bad Sobernheim in Germany attracts over 100,000 visitors annually and has seen approximately 1 million visitors since its inception in 1999.&lt;ref name="BadSobernheim"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fast eine Million Menschen.|url=http://www.allgemeine-zeitung.de/region/bad-kreuznach-bad-sobernheim-kirn/vg-bad-sobernheim/sobernheim/7927509.htm|accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=Allgemeine Beitung |date=November 25, 2009|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was first developed in the 19th century by [[Sebastian Kneipp]], one of the founders of the [[Naturopathy|Naturopathic medicine]] movement. He believed that applying your feet to a range of natural stimuli would have therapeutic benefits. This is related to the ancient practice of [[reflexology]], practiced in China for thousands of years for relaxation and to promote longevity.&lt;ref name="Wignall_Alice"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wignall|first=Alice|title=Get your socks off|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/25/healthandwellbeing.walkingholidays|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barefoot running can be dangerous, especially to runners who do not adequately prepare or give their feet time to adapt to the new style. Many injuries are possible, such as injuries to the [[Achilles tendon]] or [[plantar fascia]], or [[stress fracture]]s in the [[metatarsal]] bones or lower leg. Barefoot runners who do not prepare their bodies could provide, "a stimulus plan for podiatrists, orthopedists, and physical therapists."&lt;ref name="Carey_Art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey |first=Art |title=Well Being: Running barefoot has not-so-obvious hazards |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20100628_Well_Being__Running_barefoot_has_not-so-obvious_hazards.html |accessdate=July 2, 2010|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=June 28, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100702011452/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20100628_Well_Being__Running_barefoot_has_not-so-obvious_hazards.html| archivedate= 2 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official position on barefoot running by the [[American Podiatric Medical Association]] states that there is not enough research on the immediate- and long-term benefits of the practice and that individuals should consult a podiatrist with a strong background in sports medicine to make an informed decision on all aspects of their running and training programs.&lt;ref name="APMA_statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=APMA Position Statement on Barefoot Running|url=http://www.apma.org/Media/position.cfm?ItemNumber=995|publisher=[[American Podiatric Medical Association]]|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative to barefoot running is to wear thin-soled shoes with minimal padding, such as [[moccasin]]s, [[plimsolls]], or [[huarache (running shoe)|huaraches]], which result in similar gait to going barefoot but protect the skin and keep dirt and water off.&lt;ref name="Hersher_Rebecca"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hersher|first=Rebecca|title=Perfect Landing. |url=http://alumni.harvard.edu/stories/perfect-landing |accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=[[Harvard University]]|date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern shoe manufacturers have recently designed footwear to maintain optimum flexibility while providing a minimum amount of protection.

A '''beta reader''' is usually an unpaid test reader of an unreleased work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karen Hellekson|first=Kristina Busse|title=Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet: New Essays|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786454962|pages=15, 43, 172–179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgZsi_DOKoQC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=%22Beta+reader%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=seZYUtvkIqHA4AOL34HgAg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Beta%20reader%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; of literature or other writing (similar to [[Beta tester|beta testing]] in software), who gives feedback from the point of view of an average reader to the author.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-beta-reader.htm|title=What Is a Beta Reader? (with picture)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A beta reader is not a professional and can therefore provide advice and comments in the opinions of an average reader&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cocowordcraft.com/menu.html/], Beta Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. This feedback is used by the writer to fix remaining issues with plot, pacing, and consistency. The beta reader also serves as a [[sounding board]] to see if the book has had the intended emotional impact.

== Origin ==
"Beta reader" is an English term originally borrowed from the information technology/software industry where [[Beta tester|beta testers]] try to identify problems in [[Software|a piece of computer software]] before its release.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it differs from other roles ==
A "proofreader" usually only looks at grammar and spelling and is a paid professional. A "critique partner" is a trained writer who "test reads" from the perspective of an author, unlike a beta reader who has little or no experience with writing. A beta reader can also serve as an "alpha reader" when reading a book draft that is still without an ending or is completely unrevised. Typically, a beta reader reviews a draft that has gone through at least one revision.

[[Image:Hartford Residence, Bridgton, ME.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cape Cod–style house c. 1920]]
A '''Cape Cod''' house is a low, broad, single-story frame building with a moderately steep pitched [[gable]]d [[roof]], a large central [[chimney]], and very little ornamentation. Originating in [[New England]] in the 17th century, the simple symmetrical design was constructed of local materials to withstand the stormy, stark weather of [[Cape Cod]].  It features a central front door flanked by multi-paned windows. The space above the 1st floor was often left unfinished, with or without windows on the gable ends.

The style enjoyed a boom in popularity and adaptation to modern needs in the 1930s-1950s, particularly with [[Colonial Revival]] embellishments.  It remains a feature of New England homebuilding.

==History==
[[File:Ephraim Hawley house circa 1880.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Ephraim Hawley House]] built c. 1683]]
The Cape Cod cottage style house originated in the wood building counties of [[England]] and was brought to America by [[Puritan]] [[carpenters]]. The harsh climate of [[New England]] tested the pioneers ingenuity, and by lowering the house and pulling its plan into more of a square footprint, they transported the English [[Hall and parlor house]] we call the Cape Cod cottage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qyqba8HF4OEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20cape%20cod%20cottage%20william%20morgan&amp;pg=PP14#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20cape%20cod%20cottage%20william%20morgan&amp;f=false William Morgan, ''The Cape Cod Cottage'', Princeton Architectural Press, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The style has survived and emerged as a 1- to {{frac|1|1|2}}-story house with wooden [[Window shutter|shutters]] and [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]] or [[Wood shingle|shingle]] exterior. Using local materials &amp;ndash; cedar for roofing and siding shingles, oak and pine for framing and flooring&lt;ref name="Ballinger"&gt;Ballinger, Barbara. "Cozy Cape Cods." Realtor Mag 01 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; settlers built houses locally adapted to New England's extreme winter climate. Temperatures in January and February can drop to -20F, with snow accumulations often reaching several feet.&lt;ref&gt;"Winter in New England." New England Travel Planner.&lt;/ref&gt; To fight the chill, they built massive central chimneys and low ceilinged rooms to conserve heat. The steep roof characteristic of New England homes minimized snow load. Finally, colonists installed shutters on the windows to hold back heavy winds.

The Reverend [[Timothy Dwight IV]] (1752–1817), president of [[Yale University]] from 1795–1817, coined the term "Cape Cod House" after a visit to the Cape in 1800. His observations were published posthumously in ''Travels in New England and New York'' (1821–22).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BSjFmcmsttUC&amp;ots=vglLKxzn2V&amp;dq=Timothy%20Dwight%20Travels%20in%20New%20England%20and%20New%20York&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=cape%20cod%20houses&amp;f=false Timothy Dwight, ''Travels in New England and New York'', William Baynes and Son, London, 1823]&lt;/ref&gt; The style was popularized more broadly in a slightly more elaborate [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] variant popularized in the 1930s–50s, though traditional unornamented capes remain common in New England.

[[Image:Hoyt-BarnumHouse.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Hoyt-Barnum House]] built c. 1699]]

===Colonial and Federal Capes (17th century–early 19th century)===
[[File:Oldest House in Brockton Heights, MA.jpg|thumb|A traditional Cape Cod style farmhouse in Brockton Heights, [[Massachusetts]]]]
[[File:Harlow_Old_Fort_House_in_Plymouth_MA.jpg|thumb|Harlow Old Fort House, an example of the rarer Gambrel-roofed Cape]]
Colonial-era Capes were most prevalent in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] [[United States]] and [[Atlantic Canada]]. They were made of wood, and covered in wide clapboard or shingles, often unpainted, which weathered grey over time. Most houses were small, usually 1,000–2,000 square feet in size. Often windows of different sizes were worked into the gable ends, with those of nine and six panes the most common.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The style has a symmetrical appearance with front door in the center of the house, and a large central chimney that could often accommodate back-to-back fireplaces. The [[master bedroom|main bedroom]] was on the first floor, with an often unfinished loft on the second. A typical early house had no [[dormer]]s and little or no exterior ornamentation.

==Framing and layout==
[[File:Standard Floor Plans for a Cape Cod Cottage- ca. 1940.jpg|thumb|1940 Federal government plans for a three-quarter house designed by [[Eleanor Raymond]]]]
The overwhelming majority of early capes were [[timber framed]], with three bays formed by four [[Bent (structural)|bent]]s.  A few late examples of early capes used stud framing, and [[plank frame]] was also used.

The first Cape Cod houses fall into four categories: the  quarter, half, three-quarter, and full Cape. The comparatively rare quarter cape is a single bay, usually a wider "outside" bay that would become rooms.  It has a single door and a single window on the front, but is full depth. The half Cape is two bays, with a door to one side of the house and two windows on one side of the door; the three-quarter Cape has a door with two windows on one side and a single window on the other, while the full Cape consists of a front door in the center of the home, flanked on each side by two windows.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Ross, Chuck. "Cape Cod-Style Houses: The Colonists' "Starter Homes"." HGTV Pro.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the three categories of early Cape Cod houses were nearly identical in layout. Inside the front door, a central staircase led to the small upper level, which consisted of two children's bedrooms.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; The lower floor consisted of a hall for daily living (including cooking, dining, and gathering) and the parlor, or master bedroom.&lt;ref name="Pilgrim Hall"&gt;Pilgrim Hall. Pilgrim Hall Museum, 18 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some use a different naming system, and call the full-size version a "double cape", but this is used more often for an extended duplex structure.

"High post", also known as "kneewall", capes were originally an uncommon variant, but became more so into the 19th century, and became a feature of cape-derived vernacular architecture in the Midwest.  The posts extend vertically past the first floor, increasing usable space on the second floor and simplifying joinery, at a cost of structural rigidity.
The kneewall was often fenestrated with small low windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Hampshire Architectural Survey Manual|url=https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/programs/documents/appendixe_domesticstyles.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
Over the years owners doubled the full Cape and added wings onto the rear&lt;ref name="Pilgrim Hall" /&gt; or sides, typically single-storied.  Dormers were added for increased space, light, and ventilation. A screened-in porch was sometimes added to one side of the home, rarely the front.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Colonial Revival (1930s–1950s)==
Colonial Revival Cape Cod houses are very similar to Colonial Cape Cod houses, but some have the chimney at one end of the living room on the side of the house. Elaborate replicas were designed for the affluent, while [[architect]]s such as [[Royal Barry Wills]] modernized the Cape for middle-class families&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Richard. The Colonial Revival House. New York, NY: Harry N. Abrams, Incorporated, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; by including modern amenities that addressed demands for increased privacy and technology, including bathrooms, kitchens, and garages.&lt;ref&gt;HPRO_20174_5384502,00.html - "Royal Barry Wills &amp; the History of the Firm." Royal Barry Wills Associates, inc&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations proliferated throughout suburbs which emerged after World War II, and planned communities like [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], [[New York (state)|New York]] offered Cape Cod styled [[tract housing]], particularly to returning soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilgrimhall.org/cchse2.htm Pilgrim Hall Museum, ''The Cape Cod House''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527063610/http://www.pilgrimhall.org/cchse2.htm |date=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:baglione.jpg|thumb|File:baglione.jpg|right|thumb|[[Giovanni Baglione]]. ''Sacred and Profane Love''. 1602–1603, showing dramatic compositional chiaroscuro]]
'''Chiaroscuro''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|k|i|ˌ|ɑː|r|ə|ˈ|s|k|jʊər|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|ˌkjaroˈskuːro|lang}}; [[Italian language|Italian]] for ''light-dark''), in [[art]], is the use of strong [[contrast (vision)|contrasts]] between light and dark, usually bold contrasts affecting a whole composition. It is also a technical term used by artists and [[art historian]]s for the use of contrasts of light to achieve a sense of volume in modelling three-dimensional objects and figures.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of the National Gallery, London [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/chiaroscuro] (accessed 23 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar effects in cinema and photography also are called chiaroscuro.

Further specialized uses of the term include [[chiaroscuro woodcut]] for coloured woodcuts printed with different blocks, each using a different coloured ink; and chiaroscuro drawing for drawings on coloured paper in a dark medium with white highlighting.

The underlying principle is that solidity of form is best achieved by the light falling against it. Artists known for developing the technique include [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Rembrandt]]. It is a mainstay of black and white and [[low-key photography]]. It is one of the modes of painting colour in [[Renaissance art]] (alongside [[cangiante]], [[sfumato]] and [[unione]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Color and Technique in Renaissance Painting: Italy and the North|last=Hall|first=Marcia B.|date=1987|publisher=J.J. Augustin|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origin in the chiaroscuro drawing===
[[File:Christ at Rest, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ at Rest'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], a chiaroscuro drawing using pen and ink and brush, washes, white heightening, on ochre prepared paper]]
The term chiaroscuro originated during the [[Renaissance]] as drawing on coloured paper, where the artist worked from the paper's base tone toward light using white [[gouache]], and toward dark using ink, [[bodycolour]] or [[watercolour]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080421003620/http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/fogg/drawingglossary.html#C#C Harvard Art Museum glossary] (accessed 30 August 2007). See also Metropolitan external link&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/recent_acquisitions/1998/co_rec_eur_1998_15.asp Example from the Metropolitan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220055933/http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/recent_acquisitions/1998/co_rec_eur_1998_15.asp |date=December 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These in turn drew on traditions in [[illuminated manuscript]]s going back to late Roman Imperial manuscripts on [[Purple parchment|purple-dyed vellum]]. Such works are called "'''chiaroscuro drawings'''", but may only be described in modern museum terminology by such formulae as "pen on prepared paper, heightened with white bodycolour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/holbein/rooms/room8.htm|title=Holbein in England - Tate|work=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiaroscuro woodcuts began as imitations of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;David Landau &amp; Peter Parshall, ''The Renaissance Print'', pp.180-84; Yale, 1996, {{ISBN|0-300-06883-2}} - discusses these at length. Also see Metropolitan external link.&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing Italian art, the term sometimes is used to mean painted images in monochrome or two colours, more generally known in English by the French equivalent, [[grisaille]]. The term broadened in meaning early on to cover all strong contrasts in [[Illumination (image)|illumination]] between light and dark areas in art, which is now the primary meaning.

===Chiaroscuro modelling===
[[File:Raffael 045 detail .jpg|thumb|right|Detail of "[[La Fornarina]]" by [[Raphael]], shows delicate modelling chiaroscuro in the body of the model, for example in the shoulder, breast, and arm on the right]]
The more technical use of the term chiaroscuro is the effect of light modelling in [[painting]], [[drawing]], or [[printmaking]], where three-dimensional volume is suggested by the value gradation of colour and the analytical division of light and shadow shapes—often called "[[shading]]". The invention of these effects in the West, [[Sciography|"''skiagraphia''"]] or "shadow-painting" to the Ancient Greeks, traditionally was ascribed to the famous Athenian painter of the fifth century BC, [[Apollodorus (painter)|Apollodoros]]. Although few Ancient Greek paintings survive, their understanding of the effect of light modelling still may be seen in the late-fourth-century BC mosaics of [[Pella]], Macedonia, in particular the ''[[Stag Hunt Mosaic]]'', in the House of the Abduction of Helen, inscribed ''gnosis epoesen'', or 'knowledge did it'.

The technique also survived in rather crude standardized form in [[Byzantine art]] and was refined again in the Middle Ages to become standard by the early fifteenth-century in painting and [[manuscript illumination]] in Italy and Flanders, and then spread to all Western art.

According to the theory of the art historian Marcia B. Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Marcia B.|title=Color and Meaning: Practice and Theory in Renaissance Painting|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-521-45733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has gained considerable acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Canonical Painting Modes by APA|url=http://artpaintingartist.org/the-four-canonical-painting-modes-of-the-renaissance/}}. Retrieved June 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; chiaroscuro is one of four modes of painting colours available to Italian [[High Renaissance]] painters, along with ''[[cangiante]]'', [[sfumato]] and ''[[unione]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Marcia B., ''Rome'' (series "Artistic Centers of the Italian Renaissance"), pp.148-150, 2005, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521624452}}, 9780521624459, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gt5gtrqoKOIC&amp;pg=PA148 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raphael painting illustrated, with light coming from the left, demonstrates both delicate modelling chiaroscuro to give volume to the body of the model, and strong chiaroscuro in the more common sense, in the contrast between the well-lit model and the very dark background of foliage. To further complicate matters, however, the compositional chiaroscuro of the contrast between model and background probably would not be described using this term, as the two elements are almost completely separated. The term is mostly used to describe compositions where at least some principal elements of the main composition show the transition between light and dark, as in the Baglioni and Geertgen tot Sint Jans paintings illustrated above and below.

Chiaroscuro modelling is now taken for granted, but it has had some opponents; namely: the English [[portrait miniaturist]] [[Nicholas Hilliard]] cautioned in his treatise on painting against all but the minimal use we see in his works, reflecting the views of his patron Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]: "seeing that best to show oneself needeth no shadow of place but rather the open light... Her Majesty... chose her place to sit for that purpose in the open alley of a goodly garden, where no tree was near, nor any shadow at all..."&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from Hilliard's ''Art of Limming'', c. 1600, in ''Nicholas Hilliard'', [[Roy Strong]], 2002, p.24, Michael Joseph Ltd, London, {{ISBN|0-7181-1301-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In drawings and prints, modelling chiaroscuro often is achieved by the use of [[hatching]], or shading by parallel lines. Washes, [[stipple]] or dotting effects, and "surface tone" in printmaking are other techniques.

===Chiaroscuro woodcuts===
[[File:Mary Coriolano2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Chiaroscuro woodcut of the Virgin and Child by [[Bartolommeo Coriolano]], created between 1630 and 1655 (digitally restored)]]

Chiaroscuro woodcuts are [[old master print]]s in [[woodcut]] using two or more blocks printed in different colours; they do not necessarily feature strong contrasts of light and dark.  They were first produced to achieve similar effects to chiaroscuro drawings.  After some early experiments in book-printing, the true chiaroscuro woodcut conceived for two blocks was probably first invented by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in Germany in 1508 or 1509, though he backdated some of his first prints and added tone blocks to some prints first produced for monochrome printing, swiftly followed by [[Hans Burgkmair the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 179-192; ''Renaissance Impressions: Chiaroscuro Woodcuts from the Collections of Georg Baselitz and the Albertina, Vienna'', [[Royal Academy]], London, March–June 2014, exhibition guide.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite [[Vasari]]'s claim for Italian precedence in [[Ugo da Carpi]], it is clear that his, the first Italian examples, date to around 1516&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wdct/ho_17.50.1.htm |title=Ugo da Carpi after Parmigianino: Diogenes (17.50.1) &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; But other sources suggest, the first chiaroscuro woodcut to be the ''Triumph of Julius Caesar'', which was created by [[Andrea Mantegna]], an Italian painter, between 1470 and 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Italian Renaissance and Cultural Memory |last=Emison |first=Patricia A. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-107-00526-6 |location=New York |pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view states that: "Lucas Cranach backdated two of his works in an attempt to grab the glory" and that the technique was invented "in all probability" by Burgkmair "who was commissioned by the emperor Maximilian to find a cheap and effective way of getting the imperial image widely disseminated as he needed to drum up money and support for a crusade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/11/revolutionary-chiaroscuro-woodcuts-british-exhibition | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Brown | title=Revolutionary chiaroscuro woodcuts win first British exhibition | date=11 March 2014|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[printmaker]]s who have used this technique include [[Hans Wechtlin]], [[Hans Baldung Grien]], and [[Parmigianino]]. In Germany, the technique achieved its greatest popularity around 1520, but it was used in Italy throughout the sixteenth century. Later artists such as [[Hendrick Goltzius|Goltzius]] sometimes made use of it. In most German two-block prints, the keyblock (or "line block") was printed in black and the tone block or blocks had flat areas of colour. In Italy, chiaroscuro woodcuts were produced without keyblocks to achieve a very different effect.&lt;ref&gt;David Landau &amp; Peter Parshall, ''The Renaissance Print'', pp. 179-202; 273-81 &amp; passim; Yale, 1996, {{ISBN|0-300-06883-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compositional chiaroscuro to Caravaggio===
[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Nativity at Night (Geertgen tot Sint Jans)|Nativity at Night]]'' by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]], c. 1490, after a composition by [[Hugo van der Goes]] of c. 1470; sources of light are the infant Jesus, the shepherds' fire on the hill behind, and the angel who appears to them.]]
Manuscript illumination was, as in many areas, especially experimental in attempting ambitious lighting effects since the results were not for public display. The development of compositional chiaroscuro received a considerable impetus in northern Europe from the vision of the [[Nativity of Jesus]] of Saint [[Bridget of Sweden]], a very popular mystic. She described the infant Jesus as emitting light; depictions increasingly reduced other light sources in the scene to emphasize this effect, and the Nativity remained very commonly treated with chiaroscuro through to the Baroque. [[Hugo van der Goes]] and his followers painted many scenes lit only by candle or the divine light from the infant Christ. As with some later painters, in their hands the effect was of stillness and calm rather than the drama with which it would be used during the Baroque.

Strong chiaroscuro became a popular effect during the sixteenth century in [[Mannerism]] and [[Baroque]] art. Divine light continued to illuminate, often rather inadequately, the compositions of [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], and their many followers. The use of dark subjects dramatically lit by a shaft of light from a single constricted and often unseen source, was a compositional device developed by [[Ugo da Carpi]] (c. 1455 – c. 1523), [[Giovanni Baglione]] (1566–1643), and [[Caravaggio]] (1571–1610), the last of whom was crucial in developing the style of [[tenebrism]], where dramatic chiaroscuro becomes a dominant stylistic device.

===17th and 18th centuries===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - De kruisoprichting.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s ''The Elevation of the Cross'' (1610–1611) is modelled with dynamic chiaroscuro.]]
Tenebrism was especially practiced in [[Spain]] and the Spanish-ruled Kingdom of [[Naples]], by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and his followers. [[Adam Elsheimer]] (1578–1610), a German artist living in Rome, produced several night scenes lit mainly by fire, and sometimes moonlight. Unlike Caravaggio's, his dark areas contain very subtle detail and interest. The influences of Caravaggio and Elsheimer were strong on [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who exploited their respective approaches to tenebrosity for dramatic effect in paintings such as ''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Raising of the Cross]]'' (1610–1611). Artemisia Gentileschi (1593–1656), a Baroque artist who was a follower of Caravaggio, was also an outstanding exponent of tenebrism and chiaroscuro.

A particular genre that developed was the nocturnal scene lit by candlelight, which looked back to earlier northern artists such as Geertgen tot Sint Jans and more immediately, to the innovations of Caravaggio and Elsheimer. This theme played out with many artists from the [[Low Countries]] in the first few decades of the seventeenth century, where it became associated with the [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]] such as [[Gerrit van Honthorst]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]], and with [[Flemish Baroque painter]]s such as [[Jacob Jordaens]]. [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]'s (1606–1669) early works from the 1620s also adopted the single-candle light source. The nocturnal candle-lit scene re-emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]] in the mid-seventeenth century on a smaller scale in the works of [[fijnschilder]]s such as [[Gerrit Dou]] and [[Gottfried Schalken]].

[[File:Gerrit van Honthorst - De koppelaarster.jpg|thumb|left|''The Matchmaker'' by [[Gerrit van Honthorst]]]]Rembrandt's own interest in effects of darkness shifted in his mature works. He relied less on the sharp contrasts of light and dark that marked the Italian influences of the earlier generation, a factor found in his mid-seventeenth-century etchings. In that medium he shared many similarities with his contemporary in Italy, [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], whose work in [[printmaking]] led him to invent the [[monotyping|monotype]].

Outside the Low Countries, artists such as [[Georges de La Tour]] and [[Trophime Bigot]] in France and [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] in England, carried on with such strong, but graduated, candlelight chiaroscuro. [[Watteau]] used a gentle chiaroscuro in the leafy backgrounds of his [[fêtes galantes]], and this was continued in paintings by many French artists, notably [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]]. At the end of the century [[Fuseli]] and others used a heavier chiaroscuro for romantic effect, as did [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] and others in the nineteenth century.

==Use of the term==
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Wright of Derby]] painted several large groups with strong chiaroscuro, such as ''The Orrery''.]]
The French use of the term, ''clair-obscur'', was introduced by the seventeenth-century art-critic [[Roger de Piles]] in the course of a famous argument (''Débat sur le coloris''), on the relative merits of drawing and colour in painting (his ''Dialogues sur le coloris'', 1673,&lt;ref&gt;Le rubénisme en Europe aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles, Volume 16 of Museums at the Crossroads, Michèle-Caroline Heck, University of Michigan, Brepols, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; was a key contribution to the ''Débat'').

In English, the Italian term has been used since at least the late seventeenth century. The term is less frequently used of art after the late nineteenth century, although the [[Expressionist]] and other modern movements make great use of the effect.

Especially since the strong twentieth-century rise in the reputation of Caravaggio, in non-specialist use the term is mainly used for strong chiaroscuro effects such as his, or Rembrandt's. As the [[Tate]] puts it: "Chiaroscuro is generally only remarked upon when it is a particularly prominent feature of the work, usually when the artist is using extreme contrasts of light and shade".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/chiaroscuro Tate Glossary]. Retrieved 30 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Photography and cinema also have adopted the term. For the history of the term, see René Verbraeken, ''Clair-obscur, histoire d’un mot'' (Nogent-le-Roi, 1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verbraeken|first=René|title=Clair-obscur, histoire d’un mot|year=1979|publisher=J. Laget|location=Nogent-le-Roi|isbn=2-85497-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema and photography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2007}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cherkasov.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nikolai Cherkasov]] as [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s film of the same name|{{puic|1=Cherkasov.jpg|log=2009 January 3}}]] --&gt;
''Chiaroscuro'' also is used in cinematography to indicate extreme [[low key]] and high-contrast lighting to create distinct areas of light and darkness in films, especially in black and white films. Classic examples are ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920), ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1939), ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (film)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'' (1941), and the black and white scenes in [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' (1979).

For example, in ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', chiaroscuro lighting is used to create contrast between light and dark [[mise-en-scene]] and figures. The effect of this is primarily to highlight the differences between the capitalist elite and the workers.

In [[photography]], chiaroscuro can be achieved with the use of "[[Rembrandt lighting]]". In more highly developed photographic processes, this technique also may be termed "ambient/natural lighting", although when done so for the effect, the look is artificial and not generally documentary in nature. In particular, [[Bill Henson]] along with others, such as [[W. Eugene Smith]], [[Josef Koudelka]], [[Garry Winogrand]], [[Lothar Wolleh]], [[Annie Leibovitz]], [[Floria Sigismondi]], and [[Ralph Gibson]] may be considered some of the modern masters of chiaroscuro in documentary photography.

[[File:Barry12.jpg|thumb|Still from [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'', some of which was shot using only candlelight]]

Perhaps the most direct intended use of chiaroscuro in filmmaking would be [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Victorian Studies Bulletin". Northeast Victorian Studies Association, v. 9-11, 1985. 1984&lt;/ref&gt; When informed that no lens currently had a wide enough aperture to shoot a costume drama set in grand palaces using only candlelight, Kubrick bought and retrofitted a special lens for these purposes: a modified Mitchell BNC camera and a Zeiss lens manufactured for the rigors of space photography, with a maximum aperture of f/.7. The naturally unaugmented lighting situations in the film exemplified low-key, natural lighting in filmwork at its most extreme outside of the Eastern European/Soviet filmmaking tradition (itself exemplified by the harsh low-key lighting style employed by Soviet filmmaker [[Sergei Eisenstein]]).

[[Sven Nykvist]], the longtime collaborator of [[Ingmar Bergman]], also informed much of his photography with chiaroscuro realism, as did [[Gregg Toland]], who influenced such cinematographers as [[László Kovács (cinematographer)|László Kovács]], [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], and [[Vittorio Storaro]] with his use of deep and selective focus augmented with strong horizon-level key lighting penetrating through windows and doorways. Much of the celebrated [[film noir]] tradition relies on techniques Toland perfected in the early thirties that are related to chiaroscuro (though [[high-key lighting]], stage lighting, frontal lighting, and other effects are interspersed in ways that diminish the chiaroscuro claim).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">The '''Dark Room Collective''' was an influential [[African-American poetry]] collective. Established in 1988, the collective hosted a reading series that featured leading figures in Black literature.

== Founding and activities ==
After attending the funeral of literary icon [[James Baldwin]] in 1987, poets [[Sharan Strange]] and [[Thomas Sayers Ellis]], then Harvard undergraduates, with poet-composer Janice Lowe, a [[Berklee College of Music]] student, co-founded the Dark Room Reading Series in 1988. The series was named for a project called ''The Dark Room: A Collection of Black Writing'', a library containing the works of black authors which was hosted in a former [[darkroom]] on the third floor of their Victorian house at 31 Inman Street in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strange|first1=Sharan|title=Dark Room Collective: Essay|date=Fall 2006|issue=16|url=http://mosaicmagazine.org/blog/?p=2616#.VOa9LTVVK1E|journal=Mosaic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dark Room Collective hosted a writing workshop and gatherings of black artists and writers at the house.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordinier|first1=Jeff|title=The Dark Room Collective: Where Black Poetry Took Wing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/arts/the-dark-room-collective-where-black-poetry-took-wing.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were visited by African-American literary luminaries such as [[Alice Walker]], [[bell hooks]], [[Toni Cade Bambara]], [[Derek Walcott]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], poet [[Essex Hemphill]], [[Randall Kenan]], [[Terry McMillan]], [[Ntozake Shange]], [[John Edgar Wideman]], and [[Walter Mosley]]. They hosted a reading series that paired older writers with younger ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eady|first1=Cornelius|last2=Alston|first2=Kwaku|title=Reading Ahead|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/06/24/reading-ahead|work=The New Yorker|date=June 24, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was influenced by [[Rita Dove]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Following problems with their landlord, they relocated the reading series to the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston|Institute of Contemporary Art]] and later to the [[Boston Playwrights' Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=Brian|title=The Dark Room Collective and Post-Soul Poetics|journal=African American Review|date=December 22, 2007|volume=41|issue=4|pages=727–747|url=https://www.academia.edu/3047524/The_Dark_Room_Collective_and_Post-Soul_Poetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series ran through approximately 1998, though a "reunion tour" took place in 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

[[Afghanistan]] is uniquely situated as a throughway of cultures throughout its history due to it geographic placement in South Asia. Afghanistan's location lends porous borders to trade routes between the East and West, while the Silk Road providing a vector for Buddhism and Hellenistic culture and even Egyptian influences from the west, renders an amalgamation of culture and art. Perpetual invasion and conflict has rendered a cyclic continuum of renaissance and [[destruction of art]] and culture in Afghanistan.

==Historicity of Afghanistan's art==

{{quotation|How wonderful that people show interest in our past, it means there is hope for the future. | Quote from an Afghan refugee in Peshwar, 1994&lt;ref name="AFG: Fall and Survival"&gt;{{cite book|title=Art and Archeology of Afghanistan: its fall and survival: a multi-disciplinary approach.|year=2006|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|editor=Juliette Van Krieken-Pieters}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Much of Afghanistan's art can be traced back through the invasions, occupations and dynasties that so frequently have ravaged the country.  Afghanistan has been a crossroads of cultures that make up the colorfully robust and dynamic foundation of Afghan art. These civilizations include, but are not limited to the empires and kingdoms that comprise Afghanistan's political origins as a modern state. The more renowned, larger regional empires include the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian Empire]], the [[Maurya Empire|Indian Maurya Empire]], the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic Empire]] and the [[Sassanids|Sassanid Empire]].  Like the empires, Afghanistan's transient and nomadic kingdoms and dynasties that rose to power (see [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrians]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Kabul Shahi]]s, [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Kartids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] dynasty and [[Durrani Empire|Durrani]] dynasty), helped shape the development of Afghan art as well as its preservation and destruction.

==Soviet invasion/occupation==
The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and exacted a staunch interpretation of art that stifled creativity in the 1980s during the Soviet backed regime in Afghanistan from 1979-1989.&lt;ref name=Mojumdar&gt;{{cite news|last=Mojumdar|first=Aunohita|title=Beyond the Frame|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2008/09/14/stories/2008091450230700.htm|work=THE HINDU Magazine|publisher=THE HINDU|accessdate=28 October 2011|date=September 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|last=Comiteau|first=Lauren|title=Saving Afghanistan's Art|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1701306,00.html|work=Time Magazine|publisher=Time|accessdate=October 25, 2011|date=January 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this time thousands of pieces of art were pillaged, looted or mysteriously disappeared during the ten year occupation.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Archeological Congress"&gt;{{cite book|last=2.

===Destruction of ancient archeological sites===
====Hadda and the Stupa-monastery complex of Tepe Shortor====
In the first years of the Soviet occupation several ancient sites, previously explored by French and Afghan archeologists, were ransacked by the pro-Russian government and destitute villagers.  The ancient sites included in the ransack and pillaging, which ultimately would continue through and even after the Taliban regime, were the stupa-monastery complex of Tepe Shortor, Hadda, Ai Khanoum, Bactres and Tepe Marandjan.&lt;ref name="World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet 2006 266"&gt;{{cite book|last=World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet|title=Of the past, for the future: integrating archaeology and conservation: proceedings of the conservation theme at the 5th World Archaeological Congress, Washington, D.C., 22-26 June 2003|year=2006|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|editor1=Neville Agnew |editor2=Janet Bridgland |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous for its intricate Graeco-Buddhist sculptures and reliefs, the archeological site Hadda is in [[Gandhara]] an ancient  state in what is now eastern Afghanistan, 10 kilometers from the present day city of Jalalabad (adjacent the Khyber Pass).&lt;ref name="World Archeological Congress" /&gt; This site was excavated in the 1930s and 1970s where approximately 23,000 clay and plaster sculptures were found.  These findings exemplified elements of Buddhism and Hellenism in a near perfect traditional Hellenistic style comparable to the sculptures found at the Temple of Apollo in [[Bassae, Greece]].  It is said that Hadda sustained significant damage in the Afghan Civil war and was destroyed in its entirety in 1980.&lt;ref name="World Archeological Congress" /&gt;

[[Tepe Shortor]] is a Buddhist monastery and stupa complex located at Hadda that was excavated between 1974 and 1979 by Afghan, and later French, archeologists. It is positioned midpoint on the main road from Kabul to Kandahar.  The site consisted of an entire ancient town, numerous Buddhist stupas and caves decorated with elaborate stucco figures dated to the second century C.E. Looters and pillagers have systematically destroyed the site in addition to some illegal, clandestine excavations.  Those statues that were too large to remove were smashed, and the small statues were taken to Pakistani bazaars to be sold.  Remains above the plateau, where the site is situated, are Buddhist temple sites including Tapa-Kalan, Tapa-i-Kafariha, Bagh-gai, Chakhil-i-Gundi, deh-Ghundi and Gar-Nao.&lt;ref name=Flandrin&gt;{{cite book|last=Flandrin|first=P|title=Le Tresor perdu des Rois d'Afghanistan|year=2001|publisher=Editions du Rocher|location=Paris|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet|title=Of the past, for the future: integrating archaeology and conservation: proceedings of the conservation theme at the 5th World Archaeological Congress, Washington, D.C., 22-26 June 2003|year=2006|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|editor1=Neville Agnew |editor2=Janet Bridgland |page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ai Khanoum====

The ancient site of [[Ai Khanoum]] is thought to be the historical Alexandria on the Oxus, founded in the fourth century B.C. as a result of the conquests of Alexander the Great.&lt;ref name="Vandalized Afghanistan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&amp;page=flonnet&amp;rdurl=fl1906/19060660.htm |last=Bopearachchi |first=Osmund |title=Vandalized Afghanistan |work=Frontline |publisher=THE HINDU |format=vol.19, issue 6, Mar. 16 - 29, 2002 |deadurl=no |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Graeco-Bactrian site stood on the left bank of the Oxus river at its meeting point with the Kokcha tributary, rendering it a strategically placed military outpost to control the eastern territories of Alexander the Great's ancient Bactria.&lt;ref name="Vandalized Afghanistan" /&gt; The topographic prowess of city complex provided a natural acropolis spanning 60 meters higher than the surrounding areas while two rivers form the west and south provided protection.&lt;ref name="Vandalized Afghanistan" /&gt; And for the past 20 years, the world-renowned site in northern Afghanistan has been the target of systematic illicit digs.&lt;ref name="World Archeological Congress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandalized Afghanistan" /&gt;

Some of the most significant contributions toward the understanding of Greek presence in Bactria were provided by the discoveries made at Ai Khanoum, and as some claim, demonstrated how the Greek artists of Ai Khanoum not only had an affinity for the Greek traditions but also perpetuated a classical style.&lt;ref name="Vandalized Afghanistan" /&gt; The slow devastation of Ai Khanoum began with treasure profiteers who had metal detectors brought into the country, originally designed to seek out landmines, but were used instead to hunt the ancient soils. Corinthian and Doric capitals unearthed by French archeologists were taken away and recycled as bases for the columns in tcha-khan while hundreds of ivory pieces, jewelry, intaglios, plaster medallions, bronze items, precious coins and statuettes have found their way to Pakistani bazaars and private collections.&lt;ref name="Vandalized Afghanistan" /&gt; Historian and numismatist, Osmund Bopearachchi describes the gravity of loss: “The objects that I have seen personally in Pakistani bazaars do not represent one-tenth of the artifacts that have been dispersed in international art markets.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet.|title=Of the past, for the future: integrating archaeology and conservation: proceedings of the conservation theme at the 5th World Archaeological Congress, Washington, D.C., 22-26 June 2003|year=2006|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|editor1=Neville Agnew |editor2=Janet Bridgland |page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, some of the looted or otherwise removed pieces from Ai Khanoum have been found and restored. However, the architectural infrastructure of the lower city is destroyed in its entirety.  Craters now occupy the space where Ai Khanoum's lower city once existed.&lt;ref name="World Archeological Congress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandalized Afghanistan" /&gt;

=====Mir Zakah Treasure=====

A rare find in Mir Zakah, located in Pakhtia province on the Pakistan border is loosely related to the numismatic knowledge of the Greco-Bactrian era, for which Ai Khanoum provided significant insight.  Between 1992 and 1995 one of the largest deposit of coins known in the history of currencies was discovered at the bottom of a well.  The circumstances surrounding the treasure's discovery remain unknown to this day. The coin deposit is calculated to contain more than four tons of minted metal, near 550,000 coins of mostly silver and bronze and 350 kilograms of gold.  The numismatic travesty of this profound discovery is, according to reliable sources, two and a half tons of the coins had been taken to Switzerland for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet|title=Of the past, for the future: integrating archaeology and conservation: proceedings of the conservation theme at the 5th World Archaeological Congress, Washington, D.C., 22-26 June 2003|year=2006|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|editor1=Neville Agnew |editor2=Janet Bridgland |page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The National Kabul Museum===

Beginning during the Soviet occupation that carried through the Taliban insurgence, it is said the Kabul Museum was arguably one of the greatest casualties Afghanistan suffered.  As a result of the Soviet and Taliban occupation, more than two thirds of the museums treasures and artifacts were lost or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet|title=Of the past, for the future: integrating archaeology and conservation: proceedings of the conservation theme at the 5th World Archaeological Congress, Washington, D.C., 22-26 June 2003|year=2006|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|editor1=Neville Agnew |editor2=Janet Bridgland |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of political complication, the museum agonized greatly from its location in the suburbs of Kabul as it was on the frontline of much of the Soviet combat. Until 1992, more than one hundred thousand objects belonging to periods from prehistory to twentieth century were conserved and partially displayed in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet|title=Of the past, for the future: integrating archaeology and conservation: proceedings of the conservation theme at the 5th World Archaeological Congress, Washington, D.C., 22-26 June 2003|year=2006|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|editor1=Neville Agnew |editor2=Janet Bridgland |pages=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1992 onward, more than 70 percent of objects in the National Museums collection and 100 percent of the objects deposited in the Archeological Institute, located nearby, were plundered and exported to bordering countries for sale.  Meanwhile, clandestine excavations took place throughout the country where the artifacts were illicitly trafficked into international black markets.&lt;ref name="World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet 2006 266"/&gt;

In February 2001, a motorcade of vehicles stopped in front of the museum where the minister of finance, the minister of culture and his adjunct, and the infamous Mollah Khari Faiz ur-Rahamn who slapped the Bodhisattva in the summer of 2001, ordered that the storeroom of the museum be opened.&lt;ref name="World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet 2006 267"&gt;{{cite book|last=World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet|title=Of the past, for the future: integrating archaeology and conservation: proceedings of the conservation theme at the 5th World Archaeological Congress, Washington, D.C., 22-26 June 2003|year=2006|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|editor1=Neville Agnew |editor2=Janet Bridgland |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a staff member who witnessed the scene, “As they entered the storeroom, they snarled in excitement an started to smash everything while chanting ‘Allahu Akbar’”&lt;ref name=Flandrin&gt;{{cite book|last=Flandrin|first=P|title=Le Tresor perdu des Rois d'Afghanistan|year=2001|publisher=Editions du Rocher|location=Paris|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet 2006 267"/&gt;

In May 1993, The National Museum was destroyed by several rockets that penetrated the roof, top floor and most of the building doors and windows.  Shortly thereafter it was looted where more than four thousand objects deposited in the storerooms of the museum for safe keeping were stolen.  Nearby, the Institute of Archaeology was also severely damaged.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet|title=Of the past, for the future: integrating archaeology and conservation: proceedings of the conservation theme at the 5th World Archaeological Congress, Washington, D.C., 22-26 June 2003|year=2006|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, Calif|editor1=Neville Agnew |editor2=Janet Bridgland |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Flandrin describes the looting process in which the storerooms of the museum were systematically emptied:

{{quotation|Three quarters of the collections that have been found were removed without any iconoclastic intent. The pillaging of the museum follows the same surgical rules as the looting of castles.  It is carried out with method and order, under the guidance of professional thieves who take care to salvage, along with the valuable, the corresponding catalogs and inventories that identify the stolen items.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

==Taliban insurgence/occupation==
Upon the resurgence of [[Taliban]] rule from 1996-2001 the ban on most forms of art and cultural expression was immediately implemented.&lt;ref name=Mojumdar /&gt; The Taliban’s war on art was inspired by the Koran.  The Koran forbids the portrayal of living things, whereby drawing or sculpting living things is recognized as a direct affront to the Almighty.&lt;ref name="Lost Treasures of Afghanistan"&gt;Lost Treasures of Afghanistan. Dir. James Barrat.  Ed. Geoff Luck. 2006. DVD.

Even today, 10 years after the end of the Taliban's official regime ended, beauty parlors in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, do their best to hide go unnoticed by Taliban sympathizers.&lt;ref name="Why ban just the Bra?" /&gt;

===The Giant Buddhas of Bamiyan===
The obliteration of the giant [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] also known as the "Bamiyan Massacre" is arguably the most devastating act by the Taliban against the history of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rathje|first=W.L.|title=Why the Taliban are Destroying Buddhas|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/archaeology/2001-03-22-afghan-buddhas.htm|work=Discover Archeology Magazine|publisher=USA Today Magazine|accessdate=October 30, 2011|date=March 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2001, supreme Taliban leader [[Mullah Mohammed Omar]] issued an edict against un-Islamic graven images, including but not limited to, all idolatrous images of humans and animals. The well-coordinated and media sensationalized dynamiting of the giant Buddhas was the Taliban's outwardly dramatic expression of their quest to exterminate all "idolatrous" and unIslamic images from Afghanistan's pre-Islamic past.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lost Treasures of Afghanistan"/&gt; The destruction ancient art, like the peaceful giants, was seen by Taliban radicals as the fulfillment of Koranic law.&lt;ref name="Lost Treasures of Afghanistan"/&gt;

Dated to the 7th Century B.C., the Colossi were cut at what is conceived to be an immeasurable cost into the towering, sandstone cliffs surrounding Bamiyan.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buddhas, About.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tristam|first=Pierre|title=The Buddha Statues of Bamiyan, Afghanistan|url=http://middleeast.about.com/od/afghanista1/a/me080910.htm|work=The New York Times Company|publisher=About.com|accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located at the center of a long valley, separating the mountain ranges of Hindu Kush and Koh-i-Baba, the taller of the two statues (approximately 53 meters/175 feet) is thought to represent [[Vairocana]] while the shorter one (approximately 36 meters/120 feet) most likely represents Buddha [[Sakyamuni]], although the local [[Hazara people]] believe it embodies a woman.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buddhas, About.com" /&gt; In the height of their existence, the two colossi rendered an awesome sight situated in a cliff with innumerable caves on either side of them while visible for miles with giant copper plated accents and brightly painted garments, as the statues were naturally illuminated both day and night.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buddhas, About.com" /&gt; The Buddhas were seen as transcendental images and key symbols in the rise of Mahayana Buddhist teachings, the antithesis of Taliban belief construct and rule of law.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buddhas, About.com" /&gt;

In 1998, a Taliban commander fired grenades at the smaller statue, severing its upper half. The Taliban bombed the mountain above the statues frequently, cracking the enclaves that held the statues and damaging the colossi further. By winter 2001, pleas were raining down on the Taliban from around the world to spare the statues.&lt;ref name="Buddhas, About.com" /&gt;

Mullah Mohammad Omar, leader of the Taliban Islamic militia in Afghanistan, dismissed the international pleas of the art and historical preservation world community with regard to saving the world-renowned Buddhas from imminent destruction. Despite international condemnation, Mullah Omar ordered the ancient Buddhas to be destroyed per the judgment of the clergymen and the ruling of the supreme court of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban).&lt;ref name="Lost Treasures of Afghanistan"/&gt;

On February 26, 2001, the Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, declared, “these idols have been gods of the infidels” and ordered them destroyed.&lt;ref name="Buddhas, About.com" /&gt;

{{quotation|"Based on the verdict of the clergymen and the decision of the supreme court of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban) all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed."

"According to Islam, I don't worry about anything. My job is the implementation of Islamic order. The breaking of statues is an Islamic order and I have given this decision in the light of a fatwa of the ulema (clerics) and the supreme court of Afghanistan. Islamic law is the only law acceptable to me."

"Only Allah, the Almighty, deserves to be worshipped, not anyone or anything else."

Explosives, tanks, and anti-aircraft weapons blew apart two colossal images of the Buddha in Bamiyan Province, 230 kilometers (150 miles) from the capital of Kabul.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; Broken pieces of the statues and fragments of the beautiful paintings that decorated the niches were subsequently offered for sale in the Peshawar bazaar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Archaeological Congress and Agnew, Neville, and Bridgland, Janet|title=Of the past, for the future: integrating archaeology and conservation: proceedings of the conservation theme at the 5th World Archaeological Congress, Washington, D.C., 22-26 June 2003|year=2006|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|editor1=Neville Agnew |editor2=Janet Bridgland |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early March 2001, the colossi were rubble.&lt;ref name="Buddhas, About.com" /&gt;

====Response and resurrection for the Bamiyan Buddhas====

After the demise of the two colossi in 2001, Dr. Zemaryali Tarzi, a renown Afghan archeologist that fled to France upon the Soviet invasion, made the decision to return to Afghanistan and search out an elusive piece of Afghanistan's history, the Sleeping Buddha of Bamiyan.  The last time the Sleeping Buddha was seen was approximately 630 C.E. when it was recorded in the journal of Xuanzang, a Chinese pilgrim who traveled to central Afghanistan in the 7th century C.E.&lt;ref name="Radio Free, Sleeping Buddha"&gt;{{cite web |last=Synovitz |first=Ron |title=Archaeologists Find Giant 'Sleeping' Buddha In Afghanistan |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Archeologists_Find_Giant_Sleeping_Buddha_In_Afghanistan_/1197572.html|work=Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty|publisher=Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty |author2=Ali Irfanin |date=September 9, 2008 |deadurl=no |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Soviet invasion in 1979, Professor Tarzi had already spent three decades of study and completed extensive restoration on the standing Buddhas of Bamiyan's.  Devastated by the Taliban's indiscriminate destruction of the two standing Buddhas, Dr. Tarzi used the ancient texts from the journal of Xuanzang to locate the suspected area of the ancient Buddhist monastery, housing the sleeping Buddha. Professor Tarzi sought to offer up the discovery and resurrection of the mythological sleeping Buddha of Bamiyan to the Taliban as a response to the terror exacted on the other colossals, affectionately known as the sleeping Buddha's “Brothers”.&lt;ref name="Lost Treasures of Afghanistan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio Free, Sleeping Buddha" /&gt;

Due to the intricate detail and accuracy of Xuanzang's immaculately preserved 1,400-year-old journal of the Bamiyan Buddhas, Professor Tarzi mapped out the locations for test sites in search for Xuanzang's descriptions of a giant reclining Buddha nearby. (3)(4)  After three years of test sites, in the summer of 2008, Professor Tarzi discovered the remains of the 19-meter-long reclining Buddha statue within the foundations of an ancient Buddhist temple less than two kilometers from the niches where Bamiyan's two giant Buddha statues once stood.&lt;ref name="Lost Treasures of Afghanistan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio Free, Sleeping Buddha" /&gt;

Although saved from the ravages of war and conflict, the sleeping colossal did not escape significant injury.  Due to the fact very little is known about the sleeping Buddha it is difficult for archeologists to ascertain the exact causes of the damages, however, Professor Tarzi assessed the majority of the impairment is simple deterioration from time and the elements.&lt;ref name="Lost Treasures of Afghanistan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio Free, Sleeping Buddha" /&gt;

{{quotation|“Most of the parts are damaged. But we discovered a piece from the upper right arm down to the elbow. We discovered its neck and its shoulders. But the head is broken because of water damage beneath the ground. Still, the pillow he is sleeping on is in perfect condition.” Tarzi&lt;ref name="Radio Free, Sleeping Buddha" /&gt;}}

==Future of Afghanistan’s art, cultural heritage and identity==

Little is certain on the survival and preservation of Afghanistan's cultural heritage through the mediums of art and architecture.  However, much is being done to reinstitute art studios, traditional clay sculpting schools and archeological foundations in order to reopen the doors and expand upon Afghanistan's lost, forgotten or otherwise suppressed traditional teachings and cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="Lost Treasures of Afghanistan"/&gt;  In 2002, UNESCO was charged with the task of rehabilitating Afghanistan's scarred cultural heritage that underwent incredible loss and irreversible damage during two continuous decades of war and civil unrest.&lt;ref name="AFG: Fall and Survival" /&gt; Despite ongoing operations to thwart Taliban resurgence attempts, UNSECO is entrusted by the existing Afghan government to coordinate all international efforts to aiming to safeguard and enhance Afghanistan's cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="AFG: Fall and Survival" /&gt;  UNSECO's strategy includes assisting in the re-establishment of links between the populations in order to develop a sense of common ownership of monuments, artifacts and historical sites that represent the cultural heritage of different segments of  Afghan society.&lt;ref name="AFG: Fall and Survival" /&gt; To date, the expenditures of UNESCO's funding and alternative forms of assistance well exceed the 7 million committed at the Kabul Seminar in May 2002.&lt;ref name="AFG: Fall and Survival" /&gt;

{{quotation|“It may be argued that in the face of millions of displaced Afghans, large scale impoverishment, homelessness, unemployment and injustice, not to mention the almost total destruction of basic national infrastructure and the continued instability, factionalism and international division, cultural heritage is the least of Afghanistan’s priorities. Why bother about the ancient Buddha statues when ordinary Afghans are starving here and now? But a nation’s cultural identity cannot be so easily dismissed: the past, the monuments, the history, the art treasures are as essential in establishing national unity and self-confidence as basic infrastructure is…This not only applies to new nations: the importance of Firdausi and Persepolis to Iran’s identity, or Homer and the Parthenon to Greece’s or the Great Wall to China’s, need hardly emphasizing.  The glories and achievements of the Kushan or the Ghaznavid civilizations are far more a part of Afghanistan’s identity than the Taliban, the factionalism or the fighting are… If the last decades of Afghanistan’s history have demonstrated nothing else, t is the need for a strong, unified cultural identity and cohesiveness.  The role of its cultural heritage is essential in this.”&lt;ref name="AFG: Fall and Survival" /&gt;

Excavators at the Buddhist site of [[Mes Aynak]] have been denounced as "promoting Buddhism" and threatened by the Taliban and many of the Afghan excavators who are working for purely financial reasons don't feel any connection to the Buddhist artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bloch  |first=Hannah |date=September 2015 |title=Mega Copper Deal in Afghanistan Fuels Rush to Save Ancient Treasures |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/mes-aynak/bloch-text |journal=National Geographic |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminist art''' is a category of art associated with the late 1960s and 1970s [[feminist movement]]. Feminist art highlights the societal and political differences women and those of other gender identity experience within their lives. The hopeful gain from this form of art is to bring a positive and understanding change to the world, in hope to lead to equality. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm|title=Feminist Art Movement, Artists and Major Works|author=|date=|website=theartstory.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media used range from traditional art forms such as painting to more unorthodox methods such as [[performance art]], [[conceptual art]], [[body art]], [[craftivism]], video, film, and [[fiber art]]. Feminist art has served as an innovative driving force towards expanding the definition of art through the incorporation of new media and a new perspective.&lt;ref name="Kramarae pp. 92-93"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cheris Kramarae|author2=Dale Spender|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfrzBcycB-4C&amp;pg=PA92|date=1 December 2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-92088-9|pages=92–93}}

==History==
{{Main|Feminist art movement|Feminist art movement in the United States}}
Historically speaking, female artists, when they existed, have largely faded into obscurity: there is no female [[Michelangelo]] or [[Da Vinci]] equivalent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|date=1973|publisher=Collier|editor1-last=Hess|editor1-first=Thomas|editor1-link=Art and Sexual Politics: Women's Liberation, Women Artists, and Art History|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nmwa.org/blog/2017/02/27/challenge-accepted-can-you-name-five-women-artists/|title=Challenge Accepted: Can You Name Five Women Artists?|last=|first=|date=February 27, 2017|website=National Museum of Women in the Arts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists'' [[Linda Nochlin]] wrote, "The fault lies not in our stars, our hormones, our menstrual cycles, or our empty internal spaces, but in our institutions and our education".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of women's historical role as caregiver, most women were unable to devote time to creating art. In addition women were rarely allowed entry into schools of art, and almost never allowed into live nude drawings classes for fear of impropriety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, women who were artists were largely wealthy women with leisure time who were trained by their fathers or uncles and produced still lives, landscapes, or portrait work. Examples include [[Anna Claypoole Peale]] and [[Mary Cassatt]]. 

Feminist art can be contentious to define as it holds different personal and political elements, different to each individual. Is all art made by a feminist then feminist art? Can art that is not made by a feminist be feminist art? [[Lucy R. Lippard]] stated in 1980 that feminist art was "neither a style nor a movement but instead a value system, a revolutionary strategy, a way of life."&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Emerging at the end of the 1960s, the feminist art movement was inspired by the 1960s student protests, the [[civil rights movement]], and [[Second-wave feminism]]. By critiquing institutions that promote sexism and racism students, people of color, and women were able to identify and attempt to fix inequity. Women artists used their artwork, protests, collectives, and women's art registries to shed light on inequities in the art-world. 

===1960s===
Before the 1960s the majority of woman-made artwork did not portray feminist content, in the sense that it neither addressed nor criticized the conditions that women have historically faced. Women were more often the subjects of art, rather than artists themselves. Historically, the female body was regarded as an object of desire existing for the pleasure of men. In the early 20th century, works that flaunted female sexuality – the [[pin-up girl]] being a prime example – began to be produced. By the late 1960s there was a plethora of feminine artwork that broke away from the tradition of depicting women in an exclusively sexualized fashion.

In order to gain recognition, many female artists struggled to "de-gender" their work in order to compete in a dominantly male art world. If a work did not "look" like it was made by a woman, then the stigma associated with women would not cling to the work itself, thus giving the work its own integrity. In 1963 [[Yayoi Kusama]] created ''Oven-Pan'' – part of a larger collection of works she referred to as the ''aggregation sculptures''. As with other works from that collection, ''Oven-Pan'' takes an object associated with women's work – in this case a metal pan – and completely covers it with bulbous lumps of the same material. This is an early feminist example of female artists finding ways to break from the traditional role of women in society. Having the lumps made from the same color and material as the metal pan completely takes away the pan's functionality, and – in a metaphorical sense – its association with women.{{whom|date=January 2018}} The protrusions remove the item's gender by not only removing its function of being a metal pan women would use in the kitchen, but by also making it ugly. Before this era, common female work consisted of pretty and decorative things like landscapes and quilts, whereas more contemporary artwork by women was becoming bold or even rebellious.{{whom|date=January 2018}}

Towards the end of the decade, progressive ideas criticizing social values began to appear in which the mainstream ideology that had come to be accepted was denounced as not being neutral. It was also suggested{{whom|date=January 2018}} that the art world as a whole had managed to institutionalize within itself the notion of sexism. During this time there was a rebirth of various media that had been placed at the bottom of the aesthetic hierarchy by art history, such as [[quilting]].&lt;ref name="Gender and Genius"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battersby|first1=Christine|title=Gender and Genius: Towards a Feminist Aesthetic|date=1989|publisher=Bloomington|location=Indiana UP}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put it simply, this rebellion against the socially constructed ideology of a woman's role in art sparked the birth of a new standard of the female subject. Where once the female body was seen as an object for the male gaze, it then became regarded as a weapon against socially constructed ideologies of gender.

With [[Yoko Ono]]'s 1965 work, ''[[Yoko Ono#Cut Piece.2C 1964|Cut Piece]]'', performance art began to gain popularity in feminist artwork as a form of critical analysis on societal values on gender. In this work, Yoko Ono is seen kneeling on the ground with a pair of scissors in front of her. One by one, she invited the audience to cut a piece of her clothing off until she was eventually left kneeling in the tattered remains of her clothing and her underwear. This intimate relationship created between the subject (Ono) and the audience addressed the notion of gender in the sense that Ono has become the sexual object. By remaining motionless as more and more pieces of her clothing are cut away, she reveals a woman's social standing where she is regarded as an object as the audience escalates to the point where her bra is being cut away.

===1970s===
During the 1970s, feminist art continued to provide a means of challenging women's position in the social hierarchy. The aim was for women to reach a state of equilibrium with their male counterparts. Judy Chicago's work, ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', emphasizes this idea of a newfound female empowerment through the use of turning a dinner table – an association to the traditional female role – into an equilateral triangle. Each side has an equal number of plate settings dedicated to a specific woman in history. Each plate contains a dish. This served as a way of breaking the idea of women being subjugated by society. Looking at the historical context, the 1960s and 1970s served as a prominent era where women began to celebrate new forms of freedom. More women joining the work force, legalization of birth control, fight towards equal pay, civil rights, and the ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision to legalize abortion, were reflected in artwork. Such freedoms, however, were not limited to politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Michael|last2=Bird|first2=Jon|title="Cleaning Up the 1970s; The Work of Judy Chicago , Mary Kelly, and Mierle Laderman Ukeles." Rewriting Conceptual Art|date=1999|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, being able to expertly capture the nude on canvas or in a sculpture reflected a high level of achievement in the arts. In order to reach that level, access to nude models was required. While male artists were given this privilege, it was considered improper for a woman to see a naked body. As a result, women were forced to focus their attention to the less professionally acclaimed "decorative" art. With the 1970s, however, the fight towards equality extended to the arts. Eventually more and more women began to enroll in art academies. For most of these artists, the goal was not to paint like the traditional male masters, but instead to learn their techniques and manipulate them in a way that challenged traditional views of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hein|first1=Hilde|last2=Korsmeyer|first2=Carolyn|title=Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective|date=1993|publisher=Indiana UP|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography became a common medium used by feminist artists. It was used, in many ways, to show the "real" woman. For instance, in 1979 [[Judith Black]] took a self-portrait depicting her body in such a light. It showed the artist's aging body and all her flaws in an attempt to portray herself as a human being rather than an idealized sex symbol. [[Hannah Wilke]] also used photography as her way of expressing a non-traditional representation of the female body. In her 1974 collection called ''S.O.S - Stratification Object Series'', Wilke used herself as the subject. She portrayed herself topless with various pieces of chewed gum in the shape of vulvas arranged throughout her body, metaphorically demonstrating how women in society are chewed up and then spit out.

At this time, there was a large focus on rebelling against the "traditional woman". With this came the backlash of both men and women who felt their tradition was being threatened. To go from showing women as glamorous icons to showing the disturbing silhouettes of women (an artistic demonstration of the 'imprint' left behind by the victims of rape) in the case of [[Ana Mendieta]], underscored certain forms of degradation that popular culture failed to fully acknowledge.

While [[Ana Mendieta]]'s work focused on a serious issue, other artists, like [[Lynda Benglis]], took a more satirical stance in the fight towards equality. In one of her photographs published in ''Artforum'', she is depicted naked with a short haircut, sunglasses, and a dildo positioned in her pubic region. Some saw this radical photo as "vulgar" and "disturbing". Others, however, saw an expression of the uneven balance between the genders in the sense that her photo was critiqued more harshly than a male counterpart, [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], who posed shirtless with chains around his neck as a sign of submission. At this time, the depiction of a dominant woman was highly criticized and in some cases, any female art depicting sexuality was perceived as pornographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Betterton|first1=Rosemary|title="Body Horor." An Intimate Distance: Women, Artists, and the Body.|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Bengalis' depiction of dominance to expose inequality in gender, [[Marina Abramovic]] used subjugation as a form of exposing the position of women in society that horrified rather than disturbed the audience. In her performance work ''[[Rhythm 0]]'' (1974), Ambramovic pushes not only her limits, but her audience's limits as well, by presenting the public with 72 different objects ranging from a feathers and perfume to a rifle and a bullet. Her instructions are simple; She is the object and the audience may do whatever they want with her body for the next six hours. Her audience has complete control while she lays motionless. Eventually they become wilder and begin violating her body – at one point a man threatens her with a rifle – yet when the piece ends the audience gets into a frenzy and run away in fear, as if they cannot come to terms with what just happened. In this emotional performance piece, Ambramovic depicts the powerful message of the objectification of the female body while at the same time unraveling the complexity of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Cornelia|last2=Gabrielle|first2=Lisa|title=WACK!: Art and the Feminist Revolution.|date=2007|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, [[Barbara Deming]] founded The Money for Women Fund to support the work of feminist artists. Deming helped administer the Fund, with support from artist [[Mary Meigs]].  After Deming's death in 1984, the organization was renamed as The Barbara Deming Memorial Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demingfund.org/our-founders |accessdate=September 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206011812/http://demingfund.org/our-founders |archivedate=December 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the foundation is the "oldest ongoing feminist granting agency" which "gives encouragement and grants to individual feminists in the arts (writers, and visual artists)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demingfund.org/ |title=Barbara Deming Memorial Fund, Inc. : Home |publisher=Demingfund.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dusenbery |first=Maya |url=http://feministing.com/2010/12/06/quickhit-calling-all-feminist-fiction-writers/ |title=Quickhit: Calling all Feminist Fiction Writers |publisher=Feministing.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Although feminist art is fundamentally any field that strives towards equality among the genders, it is not static. It is a constantly changing project that "is itself constantly shaped and remodeled in relation to the living processes of women's struggles". It not a platform but rather a "dynamic and self-critical response".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pollock|first1=Griselda|title=Generations and Geographies in the Visual Arts: Feminist Readings|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=london}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist spark from the 1960s and 1970s helped to carve a path for the activist and identity art of the 1980s.  In fact, The meaning of feminist art evolved so quickly that by 1980 Lucy Lippard curated a show where "all the participants exhibited work that belonged to 'the full panorama of social-change art,' though in a variety of ways that undercut any sense that 'feminism' meant either a single political message or a single kind of artwork.  This openness was a key element to the future creative social development of feminism as political and cultural intervention."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Jonathan ''The New Art History: A Critical Introduction'' Routledge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York opened a gallery that claimed to exhibit the most-renowned works of contemporary art of the time. of the 169 artists chosen, only 13 were women. As a result of this, an anonymous group of women investigated the most-influential museums of art only to find out that they barely exhibited women's art. With that came the birth of the [[Guerrilla Girls]] who devoted their time to fighting sexism and racism in the art world through the use of protest, posters, artwork and public speaking. Unlike the feminist art before the 1980s, the Guerrilla Girls introduced a bolder more in-your-face identity and both captured attention and exposed sexism. Their posters aim to strip the role that women played in the art world prior to the feminist movement. In one case, the painting ''La Grande Odalisque'' by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] was used in one of their posters where the female nude portrayed was given a gorilla mask. Beside it was written "Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum? Less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art Sections are women, but 85% of the nudes are female". By taking a famous work and remodeling it to remove its intended purpose for the male gaze, the female nude is seen as something other than a desirable object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls / by the Guerrilla Girls (whoever They Really Are) ; with an Essay by Whitney Chadwick|date=1995|publisher=HarperPerennial|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deepwell|first1=Kathy|title=New Feminist Art Criticism: Critical Strategies.|date=1995|publisher=Manchester UP|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critique of the male gaze and the objectification of woman can also be seen in [[Barbara Kruger]]'s ''Your gaze Hits the side of my face''. In this work we see a marble bust of a woman turned to its side. The lighting is harsh, creating sharp edges and shadows to emphasize the words "your gaze hits the side of my face" written in bold letters of black red and white down the left side of the work. In that one sentence, Kruger is able to communicate her protest on gender, society, and culture through language designed in a way that can be associated with a contemporary magazine, thus capturing the viewer's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isaak|first1=Jo Anne|title=Feminism and Contemporary Art: The revolutionary power of women's laughter|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promoting feminist art==
In the 1970s, society started to become open to change and people started to realize that there was a problem with the stereotypes of each gender. Feminist art became a popular way of addressing the social concerns of feminism that surfaced in the late 1960s to 1970s. The creation and publication of the first feminist magazine was published in 1972. ''Ms. Magazine'' was the first national magazine to make feminist voices prominent, make feminist ideas and beliefs available to the public, and support the works of feminist artists. Like the art world, the magazine used the media to spread the messages of feminism and draw attention to the lack of total gender equality in society. The co-founder of the magazine, Gloria Steinem, coined the famous quote, "A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle", which demonstrates the power of independent women; this slogan was frequently used by activists.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite book | author=Rozsika Parker and Griselda Pollock | title=Framing Feminism: Art and the Women's Movement 1970-85 | location=New York  | publisher= Pandora Press |year= 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of feminist art on society==
Lucy R. Lippard argued in 1980 that feminist art was "neither a style nor a movement but instead a value system, a revolutionary strategy, a way of life." This quote supports that feminist art effected all aspects of life. The women of the nation were determined to have their voices heard above the din of discontent, and equality would enable them to obtain jobs equal to men and gain rights and agency to their own bodies.&lt;ref name="Griselda Pollock 1987"&gt;Rozsika Parker and Griselda Pollock, Framing Feminism: Art and the Women's Movement 1970-85 (New York  Pandora Press 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Art was a form of media that was used to get the message across; this was their platform. Feminist art support this claim because the art began to challenge previously conceived notions of the roles of women. The message of gender equality in feminist artworks resonates with the viewers because the challenging of the social norms made people question, should it be socially acceptable for women to wear men's clothing?&lt;ref name="Griselda Pollock 1987"/&gt;

== Example of feminist art==
The magazine and the rise of feminism occurred during the same time feminist artists became more popular, and an example of a feminist artist is Judy Dater. Starting her artistic career in San Francisco, a cultural hub of different kinds of art and creative works, Dater displayed feminist photographs in museums and gained a fair amount of publicity for her work.&lt;ref name="Griselda Pollock 1987"/&gt; Dater displayed art that focused on women challenging stereotypical gender roles, such as the expected way women would dress or pose for a photograph. To see a woman dressed in men's clothing was rare and made the statement of supporting the feminist movement, and many people knew of Dater's passionate belief of equal rights. Dater also photographed nude women, which was intended to show women's bodies as strong, powerful, and as a celebration. The photographs grabbed the viewers attention because of the unusualness and never-before-seen images that do not necessarily fit into society.&lt;ref&gt;Norma Broude and [[Mary D. Garrard]], The Power of Feminist Art The American Movement of the 1970s: History and Impact (Harry N. Abrams Publishers Inc. New York 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early era===
Film-making in Louisiana began in 1898 with the [[Biograph Company|American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianafilmmuseum.org/Louisiana_Filmography.html|title=Louisiana Filmography: 1898-1980|author=Louisiana Film Museum|accessdate=2012-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323140558/http://www.louisianafilmmuseum.org/Louisiana_Filmography.html|archive-date=2012-03-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It has been the site of several notable productions over the years, the first of which was ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'', completed in 1918. Other earlier film productions include ''[[Jezebel]]'', ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', ''[[Easy Rider]]'', ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', and ''[[The Big Easy (film)|The Big Easy]]''.&lt;ref name="fbtfilm"/&gt;

Louisiana has hosted a long list of major film and television stars over the years whose reputations and talents have likely played a role in the rise of state's film industry. Some of these actors and actresses include Bette Davis, Henry Fonda, Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Denzel Washington, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Julia Roberts, Dennis Hopper, Cicely Tyson, Elvis Presley, Dennis Quaid, John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason, James Spader, Dolly Parton, Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner, Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Yul Brenner, David Niven, Jimmy Stewart, James Mason, Brad Pitt, Charles Bronson, and Daryl Hannah.&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianafilmmuseum.org/|title=Background on the Museum|publisher=Louisiana Film Museum|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
In 2002, Louisiana passed unique{{citation-needed|date=June 2015}} tax incentives aimed at recruiting film and television productions to the state. By 2011, the state's skilled crew base had grown by over 400 percent, and since 2006 over 300 [[film]]s have been shot in Louisiana. The industry truly entered the national spotlight though when ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'' earned thirteen [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations, the most in 2009.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

In 2010, boosted by its film industry, Louisiana made its first appearance in [[Site Selection (magazine)|Site Selection Magazine]]’s Top Business Climate rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbtfilm.com/site-selection-2010.aspx|title=Film industry helps Louisiana earn Top 10 state ranking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Louisiana hosted more than 150 productions and about $1.3 billion of their combined $1.9 billion in budgets was spent in the state.&lt;ref name="2011record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmneworleans.org/2012/uncategorized/louisiana-film-industry-passes-billion-dollar-mark-in-record-setting-2011/|title=Louisiana Film Industry Passes Billion-Dollar Mark In Record-Setting 2011|author=Mike Scott|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax incentives==
On July 1, 2002, the [[Louisiana Legislature]] enacted the Louisiana Motion Picture Tax Incentive Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://revenue.louisiana.gov/publications/lsleb(2002).pdf | title=2002 Legislative Sessions Department of Revenue Enrolled Bills | date=2002 | accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[tax credit]] has two primary components. First, the Investor Tax Credit provides a 30% tax credit on qualified motion picture expenditures with no project or program cap. Second, the Labor Tax Credit provides a 5% credit for [[payroll]] expenditures on Louisiana residents.&lt;ref name="louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com/opportunities/incentives--programs/motion-picture-tax-credit.aspx|title=Motion Picture Industry Development Tax Credit|publisher=LED|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123175417/http://www.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com/opportunities/incentives--programs/motion-picture-tax-credit.aspx|archivedate=January 23, 2010|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program not only encourages residents to film in Louisiana but also employ Louisiana residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbtfilm.com/film_incentives.aspx|title=Louisiana Film Incentive &amp; Tax Credit Program Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify for this program, [[filmmaker]]s must spend at least $300,000 in Louisiana.&lt;ref name="louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com"/&gt;

==Climate and scenery==
Louisiana's warm weather and diverse locations have appealed to film producers across the country considering that the [[subtropical climate]] makes filming possible year-round without interruptions.&lt;ref name="shreveport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveportla.gov/pictures/pics.htm|title=Shreveport Film and Media Industry|author=Cedric B.

These diverse locations are often credited for Louisiana's ability to stand in as multiple settings such as [[Texas]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], [[Washington, DC]], and [[London]]. As [[Patrick Lussier]], director of [[Drive Angry]] 3D, commented in [[USA Today]], "The film industry wants to find places it can reinvent and make look like anything it needs. There's a lot of opportunity [to] do that in Louisiana."&lt;ref name="Lussier"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-08-03-louisianafilm03_CV_N.htm|title=Versatile Louisiana becomes 'L.A.

{{Other people}}
'''George Wilkins''' (died 1618)&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=29418|title=Wilkins, George|last=Parr|first=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[dramatist]] and [[pamphlet]]eer best known for his probable collaboration with [[William Shakespeare]] on the play ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''. By  profession he was an inn-keeper, but he was also apparently involved in criminal activities.

==Life==
Wilkins was an inn-keeper in Cow-Cross, London, an area that was "notorious as a haunt of whores and thieves".&lt;ref name = "wilk"&gt;Roger Warren, Gary Taylor, [[MacDonald P. Jackson|MacDonald Pairman Jackson]], ''A reconstructed text of Pericles, Prince of Tyre'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Most biographical information about him derives from his regular appearance in criminal court records for thievery and acts of violence. Many of the charges against him involved violence against women, including kicking a pregnant woman in the belly, and knocking down and stomping another woman. The latter appears in other records as a known "bawd", or keeper of prostitutes. These facts have led to the suggestion that his inn functioned as a brothel and that Wilkins was a procurer, or pimp.&lt;ref name = "wilk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Charles Nicholl, 'The gent upstairs', ''Guardian'' 20-10-2007, and his book ''The Lodger'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkins was associated with the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], and their chief playwright [[William Shakespeare]], during the latter's last working years as a dramatist. Shakespeare and Wilkins were both witnesses in the case of ''[[Bellott v Mountjoy]]'' in 1612; in his deposition he described himself as a "victualler."

==Works==

He is first heard of as the author of a [[pamphlet]] on the ''Three Miseries of [[Barbary]]'', which dates from 1606.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Robert (1961). “Manuscript Evidence for dates of two Short Title Catalogue books: George Wilkins’s ‘Three Miseries of Barbary’ and the third edition of Elizabeth Grymeston’s ‘Miscelanea’.” ''The Library'' s5-XVI(2):141-142&lt;/ref&gt; He then collaborated in 1607 with [[William Rowley]] and [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]] in ''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]'', a dramatisation of the real-life adventures of the [[Robert Sherley|Sherley brothers]].

In the same year Wilkins wrote ''[[The Miseries of Enforced Marriage]]''. This play is based on the story of [[Walter Calverley]], whose identity is thinly disguised under the name of "Scarborough." This man had killed his two children and had attempted to murder his wife. The play originally had a tragic ending, but as played in 1607, ended in comedy and the story stopped short before the catastrophe, perhaps because of objections raised by Mrs. Calverley's family, the Cobhams.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The crime itself is dealt with in a short play, ''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' of uncertain authorship.

==''Pericles''==
A number of studies have attributed to Wilkins a share in Shakespeare's ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' (which does not appear in Shakespeare's ''[[First Folio]]'', but was published only in a textually corrupt [[quarto]]). This may have been collaboration, or perhaps Wilkins was the original author of ''Pericles'' and Shakespeare remodelled it, or vice versa. However it may be, Wilkins published in 1608 a novel entitled ''The Painful Adventures of Pericles, Prynce of Tyre'', described as "the true history of Pericles as it was lately presented by ... [[John Gower]]" (who serves as narrator in the play). This follows the play very closely. The editors of the 1986 Oxford Edition of Shakespeare make the assumption that Wilkins was the co-author of ''Pericles'' and draw heavily upon ''The Painful Adventures'' in their controversial reconstructed text of the play. Wilkins is thought to have contributed most of the first two acts of the play, while Shakespeare wrote the last three.

[[Image:st anne mosaic.jpg|thumb|right|La Scapigliata in Carnelian, with close-up of mouth. ([[Roy Feinson]])]]
Unlike traditional [[mosaics]] which rely on differently colored material arranged in arbitrary configurations to make an image, '''impressionist mosaics''' are created using the natural flaws and marbling in the tiles to create the impression of an image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozaico.com/impressionism-mosaic-art/ | title=Impressionist Mosaics: Portraying a Perceptual Impression | publisher=Mozaico | date=14 August 2015 | accessdate=24 November 2015 | author=Menhem, Chantal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the definition, this may be limited to arranging square, homogeneously colored tiles in a grid-like, non-overlapped fashion.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Using stones that are of relatively uniform color and texture (typically pre-cut natural [[gemstones]] such as jasper, marble, or amethyst), the resulting mosaics have a uniquely ethereal quality that distinguishes them from traditional processes. Since the technique uses uniformly cut stones, it does not require [[grouting]]. 

==Process==
By [[Roy Feinson]]'s definition, impressionist mosaics are created by taking dozens of measurements of every tile in the artist's "palette".  The measurements are obtained by digitally photographing each tile and separating it into a grid of sixteen equal sections and analyzing each section for color, contrast and marbling. The resultant data are stored in a [[database]] and operated on by proprietary software, which recommends placements for all the tiles. Since the tiles are generally square, the software considers all four possible rotations for each tile, which greatly increases the odds that a given tile will find a good 'home'.  Each tile is equivalent to sixteen pixels in the final mosaic since its final location is a function of sixteen sections. While the software is an important component of this process, the artist must still rely on traditional hand-eye techniques to complete the image.
Care must be taken to balance the color curves in the target image to that of the component tiles. For example, if the darkest color to be found on any of the component tiles is only a mid-tone gray, then any blacks in the target image's must be converted to mid-tone gray.  This process would be repeated for the reds, greens, blues, and whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://royfeinson.com/mozaicartz/home/ | title=Impressionist Mosaics | publisher=Roy Feinson | accessdate=24 November 2015 | author=Feinson, Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from traditional mosaics==
Traditional mosaics have a history dating back to at least the fourth century BC, and employ a variety of methodologies to create their images. However, traditional mosaics share the common feature of employing small, uniformly colored materials ([[tesserae]]) to create a pattern or picture. Because the tiles can be cut into irregular shapes to conform to the base pattern, mosaisists are able to create works of astonishing detail and color. 
 
Alternatively, pixel tile mosaics, such as those found on the floor of the [[University of Toronto]] pool, employ standard sized tiles (generally 1 x 1 or 2 by 2 inch) in a variety of colors arranged in a uniform matrix.   Each tile is a different color and represents a single 'pixel' in the final image. The resulting mosaic is typically coarse and of very low resolution.

==History==
Pioneering work in this field was conducted in the 1990s by California mosaic artist [[Roy Feinson]], who because of its underlying similarities to 19th century [[impressionism]] coined the term Impressionist Mosaics.

In 2006, mosaic artists Nick Berg and Alan Roth made custom mosaics using this technique commercially available in marble and wood. Because of the increased image resolution inherent in the impressionist mosaic process, they coined the terms High Definition Mosaics and Photo-realistic Mosaics.

The '''Incunabula Short Title Catalogue''' (ISTC) is an electronic [[bibliography|bibliographic]] [[database]] maintained by the [[British Library]] which seeks to catalogue all known [[incunabula]]. The database lists books by individual editions, recording standard bibliographic details for each edition as well as giving a brief census of known copies, organised by location. It currently holds records of over 30,000 editions.&lt;ref name="bl1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html|title=Incunabula Short Title Catalogue|work=bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Previous efforts to comprehensively catalog 15th century printing include [[Georg Wolfgang Panzer]]'s ''Annales Typographici ab Artis Inventae Origine ad Annum MD'' (1793–97) and [[Ludwig Hain]]'s ''Repertorium Bibliographicum'' (1822).  Hain's work was later supplemented by Copinger's ''Supplement'' and Reichling's ''Appendices'', which would pave the way for the ''[[Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke]]'' (1925).  The ''Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke'' (''GW'') was the most comprehensive catalog of incunables to date (and still offers more in-depth information than ISTC),&lt;ref name="pn2"&gt;Needham, Paul (1993), "Incunable catalogs,"  ''Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America'' 87:1, p. 371-372.&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent decades work on the catalog has slowed to such a degree that the goal of cataloging all extant incunables under the ''GW'''s system is indefinitely far-off.&lt;ref name="pn1"&gt;Needham, Paul (1998), "Counting incunables: The IISTC CD-ROM," ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 61:3/4, p. 456-529.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISTC was created to establish a system of incunable cataloging that was simple enough to be expanded quickly, bringing the goal of a complete incunable catalog back into focus. Furthermore, the ISTC would use standardized entries that could be entered into a machine-searchable database.

Work on the ISTC began in 1980 under the leadership of the British Library's Lotte Hellinga. [[Frederick R. Goff]]'s ''Incunabula in American Libraries'' (1973) was the first pre-existing catalog to be keyed into ISTC's database. Besides providing the catalog's first 12,900 entries, Goff's system for classifying information about incunables formed the basis for the structure of ISTC's records. Entries for all of the incunables in British Library and the Italian [[union catalog]] (IGI) were added next, followed by other national incunable catalogs.&lt;ref name="b15"&gt;Hellinga, Lotte, and Goldfinch, John (eds) (1987), ''Bibliography and the study of 15th-century civilisation: Papers presented at a colloquium at the British Library 26–28 September 1984'' (London: British Library).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Records ==
ISTC records retain many characteristics of the records from Goff's census. Each record represents one [[edition (book)|edition]] of a work.  Information such as [[author]], [[title]], [[Printer (publisher)|printer]], place of printing, year of printing, language, and format is entered into discrete fields to make the records searchable by a computer. Catalogue entries are reduced to a standard form, for ease of indexing and access, which includes the use of standard names for authors and printers—a major issue in an era where the use of [[List of Latinised names|Latinised names]] and vernacular ones interchangeably was common—and contemporary English names for places. Dates are reduced to conventional years where possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://138.253.81.72/~cheshire/istc/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISTC has recorded 29,777 editions to date, although some of the records included in that number are actually 16th-century works that were included in previous incunable catalogs in error, so the number of true incunabula recorded is 27,460.&lt;ref name="bl2"&gt;http://www.bl.uk/collections/hoinc.html&lt;/ref&gt; The number of extant incunabula is estimated to be approximately 28,000 editions, which puts ISTC extraordinarily close to completing its goal of total coverage.  Documenting these last few hundred editions is a tremendous undertaking, as the works are scattered in unknown locations in many countries, leaving bibliographers with no organized way to search for them except to "look everywhere".&lt;ref name="pn1"/&gt;

While the ISTC is unsurpassed in coverage, it does not offer the same level of detail as the ''Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke'' or the numerous [[collection catalog]]s that are available. Rather, the ISTC complements these resources by providing a searchable [[Bibliographic index|index]] of editions, referring to other catalogs and bibliographies for further detail. ISTC does not include information about individual copies of a work as standard, though a brief census of confirmed locations is provided, and may contain brief notes.&lt;ref name="pn2"/&gt;

In general, the ISTC only covers extant editions, although records exist for some works that were sufficiently well-documented before being lost to fire or other calamities.

An illustrated edition of the ISTC was made available on [[CD-ROM]] in 1998. The addition of illustrations offers important information about a book's layout, format, and printing type. The images represent samples of each text rather than the full text.&lt;ref name="bl2"/&gt;

'''Joke theft''' is the act of performing and taking credit for comic material written by another person without their [[consent]]. This is a form of [[plagiarism]] and can, in some cases, be [[copyright infringement]]. 
==History==
===Vaudeville years===
In [[music hall]]s and [[vaudeville]], it was common for performers to "borrow" material. According to [[Milton Berle]], [[etiquette]] only required that "the borrower add to the joke and make it his own".&lt;ref name="Berle1989xxiii"&gt;Berle, Milton (1989) ''Private joke file'', ''Introduction'', p.xxiii quotation: {{quotation|Of course, in the days of vaudeville, it wasn't uncommon for a performer to "borrow" a joke from another performer. Etiquette demanded only that the borrower add to the joke and make it his own. Bert Williams, a star of the Ziegfeld Follies, pilfered a story about fish and added enough laughs to turn it into a classic fifteen-minute routine. Naturally, that routine happens to be in my file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade. Most jokes at the time were one-liners and there was little in the way of proof of a joke's origin, but the value of each joke was immeasurable to a comedian.&lt;ref name="radartake"&gt;{{cite web

Berle and [[Bob Hope]] had a long-standing feud due to Hope's accusation that Milton Berle had stolen some of his jokes.&lt;ref name="radartake" /&gt; Berle never disputed the claim, but instead embraced the title "The Thief of Bad Gag".

Even the most famous of comics have found themselves, knowingly or unknowingly, stealing material. [[Bill Cosby]] admitted to stealing a joke by George Carlin involving an uneducated football player doing a television commercial. Cosby said that what makes the routine his own is the surreal phrase "little tiny hairs".&lt;ref name="funny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-joketheft24jul24,1,6252669,full.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=5&amp;cset=true |title=Funny, that was my joke |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Welkos |first=Robert W. |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221013725/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-joketheft24jul24%2C1%2C6252669%2Cfull.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=5&amp;cset=true |archivedate=21 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Cosby, Bill|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AikgyewBn8k|title=Late Show with David Letterman – Bill Cosby's Race Against George Carlin|publisher=[[CBS]]|medium=TV|date=2009-06-01|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later, [[Carlos Mencia]] performed a bit about athletes and their parents that hearkened back to a Cosby bit from his album ''[[Bill Cosby: Himself]]''.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The 1980s and 1990s saw the popularity of [[stand-up comedy]] continue to increase. The advent of pay-cable networks afforded comics the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft in which the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.

[[Robin Williams]] was accused of stealing material from another comic. [[David Brenner]] claims that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes.&lt;ref name="Comedy at the Edge"&gt;{{cite book | title=Comedy at the Edge | author=Richard Zoglin | year=2008 | publisher=Bloomsbury USA | isbn=978-1582346243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
For many years, [[Denis Leary]] had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1993 album ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt Leary had stolen his act and material, and the friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=[[Kevin Booth]] and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170  |title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | author=Joe Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-10-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051218140900/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 |archivedate = 2005-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Joe Rogan answers 20 Questions | last=Rogan | first=Joe | work=Playboy Magazine |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html | title=Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions | author=Tim McIntire | year=1998 | publisher=BillHicks.com | archivedate=2006-03-20 | accessdate=2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from [[pancreatic cancer]], an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; "Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer").&lt;ref name="hicksfaq" /&gt;

In a 2008 appearance on ''The Opie and Anthony Show'', comedian [[Louis C.K.]] claimed that Leary stole his "I'm an asshole" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.&lt;ref name="Berle1989xxiii"/&gt; On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips.&lt;ref name="radartake"/&gt;

In his memoir ''[[Gasping for Airtime]]'', [[Jay Mohr]] admitted that he lifted an entire routine from [[Rick Shapiro]]'s act for a 1995 ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch. He stated that Shapiro sued the show and was financially compensated, but Shapiro later disputed that he received any compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohr|first1=Jay|title=Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live|date=2004|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=1401300065|pages=276–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and 2010s===
Louis C.K. has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with [[Dane Cook]] over three bits on Cook's album, ''Retaliation'', that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on C.K.'s album ''Live in Houston''.  C.K. and Cook portray this rivalry with comedy and sincerity in an episode of C.K.'s series ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thecomicscomic.com/2011/08/05/dane-cook-confronts-louis-ck-in-an-honest-way-about-joke-theft-read-the-transcript-watch-the-video/ | title = Dane Cook confronts Louis CK in an honest way about joke theft.

[[George Lopez]] has accused Carlos Mencia of plagiarizing his material and claimed that the two once had a physical altercation over the alleged plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml |author=Goldyn, Debra |title=Is Carlos Mencia a thief? |work=Advocate |publisher=[[University of Colorado at Denver]] |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2007-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007092111/http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml |archivedate=7 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fellow comedian Ted Sarnowski countered this claim and stated that it was he, not Lopez, who had originally penned the joke and that he had given Mencia permission to use it when he discovered that Lopez had stolen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5264&amp;IssueNum=199|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216161529/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5264&amp;IssueNum=199|archivedate=16 February 2008|author=Kozlowski, Carl|title=Carlos Mencia Just Said That|work=|publisher=Los Angeles CityBeat|date=2007-03-29|accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Italian comic and satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] was accused by anonymous bloggers of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as [[George Carlin]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Robert Schimmel]].&lt;ref name="rep_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2010/06/09/news/luttazzi-secopia-4703064/ |title=La Rete contro Luttazzi: "Copia" I dubbi dei fan, il tam-tam cresce – Repubblica.it |accessdate=2010-06-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html |title=Luttazzi copia – Parte 1 |accessdate=2010-06-11 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612084318/http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a personal blog entry published five years prior, Luttazzi himself offered his blog readers a prize if they were able to identify a "nugget" (i.e. a reference to a famous joke), calling the game a "treasure hunt".&lt;ref name="blo_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danieleluttazzi.blogspot.com/|title=Caccia al tesoro|author=Luttazzi, Daniele}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against [[La7]] broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show "Decameron", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. Luttazzi got 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros as compensation.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/12_marzo_10/satira-tv-luttazzi-vince-causa-contro-la-7-franco_69183226-6a83-11e1-8b63-010bde402ef9.shtml|title=Luttazzi vince la causa contro La7|date=10 March 2012|accessdate=10 March 2012|publisher=corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls this ruse "the [[Lenny Bruce]] trick" (named for the comic of same name).  Luttazzi asserts that the jokes he references are not "plagiarized" but "calqued", which is a fair use of original material. In 2014, an academic paper explained why Luttazzi's jokes are his own and not "plagiarised" ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caimotto|first1=M.Cristina|title=Transcreating a New Kind of Humor: the case of Daniele Luttazzi|url=http://www.cultusjournal.com/index.php/archive/16-issue-2014-v-7-transcreation-and-the-professions|website=cultusjournal.com|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' contestant Jordan Paris presented an act of stand-up comedy and quickly proceeded to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, G 2011, '[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/comedy/australias-got-plagiarism-ripoff-comic-exposed-20110526-1f50v.html Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip-off comic exposed]', ''Brisbane Times'' 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians [[Lee Mack]] and [[Geoff Keith]]. The television network gave him a chance to redeem himself and allowed him to compete in the semi-finals using his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well – "I just sacked my two writers – Copy and Paste" – had been done in 2009 by comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]], about [[Brad Garrett]], at a roast of [[Joan Rivers]]. Ross had said, "This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste."&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, D 2011, [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/oops-he-did-it-again-ripoff-comic-plunders-joke-about-plagiarism-20110629-1gq1d.html 'Oops. He did it again: Rip-off comic plunders joke about plagiarism'], ''Brisbane Times'', 29 June 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, blogger and comedian Troy Holm was ridiculed on the [[social networking]] site Facebook&lt;ref name="facebook1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-Troy-Holm/217011661714006 |title=Occupy Troy Holm |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for stealing jokes and stories from comedian [[Doug Stanhope]] and posting them to his blog from 2010, [[plagiarism|claiming them as his own work]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701002315/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; including Stanhope's "Fuck someone uglier than you" routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103154727/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |archivedate=3 January 2012 |title=Fuck Someone Ugly|date=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found on Stanhope's ''Acid Bootleg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Doug+Stanhope/ACID+Bootleg |title=ACID Bootleg – Doug Stanhope – Listen and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute&lt;ref&gt;[[Sicko (album)]]&lt;/ref&gt; nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701001921/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the "Occupy Troy Holm" Movement.&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;  Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that "To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that ''isn't'' mine?"&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;

==In other media==
Joke theft is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often jokes in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.
[[Dick Cavett]] wrote about joke theft in his autobiography. He'd written a bit about eating Chinese-German food and, an hour later, being hungry for power. After a few days of performing the bit, he discovered a column by [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] which attributed the joke to [[Rip Taylor]]. However, after calling Taylor to ask him to stop using the bit, he discovered that not only had Taylor never performed the bit, he had never even heard it and laughed heartily at the joke's humor. It was then that Cavett discovered that some journalists often falsely attribute jokes to the wrong comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Cavett | author=Dick Cavett, Christopher Porterfield | year=1974| publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |pages=227–228| isbn=978-0151161300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavett and [[Woody Allen]] often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other. Allen's jokes, when he still lacked access to television, were regularly stolen by top mainstream shows ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' and ''[[Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name="Cavett interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/cavett.htm |title=SHECKY! Interview: DICK CAVETT! |publisher=Sheckymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-07-11}} quotation: {{quotation|Woody's best lines would show up, while he was still confined to little Village clubs, on the Red Skelton show and that alleged entertainment, Laugh-In.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved extremely painful to Allen.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including "[[Missionary: Impossible]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]" and "[[The Italian Bob]]" have poked fun at ''[[Family Guy]]'', implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from the Simpsons. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | title = Interview: Matt Groening | accessdate = 2006-12-12 | author = Nathan Rabin | date = 2006-04-26 | work = The A.V.

In 2017 the Australian television show host [[Grant Denyer]] was interviewed on the radio programme ''[[The Grill Team]]'', which is on [[2MMM]]. In the interview, ''The Grill Team''{{'}}s co-host [[Matty Johns]] told an amusing anecdote about introducing a child to the board game ''[[Test Match (board game)|Test Match]]''. Later that morning, Grant Denyer was interviewed on the radio programme ''[[The Kyle and Jackie O Show]]'', which is on [[KIIS 106.5]]. In that interview, he told the same anecdote about ''Test Match'', passing it off as his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://au.be.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/a/34283262/grant-denyer-banned-from-triple-m-and-kiis-fm-radio-stations-for-stealing-story-yahoo7-be/#page1 | title = Grant Denyer Banned From Triple M and KIIS FM Radio Stations For Stealing Story | accessdate = 2017-01-28 | author = Leah Cohen | date = 2017-01-28 | work = Yahoo7Be | publisher = Yahoo!7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recourse and consequences==
There is, historically, very little [[legal recourse]] taken in cases of joke theft. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. [[W. C. Fields]] reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a thieving comic's legs broken.&lt;ref name="radartake" /&gt;

"You have a better chance of stopping a serial killer than a serial thief in comedy," said comedian [[David Brenner]]. "If we could protect our jokes, I'd be a retired billionaire in Europe somewhere – and what I just said is original."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/24/entertainment/et-joketheft24|title=Funny, that was my joke|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|date=2007-07-24|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2018 study in the ''American Sociological Review'', "most instances of possible joke theft are ambiguous owing to the potential for simultaneous and coincidental discovery".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reilly|first=Patrick|date=2018-08-17|title=No Laughter among Thieves: Authenticity and the Enforcement of Community Norms in Stand-Up Comedy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122418791174|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|pages=000312241879117|doi=10.1177/0003122418791174|issn=0003-1224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"that accusations are not strongly coupled to jokes’ similarity, and enforcement depends mainly on the extent to which insiders view the comic in question as being authentic to the community. Comics who are oriented toward external rewards, have a track record of anti-social behavior, and exhibit lackluster on-stage craft are vulnerable to joke theft accusations even in borderline cases because those inauthentic characteristics are typical of transgressors. Vulnerability is greatest for comics who enjoy commercial success despite low peer esteem."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Kendell Geers''' is a [[South Africa]]n conceptual artist.

==Life==
Kendell Geers was born in Johannesburg into a white working-class Afrikaans family during the time of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Salon | Artist Talk | Manifesta 9: FIRED UP by Kendell Geers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGJDXFKIz0U&lt;/ref&gt; 

Becoming aware of the political struggles in his country, he ran away from home at the age of 15 to get involved in the anti-apartheid movement. 
Kendell finished his schooling at the end of 1984. At the beginning of 1985, to avoid conscription, he enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for a Fine Arts degree.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Siebrits,States of Emergency 1985-1990, "Irrespektiv." BOM / Actar, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1988, Kendell Geers was one of 143 young men who publicly refused to serve in the South African Defence Force and faced either a life in exile or six years' imprisonment in a civilian jail.&lt;ref&gt;Merret, C., Saunders, C., in Switzer L., Adhikari M., ''South Africa's Resistance'', Ohio University Press, 2000, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 he left South Africa and lived for a brief period in exile in the United Kingdom and New York where he worked as an assistant to artist [[Richard Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;Clive Kellner, Kendell Geers 1988-2012, Prestel, 2012, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was only after [[Nelson Mandela]] and other political prisoners' release from prison, that Geers could return from exile to Johannesburg without fear of being imprisoned. In 1990, he returned to [[Johannesburg]] where he worked as an artist, and art critic, curator and performance artist. The first work of art he created back on South African soil was "Bloody Hell", a ritual washing of his white [[Afrikaaner]] [[Boer]] body with his own fresh blood.&lt;ref name="Fin de Partie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sans|first=Jerome|title=Hang Grenades From My Heart|year=2012|publisher=Blue Kingfisher|isbn=9789881506474|pages=23–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rejecting everything his family and his community stood for, in 1993 he changed his name to Kendell Geers and his date of birth to May 1968 as a political act, reclaiming his identity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Bourriaud, ''Kendell Geers: A Proletarian Gnosis'', ''Kendell Geers 1988-2012'', Munich, Prestel, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to Brussels in 2003.

==Work==
Sometimes described as a political artist, Kendell Geers is known best for using a variety of colors and materials that signal danger such as sirens, broken glass, and barbed wire in an attempt to examine power structures, social injustices, and establishment values. Geers has worked with different media ranging from objects to large scale installation, neon works, performances and video.
Geers also uses words as a means to explore the coding and reinterpretation of language and its meaning and to communicate with his audience.

===Early work===
His work had heavily political elements from 1988 to 2000, during which time Geers, explored the moral and ethical contradictions of the apartheid system through his practice.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; He developed a visual vocabulary characterized by provocation as well as humor by using found objects such as barbed wire or glass shards. By appropriating historical events and ideas, he focused on questions of relationship between individual and society. It was in this context that Geers changed his date of birth to May 1968, the start of the student and civil revolution, and joined every political party in the period before South Africa’s first democratic elections, from the extreme right-wing to the Communist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition traces the shift and the development of Kendell Geers' aesthetic language|url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=59989#.US94rjdhAqA|work=Art Daily|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, he expressed his doubts about the fetishization of party politics.

He participated in the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1993, the first time since the anti-[[Apartheid]] boycotts that South African artists had been invited.

From 1999 until 2004, Geers worked as the curator and art consult for [[Gencor]] which was later bought out by [[BHP Billiton]]. The collection focused on artists and works of art that were central to the [[apartheid|Anti-Apartheid Movement]] spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Williamson, South African Art in the Nineties: Part I, II &amp; III, [http://www.artthrob.co.za/00jan/news.html Artthrob]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Geers edited and published ''Contemporary South African Art,'' with essays by [[Okwui Enwezor]], [[Olu Oguibe]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary South African Art'', Jonathan Ball Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|978-1-86842-039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiated by his move to Brussels in 2000, his later European period is characterized by a more poetic aesthetic.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; Here, Geers transferred his incendiary practice into a post-colonial and increasingly global context, suggesting more universal themes like terrorism, spirituality, and mortality. As such, the artist’s life and work can be said to constitute a living archive composed of political events, photographs, letters, and literary texts that serve as a source of inspiration and represent a continuation of his oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=haus der kunst|url=http://www.hausderkunst.de/index.php?id=132&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 a Geers retrospective called "1988-2012" opened at the [[Haus der Kunst]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=welt&gt;{{cite news|last=Reitter-Welter|first=Barbara|title=Hinweis warnt vor Kendell-Geers-Ausstellung|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article113480460/Hinweis-warnt-vor-Kendell-Geers-Ausstellung.html|newspaper=Die Welt|date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The exhibition divided his life and work into two decade-long periods, the first political phase until 2000, and the later more poetic phase.

===Manifesto===
In 2011 Geers wrote a Manifesto in which through a series of statements, he explores the link between political and natural revolutions, mourns the loss of our talent for revolution and the underlying causes, and gives us clues on how to remember our inner selves to live a more true life.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Arts: A Journal of South-North Cultural and Media Studies 27(6), An Van Dienderen &amp; Kris Rutten, 2013, p. 655-660.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side projects==
Together with musician Patrick Codenys ([[Front 242]]) Kendell Geers formed the Belgium Audio-Visual group "[[thefucKINGFUCKS]]" in 2007. The project grew out of the now defunct "[[Red Snyper]]" collaboration between Geers and Codenys.

==Exhibitions==
He has exhibited globally since 1993 and participated in numerous exhibitions including [[Documenta]], the [[Carnegie International]], Havana Biennial, Istanbul Biennial, Kwang Ju Biennial, Taipei Biennial, [[Gwangju Biennale]], Lyon Biennial, [[Glasstress]] at the Venice Biennale, as well as presented solo exhibitions in the CCA Cincinnati, [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst]] Gent, [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baltic Museum Presents Kendell Geers|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/10544/Baltic-Museum-Presents-Kendell-Geers/?month=&amp;year=|work=Design Taxi|accessdate=28 February 2013|date=3 Aug 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspen Art Museum, MOCA in Rome, Migros Museum, Palais de Tokyo, the CAC in Lyon and Haus der Kunst in Munich.

'''[[Korea|Korean]] [[embroidery]]''' techniques and artifacts have a long history, but there is the most evidence from the [[Joseon Dynasty]], after the 14th century in [[Korea]]. This article talks about the history, styles, preservation, artists, and examples of screens, costumes, and domestic wares of this exacting and beautiful [[art]] form. 

People used needles made out of bones of fish or animals to sew and weave animal skins and the bark or leaves of trees.

''Chasu'', the Korean word for embroidery, was a method of cultivating beauty in every corner of daily life. ''Pokshik chasu'', ''kiyong chasu'', ''kamsang chasu'' and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''chasu'' are the four types of Chasu.

* Pokshik chasu is the embroidery on clothes.  
* Kiyong chasu is the embroidery decorated on various materials used in the king’s palace.
* Kamsang chasu represented a type of artistic piece.
* Buddhist chasu came from Buddhism.  Buddhist chasu was used in the statues of Buddha or various temples. Chasu has begun from the prehistoric era when the humans first started to make clothes.

==History==
Traditional [[embroidery]] of Korea has a long history and has expressed the aesthetic qualities of Korea according to the changes of the times. The embroidery has been cultivating beauty with delicate skill in every day life through the stiffness of needle, sweat and stitches along with weaving and sewing, and also the national emotions have blossomed in.

Traditional embroidery of Korea used silk cloth and thread mainly before the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] and had a special gloss and texture. As a result, the aesthetic effect of embroidery was expressed as beautifully as possible. This silk embroidery was first introduced in Persia, became popular in Iran, and was known to have been brought to Korea through India and China.&lt;ref name="한국민족대백과"&gt;{{cite web|title=자수|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=795420&amp;cid=46671&amp;categoryId=46671|website=한국민족대백과|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistory===
In the Bronze Age, there are ferrules made of soil or stone, large and small crocodiles, stone needles, and needle houses. It can be inferred that weaving and sewing were already done at the time when such spinning tools and sewing tools were unearthed.

Following the Bronze Age, iron farming came into being in the Iron Age, and agriculture was remarkably developed. Textile cultivation technology developed and textile production increased. In the case of "Three Kingdoms" and "Huh Hanbook", it is said that this time, it was cultivated horse and mulberry trees and raised that silkworm cocoons, including cotton seeds, mapo, and coops.

The development of these fabrics is a basic requirement for embroidery development. In the granting of the transfer of the "Three Kingdoms", "the grantor wears clothes made of silver, gold, silver, and silver when he goes abroad", and the number is recorded as silver silk embroidered with gold and silver.

The embroidery is presumed to have been embroidered on clothes, flags and wagons with signs indicating the rank and class of the ruling class at that time, although the facts of this age are not conveyed to today because of the nature of the materials which are easily damaged . Literary records of the embroidery before the Three Kingdoms period are only fragmentary about the embroidery and the fabric used in the Goryeo, Goguryeo, Mahan, Jinhwan, Changjin, and Yeon before the Three Kingdoms period.&lt;ref name="한국민족대백과" /&gt;

===Samgukside(Three Kingdoms Period)===
In this age, production tools and production technology have been developed in general and productivity has improved. As a result, weaving machines have been improved and weaving has been developed. And the kinds of fabrics have increased and quality also has improved. Therefore, embroidery decorations would have been performed on clothes and various textile products.
However, the literature on embroidery is scarce and there are no examples of embroidery artifacts left yet. Among the unearthed artifacts of Gyeongju Cheonmachuk excavated in 1973, traces of gold silk were found on the hem.

In the [[Samguk sagi]] and [[Samgukyusa]], the Silla Dynasty Queen(Jinduk Queen 4) sent "Taipyeong Song" to [[Tang dynasty]]. The "Taepyeongsong" embroidery, which was produced as a diplomatic gift at that time, is a masterpiece in which 100 Chinese characters combined with 5 and 20 lines are embroidered. The content was a ritual that praised Gojong's dignity.

The number of "Taepyongsong" suggests that firstly, embroidery has made a great contribution as a diplomatic gift to represent the friendship between nations. Secondly, the record that the queen squeezed her handmade silk was important for embroidery, including sewing, weaving and dyeing, as a household art that women should acquire from their childhood, from noble to commoner.

The embroidery was brought to Japan with various cultures developed in this period and had a great influence. Such facts can be found in the records of the Japanese Nihon Shiki and the Japanese embroidery textbook chronicle. Around 340 BC, the king of Baekje sent Jin Maojin, the workwoman, to Japan and she became the founder of Japanese embroidery.

In addition, the head of the maritime state Mandara (Japanese National Treasure), which was built by Kagyu Iga, is depicted as a Goguryeo-style figure. It is believed that the embroidery techniques of Koguryo and Baekje were handed down to Japan because there are many similarities.
The embroidery of Goguryeo, Silla, and Baekje are commonly seen as representing the identity of the nobility, and they have been supplemented with abstract paintings on restoration, longevity.&lt;ref name="한국민족대백과" /&gt;

===Unified Silla Period===
In this era, cultural characteristics of the Three Kingdoms were fused and gathered and enjoyed the glorious golden age of culture. Embroidery was also considered to have developed considerably both quantitatively and qualitatively. However, there are no existing artifacts at the time, and no detailed data on embroidery techniques and patterns can be found, so research through works is impossible. However, when you look at the "Samguksagi" , you can see that the embroidery has been decorated with embroidery from cloths to saddle, and daily necessities, and Buddhist embroidery has also prospered considerably.
The records of the embroidery are summarized first, and in 834 (the 9th year of King Heungdeok) the costume ban was issued and stipulated the kind of use of fabric according to the status. This ban was enforced, and it can be seen that the demand for fine fabrics and embroidery was considerable due to the luxury that was prevalent in the noble society at the time.
On the other hand, there were many workshops dedicated to weaving, dyeing, and sewing in this period, contributing to the development of textile arts.&lt;ref name="책1"&gt;{{cite book|title=자수문양|date=2005-09-30|publisher=국립민속박문관, 한국문화콘텐츠진흥원}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goryeo Dynasty===
In the [[Goryeo]] era, the embroidery has evolved more and more. The country established a bureaucratic office and a manual book to produce various cloths and handicrafts. It seems that not only the items shown in the literature have been diversified compared to the previous era, but also the production technology has developed considerably. According to the "Goryo Dogyung",  the guards who escorted the king usually wore silk bouquets embroidered with five-color flowers or birds, and decorated with white flowers in their waistbands. As the embroidery is decorated up to military uniforms, it seems that the embroidery decoration was also performed in the costumes of the noble and common people.&lt;ref name="책1" /&gt;

===Joseon Dynasty===
The most prominent feature of embroidery development in the [[Joseon]] Dynasty is that the use of handicrafts has expanded to the general level, The embroideries used in the court are made by skilled ladies who are experts in embroidery belonging to the court, and the embroidery expressions are precise and the arrangement of the colors is sophisticated, but it is somewhat formalized because it is made by standardized handwriting. On the other hand, the embroideries made in the villages are not very sophisticated because of their low proficiency, but they are varied and interesting because they 
embroidered to their taste.

===Modern===
Craftsman with professional handicraft technique embroidering succeeds embroidery culture. They hold an exhibition in South Korea and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baek|first1=JunSang|title=Traditional embroidery artist Lee Jung-sook, a civil diplomat who competes with art|url=http://www.queen.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=203513|agency=MagazinePlus INC

==Components and Features==
===Material===
The base cloth of embroidery was white or blue silk colored silk, and wool was rarely used. And the investigation was mainly used by the half - puns and the twins.
In the mid Joseon Dynasty, the lacquered sagas became thinner and the thick braided saga after the late Joseon Dynasty was the basic material of traditional embroidery. Braided yarn has strength and elasticity and can be easily remained or undamaged.
Also, it is suitable for regular fine embroidery, and the twisted yarn is strong, so that the gloss of the yarn is not exposed. There are differences in the effect of expression depending on the number of twisted lines and the direction of the beam (left or right), but in any case, the surface of the braided yarn of constant thickness by a constant light becomes flat without any bending. On the other hand, it is difficult to carry regular or detailed description of the hempen yarn because it is thick and coarse and it can not keep the stool short.&lt;ref name="한국민족대백과" /&gt;

===Embroidery pattern===
In the case of the actual pattern, the phrase implies that the pattern has the role of verbal communication as a combination of kanji with the meaning of a word indicating a phenomenon in the cloth. Therefore, the pattern contains a silent language that I want to convey, and the origin of human beings is contained in the silent language. It is embroidery pattern that expresses the pattern with these characteristics in real, and expresses the wish and origination of human history by expressing nature 's landscape, flora and fauna.

==Household goods==
===Women's Costume===
The Hwal-ot:활옷 is the ladies' dresses of the Princess and Ongju of the Joseon Dynasty, Mainly worn by women of the upper classes. 
It is a common practice to sew 10 things that symbolize long live over the entire garment.
===Accessories===
The pouch was packed with a small item or money and packed in a waistband. The main characters used in the text are light, wealthy, long live and luck. plant pattern are chrysanthemums, flowers, morning glory, orchids, peonies, bamboo, vines, cherry blossoms, peaches, peach flowers, , Pine trees, lotus flowers, roses, fenugreek. And the animal pattern is a turtle, a butterfly, a barbeque, a bee, a phoenix, a deer, a bird and so on.

Norigae is a trinket for women to wear on a jacket pant or skirt waist. It is embroidered lotus, clouds, stones, waves, suns, and gauze in a square emblem.

==Embroidery technique==
===jaryeonsu:자련수===
It is a technique used to express things in a realistic way or to express the natural change of color by using light and shade. It is filled with irregularly long, short, It can make a natural change according to the coloring of the color and the orientation of the gathering and it is suitable for embroidering petal, leaves and clouds of a comparatively large area.&lt;ref name="책1" /&gt;
===chilbosu:칠보수===
It is a unique technique of Korean embroidery which can not be seen in western embroidery. It is a technique to make regular and geometric patterns by putting the base of the embroidery on it and placing the embroidery on it.&lt;ref name="책1" /&gt;
===jing-guemsu:징금수===
It is a technique to fix a thick thread or a band with an area that is not stitched on the eye with a thin thread such as a cord, a thick thread, a gold thread, or a silver thread on a cloth.&lt;ref name="책1" /&gt;
===jarisu:자리수===
It is a unique embroidery technique that is only in Korean traditional embroidery. It is a technique to express the shape of matting mat and it is mainly used when filling a wide side.&lt;ref name="책1" /&gt;

{{confuse|Group of Lie type}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''Lie group''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|l|iː}} "Lee") is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is also a [[differentiable manifold]], with the property that the group operations are smooth. Lie groups are named after Norwegian mathematician [[Sophus Lie]], who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous [[transformation group]]s.

In rough terms, a Lie group is a continuous group, that is, one whose elements are described by several real parameters. As such, Lie groups provide a natural model for the concept of continuous symmetry, such as rotational symmetry in three dimensions. Lie groups are widely used in many parts of modern mathematics and physics. Lie's original motivation for introducing Lie groups was to model the continuous symmetries of [[differential equations]], in much the same way that finite groups are used in [[Galois theory]] to model the discrete symmetries of [[algebraic equations]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Circle as Lie group.svg|right|thumb|The set of all [[complex number]]s with [[absolute value]] 1 (corresponding to points on the [[circle]] of center 0 and radius 1 in the [[complex plane]]) is a Lie group under complex multiplication:  the [[circle group]].]]
Lie groups are [[smoothness|smooth]] [[differentiable manifold]]s and as such can be studied using [[differential calculus]], in contrast with the case of more general [[topological group]]s. One of the key ideas in the theory of Lie groups is to replace the ''global'' object, the group, with its ''local'' or linearized version, which Lie himself called its "infinitesimal group" and which has since become known as its [[Lie algebra]].

Lie groups play an enormous role in modern [[geometry]], on several different levels. [[Felix Klein]] argued in his [[Erlangen program]] that one can consider various "geometries" by specifying an appropriate transformation group that leaves certain geometric properties [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. Thus [[Euclidean geometry]] corresponds to the choice of the group [[Euclidean group|E(3)]] of distance-preserving transformations of the Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, [[conformal geometry]] corresponds to enlarging the group to the [[conformal group]], whereas in [[projective geometry]] one is interested in the properties invariant under the [[projective group]]. This idea later led to the notion of a [[G-structure]], where ''G'' is a Lie group of "local" symmetries of a manifold.

Lie groups (and their associated Lie algebras) play a major role in modern physics, with the Lie group typically playing the role of a symmetry of a physical system. Here, the [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] of the Lie group (or of its [[Lie algebra representation|Lie algebra]]) are especially important. Representation theory [[Particle physics and representation theory|is used extensively in particle physics]]. Groups whose representations are of particular importance include [[3D_rotation_group|the rotation group SO(3)]] (or its [[3D_rotation_group#Connection_between_SO(3)_and_SU(2)|double cover SU(2)]]),  [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for SU(3)#Representations of the SU.283.29 group|the special unitary group SU(3)]] and the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]].

On a "global" level, whenever a Lie group [[group action|acts]] on a geometric object, such as a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] or a [[symplectic manifold]], this action provides a measure of rigidity and yields a rich algebraic structure. The presence of continuous symmetries expressed via a [[Lie group action]] on a manifold places strong constraints on its geometry and facilitates [[global analysis|analysis]] on the manifold. Linear actions of Lie groups are especially important, and are studied in [[representation theory]].

In the 1940s&amp;ndash;1950s, [[Ellis Kolchin]], [[Armand Borel]], and [[Claude Chevalley]] realised that many foundational results concerning Lie groups can be developed completely algebraically, giving rise to the theory of [[algebraic group]]s defined over an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]]. This insight opened new possibilities in pure algebra, by providing a uniform construction for most [[finite simple group]]s, as well as in [[algebraic geometry]]. The theory of [[automorphic form]]s, an important branch of modern [[number theory]], deals extensively with analogues of Lie groups over [[adele ring]]s; [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] Lie groups play an important role, via their connections with Galois representations in number theory.

== Definitions and examples ==
A '''real Lie group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is also a finite-dimensional real [[Differentiable manifold#Definition|smooth manifold]], in which the group operations of [[multiplication]] and inversion are [[smooth map]]s.  Smoothness of the group multiplication

:&lt;math&gt; \mu:G\times G\to G\quad \mu(x,y)=xy&lt;/math&gt;

means that μ is a smooth mapping of the [[Manifold#Cartesian products|product manifold]] ''G''×''G'' into ''G''.  These two requirements can be combined to the single requirement that the mapping
:&lt;math&gt;(x,y)\mapsto x^{-1}y&lt;/math&gt;
be a smooth mapping of the product manifold into ''G''.

=== First examples ===
* The 2×2 [[real number|real]] [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] form a group under multiplication, denoted by [[general linear group|GL(2, '''R''')]] or by GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''):

:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{GL}(2, \mathbf{R}) = \left\{A=\begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\\c&amp;d\end{pmatrix}: \det A=ad-bc \ne 0\right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

: This is a four-dimensional [[compact space|noncompact]] real Lie group; it is an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^4&lt;/math&gt;. This group is [[connected space|disconnected]]; it has two connected components corresponding to the positive and negative values of the [[determinant]].

* The [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] matrices form a [[subgroup]] of GL(2, '''R'''), denoted by SO(2, '''R'''). It is a Lie group in its own right: specifically, a one-dimensional compact connected Lie group which is [[diffeomorphic]] to the [[circle]]. Using the rotation angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; as a parameter, this group can be [[parametric equations|parametrized]] as follows:
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{SO}(2, \mathbf{R}) =\left\{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\varphi &amp; -\sin \varphi \\ \sin \varphi &amp; \cos \varphi \end{pmatrix}:  \varphi\in\mathbf{R}/2\pi\mathbf{Z}\right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

:Addition of the angles corresponds to multiplication of the elements of SO(2, '''R'''), and taking the opposite angle corresponds to inversion. Thus both multiplication and inversion are differentiable maps.

* The [[Affine group#Matrix representation|affine group of one dimension]] is a two-dimensional matrix Lie group, consisting of &lt;math&gt;2\times 2&lt;/math&gt; real, upper-triangular matrices, with the first diagonal entry being positive and the second diagonal entry being 1. Thus, the group consists of matrices of the form
::&lt;math&gt; A= \left( \begin{array}{cc} a &amp; b\\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right),\quad a&gt;0,\, b\in\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Counterexample ===
We now present an example of a group with an uncountable number of elements that is not a Lie group under a certain topology.   The group given by 

:&lt;math&gt;H = \left\{\left .\left(\begin{matrix}e^{2\pi i\theta} &amp; 0\\0 &amp; e^{2\pi ia\theta}\end{matrix}\right) \right| \theta \in \mathbb{R}\right\} \subset \mathbb{T}^2 = \left\{\left .\left(\begin{matrix}e^{2\pi i\theta} &amp; 0\\0 &amp; e^{2\pi i\phi}\end{matrix}\right)\right| \theta, \phi \in \mathbb{R}\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb P = \mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; a ''fixed'' [[irrational number]], is a subgroup of the [[torus]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb T^2&lt;/math&gt; that is not a Lie group when given the [[subspace topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossmann|2001|loc=Chapter 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we take any small neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, for example, the portion of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is disconnected. The group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; winds repeatedly around the torus and forms a [[dense set|dense]] subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb T^2&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Irrational line on a torus.png|thumb|right|A portion of the group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; inside &lt;math&gt;\mathbb T^2&lt;/math&gt;. Small neighborhoods of the element &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt; are disconnected in the subset topology on &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;]]

The group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; can, however, be given a different topology, in which the distance between two points &lt;math&gt;h_1,h_2\in H&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the length of the shortest path ''in the group H'' joining &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt;. In this topology, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is identified homeomorphically with the real line by identifying each element with the number &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. With this topology, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is just the group of real numbers under addition and is therefore a Lie group.

The group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is an example of a "[[Lie subgroup]]" of a Lie group that is not closed. See the discussion below of Lie subgroups in the section on basic concepts.

===Matrix Lie groups===

Let GL(''n''; '''C''') denote the group of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} invertible matrices with entries in '''C'''. Any [[Closed subgroup theorem|closed subgroup]] of GL(''n'', '''C''') is a Lie group;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.45&lt;/ref&gt; Lie groups of this sort are called '''matrix Lie groups.''' Since most of the interesting examples of Lie groups can be realized as matrix Lie groups, some textbooks restrict attention to this class, including those of Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rossmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossmann|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restricting attention to matrix Lie groups simplifies the definition of the Lie algebra and the exponential map. The following are standard examples of matrix Lie groups.
*The [[special linear group]]s over '''R''' and '''C''', SL(''n'', '''R''') and SL(''n'', '''C'''), consisting of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices with determinant one and entries in '''R''' or '''C'''
*The [[unitary group]]s and special unitary groups, U(''n'') and SU(''n''), consisting of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} complex matrices satisfying &lt;math&gt;U^*=U^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (and also &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{det}(U)=1&lt;/math&gt; in the case of SU(''n''))
*The [[orthogonal group]]s and special orthogonal groups, O(''n'') and SO(''n''), consisting of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} real matrices satisfying &lt;math&gt;R^\mathrm{T}=R^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (and also &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{det}(R)=1&lt;/math&gt; in the case of SO(''n''))
All of the preceding examples fall under the heading of the [[classical group]]s.

=== Related concepts ===
A '''[[complex Lie group]]''' is defined in the same way using [[complex manifold]]s rather than real ones (example: SL(2, '''C''')), and similarly, using an alternate [[Complete metric space#Completion|metric completion]] of '''Q''', one can define a '''''p''-adic Lie group''' over the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]], a topological group in which each point has a ''p''-adic neighborhood. [[Hilbert's fifth problem]] asked whether replacing differentiable manifolds with topological or analytic ones can yield new examples. The answer to this question turned out to be negative: in 1952, [[Andrew Gleason|Gleason]], [[Deane Montgomery|Montgomery]] and [[Leo Zippin|Zippin]] showed that if ''G'' is a topological manifold with continuous group operations, then there exists exactly one analytic structure on ''G'' which turns it into a Lie group (see also [[Hilbert&amp;ndash;Smith conjecture]]). If the underlying manifold is allowed to be infinite-dimensional (for example, a [[Hilbert manifold]]), then one arrives at the notion of an infinite-dimensional Lie group.  It is possible to define analogues of many [[group of Lie type|Lie groups over finite fields]], and these give most of the examples of [[finite simple group]]s.

The language of [[category theory]] provides a concise definition for Lie groups: a Lie group is a [[group object]] in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of smooth manifolds. This is important, because it allows generalization of the notion of a Lie group to [[supergroup (physics)|Lie supergroups]].

== More examples of Lie groups ==
{{see also|Table of Lie groups|List of simple Lie groups}}

Lie groups occur in abundance throughout mathematics and physics. [[Matrix group]]s or [[algebraic group]]s are (roughly) groups of matrices (for example, [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] and [[symplectic group]]s), and these give most of the more common examples of Lie groups.

===Dimensions one and two===
The only connected Lie groups with dimension one are the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (with the group operation being addition) and the group &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; of complex numbers with absolute value one (with the group operation being multiplication). The &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; group is often denoted as &lt;math&gt;U(1)&lt;/math&gt;, the group of &lt;math&gt;1\times 1&lt;/math&gt; unitary matrices.

In two dimensions, if we restrict attention to simply connected groups, then they are classified by their Lie algebras. There are (up to isomorphism) only two Lie algebras of dimension two. The associated simply connected Lie groups are &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; (with the group operation being vector addition) and the affine group in dimension one, described in the previous subsection under "first examples."

=== Additional examples ===
*The [[Special unitary group#n_.3D_2|group SU(2)]] is the group of &lt;math&gt;2\times 2&lt;/math&gt; unitary matrices with determinant 1. Topologically, SU(2) is the 3-sphere &lt;math&gt;S^3&lt;/math&gt;; as a group, it may be identified with the group of unit [[quaternion]]s. 
*The [[Heisenberg group]] is a connected [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] Lie group of dimension 3, playing a key role in [[quantum mechanics]].
*The [[Lorentz group]] is a 6-dimensional Lie group of linear [[isometry|isometries]] of the [[Minkowski space]].
*The [[Poincaré group]] is a 10-dimensional Lie group of [[affine transformation|affine]] isometries of the Minkowski space.
*The [[exceptional Lie group]]s of types [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[F4 (mathematics)|''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E6 (mathematics)|''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E7 (mathematics)|''E''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E8 (mathematics)|''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]] have dimensions 14, 52, 78, 133, and 248. Along with the A-B-C-D series of [[simple Lie group]]s, the exceptional groups complete the list of simple Lie groups. 
*The [[symplectic group]] Sp(2''n'', '''R''') consists of all 2''n'' × 2''n'' matrices preserving a ''[[symplectic form]]'' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. It is a connected Lie group of dimension 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''n''.

=== Constructions ===
There are several standard ways to form new Lie groups from old ones:
*The product of two Lie groups is a Lie group.
*Any [[Closed set|topologically closed]] subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie group. This is known as the [[Closed subgroup theorem]] or '''Cartan's theorem'''.
*The quotient of a Lie group by a closed normal subgroup is a Lie group.
*The [[universal cover]] of a connected Lie group is a Lie group. For example, the group '''R''' is the universal cover of the circle group '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In fact any covering of a differentiable manifold is also a differentiable manifold, but by specifying ''universal'' cover, one guarantees a group structure (compatible with its other structures).

=== Related notions ===
Some examples of groups that are ''not'' Lie groups (except in the trivial sense that any group can be viewed as a 0-dimensional Lie group, with the [[discrete topology]]), are:

*Infinite-dimensional groups, such as the additive group of an infinite-dimensional real vector space. These are not Lie groups as they are not ''finite-dimensional'' manifolds.
*Some [[totally disconnected group]]s, such as the [[Galois group]] of an infinite extension of fields,  or the additive group of the ''p''-adic numbers. These are not Lie groups because their underlying spaces are not real manifolds. (Some of these groups are "''p''-adic Lie groups".) In general, only topological groups having similar [[local property|local properties]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some positive integer ''n'' can be Lie groups (of course they must also have a differentiable structure).

== Basic concepts ==

=== The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group ===
{{main|Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence}}
To every Lie group we can associate a Lie algebra whose underlying vector space is the tangent space of the Lie group at the identity element and which completely captures the local structure of the group. Informally we can think of elements of the Lie algebra as elements of the group that are "[[infinitesimal]]ly close" to the identity, and the Lie bracket of the Lie algebra is related to the [[commutator]] of two such infinitesimal elements. Before giving the abstract definition we give a few examples:
* The Lie algebra of the vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is just '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the Lie bracket given by &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [''A'',&amp;nbsp;''B''] = 0. &lt;br /&gt; (In general the Lie bracket of a connected Lie group is always 0 if and only if the Lie group is abelian.)
* The Lie algebra of the [[general linear group]] GL(''n'', '''C''') of invertible matrices is the vector space M(''n'', '''C''') of square matrices with the Lie bracket given by &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [''A'',&amp;nbsp;''B''] = ''AB''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''BA''.
*If ''G'' is a closed subgroup of GL(''n'', '''C''') then the Lie algebra of ''G'' can be thought of informally as the matrices ''m'' of M(''n'', '''R''') such that 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε''m'' is in ''G'', where ε is an infinitesimal positive number with ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (of course, no such real number ε exists). For example, the orthogonal group O(''n'', '''R''') consists of matrices ''A'' with ''AA''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, so the Lie algebra consists of the matrices ''m'' with (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε''m'')(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε''m'')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, which is equivalent to ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 because ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
*The preceding description can be made more rigorous as follows. The Lie algebra of a closed subgroup ''G'' of GL(''n'', '''C'''), may be computed as
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Lie}(G) = \{ X \in M(n;\mathbb{C}) | \operatorname{exp}(tX) \in G \text{ for all } t \text{ in } \mathbb{\mathbb{R}} \},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|loc=Ch. II, § 2, Proposition 2.7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where exp(''tX'') is defined using the [[matrix exponential]]. It can then be shown that the Lie algebra of ''G'' is a real vector space that is closed under the bracket operation, &lt;math&gt;[X,Y]=XY-YX&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The concrete definition given above for matrix groups is easy to work with, but has some minor problems: to use it we first need to represent a Lie group as a group of matrices, but not all Lie groups can be represented in this way, and even it is not obvious that the Lie algebra is independent of the representation we use.&lt;ref&gt;But see {{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Proposition 3.30 and Exercise 8 in Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; To get around these problems we give 
the general definition of the Lie algebra of a Lie group (in 4 steps):
#Vector fields on any smooth manifold ''M'' can be thought of as [[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivations]] ''X'' of the ring of smooth functions on the manifold, and therefore form a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket [''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'']&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''XY''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''YX'', because the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] of any two derivations is a derivation.
#If ''G'' is any group acting smoothly on the manifold ''M'', then it acts on the vector fields, and the vector space  of vector fields fixed by the group is closed under the Lie bracket and therefore also forms a Lie algebra.
#We apply this construction to the case when the manifold ''M'' is the underlying space of a Lie group&amp;nbsp;''G'', with ''G'' acting on ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M'' by left translations ''L&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''(''h'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''gh''. This shows that the space of left invariant vector fields (vector fields satisfying ''L&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''X&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' =&amp;nbsp;''X&lt;sub&gt;gh&lt;/sub&gt;'' for every ''h'' in ''G'', where ''L&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the differential of ''L&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'') on a Lie group is a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket of vector fields.
#Any tangent vector at the identity of a Lie group can be extended to a left invariant vector field by left translating the tangent vector to other points of the manifold. Specifically, the left invariant extension of an element ''v'' of the tangent space at the identity is the vector field defined by ''v''^&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''L&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;''v''. This identifies the [[tangent space]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;G'' at the identity with the space of left invariant vector fields, and therefore makes the tangent space at the identity into a Lie algebra, called the Lie algebra of ''G'', usually denoted by a [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|Fraktur]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}.&lt;/math&gt; Thus the Lie bracket on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is given explicitly by [''v'',&amp;nbsp;''w'']&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''v''^,&amp;nbsp;''w''^]&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;.

This Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional and it has the same dimension as the manifold ''G''. The Lie algebra of ''G'' determines ''G'' up to "local isomorphism", where two Lie groups are called '''locally isomorphic''' if they look the same near the identity element.
Problems about Lie groups are often solved by first solving the corresponding problem for the Lie algebras, and the result for groups then usually follows easily.  
For example, simple Lie groups are usually classified by first classifying the corresponding Lie algebras.

We could also define a Lie algebra structure on ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' using right invariant vector fields instead of left invariant vector fields. This leads to the same Lie algebra, because the inverse map on ''G'' can be used to identify left invariant vector fields with right invariant vector fields, and acts as &amp;minus;1 on the tangent space ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The Lie algebra structure on ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' can also be described as follows:
the commutator operation

: (''x'', ''y'') → ''xyx''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;

on ''G'' &amp;times; ''G'' sends (''e'',&amp;nbsp;''e'') to ''e'', so its derivative yields a [[bilinear operator|bilinear operation]] on ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;G''. This bilinear operation is actually the zero map, but the second derivative, under the proper identification of tangent spaces, yields an operation that satisfies the axioms of a [[Lie algebra#Definition and first properties|Lie bracket]], and it is equal to twice the one defined through left-invariant vector fields.

=== Homomorphisms and isomorphisms ===
If ''G'' and ''H'' are Lie groups, then a Lie group homomorphism ''f'' : ''G'' → ''H''  is a smooth [[group homomorphism]]. In the case of complex Lie groups, such a homomorphism is required to be a [[holomorphic map]]. However, these requirements are a bit stringent; every continuous homomorphism between real Lie groups turns out to be (real) [[analytic map|analytic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.50. Hall only claims smoothness, but the same argument shows analyticity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of two Lie homomorphisms is again a homomorphism, and the class of all Lie groups, together with these morphisms, forms a [[category theory|category]]. Moreover, every Lie group homomorphism induces a homomorphism between the corresponding Lie algebras. Let &lt;math&gt;\phi\colon G \to H&lt;/math&gt; be a Lie group homomorphism and let &lt;math&gt;\phi_{*}&lt;/math&gt; be its [[Pushforward (differential)|derivative]] at the identity. If we identify the Lie algebras of ''G'' and ''H'' with their [[tangent space]]s at the identity elements then &lt;math&gt;\phi_{*}&lt;/math&gt; is a map between the corresponding Lie algebras:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{*}\colon\mathfrak g \to \mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;
One can show that &lt;math&gt;\phi_{*}&lt;/math&gt; is actually a [[Lie algebra homomorphism]] (meaning that it is a [[linear map]] which preserves the [[Lie bracket]]). In the language of [[category theory]], we then have a covariant [[functor]] from the category of Lie groups to the category of Lie algebras which sends a Lie group to its Lie algebra and a Lie group homomorphism to its derivative at the identity.

Two Lie groups are called ''isomorphic'' if there exists a [[bijective]] homomorphism between them whose inverse is also a Lie group homomorphism. Equivalently, it is a [[diffeomorphism]] which is also a group homomorphism. 

===Lie group versus Lie algebra isomorphisms===
Isomorphic Lie groups necessarily have isomorphic Lie algebras; it is then reasonable to ask how isomorphism classes of Lie groups relate to isomorphism classes of Lie algebras.

The first result in this direction is [[Lie's third theorem]], which states that every finite-dimensional, real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of  some (linear) Lie group. One way to prove Lie's third theorem is to use [[Ado's theorem]], which says every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is isomorphic to a matrix Lie algebra. Meanwhile, for every finite-dimensional matrix Lie algebra, there is a linear group (matrix Lie group) with this algebra as its Lie algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.20&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras need not be isomorphic. Furthermore, this result remains true even if we assume the groups are connected. To put it differently, the ''global'' structure of a Lie group is not determined by its Lie algebra; for example, if ''Z'' is any discrete subgroup of the center of ''G'' then ''G'' and ''G''/''Z'' have the same Lie algebra (see the [[table of Lie groups]] for examples). An example of importance in physics are the groups [[Special_unitary_group#The_group_SU(2)|SU(2)]] and [[Rotation group SO(3)|SO(3)]]. These two groups have isomorphic Lie algebras&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Example 3.27&lt;/ref&gt;, but the groups themselves are not isomorphic, because SU(2) is simply connected but SO(3) is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 1.3.4&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, if we require that the Lie group be [[simply connected]], then the global structure is determined by its Lie algebra: two simply connected Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras are isomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 5.7&lt;/ref&gt; (See the next subsection for more information about simply connected Lie groups.) In light of Lie's third theorem, we may therefore say that there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional real Lie algebras and isomorphism classes of simply connected Lie groups.

===Simply connected Lie groups===
{{see also|Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence|Fundamental group#Lie groups}}
A Lie group ''G'' is said to be '''[[Simply connected space|simply connected]]''' if every loop in ''G'' can be shrunk continuously to a point in ''G''. This notion is important because of the following result that has simple connectedness as a hypothesis:
:'''Theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.6&lt;/ref&gt;: Suppose &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are Lie groups with Lie algebras &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;f:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie algebra homomorphism. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is simply connected, then there is a unique Lie group homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi_*=f&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi_*&lt;/math&gt; is the differential of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; at the identity.
[[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence#The correspondence|Lie's third theorem]] says that every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a Lie group. It follows from Lie's third theorem and the preceding result that every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a ''unique'' simply connected Lie group.

An example of a simply connected group is the special unitary group [[Special unitary group#n_.3D_2|SU(2)]], which as a manifold is the 3-sphere. The [[rotation group SO(3)]], on the other hand, is not simply connected. (See [[Rotation group SO(3)#Topology|Topology of SO(3)]].) The failure of SO(3) to be simply connected is intimately connected to the distinction between [[integer spin]] and [[half-integer spin]] in quantum mechanics. Other examples of simply connected Lie groups include the special unitary group [[SU(n)]], the spin group (double cover of rotation group) [[Spin(n)]] for &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;, and the compact symplectic group [[Symplectic group#Sp.28n.29|Sp(n)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 13.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for determining whether a Lie group is simply connected or not are discussed in the article on [[Fundamental group#Lie groups|fundamental groups of Lie groups]].

===The exponential map===
{{Main|Exponential map (Lie theory)}}
{{see also|derivative of the exponential map|normal coordinates}}

The [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] from the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;M(n;\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt;  of the [[general linear group]] &lt;math&gt;GL(n;\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;GL(n;\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the [[matrix exponential]], given by the usual power series:

:&lt;math&gt;\exp(X) = 1 + X + \frac{X^2}{2!} + \frac{X^3}{3!} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

for matrices &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subgroup of &lt;math&gt;GL(n;\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt;, then the exponential map takes the Lie algebra of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; thus, we have an exponential map for all matrix groups. Every element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that is sufficiently close to the identity is the exponential of a matrix in the Lie algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.42&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition above is easy to use, but it is not defined for Lie groups that are not matrix groups, and it is not clear that the exponential map of a Lie group does not depend on its representation as a matrix group. We can solve both problems using a more abstract definition of the exponential map that works for all Lie groups, as follows.

For each vector &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the tangent space to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; at the identity), one proves that there is a unique one-parameter subgroup &lt;math&gt;c:\mathbb R\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;c'(0)=X&lt;/math&gt;. Saying that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a one-parameter subgroup means simply that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth map into &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and that 

:&lt;math&gt;c(s + t) = c(s) c(t)\ &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''s'' and ''t''. The operation on the right hand side is the group multiplication in ''G''. The formal similarity of this formula with the one valid for the [[exponential function]] justifies the definition

:&lt;math&gt;\exp(X) = c(1).\ &lt;/math&gt;

This is called the '''exponential map''', and it maps the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; into the Lie group ''G''. It provides a [[diffeomorphism]] between a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of 0 in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; and a neighborhood of ''e'' in ''G''. This exponential map is a generalization of the exponential function for real numbers (because '''R''' is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of [[positive real numbers]] with multiplication), for complex numbers (because '''C''' is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of non-zero complex numbers with multiplication) and for [[matrix (math)|matrices]] (because M(''n'', '''R''') with the regular commutator is the Lie algebra of the Lie group GL(''n'', '''R''') of all invertible matrices).

Because the exponential map is surjective on some neighbourhood ''N'' of ''e'', it is common to call elements of the Lie algebra '''infinitesimal generators''' of the group ''G''. The subgroup of ''G'' generated by ''N'' is  the identity component of ''G''.

The exponential map and the Lie algebra determine the ''local group structure'' of every connected Lie group, because of the [[Baker&amp;ndash;Campbell&amp;ndash;Hausdorff formula]]: there exists a neighborhood ''U'' of the zero element of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, such that for ''X'', ''Y'' in ''U'' we have

:&lt;math&gt; \exp(X)\,\exp(Y) = \exp\left(X + Y + \tfrac{1}{2}[X,Y] + \tfrac{1}{12}[\,[X,Y],Y] - \tfrac{1}{12}[\,[X,Y],X] - \cdots \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the omitted terms are known and involve Lie brackets of four or more elements. In case ''X'' and ''Y'' commute, this formula reduces to the familiar exponential law {{nowrap|exp(''X'') exp(''Y'') {{=}}}} {{nowrap|exp(''X'' + ''Y'')}}.

The exponential map relates Lie group homomorphisms. That is, if &lt;math&gt;\phi: G \to H&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie group homomorphism and &lt;math&gt;\phi_*: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; the induced map on the corresponding Lie algebras, then for all &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\exp(x)) = \exp(\phi_{*}(x)).\,&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]],&lt;ref group=Note&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~vkiritch/MAT552/ProblemSet1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928024044/http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~vkiritch/MAT552/ProblemSet1.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ExponentialMap-01.png|center]]

(In short, exp is a [[natural transformation]] from the functor Lie to the identity functor on the category of Lie groups.)

The exponential map from the Lie algebra to the Lie group is not always [[Surjective function|onto]], even if the group is connected (though it does map onto the Lie group for connected groups that are either compact or nilpotent). For example, the exponential map of [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]] is not surjective. Also, exponential map is not surjective nor injective for infinite-dimensional (see below) Lie groups modelled on [[Smooth function#Differentiability classes|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Fréchet space]], even from arbitrary small neighborhood of 0 to corresponding neighborhood of 1.

=== Lie subgroup ===
A '''Lie subgroup''' ''H'' of a Lie group ''G'' is a Lie group that is a [[subset]] of ''G'' and such that the [[inclusion map]] from ''H'' to ''G'' is an [[injective]] [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] and [[group homomorphism]]. According to [[Closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]], a closed [[subgroup]] of ''G'' admits a unique smooth structure which makes it an [[embedding|embedded]] Lie subgroup of ''G''—i.e. a Lie subgroup such that the inclusion map is a smooth embedding.

Examples of non-closed subgroups are plentiful; for example take ''G'' to be a torus of dimension ≥ 2, and let ''H'' be a [[one-parameter subgroup]] of ''irrational slope'', i.e. one that winds around in ''G''. Then there is a Lie group [[homomorphism]] φ : '''R''' → ''G'' with ''H'' as its image. The [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''H'' will be a sub-torus in ''G''.

The [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] gives a [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence#The correspondence|one-to-one correspondence]] between the connected Lie subgroups of a connected Lie group ''G'' and the subalgebras of the Lie algebra of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.20&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, the subgroup corresponding to a subalgebra is not a  closed subgroup.  There is no criterion solely based on the structure of ''G'' which determines which subalgebras correspond to closed subgroups.

==Representations==
{{main|Representation of a Lie group}}
{{see also|Compact group#Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group|Lie algebra representation}}
One important aspect of the study of Lie groups is their representations, that is, the way they can act (linearly) on vector spaces. In physics, Lie groups often encode the symmetries of a physical system. The way one makes use of this symmetry to help analyze the system is often through representation theory. Consider, for example, the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]] in quantum mechanics, &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}\psi = E\psi&lt;/math&gt;. Assume the system in question has the [[rotation group SO(3)]] as a symmetry, meaning that the Hamiltonian operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with the action of SO(3) on the wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;. (One important example of such a system is the [[Hydrogen atom]].) This assumption does not necessarily mean that the solutions &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; are rotationally invariant functions. Rather, it means that the ''space'' of solutions to &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}\psi = E\psi&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under rotations (for each fixed value of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;). This space, therefore, constitutes a representation of SO(3). These representations have been [[Representation of a Lie group#An example: The rotation group SO.283.29|classified]] and the classification leads to a substantial [[Hydrogen-like atom|simplification of the problem]], essentially converting a three-dimensional partial differential equation to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation.

The case of a connected compact Lie group ''K'' (including the just-mentioned case of SO(3)) is particularly tractable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Part III&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, every finite-dimensional representation of ''K'' decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The irreducible representations, in turn, were classified by [[Hermann Weyl]]. [[Compact group#Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group|The classification]] is in terms of the "highest weight" of the representation. The classification is closely related to the [[Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras|classification of representations of a semisimple Lie algebra]].

One can also study (in general infinite-dimensional) unitary representations of an arbitrary Lie group (not necessarily compact). For example, it is possible to give a relatively simple explicit description of the [[Representation theory of SL2(R)|representations of the group SL(2,R)]] and the [[Wigner%27s classification|representations of the Poincaré group]].

== Early history ==
According to the most authoritative source on the early history of Lie groups (Hawkins, p.&amp;nbsp;1), [[Sophus Lie]] himself considered the winter of 1873–1874 as the birth date of his theory of continuous groups. Hawkins, however, suggests that it was "Lie's prodigious research activity during the four-year period from the fall of 1869 to the fall of 1873" that led to the theory's creation (''ibid''). Some of Lie's early ideas were developed in close collaboration with [[Felix Klein]].  Lie met with Klein every day from October 1869 through 1872: in Berlin from the end of October 1869 to the end of February 1870, and in Paris, Göttingen and Erlangen in the subsequent two years (''ibid'', p.&amp;nbsp;2). Lie stated that all of the principal results were obtained by 1884. But during the 1870s all his papers (except the very first note) were published in Norwegian journals, which impeded recognition of the work throughout the rest of Europe (''ibid'', p.&amp;nbsp;76). In 1884 a young German mathematician, [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]], came to work with Lie on a systematic treatise to expose his theory of continuous groups. From this effort resulted the three-volume ''Theorie der Transformationsgruppen'', published in 1888, 1890, and 1893. The term ''groupes de Lie'' first appeared in French in 1893 in the thesis of Lie's student Arthur Tresse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Sur les invariants différentiels des groupes continus de transformations | author= Arthur Tresse |journal=Acta Mathematica|volume=18|year=1893|pages=1–88 |doi=10.1007/bf02418270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lie's ideas did not stand in isolation from the rest of mathematics. In fact, his interest in the geometry of differential equations was first motivated by the work of [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]], on the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s of first order and on the equations of [[classical mechanics]].  Much of Jacobi's work was published posthumously in the 1860s, generating enormous interest in France and Germany (Hawkins, p.&amp;nbsp;43). Lie's ''idée fixe'' was to develop a theory of symmetries of differential equations that would accomplish for them what [[Évariste Galois]] had done for algebraic equations: namely, to classify them in terms of group theory. Lie and other mathematicians showed that the most important equations for [[special functions]] and [[orthogonal polynomials]] tend to arise from group theoretical symmetries. In Lie's early work, the idea was to construct a theory of ''continuous groups'', to complement the theory of [[discrete group]]s that had developed in the theory of [[modular form]]s, in the hands of [[Felix Klein]] and [[Henri Poincaré]]. The initial application that Lie had in mind was to the theory of [[differential equation]]s. On the model of [[Galois theory]] and [[polynomial equation]]s, the driving conception was of a theory capable of unifying, by the study of [[symmetry]], the whole area of [[ordinary differential equation]]s. However, the hope that Lie Theory would unify the entire field of ordinary differential equations was not fulfilled. Symmetry methods for ODEs continue to be studied, but do not dominate the subject. There is a [[differential Galois theory]], but it was developed by others, such as Picard and Vessiot, and it provides a theory of [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]]s, the [[indefinite integral]]s required to express solutions.

Additional impetus to consider continuous groups came from ideas of [[Bernhard Riemann]], on the foundations of geometry, and their further development in the hands of Klein. Thus three major themes in 19th century mathematics were combined by Lie in creating his new theory: the idea of symmetry, as exemplified by Galois through the algebraic notion of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]; geometric theory and the explicit solutions of [[differential equation]]s of mechanics, worked out by [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]] and Jacobi; and the new understanding of [[geometry]] that emerged in the works of [[Julius Plücker|Plücker]], [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]], [[Grassmann]] and others, and culminated in Riemann's revolutionary vision of the subject.

Although today Sophus Lie is rightfully recognized as the creator of the theory of continuous groups, a major stride in the development of their structure theory, which was to have a profound influence on subsequent development of mathematics, was made by [[Wilhelm Killing]], who in 1888 published the first paper in a series entitled ''Die Zusammensetzung der stetigen endlichen Transformationsgruppen'' (''The composition of continuous finite transformation groups'') (Hawkins, p.&amp;nbsp;100). The work of Killing, later refined and generalized by [[Élie Cartan]], led to classification of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s, Cartan's theory of [[Riemannian symmetric space|symmetric spaces]], and [[Hermann Weyl]]'s description of [[group representation|representations]] of compact and semisimple Lie groups using [[highest weight]]s.

In 1900 [[David Hilbert]] challenged Lie theorists with his [[Hilbert's fifth problem|Fifth Problem]] presented at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Paris.

Weyl brought the early period of the development of the theory of Lie groups to fruition, for not only did he classify irreducible representations of semisimple Lie groups and connect the theory of groups with quantum mechanics, but he also put Lie's theory itself on firmer footing by clearly enunciating the distinction between Lie's ''infinitesimal groups'' (i.e., Lie algebras) and the Lie groups proper, and began investigations of topology of Lie groups.{{sfnp|Borel|2001}} The theory of Lie groups was systematically reworked in modern mathematical language in a monograph by [[Claude Chevalley]].

==The concept of a Lie group, and possibilities of classification==
Lie groups may be thought of as smoothly varying families of symmetries. Examples of symmetries include rotation about an axis.  What must be understood is the nature of 'small' transformations, for example, rotations through tiny angles, that link nearby transformations. The mathematical object capturing this structure is called a Lie algebra ([[Sophus Lie|Lie]] himself called them "infinitesimal groups"). It can be defined because Lie groups are smooth manifolds, so have [[tangent space]]s at each point.

The Lie algebra of any compact Lie group (very roughly: one for which the symmetries form a bounded set) can be decomposed as a [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of an [[abelian Lie algebra]] and some number of [[simple Lie group|simple]] ones. The structure of an abelian Lie algebra is mathematically uninteresting (since the Lie bracket is identically zero); the interest is in the simple summands. Hence the question arises: what are the [[simple Lie group|simple Lie algebras]] of compact groups? It turns out that they mostly fall into four infinite families, the "classical Lie algebras" A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, which have simple descriptions in terms of symmetries of Euclidean space. But there are also just five "exceptional Lie algebras" that do not fall into any of these families. E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is the largest of these.

Lie groups are classified according to their algebraic properties ([[simple group|simple]], [[semisimple group|semisimple]], [[solvable group|solvable]], [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]], [[abelian group|abelian]]), their [[connectedness]] ([[connected space|connected]] or [[simply connected space|simply connected]]) and their [[compact space|compactness]].

A first key result is the [[Levi decomposition]], which says that every simply connected Lie group is the semidirect product of a solvable normal subgroup and a semisimple subgroup. 

*Connected [[compact Lie group]]s are all known: they are finite central quotients of a product of copies of the circle group '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and simple compact Lie groups (which correspond to connected [[Dynkin diagram]]s).
*Any simply connected solvable Lie group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices of some rank, and any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of such a group is 1-dimensional. Solvable groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions.
*Any simply connected nilpotent Lie group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal of some rank, and any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of such a group is 1-dimensional. Like solvable groups, nilpotent  groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions.
*[[Simple Lie group]]s are sometimes defined to be those that are simple as abstract groups, and sometimes defined to be connected Lie groups with a simple Lie algebra. For example, [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]] is simple according to the second definition but not according to the first. They have all been [[list of simple Lie groups|classified]] (for either definition).
*[[Semisimple group|Semisimple]] Lie groups are Lie groups whose Lie algebra is a product of simple Lie algebras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sigurdur |last=Helgason |title=Differential Geometry, Lie Groups, and Symmetric Spaces |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |year=1978 |page=131 |isbn=0-12-338460-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are central extensions of products of simple Lie groups.

The [[identity component]] of any Lie group is an open [[normal subgroup]], and the [[quotient group]] is a [[discrete group]]. The universal cover of any connected Lie group is a simply connected Lie group, and conversely any connected Lie group is a quotient of a simply connected Lie group by a discrete normal subgroup of the center. Any Lie group ''G'' can be decomposed into discrete, simple, and abelian groups in a canonical way as follows.  Write 
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;con&lt;/sub&gt; for the connected component of the identity
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt; for the largest connected normal solvable subgroup
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;nil&lt;/sub&gt; for the largest connected normal nilpotent subgroup
so that we have a sequence of normal subgroups
:1 ⊆ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;nil&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;con&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''G''.
Then
:''G''/''G''&lt;sub&gt;con&lt;/sub&gt; is discrete
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;con&lt;/sub&gt;/''G''&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[group extension|central extension]] of a product of [[list of simple Lie groups|simple connected Lie groups]].
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt;/''G''&lt;sub&gt;nil&lt;/sub&gt; is abelian. A connected abelian Lie group is isomorphic to a product of copies of  '''R''' and the [[circle group]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;nil&lt;/sub&gt;/1 is nilpotent, and therefore its ascending central series has all quotients abelian.

This can be used to reduce some problems about Lie groups (such as finding their unitary representations) to the same problems for connected simple groups and nilpotent and solvable subgroups of smaller dimension.

* The [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphism group]] of a Lie group acts transitively on the Lie group
* Every Lie group is [[parallelizable]], and hence an [[orientable manifold]] (there is a [[fibre bundle|bundle isomorphism]] between its [[tangent bundle]] and the product of itself with the [[tangent space]] at the identity)

==Infinite-dimensional Lie groups==
Lie groups are often defined to be finite-dimensional, but there are many groups that resemble Lie groups, except for being infinite-dimensional. The simplest way to define infinite-dimensional Lie groups is to  model them locally on [[Banach space]]s (as opposed to [[Euclidean space]] in the finite-dimensional case), and in this case much of the basic theory is similar to that of finite-dimensional Lie groups. However this is inadequate for many applications, because many natural examples of infinite-dimensional Lie groups are not Banach manifolds. Instead one needs to define Lie groups modeled on more general [[Locally convex space|locally convex]] topological vector spaces. In this case the relation between the Lie algebra and the Lie group becomes rather subtle, and several results about finite-dimensional Lie groups no longer hold.

The literature is not entirely uniform in its terminology as to exactly which properties of infinite-dimensional groups qualify the group for the prefix ''Lie'' in ''Lie group''. On the Lie algebra side of affairs, things are simpler since the qualifying criteria for the prefix ''Lie'' in ''Lie algebra'' are purely algebraic. For example, an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra may or may not have a corresponding Lie group. That is, there may be a group corresponding to the Lie algebra, but it might not be nice enough to be called a Lie group, or the connection between the group and the Lie algebra might not be nice enough (for example, failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity). It is the "nice enough" that is not universally defined.

Some of the examples that have been studied include:
*The group of [[diffeomorphism]]s of a manifold. Quite a lot is known about the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle. Its Lie algebra is (more or less) the [[Witt algebra]], whose [[Lie algebra extension|central extension]] the [[Virasoro algebra]] (see [[Lie algebra extension#Virasoro algebra|Virasoro algebra from Witt algebra]] for a derivation of this fact) is the symmetry algebra of [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]]. Diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds of larger dimension are [[Convenient vector space#Regular Lie groups|regular Fréchet Lie groups]]; very little about their structure is known.
The diffeomorphism group of spacetime sometimes appears in attempts to [[Quantization (physics)|quantize]] gravity.
*The group of smooth maps from a manifold to a finite-dimensional Lie group is an example of a [[gauge group]] (with operation of [[pointwise multiplication]]), and is used  in [[quantum field theory]] and [[Donaldson theory]]. If the manifold is a circle these are called [[loop group]]s, and have central extensions whose Lie algebras are (more or less) [[Kac&amp;ndash;Moody algebra]]s.
*There are infinite-dimensional analogues of general linear groups, orthogonal groups, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bäruerle|de Kerf|ten Kroode|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important aspect is that these may have ''simpler'' topological properties: see for example [[Kuiper's theorem]]. In [[M-theory]], for example, a 10 dimensional SU(N) gauge theory becomes an 11 dimensional theory when N becomes infinite.

{{American and British English differences}}

This page lists '''works with different titles in the United Kingdom and United States'''. Categories of such works include [[edition (book)#Co-edition|co-editions of books]] and foreign releases of films. Unless otherwise noted, [[United Kingdom|UK]] titles are also used in most other countries, with the exception that [[Canada]] generally uses [[United States|US]] titles. [[Australia]] will sometimes utilize a third alternative title, but more often follows UK or US usage, these differences are included where known. Not listed are minor changes due to [[American and British English spelling differences]]; for example, the American film ''[[Rumor Has It...]]'' is titled ''Rumour Has It...'' in the UK, and, atypically, in Canada as well.

Legend:
*An [[asterisk]] (*) indicates which of the two countries the work originated in. If a work originated in a third country, this is covered in the Notes column. 
*[c] indicates cases where Canada follows UK usage.

| Canadian author [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]]
| The UK title is also used in Australia and Japan. The two editions are not exactly the same, as when the book was first published, the working title was ''Anne of Windy Willows'', but Montgomery's publisher wanted to change it because of its purported similarity to [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''. The same publisher also requested some scenes to be cut out for perceived gory or terrifying content, to which Montgomery complied. Montgomery's UK publisher, however, did not see the need for any of these changes, and published the unedited book under the title ''Anne of Windy Willows''.

The '''MexiCali Biennial''' is a contemporary visual arts organization which focuses on the border between California and Mexico as a region of aesthetic production. The organization is migratory in nature and showcases exhibitions on both sides of the border. The MexiCali Biennial was originally started as a project critiquing the proliferation of international and regional art [[biennials]] and as a result may be shown at any time and at any location. The inaugural exhibition was in 2006 and subsequent programming occurred in the years spanning 2009 through 2010 and again in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Luis|title=The MexiCali Biennial: A Binational Art Project|url=http://beyondbordersnews.com/2016/04/17/the-mexicali-biennial-a-binational-art-project/|website=Beyond Borders Gazette|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The MexiCali Biennial was conceived in 2006 by artists Ed Gomez and Luis G. Hernandez.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Christopher|title=Art review: At MexiCali Biennial, cannibalism is consuming theme|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/28/entertainment/la-et-cm-0129-mexicali-biennial-review-20130129|website=LATimes.com|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Pilar Tompkins-Rivas was a founding member and curator of the inaugural exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pilar Tompkins:Mentors|url=http://btwconnect.com/pilar-tompkins-rivas|website=BTWConnect}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 round of programming first took place at La Casa de la Tia Tina, an artist-run space on the border town of [[Mexicali]], MX before traveling to Chavez Studios in East Los Angeles. Due to the nature of the biennial's programming, the second biennial didn't occur until 2009 through 2010, during which time it took place in four different locations in both Mexico and California. Dr. Amy Pederson Converse joined the board and served as co-curator for the 2009-2013 programming. Pederson Converse was instrumental in conceptualizing the theme for the third MexiCali Biennial, which was cannibalism, specifically in regard to philosopher {{ill|Cătălin Avramescu|ro|Cătălin Avramescu}}'s studies of cultural [[cannibalism]] and its relationship to [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vikram|first1=Anuradha|title=The Art of Anthropophagy|url=http://x-traonline.org/article/the-art-of-anthropophagy/|website=X-Tra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MexiCali Biennial 2013: Cannibalism in the New World ==
The 2013 programming was the first time that an official theme was conceived for the exhibitions. The theme of Cannibalism was influenced by philosopher Catalin Avramescu's research on the cannibal throughout history, in particular its place in colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Christopher|title=Art review: At MexiCali Biennial, cannibalism is consuming theme|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/28/entertainment/la-et-cm-0129-mexicali-biennial-review-20130129|website=latimes|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabe|first1=John|title=Feast on the MexiCali Biennial at Vincent Price Art Museum.

A '''mortuary enclosure''' is a term given in [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] to an area, surrounded by a wood, stone or earthwork barrier, in which dead bodies are placed for [[excarnation]] and to await secondary and/or collective burial. There are some parallels with [[mortuary house]]s although the two are the products of different cultural practices and traditions regarding the treatment of the dead.

The mortuary enclosures of the British [[Neolithic]] were sub-rectangular banks with external ditches and raised platforms of stone or wood within them, thought to be used for the exposure of corpses prior to burial elsewhere. Remains of mortuary enclosures of this period are often found under [[long barrow]]s.

'''National School of Drama''' (or '''NSD''') is a theatre training institute situated at [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. It is an autonomous organization under [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]], [[Government of India]]. It was set up in 1959 by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], and became an independent school in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfH1tOwsHcC&amp;pg=PA676&amp;dq=%22national+school+of+drama%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 Training - National School of Drama]''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama'', by Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn. Columbia University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-231-14422-9}}. ''Page 766''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 it was granted [[deemed university]] status, but in 2011 it was revoked on the institute's request.

==''History''==
The origins of the school can be traced back to a seminar in 1954, where the idea of a Central institution for theatre was mooted, subsequently, a draft scheme was prepared in 1955, and the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], which had [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] as its president, started drawing plans for the institution. Meanwhile, elsewhere in Delhi, Bharatiya Natya Sangh (BNS) with assistance from [[UNESCO]], independently established the 'Asian Theatre Institute' (ATI) on 20 January 1958, and in July 1958, ATI was taken over by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] (SNA), India’s National Academy of Music, dance and drama of [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090315/spectrum/main1.htm National School of Drama ..over the past 50 years] [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] 15 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;

In the following year, the government merged it with the newly founded school, and thus NSD was established in April 1959 under the auspices of [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]]. Initially, the school was situated at [[Nizamuddin West]] and was called 'National School of Drama and Asian Theatre Institute, whose first batch passed out in 1961. During his tenure as the director of the institution, [[Ebrahim Alkazi]] (1962–1977), not just overhauled the syllabus, but also had the students dig and build platforms for a theatre in the backyard of a rented [[Kailash Colony]] house, where NSD had moved.&lt;ref name=hin&gt;{{cite news |title=Theatre is revelation (Interview) |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2008/02/24/stories/2008022450160500.htm |publisher=''[[The Hindu]]'' |date=24 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later when it moved to its present location, he also designed two theatres for NSD, including a 200-seat studio theatre, and the open-air Meghdoot theatre, under a banyan tree.&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=COkXM9n7KUcC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22National+School+of+Drama%22#PPA168,M1 National School of Drama] ''The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia/Pacific'', by Don Rubin. Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001. {{ISBN|0-415-26087-6}}. Page 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 it became an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] organization, under the erstwhile Ministry of Education and Ministry of Culture, Department of Culture, with the name 'National School of Drama' and relocated in May 1975, to its present premises at [[Bahawalpur House]], the residence of [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]] a former [[princely state]]. However, the place is generally known by adjacent (now demolished) [[Mandi House]], the former residence of Raja of erstwhile [[Mandi State|Mandi princely state]].&lt;ref name=ns/&gt; In 1999, the School organized its first National Theatre Festival, 'Bharat Rang Mahotsav', generally held during the second week of January each year.

In 2008, the institution celebrated its golden jubilee at its annual theatre festival, ''[[Bharat Rang Mahotsav]]'', with a gathering of its alumni from all over the country,&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Features/Culture_Cauldron/National_School_of_Drama_celebrates_golden_jubilee_in_style/rssarticleshow/2694072.cms National School of Drama celebrates golden jubilee in style] [[The Economic Times]], 12 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the festival’s satellite edition in Mumbai showcased plays of NSD graduates, including Ratan Thiyam’s Prologue, Bansi Kaul (Aranyadhipati Tantiya), Neelam Mansingh Chowdhury (The Suit), Sanjay Upadhyay (Harsingar), [[Baharul Islam (actor)|Baharul Islam]] (Akash), Mohan Maharishi (Dear Bapu) and [[M K Raina]] (Stay Yet Awhile).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/the-graduates/255144/|title=The Graduates|date=28 December 2007|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=2 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004221012/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/the-graduates/255144/|archivedate=4 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waman Kendre was appointed as Director the school in 2013.

===Deemed university status===
On 16 March 2005, the Government of India granted the NSD the status of [[deemed university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page1.asp?relid=7814 National School of Drama gets Deemed University Status][[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] 16 March 2005."The Government has declared the National School of Drama, New Delhi as Deemed to be University with immediate effect."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/mar162005/update11.asp ''NSD declared deemed university''] [[Deccan Herald]] 16 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010 the NSD Society asked for the deemed university status to be revoked since "[it] could undermine the professional training, autonomy, and flexibility required in the creative fields such as theatre." Thus, in October 2011 the status was revoked on request of NSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2518525.ece |title=The Hindu : News / National : NSD loses deemed varsity status on own request  |work=thehindu.com |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Age Orientalism''' describes a modern, Western perception of [[Tibet]], and other Asian majority countries. The term was coined by, [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]] [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Donald Swell Lopez Jr.]], who specializes in Western discourse on [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez Jr|first=Donald Sewell|date=1994|title=New age orientalism: the case of Tibet|url=|journal=Tricycle: The Buddhist Journal|volume=3|pages=36–43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lsa.umich.edu/asian/people/faculty/dlopez.html|title=Donald S. Lopez Jr. {{!}} U-M LSA Asian Languages and Cultures|website=lsa.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tibetologist is a person who studies [[tibetology]], the study of things related to [[Tibet]], including its [[History of Tibet|history]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|religion]], [[Standard Tibetan|language]], politics and the collection of Tibetan articles of historical, cultural and religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tibetology|date=2018-06-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tibetology&amp;oldid=847768940|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibet]] is a [[historical region]] covering much of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] in Central Asia. It is the traditional homeland of the [[Tibetan people]] as well as some other [[Ethnic group|ethnic groups]] such as [[Monpa people|Monpa]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], and [[Lhoba people|Lhoba peoples]] and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tibet|date=2018-08-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tibet&amp;oldid=856854724|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Orientalism on Tibet'''==

[[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Dr. Donald S. Lopez Jr.]] studied the depiction of Tibet in Western academic writing throughout history. He found that, before the New Age movement, the depiction of Tibet was often cynical and derogatory. The demeaning features that define Orientalism, characterized the portrayal of Tibet, before the emergence of New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Self-aggrandizing of the Orient ===
In line with the logic of opposites, members of Western academia stressed their superiority (particularly regarding their academic abilities) and used this as a justification to patronize the Orient. With the modern period came Colonialism, when new knowledge of the Eastern world sparked western scholars to write about foreign histories, cultures, and traditions, despite having a sparse and incomplete understanding of them. The Western world, a majority of which was engaging in colonialism, considered The Eastern world to be incapable of representing itself due to its non-western mechanisms of knowledge. The colonial philosophy of manifest destiny led western scholars to believe that they had a more civilized and valuable way of expression, and so western academics took it upon themselves to document societies, such as Tibet, from their perspectives. Often described as 'backward' or 'incapable,' particularly in self-governance, such portrayals helped to fuel racist and white supremacist beliefs of Asian peoples across the west. Such western scholars considered both China and Tibet to be “Oriental Despotisms,” to which the politically organized and colonizing Western world was meant to civilize. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Gaining and justifying authority ===
[[Manifest destiny]], along with larger ideologies of [[racism]] and [[white supremacy]], were used as a method of justifying imperialism and colonialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Eve|date=2016|title=Orientalist commercializations: Tibetan Buddhism in American popular film|url=https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1852&amp;amp=&amp;context=jrf&amp;amp=&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.de%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Dde%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C5%2526q%253D%252522new%252Bage%252BOrientalism%252522%252Bmullen%2526oq%253Dmull#search=%22new%20age%20Orientalism%20mullen%22|journal=Journal of Religion &amp; Film|volume=2.2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When control of Tibet was taken by western forces for periods of time, western understandings of self-superiority helped to fuel the sense of entitlement, which explained such [[Colonialism|colonial violence]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

However, western powers never fully succeeded in gaining imperial control of Tibet, despite [[British expedition to Tibet|Britain]] and [[Foreign relations of Tibet#Russia and The Great Game|Russia's]] considerable military efforts. According to a western-centric understanding, Tibet never [[Modernization theory|modernized,]] refusing to adopt European-style education systems or norms. Throughout the course of the 19th and 20th century, Tibet remained inaccessible to Western powers, and was therefore predominantly portrayed as isolated, closed, and uncivilized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=='''New Age Orientalism and Tibet'''==

Embedded in the [[New Age|New Age movement]], New Age Orientalism describes the positive Western perception of old Tibet (before the [[Chinese invasion of Tibet|Chinese invasion 1950]] and [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetan diaspora 1959)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This portrayal of Tibet in the modern Western Societies, has been criticized for romanticizing old Tibetan reality and neglecting negative aspects of its society, such as, violence or the clerical, feudal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDuqayOx2Nw|title=Colin Goldner: Hinter dem Lächeln des Dalai Lama (Vortrag Univ. Wien 18.05.2012)|last=Goldner|first=Colin|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, seen as a construct of Western fantasy, rather than a depiction of reality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The myth of Shangri-La: Tibet, travel writing, and the western creatio of sacred landscape.|last=Bishop|first=Peter|publisher=Univ of California Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anand|first=Dibyesh|date=|title=Strategic hypocrisy: The British imperial scripting of Tibet's geopolitical identity|url=|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=68(1)|pages=227–252|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

New Age Orientalism, subsequently, describes the [[Orientalism|orientalist]] perception of Tibet, in which Tibet is no longer depreciated but, rather, romanticized. It is based on the tradition of continued [[Romantic Orientalism]], “in which the ‘West’ perceives some lack within itself and fantasizes that the answer, through a process of projection, is to be found somewhere in the ‘East.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this manner, the four characteristics of Orientalism persist with slight variation. The logic of opposites, now relates to the old Tibet and China. Tibet is no longer perceived as an antiquated, "oriental despotism," but as a [[Shangri-La]] -- positive, holy, pristine, and pure, which is perceived as incorrupt, since it was never dominated by the West. The Chinese constitute the opposite, as the evil, subhuman force invading the land of peaceful, devoted inhabitants. The old Tibetan culture seems removed from time and history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This allows the West to aggrandize themselves as rescuers of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism (see [[Free Tibet|'Free Tibet']] movement), whereas, [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are depicted as helpless and voiceless. Ultimately, the West again finds itself in a patronizing position, representing another culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== New Age Orientalism in popular culture ===

The romanticized picture of Tibet has, partly, been constructed and reflected by [[popular culture]]. Hollywood movies such as [[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven years in Tibet]], [[Kundun]], and [[Little Buddha]], were found to draw a [[Romanticism|romanticized]] image of Tibet, and hold up the Western rescue paradigm, in line with the play of opposites, between China and Tibet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, publications surrounding the '[[Free Tibet]]' movement have been categorized as New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The constructed fantasies of a Shangri-La Tibet, are found to reflect back on the Western struggles, within their own national identity,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well as, pitfalls of [[Globalization|globalization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
=='''Expansion of New Age Orientialism'''==

In academic literature, the concept of New Age Orientalism, originally relating to Tibet, has been expanded and applied to other cultures and religions, such as [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt; The discourse and perception on [[Ayurveda]], for instance, has been categorized as New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

=='''Criticism of New Age Orientialism'''==

Dr. Donald Lopez's concept of New Age Orientalism, has been criticized for placing too much weight on the impact and power of Orientalism, and viewing Tibet as a closed totality, removed from history. Alternatives to Orientalism are not considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreyfus|first=Georges|date=2005|title=Are We Prisoners of Shangrila?

[[File:Virgin Atlantic Varga Girl.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Virgin Atlantic A340-600 G-VGAS nose art]]

'''Nose art''' is a decorative [[painting]] or design on the [[fuselage]] of an [[aircraft]], usually on the front fuselage.

While begun for practical reasons of identifying friendly units, the practice evolved to express the individuality often constrained by the uniformity of the military, to evoke memories of home and peacetime life, and as a kind of psychological protection against the stresses of war and the probability of death. The appeal, in part, came from nose art not being officially approved, even when the regulations against it were not enforced.&lt;ref name="parentseyes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ethell, Jeffrey L. The History of Aircraft Nose Art: World War I to Today. Osceola, Wisconsin: Motorbooks International, 1991, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its individual and unofficial nature, it is considered [[folk art]], inseparable from work as well as representative of a group.&lt;ref name="parentseyes"/&gt; It can also be compared to sophisticated [[graffiti]]. In both cases, the artist is often [[Anonymity|anonymous]], and the art itself is [[ephemeral]]. In addition, it relies on materials immediately available.&lt;ref name="parentseyes"/&gt;

Nose art is largely a military tradition, but civilian airliners operated by the [[Virgin Group]] feature "Virgin Girls" on the nose as part of their [[Aircraft livery|livery]]. In a broad sense, the tail art of several airlines such as the [[Eskimo]] of [[Alaska Airlines]] can be called "nose art", as are the tail markings of present-day [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] squadrons. There were exceptions, including the [[VIII Bomber Command]], [[301st Air Refueling Wing|301st Bomb Group]] B-17F "Whizzer", which had its girl-riding-a-bomb on the dorsal fin.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Peter M.

==History==
{{repetition|section|date=September 2015}}
[[File:FBaracca 1.jpg|thumb|Count [[Francesco Baracca]] and his [[Société Pour L'Aviation et ses Dérivés|SPAD]] [[SPAD S.VII|S.VII]], with the ''cavallino rampante'' that inspired the [[Ferrari]] emblem]]

[[File:95th Aero Squadron - SPAD XIII.jpg|thumb|right|Spad XIII pursuit aircraft of the 95th Aero Squadron with the "Kicking Mule" insignia, France, 1918]]

Placing personalized decorations on fighting aircraft began with [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Germany|German]] pilots. The first recorded piece of nose art was a sea monster painted on an Italian [[flying boat]] in 1913. This was followed by the popular practice of painting a mouth beneath the [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]'s spinner, begun by German pilots in [[World War I]].  The ''cavallino rampante'' (prancing horse) of the Italian [[Flying ace|ace]] [[Francesco Baracca]] was another well-known image. Nose art of that era was often conceived and produced not by the pilots, but rather by the aircraft ground crews.

Other World War I examples included the "Hat in the Ring" of the American [[1st Operations Group#1st Pursuit Group|94th Aero Squadron]] (attributed to Lt. Johnny Wentworth)&lt;ref name="afhra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/|title=Air Force Historical Research Agency - Home|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Kicking Mule" of the [[1st Operations Group#1st Pursuit Group|95th Aero Squadron]]. This followed the official policy, established by the [[American Expeditionary Forces]]' (AEF) Chief of the Air Service, [[Brigadier General]] [[Benjamin Foulois]], on 6 May 1918, requiring the creation of distinct, readily identifiable squadron insignia.&lt;ref name="afhra"/&gt; What is perhaps the most famous of all nose art, the shark-face insignia made famous by the First [[American Volunteer Group]] (AVG, the [[Flying Tigers]]), first appeared in World War I on a British [[Sopwith Dolphin]] and a German [[Roland C.II]], though often with an effect more comical than menacing.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Richard.

While World War I nose art was usually embellished or extravagant [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] insignia, true nose art appeared during [[World War II]], which is considered by many observers to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of the genre, with both [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] pilots taking part. At the height of the war, nose-artists were in very high demand in the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] and were paid quite well for their services while AAF commanders tolerated nose art in an effort to boost aircrew morale. The U.S. Navy, by contrast, prohibited nose art, the most extravagant being limited to a few simply-lettered names, while nose art was uncommon in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] or [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]].

The work was done by professional civilian artists as well as talented amateur servicemen. In 1941, for instance, the [[39th Pursuit Squadron]] commissioned a [[Bell Aircraft]] artist to design and paint the "[[P-39 Airacobra|Cobra]] in the Clouds" [[logo]] on their aircraft.&lt;ref name="histsum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cobraintheclouds.com/39thorganization/39thhistory.html|title=Military Flying, CHOCKIE 39th History|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most enduring nose art of World War II was the shark-face [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]], which first appeared on the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110s]] of [[Luftwaffe]] [[Zerstörergeschwader 76|76th Destroyer Wing]] over [[Crete]], where the twin-engined Messerschmitts outmatched the [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplanes of [[RAF]] [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|112 Squadron]]. The Commonwealth pilots were withdrawn to Egypt and refitted with [[Curtiss P-40|Curtiss Tomahawks]] off the same assembly line building fighter aircraft for the AVG Flying Tigers being recruited for service in [[China]]. In November 1941, AVG pilots saw a 112 Squadron Tomahawk in an illustrated weekly and immediately adopted the shark-face motif for their own planes. This work was done by the pilots and ground crew in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Daniel. Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941-1942. Washington, DC: Harper Collins-Smithsonian Books, 2007, pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the insignia for the "Flying Tigers" - a winged Bengal Tiger jumping through a stylized V for Victory symbol - was developed by graphic artists from the Walt Disney Company.&lt;ref name="Eisel, Braxton" /&gt;

Similarly, when in 1943 the [[39th Fighter Squadron]] became the first American [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] in their [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] with 100 kills, they adopted the shark-face for their [[P-38 Lightning]]s.&lt;ref name="histsum"/&gt; The shark-face is still used to this day, most commonly seen on the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] (with its gaping maw leading up to the muzzle of the aircraft's GAU-8 Avenger 30mm cannon), especially those of the [[23d Fighter Group]], the AVG's descendent unit, and a testament to its popularity as a form of nose art.

The largest known work of nose art ever depicted on a WWII-era American combat aircraft was on a [[B-24J Liberator]], tail number ''44-40973'', which had been named "The Dragon and his Tail" of the [[USAAF]] [[Fifth Air Force]] [[64th Bombardment Squadron|64th Bomb Squadron]], [[43d Bombardment Group|43d Bomb Group]], in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]], flown by a crew led by Joseph Pagoni, with Staff Sergeant Sarkis Bartigan as the artist.  The dragon artwork ran from the nose just forward of the cockpit, down the entire length of the fuselage's sides, with the dragon's body depicted directly below and just aft of the cockpit, with the dragon holding a nude woman in its forefeet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kensmen.com/64b2.html|title=From the 64th Squadron Briefing Room|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kensmen.com/64b14.html|title=From the 64th Squadron Briefing Room|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Starcer]] was the resident artist for the [[91st Bombardment Group|91st Bomb Group (Heavy)]], one of the initial six groups fielded by the [[Eighth Air Force]]. Starcer painted over a hundred pieces of renowned B-17 nose art, including [[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|"Memphis Belle"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.91stbombgroup.com/nose_artists/starcer.html|title=Tony Starcer - Nose Artist - 91st BG|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaaf-noseart.co.uk/starcer-tony.htm|title=USAAF Nose Art Research Project - Named planes of the USAAF during WWII|author=Mark Bowden|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commercial artist named Brinkman, from [[Chicago]] was responsible for the [[Zodiac#Western zodiac|zodiac]]-themed nose art of the [[B-24 Liberator]]-equipped [[834th Bombardment Squadron|834th Bomb Squadron]], based at [[RAF Sudbury]], England.&lt;ref name="Valant"&gt;Valant, Gary M. Classic Vintage Nose Art. Ann Arbor, Michigan: Lowe and B. Hould, 1997, pp. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary research demonstrates that bomber crews, which suffered high casualty rates during World War II, often developed strong bonds with the planes they were flying, and affectionately decorated them with nose art.&lt;ref&gt;Pfau, Ann Elizabeth. Miss Yourlovin: GIs, Gender and Domesticity During World War II. New York, N.Y.: Columbia University Press, 2008. Available at Gutenberg-e, a program of the American Historical Association and Columbia University Press: [http://www.gutenberg-e.org/pfau/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also believed by the flight crews that the nose art was bringing luck to the planes.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar, Norman, and Thomas B. Allen. World War II: The Encyclopedia of the War Years, 1941-1945. New York: Random House, 1996, p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic work of [[Alberto Vargas]]'s pin-up girls from ''Esquire'' Magazine was often duplicated, or adapted,  by air force crews and painted on the nose of American and allied aircraft during World War II.

[[File:KC-135E Stratotanker with patriotic nose art-1447cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing KC-135E Stratotanker, based with Sioux City Air National Guard, 2007.]]
Some World War II era nose art was commemorative or intended to honor certain people such as the [[B-29 Superfortress]], "The [[Ernie Pyle]]".&lt;ref&gt;Superfort "Ernie Pyle", Gift of Plane Plane Workers, Here En Route to Japan [http://www.chassis-plans.com/Wing-Tips-Article_Ernie_Pyle_B29.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Korean War]], nose art was popular with units operating [[A-26 Invader|A-26]] and [[B-29]] bombers, [[C-119 Flying Boxcar]] transports, as well as USAF [[Ground-attack aircraft|fighter-bombers]].&lt;ref
name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Warren E. Heavy Hauler. ''Wings of Fame, The Journal of Classic Combat Aircraft'',  Volume 20. London, United Kingdom: Aerospace Publishing Ltd., 2000, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changes in military policies and changing attitudes toward the representation of women, the amount of nose art declined after the [[Korean War]].

During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunships]] of the [[List of United States Air Force special operations squadrons|U.S. Air Force Special Operations Squadrons]] were often given names with accompanying nose art - for example, "Thor", "Azrael - Angel of Death", "Ghost Rider", "War Lord" and "The Arbitrator." &lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Olausson|Olausson, Lars]]. Lockheed Hercules Production List - 1954-2011 - 27th ed. Såtenäs, Sweden, April 2009. (Self-published.)&lt;/ref&gt; The unofficial gunship badge of a flying skeleton with a [[Minigun]] was also applied to many aircraft until the end of the war and was later adopted officially.

Nose art underwent a revival during the [[Gulf War]] and has become more common since [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and the [[Iraq War]] began. Many crews are merging artwork as part of camouflage patterns. The United States Air Force had unofficially sanctioned the return of the pin-up (albeit fully clothed) with the [[Strategic Air Command]] permitting nose art on its bomber force in the Command's last years. The continuation of historic names such as "[[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|Memphis Belle]]" was encouraged.

==Regional variation==

Source material for American nose art was varied, ranging from [[Pin-up girl|pinups]] such as [[Rita Hayworth]] and [[Betty Grable]] and [[cartoon]] characters such as [[Donald Duck]], [[Bugs Bunny]], and [[Popeye]] to patriotic characters ([[Yankee Doodle]]) and fictional heroes ([[Sam Spade]]). Lucky symbols such as [[dice]] and [[playing cards]] also inspired nose art, along with references to mortality such as the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]].&lt;ref name="parentseyes"/&gt; Cartoons and pinups were most popular among American artists, but other works included animals, nicknames, hometowns, and popular song and movie titles. Some nose art and slogans imposed contempt to the enemy, especially to enemy leaders.

The farther the planes and crew were from headquarters or from the public eye, the racier the art tended to be.&lt;ref name="parentseyes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/militarynoseart/|title=Military Aircraft Nose Art|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, nudity was more common in nose art on aircraft in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] than on aircraft in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohan, Phil. "Risque Business." Air and Space, 5 (Apr.-May 1990), p.65.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-382-0211-011, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|"Sharkmouth" [[Messerschmitt|Bf 110]]C of [[Zerstörergeschwader 76|ZG 76]], May 1940 ]]
''Luftwaffe'' aircraft did not often display nose art, but there were exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Ketley, Barry. Luftwaffe emblems. Manchester: Flight Recorder Publications, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mickey Mouse]] adorned a [[Condor Legion]] Bf-109 during the Spanish Civil War and one Ju 87A was decorated with a large pig inside a white circle during the same period. [[Adolf Galland]]'s Bf-109E-3 of [[Jagdgeschwader 26|JG 26]] also had a depiction of Mickey Mouse, holding a [[Candlestick telephone|contemporary telephone]] in his hands, in mid-1941. A Ju 87B-1 (''Geschwaderkennung'' of S2+AC) of Stab II/St. G 77, piloted by Major Alfons Orthofer and based in Breslau-Schöngarten (today [[Copernicus Airport Wrocław]]) during the [[invasion of Poland]], was painted with a shark's mouth, and some Bf 110s were decorated with furious wolf's heads, stylistic [[wasp]]s (as with [[SKG 210]] and [[ZG 1]]), or as in the case of [[ZG 76]], the very shark mouths that inspired both the RAF's 112 Squadron and in turn the Flying Tigers in China, on their noses or engine covers. Another example was [[Erich Hartmann]]'s Bf-109G-14, "Lumpi", with an eagle's head. The fighter wing [[Jagdgeschwader 54]] was known as the ''Grünherz'' (Green Hearts) after their fuselage emblem, a large green heart. The Geschwader was originally formed in [[Thuringia|Thüringen]], nicknamed "the green heart of Germany". Perhaps the flashiest Luftwaffe nose art was the red and white [[Viperidae|viper]] snake insignia running through the whole fuselage of certain [[Ju 87]] Stukas that served with the II ''Gruppe'', and especially the 6. ''Staffel'' of [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 2|StG 2]] in North Africa, the only known artwork on an Axis-flown combat aircraft that could have rivaled the length of that on "The Dragon and his Tail" B-24.

The [[Soviet Air Force]] also decorated their planes with historical images, mythical beasts, and patriotic [[slogan]]s.

The attitude of the [[Finnish Air Force]] to the nose art varied by unit. Some units disallowed nose art, while others tolerated it. Generally, the Finnish airforce nose art was humorous or satirical, such as the "horned Stalin" on Maj. Maunula's [[Curtiss P-36]].

The [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] has decorated fighter aircraft with [[Valkyrie]]-themed characters under the names ''Mystic Eagle'' and ''Shooting Eagle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rose-ridge.com/NOSE%20ART%20WORKS.htm|title=NOSEART-WORKS|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2011, the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] has [[AH-1 Cobra|AH-1S Cobra]] anti-tank helicopters and [[Kawasaki OH-1]] observation helicopter named ''Ita-Cobra'' and ''Ita-Omega'' respectively, decorated in the theme of 4 [[Kisarazu]] (木更津) sisters (Akane (木更津茜), Aoi (木更津葵), Wakana (木更津若菜), Yuzu (木更津柚子)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otakumode.com/news/51a149bf8ccdf39e1300d1e4/The-Four-Sisters-of-the-Fourth-Anti-Tank-Helicopter-Squad-are-Celebrated-One-Last-Time!|title=The Four Sisters of the Fourth Anti-Tank Helicopter Squad are Celebrated One Last Time!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aoi-chan first appeared in 2011, followed by the other three sisters in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-japanese-military-is-getting-offensively-cute|title=The Japanese Military Is Getting Offensively Cute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2012/10/19/japans-armed-forces-show-their-playful-side-moe-style-attack-helicopter-wows-crowds/|title=Japan’s Armed Forces Show Their Playful Side: Moé-Style Attack Helicopter Wows Crowds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canadian Forces]] were reported having nose art on [[CH-47 Chinook|CH-47D Chinook]] and [[CH-146 Griffon]] helicopters in [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/04/canadian-chopper-crews-revive-nose-art.html|title=Canadian chopper crews revive nose-art tradition in Afghanistan ~ ASIAN DEFENCE|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous examples==
[[Adolf Galland]] was famous for painting [[Mickey Mouse]] on his aircraft, and the mascot was adopted by his ''Gruppe'' during the early airwar phase of [[World War II]].

[[Werner Mölders]] flew a yellow-nosed [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#F-0, F-1, F-2|Bf 109F-2]] while with [[JG 51]] during June 1941.

Other fighter aces and their nose art have become synonymous.

* [[Don Gentile]]'s [[P-51 Mustang|P-51]]C named "Shangri-La", with an eagle sporting boxing gloves.
* [[John D. Landers]]' P-51D, which sported a distinctive black-and-white checkerboard with red trim.
* [[Chuck Yeager]]'s series of aircraft named "Glamorous Glennis", with bright letter art.
* [[Ian Gleed]]'s [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] featured Figaro the Cat, from the 1940 Disney animated movie ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.
* [[Pierre Clostermann]]'s [[Hawker Tempest]] ''Le Grand Charles'' featured the [[Cross of Lorraine]].
* [[Johnnie Johnson (RAF officer)|Johnny Johnson]]'s [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire IX]] featured the Canadian [[maple leaf]].
* [[Erich Hartmann]]'s [[Bf 109]]s featured a distinctive "black tulip" design on the very front of the [[cowling]], immediately behind the spinner.
* [[James MacLachlan]], who flew with an artificial arm, had his [[Hawker Hurricane]] adorned with a picture of his amputated arm giving a [[V sign]]
* [[Brendan Finucane]]'s Spitfires wore a shamrock with a "B" within it. Ireland's top ace in World War Two who also was the youngest wing commander in Royal Air Force history.

The markings of aces were often adopted by their squadrons, such as Galland's Mickey Mouse and Hartmann's black tulip (still in use until recently on the aircraft of [[Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 71 "Richthofen"|JG 71 "Richthofen"]] - not known to be in use on the unit's  new Eurofighter Typhoons).

[[Ted W. Lawson]], who (along with journalist [[Bob Considine]]) famously wrote about the 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]] in ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', piloted a [[B-25 Mitchell]] bomber nicknamed ''The Ruptured Duck'', after a minor training accident in which the [[Tailstrike|aircraft tail scraped the ground]] during takeoff; this was decorated by a [[caricature]] of an angry Donald Duck figure with crutches and wearing a pilot's headphones.

==Similar art==
Designs similar to aviation nose art could be found during World War II on some British torpedo boats, and German and US submarines.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Bans==
The British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] banned the use of [[pin-up girl|pin-up women]] in nose art on Royal Air Force aircraft in 2007, as commanders decided the images (many containing naked women), were inappropriate and potentially offensive to female personnel, although there were no documented complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-460054/PC-brigade-ban-pin-ups-RAF-jets--case-offend-women-Muslims.html PC brigade ban pin-ups on RAF jets - in case they offend women and Muslims] Mail Online, Jun 26 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command ordered that all nose art should be gender-neutral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/300875/MILITARY-AIRPLANES-GET-NEW-GENDER-NEUTRAL-LOOK.html Military Airplanes Get New Gender-neutral Look], Steve Fide, Dezeret news, July 20, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Orchestre symphonique de Québec''' (OSQ; English, Quebec Symphony Orchestra) is a Canadian symphony [[orchestra]] based in [[Quebec City]].  Founded in 1902 as the Société symphonique de Québec, the OSQ is the oldest active Canadian orchestra.  Joseph Vézina was the OSQ's first music director, from 1902 to 1924. In 1942 the orchestra merged with rival orchestra Cercle philharmonique de Québec (founded 1936), at which time it changed its name to the Orchestre Symphonique de Québec.

The orchestra holds an annual competition for young [[Quebec]] musicians awarding monetary prizes as well as the opportunity to perform as a soloist with the orchestra. The orchestra also performs with the Théâtre lyrique du Québec (Théâtre lyrique de Nouvelle-France), the (defunct) Opéra du Québec, the Opéra de Québec, and the Choeur symphonique de Québec.

The most recent Canadian music director of the OSQ was Françoys Bernier from 1966-1968. The most recent music director was [[Yoav Talmi]], from 1998 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Arthur Kaptainis | title=There's no shortage of Canadian talent to succeed Talmi as musical director of Quebec City orchestra | url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=40a6b362-8608-43d4-a6d4-adeb32b95ce3 | work=Montreal Gazette | date=3 April 2010 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2011, the OSQ announced the appointment of Fabien Gabel as its 11th music director, as of the 2012-2013 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osq.org/media/146994/osq-communiqu__nouveauchef_vfinal.pdf | title=L'Orchestre symphonique de Québec accueille son nouveau directeur musical: Fabien Gabel | publisher=Orchestre Symphonique de Québec | date=1 December 2011 | accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Partially Buried Woodshed''''' is a work of [[land art]] created by American artist [[Robert Smithson]] in January 1970 at [[Kent State University]] in [[Kent, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.robertsmithson.com/earthworks/partially.htm|title=Partially Buried Woodshed |website=RobertSmithson.com |access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work consisted of an existing woodshed and earth added by the artist in order to illustrate the concept of entropy. As of 2018, only a large mound of dirt and the structure's concrete foundation remain. The remaining elements, along with an informational plaque, is located in a small wooded area immediately behind the [[Liquid Crystal Institute]] building on the Kent State University main campus.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert I. Smithson, Partially Buried Woodshed papers |url=http://speccoll.library.kent.edu/other/smithson.html |publisher=Kent State University Special Collections and Archives |accessdate=October 3, 2018 |date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Partially Buried Woodshed Remains.jpg|thumb|Stone remains of the Partially Buried Woodshed]]
[[File:Partially Buried Woodshed Plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque marking the site of the Partially Buried Woodshed]]
In January 1970 [[Robert Smithson]] visited Kent State University as part of the School of Art Creative Arts Festival. Initially, he had planned to do a mudflow sculpture, but cold temperatures prevented him from being able to dig the dirt needed for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mudflow sculptor buries woodshed |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19700123-01.2.2 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |date=January 23, 1970 |page=1 |volume=LV |number=47 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he created ''Partially Buried Woodshed'' using an old woodshed from a former farm on the eastern edge of campus that had recently been acquired by the school. Smithson rented a backhoe and transported 20 truck loads of dirt onto the right side of the woodshed until the center beam cracked, marking the beginning of the structure’s decline. He valued the work at $10,000 and donated it to the university, asking that no changes be made and that the structure be allowed to deteriorate naturally. Shortly after the May 4, 1970, [[Kent State shootings]], an anonymous person added the inscription 'MAY 4 KENT 70' with white paint to one of the structure's horizontal beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsmithson.com/earthworks/partially_det5.htm|title=Partially Buried Woodshed detail |date=1970-1974|website=RobertSmithson.com |access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of the message about May 4, 1970 helped make the ''Partially Buried Woodshed'' one of the many memorial sites on campus.&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt; 

The work was set on fire by an unknown arsonist on March 28th, 1975, burning much of the left side and causing the structure's major collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Smithson's Partially Buried Woodshed|last=Shinn|first=Dorothy|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University Arts Commission recommended in April that the roof and burned portion be removed, mostly citing safety concerns, with the remaining walls, earthen mound, and rafters remaining to continue the natural aging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Natural aging of earth sculpture urged |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19750422-01.2.19 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |author=Halfhill, Tom |date=April 22, 1975 |page=5 |volume=XLVIII |number=89 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late April, the university had much of the damaged section removed and planned to landscape the area around the sculpture as a park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Smithson sculpture removed, memorial plate to be placed |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19750430-01.2.23 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |date=April 30, 1975 |page=6 |volume=XLVIII |number=94 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson's widow, Nancy Holt, visited the work May 3, 1975, and called for its preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Earth artwork ‘questions everything,’ says widow |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19750509-01.2.30 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |author=Halfhill, Tom |date=May 9, 1975 |page=8 |volume=XLVIII |number=100 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee recommended in June 1975 that the entire sculpture be removed, citing liability concerns, though university president Glenn Olds ultimately decided to keep the remains of the sculpture in 1976. Sometime in mid-1981, the center beam fully broke, and in January 1984, the remaining wooden elements of the structure were quietly removed by the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wood shed continues natural return to landscape |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19810925-01.2.32 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |author=Glasko, Robert |date=September 25, 1981 |accessdate=October 5, 2018 |volume=LV |number=17 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the School of Art hosted exhibits in 1990 for the 20th anniversary of the work's creation, and again in 2005 for the 35th anniversary, the location of the artwork was largely ignored until Kent State University added an informational plaque to a sidewalk near the site in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buried Treasure |url=https://www.kent.edu/magazine/shed |work=Kent State Magazine |date=Spring 2016 |accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edwin forrest house01.jpg|thumb|[[Edwin Forrest House]], formerly the home of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women.]]

'''Philadelphia School of Design for Women''' (1848&amp;ndash;1932) was an art school for women in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Under the directorship of [[Emily Sartain]] (1886&amp;ndash;1920), it became the largest art school for women in the United States, and its faculty included [[Robert Henri]], [[Samuel Murray]] and [[Daniel Garber]]. In 1932, it merged into what is now the [[Moore College of Art and Design]]. 

==History==
[[Sarah Peter|Sarah Worthington King Peter]], wife of the British consul in Philadelphia, established an industrial arts school in her home in 1848 to teach women without a means of supporting themselves a trade. The school taught lithography, wood carving, and design, such as for household items like carpets and wallpaper. Peter's husband died soon after she established the school and she returned to her Cincinnati, Ohio home.&lt;ref name=Tinling /&gt; 

In 1850, Peter wrote to the Franklin Institute about her drawing class of some 20 young women becoming a "co-operative, but separate branch" of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Cresson bio"&gt;{{ citation | publisher=The Franklin Institute | title=Donors of the Medals and their histories | work=The Elliott Cresson Medal - Founded in 1848 - Gold Medal | url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/case-files/bell/cresson_bio.pdf | accessdate=July 13, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528060054/http://www.fi.edu/learn/case-files/bell/cresson_bio.pdf | archivedate=May 28, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Franklin Institute established and supervised the Philadelphia School of Design for Women from 1850 to 1853.&lt;ref name="Cresson bio" /&gt; A group of 17 men were designated the incorporators of the school in 1853. [[Elliott Cresson]] was among these 17 directors, and was elected president at the first meeting.&lt;ref name="Cresson bio" /&gt; It was the country's largest art school for women&lt;ref name=Eisenmann /&gt; and its students included [[Emily Sartain]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]], [[Alice Barber Stephens]], [[Elizabeth Shippen Green|Elizabeth Shippen Green,]] [[Annie Traquair Lang]] and [[Alice Neel]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Mott, Sharon, Amanda (2008). Moore College of Art &amp; Design. Arcadia Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7385-5659-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tinling /&gt;

Elizabeth Croasdale was the school's principal before [[Emily Sartain]] took the position in 1886. Sartain was the school's leader until 1920.&lt;ref name=Tinling /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martinez p. 144"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katharine Martinez|author2=Page Talbott|author3=Elizabeth Johns|title=Philadelphia's Cultural Landscape: The Sartain Family Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4phvm-bqDMC&amp;pg=PA144|year=2000|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-791-9|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She implemented life-drawing classes at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alice A.

Sartain created a professional program that was built upon technical and lengthy training and high standards. The women were taught to create works of art based upon three-dimensional and human forms, based upon her training in Paris and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.&lt;ref name="Martinez p. 139"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katharine Martinez|author2=Page Talbott|author3=Elizabeth Johns|title=Philadelphia's Cultural Landscape: The Sartain Family Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4phvm-bqDMC&amp;pg=PA139|year=2000|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-791-9|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was responsible for introducing important faculty members such as [[Robert Henri]], [[Samuel Murray]] and [[Daniel Garber]].&lt;ref name="de Angelia Walls"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nina de Angeli Walls |title=Art, Industry, and Women's Education in Philadelphia |year=2001 |publisher=Bergin &amp; Garvey |isbn=0-89789-745-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1892, Robert Henri began teaching at the school. William Innes Homer said, "A born teacher, Henri enjoyed immediate success at the school."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=William Innes Homer | title=Robert Henri and his Circle | location=Ithaca | publisher=Cornell University Press |  year=1969 | isbn=0-87817-326-9 | page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nina de Angeli Walls wrote,
{{quote|As Sartain's career illustrates, art schools conferred professional status in a cultural field once dominated by men. Women artists used formal schooling to counter the accusation of amateurism frequently leveled at them. Nineteenth century design schools were the first institutions to offer professional certification for women in such careers as art education, fabric design, or magazine illustration; hence, the schools opened unprecedented paths to female economic independence.&lt;ref name="Eisenmann"&gt;{{cite book | editor=Linda Eisenmann |author=Nina de Angeli Walls|chapter=Design school movement|title=Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States |location=Westport, Connecticut | publisher=Greenwood Press | year=1998 | pages=129-130 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/117391948 | accessdate=October 15, 2014|via=Questia | subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Playing the Building''''' was an art installation by [[David Byrne]], ex singer of [[Talking Heads]], and [[Färgfabriken]], an independent art venue in [[Stockholm]]. It originally ran from October 8 to November 13, 2005 at Färgfabriken. The concept would later be realized in [[New York City]] in the [[Battery Maritime Building]] in 2008 (May 31 to August 10), in [[London]] in [[The Roundhouse]] in 2009 (August 8 to 31), and in [[Minneapolis]] at the Aria building in the [[Minneapolis Warehouse Historic District]] in 2012 (November 5 to December 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidbyrne.com/archive/art/art_projects/playing_the_building/ |title=Playing the Building |author=&lt;!--no by-line--&gt; |date=&lt;!--none given--&gt; |website=[http://www.davidbyrne.com DavidByrne.com] |access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept entailed utilizing the infrastructure of these buildings and spaces as resonating bodies to create sounds. Different methods are used to produce the sounds, including hitting columns with metal rods, strapping vibrating motors to girders, and blowing air through pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Randy

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15427">[[Sacred music]] and dance are fundamental to the [[Santo Daime]] religion. The earliest [[hymns]] are those of the founder, [[Mestre Irineu|Raimundo Irineu Serra - 'Mestre Irineu']]. While the rituals and music originated with a very few hymns, sung by a small group in the Brazilian Amazon, the practice of these spiritual works in diverse parts of the world since it began expansion around the beginning of the 1990s has given rise to a significant body of music, in many languages. Daimistas from [[Brazil]] and other countries have contributed to this growing genre, while continuing to sing the principle hinarios in Portuguese. 

Among adherents to the doctrine, songs tend to be referred to as 'received'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santodaime.org/archives/murilo3.htm/ |title=SantoDaime.org archives, José Murilo C. Carvalho Jr. |accessdate=2009-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104204120/http://www.santodaime.org/archives/murilo3.htm |archivedate=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from a spiritual source rather than written from the writers mind alone and confirmed by their use in ritual. Variously these hymns may be viewed as 'calling' energies or divine entities, as transmitting sacred doctrine, as bringing healing through the act of singing what the community is affirming are eternal truths. In the spiritual works and communities of Santo Daime, the hymns are a bond of shared understanding and a daily practice. New hymns are often introduced in ceremony by those who receive them, by the leader's invitation.

A Santo Daime '''hinário''' (Portuguese) or ''hymn-book (hinario)'', can be a life work of its owner, chronicling that person's spiritual journey. During a ritual, one or several hinários or compilations may be sung in their entirety. While they are sung outside of the rituals in ensaio (practice) and listened to in various settings, the real distinction of is genre is that it is intended to be sung in ritual, by a group going into what is understood to be spiritual work of transformation. The hymns can be seen as integral to the ritual, the transformation, and the revealed messages as each person understands them. Hinarios that are central to the doctrine may be sung once or several times per year, and practiced many times more.

== Calendar of official hinarios ==

Mestre Irineu on the Virgin of Conception (Dec. 7), Christmas, Day of Kings (January 6), St. John (June 23). The hinario of Padrinho Sebastiao is sung on Irineu's birthday (Dec. 15), Saint Sebastian (January 19), Madrinha Rita's birthday (June 25), as well as Brazilian Father's Day. Padrinho Alfredo's hinario is sung on Padrinho Alfredo's birthday (January 7), St. Joseph (March 18), and Saint Peter (June 28), as well as New Year's Eve (December 31)

==Historical Hinarios==

===[[Mestre Irineu|Raimundo Irineu Serra - 'Mestre Irineu']]===

'O Cruzeiro' (The Cross), 'Cruzeirinho' (The Little Cross) and 'A Santa Missa' (The Holy Mass)

The first part of Mestre Irineu's hinário, '''''O Cruzeiro''''', contains hymns up to number 116. After an interval of 11 years he received hymns 117 through 128, which are now known as the '''''Cruzeirinho''''' or occasionally as the ''Hinos Novos''. After the time of Mestre Irineu it became a more common practice to finish or close an hinario as a complete work, after which a new hinario might be received.

===Sebastião Mota de Melo - 'Padrinho Sebastião'===

'O Justiceiro' and 'Nova Jerusalem' (The New Jerusalem)

Nova Jerusalem is the second and final hinario of Padrinho Sebastião, consisting of 26 hymns. 

===Rita Gregório de Melo- 'Madrinha Rita'===

'Lua Branca' (White Moon)

Rita Gregório de Melo is the widow of Padrinho Sebastião, matriarch of the CEFLURIS line, mother of 11 children, and lives in Céu do Mapiá. She is thought to have been born 25 June 1925 in Rio Grande do Norte.
 
===Júlia Gregório da Silva - 'Madrinha Júlia'===

'O Convite'  (The Invitation)

Júlia Gregório da Silva was born in Açu, Rio Grande do Norte, in 1933. She was the younger sister of Madrinha Rita, and the mother of six children.

===Cristina Raulino da Silva - 'Madrinha Cristina'===

'A Mensagem' (The Message)

Cristina Raulino da Silva was born in Rio Branco, Acre, in 1938. She married Manuel Gregório (Padrinho Nel), the brother of Madrinha Rita.
 
===Alfredo Gregório de Melo - 'Padrinho Alfredo'===

'O Cruzerinho', 'Nova Era' (The New Age) and 'Nova Dimensão' 

Nova Dimensão is the third (yet to be completed) hinario of Padrinho Alfredo.

Alfredo Gregório de Melo, one of the sons of Padrinho Sebastião and Madrinha Rita, today heads the CEFLURIS line which Padrinho Sebastião founded, based in Céu do Mapiá, Amazonas. He was born 7 January 1950 in the seringal (rubber extraction area) Adélia along the Juruá river in the state of Amazonas.

===João Pedro===

João Pedro was a contemporary of Mestre Irineu. All we know is that his strong, healing hinário only became known to Santo Daime after his death.

===Maria Marques Vieira - 'Maria Damião'===

'O Mensageiro' (The Messenger)

Maria Marques Vieira&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afamiliajuramidam.org/os_companheiros/maria_damiao_familiajuramidam.html|title=Bio of Maria Damiao (in portuguese) by Rodrigo Borges Conti Tavares|accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in Belém do Pará, in 1917. She was very young when she moved with her family to Rio Branco, Acre, where she met Mestre Irineu, in the early 1930s. She was sallow and blond with white skin. Maria Damião, as she was known, married and had seven children (one adopted) but lost her husband early. She worked hard to support her family but had many difficulties in her material life, as in her works with Santo Daime. She died of pneumonia, aged just 32 years, on 2 April 1949.
 
===Antônio Gomes===

'O Amor Divino' (The Divine Love)

Antônio Gomes da Silva was born in Ceará, 30 April 1885. He married Maria de Nazaré in Ceará, and had five children. He lived in Belém do Pará for a while, and then moved to Rio Branco, Acre, in 1921. He worked as a seringueiro, or rubber tapper, and later as a farmer. He lost his first wife, married again, and had another four children. He met Mestre Irineu in 1938, and he received benefits for his unstable health. Antônio Gomes then became a member of the Santo Daime doctrine, as did his whole family. His son Leôncio became the new leader of Alto Santo, after Mestre Irineu's death, in 1971. His granddaughter, Peregrina Gomes, was the third wife of Mestre Irineu. Antônio Gomes da Silva died 14 August 1946.

===Germano Guilherme===

'Vós Sois Baliza' (Thou art a Beacon)

Germano Guilherme dos Santos was born in Piauí at the beginning of the 20th century. He moved with his family to Rio Branco, Acre, where he lived on the outskirts of the city working as a farmer. Germano was one of the first disciples of Mestre Irineu, becoming a member of Santo Daime in the 1930s. He was a black man with notably white teeth. Germano had special feelings for Mestre Irineu, and called him maninho, or 'my little brother'. He suffered a disease on his leg that bothered him a lot. Because of this, he couldn't eat some kinds of food. But when he was at maninho's house, Germano ate everything he wanted and didn't feel anything. He was married to Cecília Gomes, the daughter of Antônio Gomes and Maria de Nazaré, but had no children. His hinário is sung at CICLU - Alto Santo along with the O Cruzeiro hinário of Mestre Irineu. Germano Guilherme dos Santos died in 1964.
 
===João Pereira===

'Seis de Janeiro' (January 6; which is King's day, or [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]])

João Pereira was born in Porongaba, Ceará, in the end of the 19th century. Nobody knows the date he moved to Rio Branco, Acre. In the early 1930s, he joined Mestre Irineu, and became one of his first disciples. João Pereira was almost bald, and his complexion was swarthy or similar to that of caboclos, the mixed blood people of the Amazonian region. He worked as a farmer and wagon driver. He lived near Rio Branco and was married with Maria Franco (Maria Marques Feitosa), the mother of the second wife of Mestre Irineu, Raimunda. João Pereira died in 1954.
 
===Tetéu/Teteo (Francisco Fernandes Filho)===

After Mestre Irineu passed on, his last wife's uncle Leôncio Gomes assumed command of the works, and in turn after Leôncio Gomes' passing, Francisco Fernandes Filho (Tetéu or Teteo) took over; however, he apparently very soon quarreled with Mestre Irineu's widow, Dona Peregrina Gomes Serra, and was chased out of Mestre Irineu's house (Alto Santo), according to Edward MacRae. Tetéu then founded a new center less than a kilometer away, declaring himself to be the real CICLU.  Following Sr. Luis Mendes' presidency, Tetéu's eventual successor, Mr. João Rodrigues Facundes (who was also involved in the initial dispute), returned the legal name and charter of CICLU to Dona Peregrina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afamiliajuramidam.org/english/the_children_of_juramidam/genealogy.htm|title=Genealogy of the Santo Daime Doctrine|website=www.afamiliajuramidam.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Known for sleeping light and little, Tetéu received his nickname after a bird (''[[Southern lapwing|Vanellus chilensis]]'') commonly called "Tetéu" who was also believed to not sleep much.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afamiliajuramidam.org/os_companheiros/teteo.htm|title=Os Companheiros - Tetéo|website=afamiliajuramidam.org|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hinario ''[http://nossairmandade.com/hinario.php?hid=32 O Assesor]'' has 132 hymns, including a number of Daime serving hymns (Eu Tomo Daime, O Daime Me Balançou, Mesa De Centro, Daime é O Nosso Pai, Um, Dois E Três) and is sung in some churches, where it is known, to honor the passing of Mestre Irineu on July 6. Where it is not known well, Mestre Irineu's hinario ''O Cruzeiro,'' is sung (a Capella in the churches of Sr. Luis Mendes). 
 
===Maria Brilhante===

Maria Brilhante was married with Padrinho Eduardo Salles Freitas, and they had four children, three of whom survive. Madrinha Maria Brilhante received a hinário which is officially sung on the festival of St. Anthony every 12-13 June.

==Some Contemporary Hinários==

===Baixinha===

'Guia Mestre' (Master Guide), 'Mensageiros da Cura' (Messengers of Healing),
'Hinário da Fé' (Hinario of the Faith), 'Estrela D'Água' (Star of the Water. Baixinha's new hinario)

Baixinha, ''tiny'' in Portuguese, is perhaps the best known practitioner of UmbanDaime. She is a small woman of scarcely one and a half meters, who has spent more than forty years in [[Umbanda]], twenty-one in [[Candomblé]], and eighteen years in Santo Daime. Despite her small stature, she was known by many as a true spiritual beacon and traveled extensively, even after she'd become very old. She led a spiritual community in Lumiar, a mountain village two hours from Rio de Janeiro until her passage in 2015 working in two worlds (spiritual and physical) and two doctrines (Daimista and Umbandista).

===Glauco Villas Boas===

'O Chaveirinho' &amp; 'O Chaveirão'

Hinário received by prominent cartoonist [[Glauco Villas Boas]] (March 10, 1957 - March 12, 2010), commander of the Céu de Maria church in São Paulo, and consisting of 41 hymns in O Chaveirinho and 11 in O Chaveirão. 

Glauco came from a [[Villas-B%C3%B4as brothers|family of legends]], and became a legend in his own right. As one of the most recognizable and timely artists of Brazil in the late 20th century, he formed a bond with fellow cartoonists [[Laerte]] and [[Angeli (cartoonist)|Angeli]] that produced a significant, massive body of work over decades.  As daily political cartoonist for [[Folha de S.Paulo|Folha de São Paulo]] (Sao Paulo's principal daily newspaper), he was looked to by Paulistas to interpret and shed light on the news of the day in his own courageous, take-no-prisoners style. 

While participating in early works at Flor das Aguas in Itapecerica da Serra (SP), Glauco inaugurated Ceu de Maria in his own home, then built a church on a peak high above Sao Paulo called [[Pico do Jaragu%C3%A1|Pico do Jaraguá]]. An accomplished musician, he was well known for his fiery accordion playing and said that he had never once practiced outside of ceremony, relying instead on the force of the Daime to pull the music.

===Alex Polari===

'Nova Anunciação'

Alex Polari spent years as a political prisoner during the rule of the military junta in Brazil, enduring torture, brutality, and deprivation. His quest for spiritual initiation eventually led him deep into the heart of the rainforest, to Mapiá, where he became a teacher and leader of the Santo Daime community. He is the author of 'Forest of Visions: Ayahuasca, Amazonian Spirituality, and the Santo Daime Tradition' which has been translated into English.
 
===Paulo Roberto===

Luz na Escuridão (A Light In The Darkness) is the hinário received by Paulo Roberto (Paulo Roberto Silva e Souza), padrinho of the Céu do Mar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceudomarteste.magaweb.com.br/|title=Website of Ceu do Mar (portuguese)|accessdate=2009-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215005628/http://ceudomarteste.magaweb.com.br/|archivedate=2009-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; church in Rio de Janeiro, and who is a psychologist by training.

==Selections from Hinarios==

(often sung as part of rituals)

===Oração===

Oração simply means prayer. In Daimista communities and households, it is normally sung around 6:30pm, in church or at home, with or without instruments. The oração of CEFLURIS consists of a selection of 12 hymns from Padrinho Sebastião's O Justiceiro hinário (or hymnbook), plus one from his son Padrinho Alfredo's O Cruzeirinho hinário, and a new one from Sebastião's daughter Madrinha Nonata.

===Cura===
(Divided into parts I and II)

The Cura is a selection of 32 healing hymns in two parts, taken mainly from the hinários of Padrinho Sebastião, Madrinha Rita, and Padrinho Alfredo, but also including a few from Mestre Irineu, Alex Polari, Vera Froes and Madrinha Tetê (Teresa Gregório), often used on occasions when healing is required, in particular physical healing.
 
===Finados===

Finados is a compendium of the hinarios of Antonio Gomes, Maria Damião, Germano Guilherme and João Pereira, among the earliest followers of Mestre Irineu.

'''Sins Invalid''' is a performance project that focuses on inclusion of people with disabilities while also celebrating intersecting identities. The project was conceived and is led by disabled people of color, and its mission is to provide a space in which those with physical impairments, people who belong to a sensory minority, people with emotional disabilities, people with cognitive challenges, and those with chronic/severe illness can engage in development of artistic performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Mission  {{!}}  About Us  {{!}}  Sins Invalid|url = http://www.sinsinvalid.org/mission.html|website = www.sinsinvalid.org|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to multidisciplinary performances by people with disabilities, Sins Invalid also provides political education workshops for social justice-oriented community organizations that coalesce around similar themes of disability, race, gender, and sexuality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Founding and Documentary ==
Sins Invalid was founded in 2005 by Patricia Berne and [[Leroy F. Moore Jr.|Leroy F. Moore Jr]]. The organization, which Berne has described as "a hybrid between a community-based organization and a performance," originated in the San Francisco Bay Area and tours nationally.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Sins Invalid: An Unshamed Claim to Beauty in the Face of Invisibility''. Dir. Patricia Berne. New Day Films, 2013. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; Berne and Moore, who are old friends, have both had disabilities since birth, and they started the project upon realizing the paucity of venues dedicated to celebration of their work and their bodies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both co-Founders have a long history of advocacy and activism in various fields. Berne serves as Director of the organization, and she has been involved in work surrounding asylum claims, youth incarceration alternatives, the LGBTQIA community, and mental health support for survivors of violence, among other fields.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who We Are  {{!}}  About Us  {{!}}  Sins Invalid|url = http://sinsinvalid.org/artistic_core.html|website = sinsinvalid.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore is Sins Invalid's Community Relations Director. His work extends to writing, poetry, lecture series, and hip-hop/music. He has worked, studied, and lectured internationally and is considered a "leading voice" regarding police brutality toward and wrongful incarceration of people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to a ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' interview conducted by Cory Silverburg with Berne and Moore, Sins Invalid's (pronounced as in "not valid") name came from the idea that a disabled child is a manifestation of "the sins of the father being cast upon the son".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = When it Comes to Sex, Are Your Sins Invalid?|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cory-silverberg/when-it-comes-to-sex-are-_b_838404.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Berne articulates, there is a pervasive societal norm that validates bodies according to beauty, hygienic, health, and other sets of standards. The Sins Invalid framework asserts that humans have a wide variety of embodiments, and all bodies are valid and worthy of celebration.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is also a play on words, since people with disabilities have historically been referred to as "invalids".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since its creation, Sins Invalid has held annual major theater performances and an artist-in-residence performance, which have all received critical acclaim.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2012, the project launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign, culminating in the 2013 release of a 32-minute documentary titled ''[http://www.sinsinvalid.org/film.html Sins Invalid: An Unshamed Claim to Beauty in the Face of Invisibility]'', directed by Berne, which details its disability justice efforts and the value of artistic expression. The documentary also elucidates the need for inclusion of sex and sexuality in disability rights discourse.

== Disability and Sexuality ==
Sins Invalid makes the conscious choice to engage in the topic of sexuality precisely because it has historically been so taboo, especially when it intersects with disability and other social markers. The discussion of identity is also vital here, especially in terms of creating a space for identities that have become politicized as a result of socialization. In an interview with [[Icarus Project|The Icarus Project]], Berne cites the high rates of sexual violence against people with disabilities, tying the trend to an issue of dehumanization, not sexualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview w/Sins Invalid on Disability Justice Theory &amp; Praxis {{!}} The Icarus Project|url = http://www.theicarusproject.net/article/interview-wsins-invalid-on-disability-justice-theory-praxis|website = www.theicarusproject.net|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Health Organization, adults with disabilities are 1.5 times as likely to experience any type of violence—physical, emotional, sexual—than adults without disabilities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} Violence against adults and children with disabilities|url = http://www.who.int/disabilities/violence/en/|website = www.who.int|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults with mental or intellectual impairments are almost four times as likely to experience violence than those without. Children with disabilities are 3.7 times as likely to experience any type of violence than children without disabilities. Children with disabilities are 3.6 times as likely to experience physical violence and 2.9 times as likely to experience sexual violence. Children with mental or intellectual impairments are 4.6 times as likely to experience sexual violence than their counterparts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The WHO attributes these alarming statistics to stigma, discrimination, ignorance, and lack of social support, but Berne echoes scholars in the disability studies field, who argue that the issue runs deeper.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The discussion of disability and sexuality, based on cultural assumptions, categorizes the combination under [[sexual deviance]]. Public perception of those who are differently abled has come to form the disabled body as one incapable of attaining sexual [[Agency (sociology)|agency]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Disability, Sex Radicalism, and Political Agency|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nwsa_journal/v014/14.3wilkerson.html|journal = NWSA Journal|date = 2002-01-01|issn = 2151-7371|pages = 33–57|volume = 14|issue = 3|first = Abby L.|last = Wilkerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and disability studies scholar Abby Wilkerson has written that, in order to respect the sexual agency of all individuals, this agency must be reimagined as political.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Her argument hinges on the assumption of the disabled body as incapable of becoming a full citizen. Reimagining sexual and political agency is an aspect of the overall effort to change views and frames regarding disability and the perception of disabled bodies.

In the Cory Silverberg interview, Berne said, "I can experience my sexuality as a crip, as someone who fully occupies a non-normative physical space. And part of that movement to fully living in one's own experience is naming and resisting dehumanization."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Acknowledging the full history of disability in the United States requires a deconstruction of the dehumanizing practices that have plagued the community. All types of experiences are included in the show, and the denial of sexuality is part of that dehumanization. In the same interview, Moore said, "…we’re sharing these stories in a way that hopefully connects us to our past and also allows us to change our future."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The medicalized framing of disability has framed it as a problem to be cured, a pathology that decides, alongside doctors, the future of its host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stolen Bodies, Reclaimed Bodies: Disability and Queerness|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/public_culture/v013/13.3clare.html|journal = Public Culture|date = 2001-01-01|issn = 1527-8018|pages = 359–365|volume = 13|issue = 3|first = Eli|last = Clare}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with disabilities are often told what their futures will look or feel like, and part of gaining agency involves the decision one makes when deciding one's future for oneself. Sins Invalid aims to reinforce this agency and choice in the futures of people with disabilities, including an audience in order to expand the message and so that people with and without disabilities might internalize it.

=== Eugenics ===
The documentary alludes to [[Harry H. Laughlin|Harry Laughlin]]'s 1914 coining of the "Five Ds," or people who should not, according to the tenets of eugenics, reproduce. These are degenerate, dependent, deficient, delinquent, and defective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sins Invalid's work is not solely a matter of performance; rather, it is an active fight against the idea that people with disabilities should not exist.

The history of [[eugenics]] in the United States dates back to before World War II, in which the eugenics programs provided inspiration for practices in Nazi Germany. During the late 19th and early 20th century, it came to be seen as "a method of preserving and improving the dominant groups in the population," and it was not until later that its racist, nativist, and ableist elements were unearthed and included in public discourse. There were various pieces of legislation mirroring eugenics practice in the US. In the documentary, performers reference being referred to as "an excuse for abortion".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Increasing access to sex, sexuality, and reproduction for people with disabilities is a cornerstone of disability justice and the ability to be viewed as a full citizen with the same privileges afforded to those without disabilities. Sins Invalid's performances and community engagement fosters these efforts and includes them in its framework.

==== Forced sterilization ====
Sterilization is part of eugenics, and the US had legislation making it compulsory for "imbeciles" for a large part of the early 20th century. The documentary touches on the fact that, between 1910 and 1970, over 60,000 individuals were [[Compulsory sterilization|forcibly sterilized]] in the US, with many more undocumented cases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sins Invalid works against the frame that the world would be better off without people with disabilities and that others should decide their reproductive futures.

Though the issue of forced sterilization still exists in this country, it has been occurring more commonly in women's prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Female inmates sterilized in California prisons without approval {{!}} The Center for Investigative Reporting|url = http://cironline.org/reports/female-inmates-sterilized-california-prisons-without-approval-4917|website = cironline.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intersectionality ==
Sins Invalid's acceptance and celebration of the multiplicity and diversity of identities is an iteration of [[intersectionality]] in practice. The human body is not permanent and unchanging; rather, it is a non-static being that can change based on nature, the environment, or perception. Since disability does not discriminate, it is useful as a category of analysis in terms of its potential to create, as disability studies scholar Simi Linton puts it, "a prism through which one can gain a broader understanding of society and human experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminist Disability Studies|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=llOJkIHd3lsC|publisher = Indiana University Press|date = 2011-01-01|isbn = 0253223407|first = Kim Q.|last = Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Sins Invalid includes performers with disabilities who are also people of color, queer, etc., intersectionality is woven into its performances and guiding ideology. In the documentary, Sins Invalid member Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha comments on the freedom that the space provides for various manifestations of difference, such as queerness. She says, "No one has to closet themselves," and this applies to any identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This ties into Berne's idea of being able to "orient the gaze," or the position the audience occupies as consumers of the performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the project is conscious of so many diverse lenses and does not limit the frame to disability, performers and audience members alike have the opportunity to feel empowered by the acknowledgement of identities.

In order to understand the idea of embodiment, of occupying the body, as Berne states, one must have an understanding of the body as situated within a historical, political, cultural, and social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Embodying Our Humanity: Sins Invalid Promotes Disability Justice through Live Performance Arts|url = http://www.tikkun.org/tikkundaily/2014/10/03/embodying-our-humanity-sins-invalid-promotes-disability-justice-through-live-performance-arts/|website = Tikkun Daily Blog|accessdate = 2015-11-25|language = en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist disability studies scholar Rosemarie Garland-Thomson argues that, "integrating disability as a category of analysis and a system of representation deepens, expands, and challenges feminist theory".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Feminist Disability Studies|jstor = 10.1086/423352|journal = Signs|date = 2005-01-01|pages = 1557–1587|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1086/423352|first = Rosemarie|last = Garland‐Thomson}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is, essentially, arguing for a more intersectional approach to both fields, allowing conversation across coalitions and co-opting of messages and theories. For Garland-Thomson, the "shared human experience of embodiment" provides a framework in which all individuals should be able to understand the way systems affect or do not affect them based on their bodies.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The sharing of experience should, theoretically, make difference more palatable in interpersonal relationships. In the documentary, however, one of the performances includes narration that says, "We labor to shield you from our differences…We live in continual risk."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People with disabilities, both visible and invisible, live with a higher risk of experiencing violence and an extreme amount of pressure to conform. The more identities intersect with one another, the more complicated it becomes to navigate spaces that are unwelcoming or biased. Sins Invalid aims to address this difficulty through creating a performance space that is inviting to all identities.

== Objectives ==
A review by Terry Rowden states, "Moving decisively beyond any simple ‘shock’ or ‘transgressive’ aesthetic…challenges the politics that systematically disables our ability to recognize beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NOW AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE – THE SINS INVALID FILM {{!}} Sins Invalid|url = http://sinsinvalid.org/blog/now-available-for-purchase-the-sins-invalid-film|website = sinsinvalid.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sins Invalid has, for certain audience members, achieved its goal of redefining ideas like beauty, sex, and sexuality. Further, Berne has described the project as, "an erotic event featuring people with disabilities". Sins Invalid harnesses the power of the erotic, using it as a force in politicizing the disabled body. According to Audre Lorde, the erotic is a means to assert power for people who have historically been denied agency. She writes, "The erotic is a measure between our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Audre Lorde on the Erotic|url = http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/erotic.htm|website = www.english.illinois.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her argument is based on those in power suppressing or repressing eroticism, feeling, and emotion, dismissing each as weak and without value. Sins Invalid's invocation of the erotic is a means to empower those who have been denied a space for expression in the public sphere.

Another concept that Sins Invalid confronts is [[shame]]. In his book ''The Trouble with Normal'', Michael Warner writes about shame as a "political resource that some people use to silence or isolate others."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Trouble with Normal — Michael Warner {{!}} Harvard University Press|url = http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674004412|website = www.hup.harvard.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, sexual deviants are considered a "danger to the body politic."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Analyzing the politics of shame in a disability rights discourse requires the acknowledgement that people with disabilities are framed as objects of shame. Sins Invalid seeks to address this issue through the assertion that their claim is "unshamed" from the get-go. Furthermore, unabashedly claiming sex and sexuality in an empowering way serves to eliminate the shame that people with disabilities may become subject to.

Berne and Moore have both expressed a commitment to concrete change. For Moore, this manifests in changing laws, but going further and beginning to change our physical environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Berne writes on the move from individual legal rights toward a collective human rights framework. Berne's writing speaks to both types of change. She uses herself as an example, discussing the fact that her wheelchair does not climb stairs and asking the reader if this is a problem with the wheelchair or a problem with the stairs.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sins Invalid: An Unshamed Claim to Beauty in the Face of Invisibility|last = Berne|first = Patricia|date = |journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She encourages her audience to think critically about our surroundings and the barriers that exist for various members of society due to identity. Berne and Moore both view the oppression of the non-normative body as something to move beyond, toward opportunities for liberation and beauty and a new vision of embodiment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[File:Snuff bottles - AMNH collection.jpg|thumb|Snuff bottles in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] collection]]

'''Snuff bottles''' were used by the [[China|Chinese]], [[Mongolia|Mongolians]] during the [[Qing Dynasty]] to contain [[Snuff (tobacco)|powdered tobacco]]. Smoking tobacco was illegal during the Qing Dynasty, but the use of snuff was allowed because the Chinese considered snuff to be a remedy for common illnesses such as [[Common cold|colds]], [[headache]]s and stomach disorders. Therefore, snuff was carried in a small bottle like other medicines. The snuff bottle replaced the [[Decorative box#Snuff box|snuff box]] used by Europeans.

==History==
Tobacco was introduced by the Portuguese to the court at [[Beijing]] some time during the mid- to late-16th century. It was originally smoked in pipes before the establishment of the Qing Dynasty. The use of snuff and snuff bottles spread through the upper class, and by the end of the 17th century it had become a part of social ritual to use snuff. This lasted through most of the 18th century. Eventually, the trend spread into the rest of the country and into every social class. It was common to offer a pinch of snuff as a way to greet friends and relatives. Snuff bottles soon became an object of beauty and a way to represent status and wealth.

The use of snuff increased and decreased with the rise and fall of the Qing Dynasty and died away soon after the establishment of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]. However, contemporary snuff bottles are still being made, and can be purchased in souvenir shops, flea markets and museum gift shops. Original snuff bottles from the Qing period are a desirable target for serious collectors and museums. A good bottle has an extra quality over and above its exquisite beauty and value: that is touch. Snuff bottles were made to be held and so, as a rule, they have a pleasant tactile quality.

==Materials and size==
[[File:Chinese snuff bottles.jpg|thumb|Chinese snuff bottles in the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].]]
The size of a snuff bottle is small enough to fit inside the palm. Snuff bottles were made out of many different materials including [[porcelain]], [[jade]], [[rhinoceros horn]], [[ivory]], [[wood]], [[tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]], [[metal]] and  [[ceramic]], though probably the most commonly used material was glass. The stopper usually had a very small spoon attached for extracting the snuff. Though rare, such bottles were also used by women in Europe in Victorian times, with the bottles typically made of cut glass.&lt;ref name="BourneShire"&gt;Ursula Bourne, ''Snuff'', Shire Publications, 1990, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese snuff bottles were typically decorated with paintings or carvings, which distinguished bottles of different quality and value. Decorative bottles were, and remain, time-consuming in their production and are thus desirable for today's collectors.

==Symbolism in snuff bottle decoration==
[[File:Shou character 1.jpg|thumb|120px|The Shou character is commonly found on snuff bottles.]] Many bottles are completely devoid of decoration, others are incredibly ornate. As in all Chinese arts and crafts, motifs and symbols play an important part in decorative detail. Symbols are derived from a multitude of sources such as legends, history, religion, philosophy and superstition. The ideas used are almost always directed toward bringing wealth, health, good luck, longevity, even immortality to the owner of an artifact, frequently as a wish expressed in a kind of coded form by the giver of a gift. Probably the most popular decoration is the Shou character, a symbol of happiness and [[longevity]], illustrated at right. Shou or Sau was one of [[Three Star Gods]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:18 Lohan.jpg|thumb|left|120px|18 Lohan as seen on a modern resin bottle.]]  --&gt;Another popular device is a representation of the 18 Lohan, who were the personal disciples of Buddha, just one group of the many revered immortals in China. Apart from the 18 Lohan there is a constellation of other divines who are portrayed, even their innards. The eight precious organs of the Buddha are venerated – his heart, gall bladder, spleen, lungs, liver, stomach, kidneys and intestines. These are rarely depicted on snuff bottles. Animals, on the other hand appear with regularity, the most common being the dragon.

[[File:Dragon on bottle.jpg|thumb|120px|Dragon clutching a fiery pearl]] A dragon is shown in the example at right on a porcelain bottle in splendid red and blue and clutching the inevitable fiery pearl. One of the traditions of Chinese art is that only the Emperor, his sons and princes of the first and second ranks were permitted to own an artefact illustrated with a dragon having five claws. Four-clawed dragons were restricted to princes of the third and fourth ranks, while the common folk had to be content with a dragon having three claws. However, it is common to find that many older bottles have dragons with five claws.

[[File:Horse on bottle.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Naive horse]] The horse is another animal frequently used in the decorative work. The horse is one of the [[Seven Treasures of Buddhism]]. Its symbolism points to speed, perseverance, rank, power and wealth. The symbolism of wealth and power came about because the horse carried those of importance. In the example at left, the horse seems to be carved in a very amateurish way, but in this school of bottle production, naïveté was the style.

[[File:Hare on bottle.jpg|thumb|120px|Hare on a wooden bottle]] The hare is also often found on snuff bottles. The example at right shows a hare on a bottle made of wood. The hare represents a wish for long life and even immortality. In Chinese tradition it is believed that if one attains a sufficiently high standard of morality and enlightenment, one will become one of the immortals.

===Other commonly used symbols===
The three legged toad is a mythical creature. It was thought to be an animated purse containing an inexhaustible supply of coins, hence it represents wealth and has become a symbol of the unattainable.

The fish is both an emblem of wealth and abundance and of harmony and connubial bliss. The fish emblem is used in a variety of decorative ways. Bamboo is a frequent motif. Because of its durability and its being evergreen it has come, along with many other symbols, to signify longevity.

=="Inside painted" bottles==
[[File:FileSnuff bottle 1.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Modern Inside Painted Bottle]] ''[[Inner painting|Inside painted]]'' are glass bottles which have pictures and often [[calligraphy]] painted on the inside surface of the glass.

Their scenes are an inch or two high and are painted while manipulating the brush through the neck of the bottle at times only a quarter inch across, in reverse. Ursula Bourne, in her treatise on snuff, suggested that artisans painted on their backs to make it easier to work through the narrow opening.&lt;ref name="BourneShire"/&gt; 
A skilled artist may complete a simple bottle in a week while something special may take a month or more and the best craftsmen will produce only a few bottles in a year.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image and related text removed: [[File:IP Bottle 2.jpg|thumb|120px|A bottle by Kuie Hsiang-Ku (detail)]] The bottle at the left is signed by a well-respected artist called Kuie Hsiang-Ku and is dated 1896. --&gt;

The earliest inside painted bottles were made in the period between 1820 and 1830 because by then the beauty of a snuff bottle was probably more important than utilitarian considerations and few would have been used for holding snuff.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Inside painted bottles are still made expensively for collectors and inexpensively as souvenirs.

Like other types of snuff bottle, the range of subject matter treated by inside painted bottles includes among others fish, birds, poems, scenes, and portraits. They are intended to be viewed as miniature paintings within the bottle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Snuff bullet==
[[File:Nasal snuff accessories-bullets grinder spoon tin-1.JPG|thumb|120px|left|Snuff bullets and other accessories.]]
In recent years a popular method of snuff insufflation has been the snuff bullet. A simple snuff bullet consists of a small bottle with a plug in the base, a rotatable "dosing chamber" and a hole on the top. More advanced snuff bullets have variable dosing settings. They can be made of plastic, glass or metal.

'''''Stone City, Iowa''''' is a 1930 painting by the American artist [[Grant Wood]]. It depicts the former [[boomtown]] of [[Stone City, Iowa]]. It was Wood's first major landscape painting. It is a study of a real place with which Wood was thoroughly familiar, but the landscape has been given fantastical curvy shapes, the trees are ornamental, and the bright surfaces are artificially patterned.&lt;ref name="dennis"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dennis|first=James M.|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTvd44RgloMC&amp;pg=PA46|chapter=Grant Wood's Native-Born Modernism|title=Grant Wood: An American Master Revealed|location=|publisher=|p=46|isbn=0-87654-485-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town had been built for its [[limestone]] quarries. When the painting was made, the town was in rapid decline due to the development of [[Portland cement]]. The painting thus depicts the transition from [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and back to rural community. During the summers of 1932 and 1933, the town became the host of the [[Stone City Art Colony]], which Wood was part of.&lt;ref name="joslyn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.joslyn.org/collections-and-exhibitions/permanent-collections/american/grant-wood-stone-city-iowa/|title=''Stone City, Iowa'' , 1930|publisher=[[Joslyn Art Museum]]|accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stone City, Iowa'' was made the same year as Wood's ''[[American Gothic]]'' and both paintings were successes for the artist. Wood promoted his new style under the label of the "new movement".&lt;ref name="dennis" /&gt;

The painting is located at the [[Joslyn Art Museum]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name="joslyn" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5848">'''TV Lab''' (short for Television Laboratory) was a program founded at [[WNET|Thirteen/WNET]] public television station in 1972 by [[David Loxton]] with support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[New York State Council on the Arts]]. The program provided artists with advanced video making equipment through an artist-in-residence program. Between 1975 and 1977, the Video Tape Review series was established and broadcast through TV Lab. David Loxton created TV Lab's Independent Documentary Fund in 1977, aiming to provide funding for the creation of independent documentaries. Unable to match funds from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the IDF and TV Lab lost support, eventually ending in 1984.&lt;ref name="vanishingvision"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=James|title=The Vanishing Vision: The Inside Story of Public Television|year=1995|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=9780520086593|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1971, the Rockefeller Foundation donated $150,000 for the establishment of TV Lab. At the time, [[Howard Klein (music critic)|Howard Klein]] was Assistant Director at the Rockefeller Foundation and played an instrumental role in the Rockefeller Foundation's decision to donate to TV Lab at Thirteen/WNET, working with [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]'s Fred Barzyk and artist Nam June Paik, among others. Initially, [[John Jay Iselin]], WNET's President at the time, suggested Robert Kotlowitz for the role of TV Lab director, but artists involved in the project expressed discontent with the proposal. Barzyk then suggested David Loxton for the position of Director, and in 1972 TV Lab began under Loxton's direction with additional grants from the New York State Council on the Arts.&lt;ref name="SturkenKlein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sturken|first=Marita|title=Howard Klein and the Rockefeller Foundation's funding of the media arts|journal=Afterimage|date=January 1987|volume=14|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1972 and 1974, TV Lab primarily operated through an artist-in-residence program, supporting artists in the creation of [[video art]]. [[Nam June Paik]], [[Dimitri Devyatkin]], [[Ed Emshwiller]], [[Shirley Clarke]], and [[Douglas Davis (artist)|Douglas Davis]] were among artists who participated in the artist-in-residence program during this initial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=London|first=Barbara|title=Video: A Selected Chronology, 1963-1983|journal=Art Journal|date=Autumn 1985|volume=45|issue=3|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[TVTV (video collective)|TVTV video collective]] came to Loxton seeking support for a guerrilla video project about guru Maharaj-Ji and his followers at the Houston Astrodome.&lt;ref name="vanishingvision" /&gt; This became TV Lab's first video documentary, ''Lord of the Universe'', marking the beginning of TV Lab's venture into non-fiction video.

In 1975, the Video Tape Review (VTR) series hosted by Russell Connor was established as part of TV Lab, airing until 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gever|first=Martha|title=Pressure Points: Video in the Public Sphere|journal=Art Journal|date=Autumn 1985|volume=45|issue=3|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; VTR was used to introduce viewers to artists at TV Lab and provide some exposure to their work, and in its two years, featured the work of artists and video collectives including Jon Alpert and Keiko Tsuno, TVTV, Broadside TV, and Video Freex.  In 1977, David Loxton created the Independent Documentary Fund (IDF) at TV Lab, founded by the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. The IDF provided funds for independent documentaries such as [[Jack Willis|Jack Willis']] ''[[Paul Jacobs and the Nuclear Gang]]'' and [[Rob Epstein|Robert Epstein's]] ''[[The Times of Harvey Milk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Howard|title=Nam June Paik and TV Lab: License to Create|url=http://media.gfem.org/node/9494|publisher=Grantmakers in Film and Electronic Media|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006045021/http://media.gfem.org/node/9494|archivedate=2013-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, TV Lab lost funding from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] when Program Fund Director Lewis Freedman did not renew CPB funds, and TV Lab was unable to match required funds from the National Endowment for the Arts.&lt;ref name="vanishingvision" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SturkenKlein" /&gt;

Klein]] as a classic in the field of the [[supernatural]].&lt;ref name="American Supernatural Tales 1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Chambers, Robert W(illiam) |first=T. E.

"The Yellow Sign" inspired a [[The Yellow Sign#Film|film of the same name]] released in 2001.

The British first edition was published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in 1895 (316 pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?25609 |title= The King in Yellow |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stories==
The first four stories are loosely connected by three main devices:

* A play in book form entitled ''The King in Yellow''
* A mysterious and malevolent supernatural entity known as the King in Yellow
* An eerie symbol called the [[Yellow Sign]]

These stories are macabre in tone, centering, in keeping with the other tales, on characters that are often artists or [[decadence|decadents]], inhabitants of the ''demi-monde''.

The first and fourth stories, "The Repairer of Reputations" and "The Yellow Sign", are set in an imagined future 1920s America, whereas the second and third stories, "The Mask" and "In the Court of the Dragon", are set in Paris. These stories are haunted by the theme: "Have you found the Yellow Sign?"

The weird and macabre character gradually fades away during the remaining stories, and the last three are written in the romantic fiction style common to Chambers' later work. They are all linked to the preceding stories by their Parisian setting and their artistic protagonists.

===List of stories===
The stories in the book are:
[[File:Repairer of Reputations Chapter 1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hildred Castaigne in "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]", illustration by Tucker Sherry.]]
* "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]" – A weird story of egotism and paranoia which carries the imagery of the book's title.
* "The Mask" – A dream story of art, love, and uncanny science.
* "[[In the Court of the Dragon]]" – A man is pursued by a sinister church organist who is after his soul.
* "[[Yellow Sign|The Yellow Sign]]" – An artist is troubled by a sinister churchyard watchman who resembles a coffin worm.
* "[[The Demoiselle d'Ys]]" – A ghost story, the theme of which anticipates [[H. G. Wells]]' "[[H. G. Wells bibliography#Stories|The Door in the Wall]]" (1906).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129798.The_King_in_Yellow_and_Other_Horror_Stories | title=The King in Yellow and Other Horror Stories by Robert W. Chambers - Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists | publisher=[[Goodreads]] | accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[The Prophets' Paradise]]" – A sequence of eerie prose poems that develop the style and theme of a quote from the fictional play ''The King in Yellow'' which introduces "The Mask".
* "The Street of the Four Winds" – An atmospheric tale of an artist in Paris who is drawn to a neighbor's room by a cat; the story ends with a macabre touch.
* "The Street of the First Shell" – A war story set in the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|Paris Siege]] of 1870.
* "The Street of Our Lady of the Fields" – Romantic American bohemians in Paris.
* "Rue Barrée" – Romantic American bohemians in Paris, with a discordant ending that playfully reflects some of the tone of the first story.

==The play called ''The King in Yellow''==
The fictional play ''The King in Yellow,'' has at least two acts and at least three characters: Cassilda, Camilla and "The Stranger", who may or may not be the title character.

Chambers' story collection excerpts some sections from the play to introduce the book as a whole, or individual stories. For example, "Cassilda's Song" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:

:Along the shore the cloud waves break,
:The twin suns sink behind the lake,
:The shadows lengthen
::In [[Carcosa]].

:Strange is the night where black stars rise,
:And strange moons circle through the skies,
:But stranger still is
::Lost Carcosa.

:Songs that the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]] shall sing,
:Where flap the tatters of the King,
:Must die unheard in
::Dim Carcosa.

:Song of my soul, my voice is dead,
:Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed
:Shall dry and die in
::Lost Carcosa.&lt;ref name="Cassilda"&gt;"The King in Yellow" in e.g. {{cite book

 | title = The Yellow Sign and Other Stories
 | series = Call of Cthulhu Fiction
 | publisher = [[Chaosium]]
 | isbn = 1-56882-170-0
 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short story "The Mask" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:

:''Camilla: You, sir, should unmask.''
:''Stranger: Indeed?''
:''Cassilda: Indeed it's time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.''
:''Stranger: I wear no mask.''
:''Camilla: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask? No mask!''&lt;ref name="Mask"&gt;"The Mask" in e.g. {{cite book

 | series = Call of Cthulhu Fiction
 | publisher = [[Chaosium]]
 | isbn = 1-56882-170-0
 | page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also stated, in "The Repairer of Reputations", that the final moment of the first act involves the character of Cassilda on the streets, screaming in a horrified fashion, "Not upon us, oh, king! Not upon us!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chambers | first = Robert W. | authorlink = Robert W. Chambers | year = 2004 | title = The Yellow Sign and Other Stories | series = Call of Cthulhu Fiction | publisher = [[Chaosium]] | isbn = 1-56882-170-0 | page = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the "irresistible" revealed truths. "The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect." Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: "If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it [...]" ("The Repairer of Reputations").

Chambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from "[[The Repairer of Reputations]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. "The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever," he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A similar passage occurs in "The Yellow Sign", in which two protagonists have read ''The King in Yellow'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Night fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influences==
Chambers borrowed the names Carcosa, Hali and [[Hastur]] from [[Ambrose Bierce]]: specifically, his [[short story|short stories]] "[[An Inhabitant of Carcosa]]" and "Haïta the Shepherd". There is no strong indication that Chambers was influenced beyond liking the names. For example, Hastur is a god of shepherds in "Haïta the Shepherd", but is implicitly a location in "The Repairer of Reputations", listed alongside the Hyades and Aldebaran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

	| isbn = 978-1-56882-126-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Stableford]] pointed out that the story "[[The Demoiselle d'Ys]]" was influenced by the stories of [[Théophile Gautier]], such as "Arria Marcella" (1852); both Gautier and Chambers' stories feature a love affair enabled by a supernatural [[time travel|time slip]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stableford, "The King in Yellow" in Frank N. Magill, ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. (pp. 844-847).&lt;/ref&gt; The name Jeanne d'Ys is also a [[homophone]] for the word [[jaundice]] and continues the symbolism of The King in Yellow.

In [[Raymond Chandler]]'s 1938 detective story, also titled "The King in Yellow", the protagonist says "The King in Yellow. I read a book by that title once."

The first season of HBO's ''[[True Detective]]'' television series revolves around a string of crimes committed by the elusive "Yellow King" with [[Carcosa]] also being mentioned on numerous occasions. Black stars are also prominent in reference and imagery during the series.

[[SCP Foundation]] entry SCP-701, The Hanged King, is possibly a reference to this. The titular play being one that causes violence and insanity among both the cast and audience members.


===Cthulhu Mythos===

one of his main [[Cthulhu Mythos]] stories. Lovecraft borrowed Chambers' method of only vaguely referring to supernatural events, entities, and places, thereby allowing his readers to imagine the horror for themselves. The play ''The King in Yellow'' effectively became another piece of [[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature|occult literature in the Cthulhu Mythos]] alongside the ''[[Necronomicon]]'' and others.

In the story, Lovecraft linked the Yellow Sign to [[Hastur]], but from his brief (and only) mention it is not clear what Lovecraft meant Hastur to be. [[August Derleth]] developed Hastur into a [[Great Old One]] in his controversial reworking of Lovecraft's universe, elaborating on this connection in his own mythos stories. In the writings of Derleth and a few other latter-day Cthulhu Mythos authors, the King in Yellow is an [[Avatar]] of Hastur, so named because of his appearance as a thin, floating man covered in tattered yellow robes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In Lovecraft's cycle of horror sonnets, ''Fungi from Yuggoth'', sonnet XXVII "The Elder Pharos" mentions the last Elder One who lives alone talking to chaos via drums: "The Thing, they whisper, wears a silken mask of yellow, whose queer folds appear to hide a face not of this earth...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 978-0-345-02147-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This thing with a silken mask of yellow also features in ''[[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath]]''. 

In the [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'' roleplaying game]] published by [[Chaosium]], the King in Yellow is an avatar of Hastur who uses his eponymous play to spread insanity among humans. He is described as a hunched figure clad in tattered, yellow rags, who wears a smooth and featureless "Pallid Mask". Removing the mask is a sanity-shattering experience; the King's face is described as "inhuman eyes in a suppurating sea of stubby maggot-like mouths; liquescent flesh, tumorous and gelid, floating and reforming".{{attribution needed|date=November 2010}}

Although none of the characters in Chambers' book describe the plot of the play, Kevin Ross fabricated a plot for the play within the ''Call of Cthulhu'' mythos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

''[[The Secret World]]'', a Lovecraft-inspired [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]], quotes Cassilda's Song and other elements from ''The King in Yellow'' during a quest.

The theft of a supposed manuscript of the play ''The King in Yellow'' from the British Library forms a major plot element of [[Charles Stross]]'s Lovecraft-inspired book ''[[The Annihilation Score]]''.

In Alan Moore's comic series [[Providence (Avatar Press)|''Providence'']], as well as its sequel ''[[Neonomicon]]'', Moore re-imagines the Lovecraftian mythos while referencing and borrowing heavily from ''The King in Yellow''. The book is referenced by name throughout ''Providence'', as well as referencing a fictional variation ''Sous Le Monde'', French for "Under the World." In both ''Providence'' and its sequel, a recurring character named Johnny Carcosa appears as an avatar/speaker for a Lovecraftian entity, possibly [[Nyarlathotep]] or [[Azathoth]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=https://factsprovidence.wordpress.com/moore-lovecraft-comics-annotation-index/providence-10/ |title=Providence 10 |access-date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Game designer [[Robin D. Laws]], having written a collection of Chamber-inspired stories entitled ''New Tales of the Yellow Sign'', has converted the story "Repairer of Reputations" for ''[[Trail of Cthulhu]]''. He is currently writing a Yellow King Roleplaying Game, including crossover content for the Cthulhu Mythos.

'''''The Overloaded Ark''''', first published in 1953, is the debut book by British naturalist [[Gerald Durrell]]. It is the chronicle of a six months collecting trip to the West African colony of [[British Cameroon]] - now [[Cameroon]] - (Dec 1947 - Aug 1948) - that Durrell made with the highly regarded aviculturist and ornithologist [[John Yealland]].

Their reasons for going on the trip were twofold: "to collect and bring back alive some of the fascinating animals, birds, and reptiles that inhabit the region," and secondly, for both men to realise a long cherished dream to see Africa. 

Its combination of comic exaggeration and environmental accuracy, portrayed in Durrell's light, clever prose, made it a great success. It launched Durrell's career as a writer of both non-fiction and fiction, which in turn financed his work as a zookeeper and conservationist.

''[[The Bafut Beagles]]'' and ''[[A Zoo in My Luggage]]'' are sequels of sorts, telling of his later returns to the region.

== History ==

Durrell had married Jacqueline Sonia Wolfenden ([[Jacquie Durrell]]), 21, a music student, on 26 February 1951. She knew that he could  keep a company spellbound with his talk, and wondered why he couldn't present stories of his animal collecting to a wider audience. Durrell, having criticized a BBC radio talk about life in West Africa, sent in a fifteen-minute radio script about his trials attempting to catch a hairy frog in the Cameroons. It was his first piece of professional writing. 

The BBC accepted the script, which he read, live, on the [[BBC Home Service]] the morning of Sunday 9 December 1951. The Overloaded Ark appeared in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;'Gerald Durrell: a biography' Douglas Botting chapter eleven 'writing man'1951-1953&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trompe-l'œil''''' ([[French language|French]] for "deceive the eye", pronounced {{IPA-fr|tʁɔ̃p lœj|}}) is an art technique that uses realistic imagery to create the [[optical illusion]] that the depicted objects exist in three dimensions. [[Forced perspective]] is a comparable illusion in architecture.

==History in painting==
[[File:Pompejanischer Maler um 70 001.jpg|thumb|Still life, Pompeii, c. AD 70]]
[[File:Colyer, Edwaert - Still Life - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Trompe-l'œil painting by [[Evert Collier]]]]
[[File:Escaping criticism-by pere borrel del caso.png|thumb|''Escaping Criticism'' by [[Pere Borrell del Caso]], 1874]]

Though the phrase, which can also be spelled without the [[hyphen]] and [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in English as '''trompe l'oeil''',&lt;ref&gt;For example by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041108051506/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2002/slideshow/slide-176-1.shtm National Gallery of Art, Washington]&lt;/ref&gt; originates in the [[Baroque]] period, when it refers to perspectival illusionism, trompe-l'œil dates much further back. It was (and is) often employed in [[mural]]s. Instances from Greek and Roman times are known, for instance in [[Pompeii]]. A typical trompe-l'œil mural might depict a window, door, or hallway, intended to suggest a larger room.

A version of an oft-told [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story concerns a contest between two renowned painters. [[Zeuxis]] (born around 464 BC) produced a still life painting so convincing that birds flew down to peck at the painted grapes. A rival, [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]], asked Zeuxis to judge one of his paintings that was behind a pair of tattered curtains in his study. Parrhasius asked Zeuxis to pull back the curtains, but when Zeuxis tried, he could not, as the curtains were included in Parrhasius's painting—making Parrhasius the winner.

==Perspective==
With widespread fascination with [[perspective (graphical)|perspective drawing]] in the [[Renaissance]], Italian painters of the late [[Quattrocento]] such as [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1431–1506) and [[Melozzo da Forlì]] (1438–1494), began painting [[illusionistic ceiling painting]]s, generally in [[fresco]], that employed perspective and techniques such as [[Perspective (graphical)#Foreshortening|foreshortening]] to create the impression of greater space for the viewer below. This type of trompe l'œil illusionism as specifically applied to ceiling paintings is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Di sotto in sù|di sotto in sù]]'', meaning "from below, upward" in Italian. The elements above the viewer are rendered as if viewed from true vanishing point perspective. Well-known examples are the [[Camera degli Sposi]] in [[Mantua]] and [[Antonio da Correggio]]'s (1489–1534) ''Assumption of the Virgin'' in the Duomo of [[Parma]]. Similarly, [[Vittorio Carpaccio]] (1460–1525) and [[Jacopo de' Barbari]] (c. 1440 – before 1516) added small trompe-l'œil features to their paintings, playfully exploring the boundary between image and reality. For example, a [[fly]] might appear to be sitting on the painting's frame, or a curtain might appear to partly conceal the painting, a piece of paper might appear to be attached to a board, or a person might appear to be climbing out of the painting altogether—all in reference to [[Zeuxis|the contest of Zeuxis and Parrhasius]]. In a 1964 seminar, the psychoanalyst and theorist [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) observed that the myth of the two painters reveals an interesting aspect of human cognition. While animals are attracted to superficial appearances, humans are enticed by the idea of things that are hidden.

==Quadratura==
Perspective theories in the 17th century allowed a more fully integrated approach to architectural illusion, which when used by painters to "open up" the space of a wall or ceiling is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Quadratura|quadratura]]''. Examples include [[Pietro da Cortona]]'s ''Allegory of Divine Providence'' in the [[Palazzo Barberini]] and [[Andrea Pozzo]]'s ''Apotheosis of St Ignatius'' [4] on the ceiling of the Roman church of [http://www.wga.hu/html/p/pozzo/apotheos.html Sant'Ignazio].
[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|Fresco with ''trompe l'œil'' dome painted on low vaulting, [[Jesuitenkirche, Vienna|Jesuit Church]], [[Vienna]], by [[Andrea Pozzo]], 1703]]
{{Italic title}}
The [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] style interiors of [[Jesuit]] churches in the 16th and 17th century often included such trompe-l'œil ceiling paintings, which optically "open" the ceiling or dome to the heavens with a depiction of Jesus', [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s, or a saint's ascension or assumption. An example of a perfect architectural trompe-l'œil is the illusionistic dome in the Jesuit church, Vienna, by [[Andrea Pozzo]], which is only slightly curved but gives the impression of true architecture.

Trompe-l'œil paintings became very popular in Flemish and later in Dutch painting in the 17th century arising from the development of still life painting.  The Flemish painter [[Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts|Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts]] created a chantourné painting showing an easel holding a painting.  Chantourné literally means 'cutout' and refers to a trompe l'œil representation designed to stand away from a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/arrowintheeye/illusion3.html 'Illusion, Delusion, Collusion, and Perceptual Paradox', in: Michael Kubovy and Christopher Tyler, Psychology of Perspective and Renaissance Art]&lt;/ref&gt;   The Dutch painter [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] was a master of the trompe-l'œil and theorized on the role of art as the lifelike imitation of nature in his 1678 book, the ''Introduction to the Academy of Painting, or the Visible World'' (''Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt'', Rotterdam, 1678).&lt;ref&gt;Susan Merriam, 'Seventeenth-century Flemish Garland Paintings: Still Life, Vision, and the Devotional Image', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8iL0uoNEJXUC&amp;dq=%22illusionism+in+Dutch+and+Flemish+Art%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thijs Weststeijn, 'The Visible World: Samuel Van Hoogstraten's Art Theory and the Legitimation of Painting in the Dutch Golden Age'], Amsterdam University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A fanciful form of architectural trompe-l'œil, '''quodlibet''', features realistically rendered paintings of such items as paper knives, playing cards, ribbons, and scissors, apparently accidentally left lying around.&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |type=Paperback |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8 |pages=880 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe-l'œil can also be found painted on tables and other items of furniture, on which, for example, a deck of playing cards might appear to be sitting on the table. A particularly impressive example can be seen at [[Chatsworth House]] in [[Derbyshire]], where one of the internal doors appears to have a violin and bow suspended from it, in a trompe l'œil painted around 1723 by [[Jan van der Vaardt]].&lt;ref name=JvanderVaardtViolin&gt;{{cite web |last=van der Vaardt |first=Jan |title=Violin and bow hanging from door |url=http://art.chatsworth.org/image/455206/jan-van-der-vaart-violin-and-bow-hanging-on-a-door |work=Devonshire Collection |publisher=Bridgeman Art Library |accessdate=15 April 2012 |location=Chatsworth House UK |format=Painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example can be found in the Painted Hall at the [[Old Royal Naval College]], Greenwich, London. This Wren building was painted by [[James Thornhill|Sir James Thornhill]], the first British born painter to be knighted and is a classic example of the baroque style popular in the early 18th century.  The American 19th-century still-life painter [[William Harnett]] specialized in trompe-l'œil. In the 20th century, from the 1960s on, the American [[Richard Haas]] and many others painted large trompe-l'œil murals on the sides of city buildings, and from beginning of the 1980s when German Artist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] began to combine classical fresco art with contemporary content trompe-l'œil became increasingly popular for interior murals. The Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalí]] utilized the technique for a number of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|af-jY2dC5XYC|Dali and Postmodernism|page=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other art forms==
Trompe-l'œil, in the form of "[[forced perspective]]", has long been used in stage-theater [[set design]], so as to create the illusion of a much deeper space than the actual stage. A famous early example is the [[Teatro Olimpico]] in [[Vicenza]], with [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]]'s seven forced-perspective "streets" (1585), which appear to recede into the distance.

Trompe-l'œil is employed in [[Donald O'Connor]]'s famous "Running up the wall" scene in the film ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1954). During the finale of his "Make 'em Laugh" number he first runs up a real wall. Then he runs towards what appears to be a hallway, but when he runs up this as well we realize that it is a large trompe-l'œil mural. More recently, [[Roy Andersson]] has made use of similar techniques in his feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fourthreefilm.com/2015/06/a-pigeon-sat-on-a-branch-reflecting-on-existence-an-interview-with-cinematographer-istvan-borbas/|title=A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence – An Interview with Cinematographer István Borbás|author=Bateman, Conor|publisher=4:3|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matte painting]] is a variant of trompe-l'œil, and is used in film production with elements of a scene are painted on glass panels mounted in front of the camera. 

Fictional trompe-l'œil appears in many [[Looney Tunes]], such as the [[Road Runner cartoon]]s, where, for example, Wile E. Coyote paints a tunnel on a rock wall, and the Road Runner then races through the fake tunnel. This is usually followed by the coyote's foolishly trying to run through the tunnel after the road runner, only to smash into the hard rock-face. This [[Visual gag|sight gag]] was employed in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

In [[Chicago]]'s [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]], [[Richard Haas]] used a 16-story 1929 apartment hotel converted into a 1981 apartment building for trompe-l'œil murals in homage to [[Chicago school architecture]]. One of the building's sides features the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], intended as a reflection of the actual building two miles south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/288.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=The City as Artifact |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3766.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=Mural, ''Homage to the Chicago School'', by Richard Haas, 1980 |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of France's most illusive trompe-l'œil artists is [[Jean Claude Adenin]], who has created installations for various wealthy clients.

Several contemporary artists use chalk on pavement or sidewalk to create trompe-l'œil works, a technique called [[street painting]] or "pavement art." These creations last only until washed away, and therefore must be photographed to be preserved. Practitioners of this form include [[Julian Beever]], [[Edgar Mueller]], [[Leon Keer]] and [[Kurt Wenner]].

The Palazzo Salis of [[Tirano]], [[Italy]] has over centuries and throughout the palace used trompe l'œil in place of more expensive real masonry, doors, staircases, balconies and draperies to create an illusion of sumptuousness and opulence.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, J. (2015) [http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil Tirano's Palace of Trompe L'Oeil: A Photographic Exhibition by John Paull] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208185147/http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil |date=2015-12-08 }} SlideShare.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe l'œil, in the form of "illusion painting", is also used in contemporary interior design, where illusionary wall paintings experienced a Renaissance since around 1980. Significant artists in this field are the German muralist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], who invented, in the 1990s, a new method of producing illusion paintings, [[frescography]], and the English artist [[Graham Rust]].
