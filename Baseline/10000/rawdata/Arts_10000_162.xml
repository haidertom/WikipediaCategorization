'''Abandonware''' is a [[Product (business)|product]], typically [[software]], ignored by its owner and manufacturer, and for which no support is available. Although such software is usually still under [[copyright]], the owner may not be tracking copyright violations.

In [[intellectual rights]] context, abandonware is a software (or hardware) special case of the general concept of ''[[orphan works]]''.

==Definition==
Definitions of "abandoned" vary, but in general it is like any item that is abandoned – it is ignored by the owner, and as such product support and possibly copyright enforcement are also "abandoned". It can refer to a product that is no longer available for legal purchase, over the age where the product creator feels an obligation to continue to support it, or where [[operating systems]] or [[Computer hardware|hardware]] platforms have evolved to such a degree that the creator feels continued support cannot be financially justified. In such cases, copyright and support issues are often ignored. Software might also be considered abandoned when it can be used only with [[Obsolescence|obsolete technologies]], such as [[Apple II series|pre-Macintosh]] Apple computers. A difference between ''abandonware'' and a ''discontinued product'' is that the manufacturer has not officially 'discontinued' the software, but only ended their official efforts at technical support.

Abandonware may be [[computer software]] or physical devices which are usually computerised in some fashion, such as [[personal computer games]], [[Office suite|productivity applications]], [[utility software]], or [[mobile phones]].

===Types===
The term "abandonware" is broad, and encompasses many types of old software.
;Commercial software unsupported but still owned by a viable company: The availability of the software depends on the company's attitude toward the software. In many cases, the company which owns the software rights may not be that which originated it, or may not recognize their ownership. Some companies, such as [[Borland]], make some software available online,&lt;ref name="edn"/&gt; in a form of [[freeware]]. Others do not make old versions available for [[Freeware|free use]] and do not permit people to copy the software. Many abandonware websites have been set up to archive and make available copies of unsupported and discontinued [[operating systems]] made by [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], as well as rare development builds of such operating systems that have been leaked by the media or technicians working for said companies &amp;mdash; the latter is popular among [[retrogaming]] and computing enthusiasts, who value the availability of these operating systems for the ease of access they provide. After [[Windows XP]] support was discontinued in April 2014, numerous websites started providing the operating system for free. The operating system's usage and popularity thus prevented it from being entirely abandoned.
;Commercial software owned by a company no longer in business: When no owning entity of a software exists, all activities (support, distribution, [[Intellectual property|IP]] activities etc.) in relationship to this software have ceased. If the rights to a software are non-recoverable in legal limbo ("orphaned work"), also the software's rights can not be bought by another company, there can not be copyright enforcement etc. An example of this is [[Digital Research]]'s original [[PL/I]] compiler for [[DOS]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpm.z80.de/ The Unofficial CP/M Web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203184144/http://www.cpm.z80.de/ |date=February 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was considered for many years without owner (now probably owned by [[Novell]]).
;[[Shareware]] whose author still makes it available: Finding historical versions, however, can be difficult since most shareware archives remove past versions with the release of new versions. Authors may or may not make older releases available. Some websites collect and offer for download old versions of shareware, freeware, and (in some cases) commercial applications. In some cases these sites had to remove past versions of software, particularly if the company producing that software still maintains it, or if later software releases introduce [[digital rights management]], whereby old versions could be viewed as DRM circumvention.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
;Unsupported or unmaintained shareware
;[[Open-source software|Open source]] and freeware programs that have been abandoned: In some cases, source code remains available, which can prove a historical artifact. One such case is [[PC-LISP]], still found online, which implements the [[Franz Lisp]] dialect. The DOS-based PC-LISP still runs well within emulators and on [[Microsoft Windows]].

==Implications==
If a software product reaches [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] and becomes abandonware, users are confronted with several potential problems: missing purchase availability (besides used software) and missing [[technical support]], e.g. compatibility fixes for newer hardware and operating systems. These problems are exacerbated if software is bound ("[[dongle]]") to physical media with a limited life-expectancy ([[floppy disc]]s, [[optical media]] etc.) and backups are impossible because of [[copy protection]] or copyright law. If a software is distributed only in a [[Digital distribution|digital]], [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-locked form&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/nothing-lasts-forever-confronting-the-problem-of-video-game-preservation |title=Nothing Lasts Forever: Confronting the Problem of Video Game Preservation |quote=''How game historians are working to ensure the future of archiving as the medium shifts to an all-digital format.'' |publisher=usgamer.net |first=Anthony John |last=Agnello |date=February 19, 2014 |accessdate=July 10, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151113/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/nothing-lasts-forever-confronting-the-problem-of-video-game-preservation |archivedate=July 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as [[SaaS]], the shutdown of the servers will lead to a public loss of the software. If the software product is without alternative, the missing replacement availability becomes a challenge for continued software usage.

Also, once a software product has become abandonware for a developer, even historically important software might get lost forever very easily, as numerous cases have shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6271/where_games_go_to_sleep_the_game_.php |title=Where Games Go To Sleep: The Game Preservation Crisis, Part 1 |first=John |last=Andersen |quote=''The existence of decaying technology, disorganization, and poor storage could in theory put a video game to sleep permanently -- never to be played again. Troubling admissions have surfaced over the years concerning video game preservation. When questions concerning re-releases of certain game titles are brought up during interviews with developers, for example, these developers would reveal issues of game production material being lost or destroyed. Certain game titles could not see a re-release due to various issues.

==Response to abandonware==

===Early abandonware websites===
As response to the missing availability of abandonware, people have distributed old software since shortly after the beginning of [[Personal computer|personal computing]], but the activity remained low-key until the advent of the [[Internet]]. While trading old games has taken many names and forms, the term "abandonware" was coined by Peter Ringering in late 1996.&lt;ref name="ARingFAQ"/&gt; Ringering found classic game websites similar to his own, contacted their webmasters, and formed the original ''Abandonware Ring'' in February 1997.&lt;ref name="ARingFAQ"&gt;{{cite web |title =The Abandonware Ring FAQ | work = | publisher =The Official Abandonware Ring | year =2006 | url =http://www.abandonwarering.com/?Page=FAQ |accessdate=August 22, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070328073919/http://www.abandonwarering.com/?Page=FAQ| archivedate= March 28, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This original [[webring]] was little more than a collection of sites linking to adventureclassicgaming.com. Another was a site indexing them all to provide a rudimentary search facility. In October 1997, the [[Interactive Digital Software Association]] sent [[cease and desist]] letters to all sites within the Abandonware Ring, which led to most shutting down. An [[unintended consequence]] (called the [[Streisand effect]] in Internet [[wiktionary:parlance|parlance]]) was that it spurred others to create new abandonware sites and organizations that came to outnumber the original Ring members. Sites formed after the demise of the original Abandonware Ring include [[Abandonia]], Bunny Abandonware and [[Home of the Underdogs]]. In later years abandonware websites actively acquired and received permissions from developers and copyright holders (e.g. [[Jeff Minter]], [[Magnetic Fields (video game developer)|Magnetic Fields]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemon64.com/games/permissions.php Permissions] on lemon64.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110814042804/http://www.c64gg.com/Mr_Chip_MF_DL.html Mr_Chip_MF_DL] on c64gg.com (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Gremlin Interactive]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gremlinworld.emuunlim.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402114725/http://gremlinworld.emuunlim.com/ |archivedate=April 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) for legal redistribution of abandoned works,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amigaforever.com/games/ Games] on [[Amiga Forever]] ''"The following is a list of the major sites which include thousands of downloadable Amiga games with permission of the copyright holders: Amiga Future, Amigaland, Ami Sector One, Back to the Roots, Borrowed Time, Dream17, Gremlin Graphics World, Games Coffer"''&lt;/ref&gt; an example is ''[[World of Spectrum]]'' who acquired the permission from many developers and successfully retracted a DMCA case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://slashdot.org/story/03/02/28/0747252/world-of-spectrum-gets-a-visit-from-the-idsa world-of-spectrum-gets-a-visit-from-the-idsa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531080840/http://slashdot.org/story/03/02/28/0747252/world-of-spectrum-gets-a-visit-from-the-idsa |date=May 31, 2012 }} on [[slashdot.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/07/games_anti_piracy_bot_fingers/ Games anti piracy bot fingers ZX Spectrum archive site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507033537/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/07/games_anti_piracy_bot_fingers/ |date=May 7, 2010 }} on [[theregister.com]] by John Lettice (7 Mar 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/#sofar ARCHIVE - COPYRIGHTS AND DISTRIBUTION PERMISSIONS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417235847/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/ |date=April 17, 2016 }} on worldofspectrum.org ''"Cases filed against World of Spectrum: IDSA / DMCA #922932 (14/2/2003 - result: case retracted)"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/publishers.html ARCHIVE - DISTRIBUTION PERMISSIONS - SOFTWARE HOUSES] on worldofspectrum.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archives===
Several websites archive abandonware for download, including old versions of applications which are difficult to find by any other means. Much of this software fits the definition of "software that is no longer current, but is still of interest", but the line separating the use and distribution of abandonware from [[copyright infringement]] is blurry, and the term ''abandonware'' could be used to distribute software without proper notification of the owner.

The [[Internet Archive]] has created an archive of what it describes as "vintage software", as a way to preserve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/clasp |title=The Internet Archive Classic Software Preservation Project | publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=October 21, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071019034848/https://archive.org/details/clasp| archivedate= October 19, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project advocated for an exemption from the United States [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] to permit them to bypass copy protection, which was approved in 2003 for a period of three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://archive.org/about/dmca.php| title=Internet Archive Gets DMCA Exemption To Help Archive Vintage Software| accessdate=October 21, 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071020011825/https://archive.org/about/dmca.php| archivedate= October 20, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption was renewed in 2006, and {{As of|2009|October|27|lc=on}}, has been indefinitely extended pending further rulemakings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2009/74fr55138.pdf |date=October 28, 2009 |title=Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies |author=[[Library of Congress]] [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]] |journal=[[Federal Register]] |volume=27 |issue=206 |pages=55137–55139 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 17, 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202003904/http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2009/74fr55138.pdf| archivedate= December 2, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archive does not offer this software for download, as the exemption is solely "for the purpose of preservation or archival reproduction of published digital works by a library or archive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2006/71fr68472.html |title=Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies |journal=[[Federal Register]] |volume=71 |issue=227 |pages=68472–68480 |date=November 27, 2006 |author=[[Library of Congress]] [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]] |accessdate=October 21, 2007 |quote=Computer programs and video games distributed in formats that have become obsolete and that require the original media or hardware as a condition of access, when circumvention is accomplished for the purpose of preservation or archival reproduction of published digital works by a library or archive.

==Arguments for and against distribution==
Proponents of abandonware preservation argue that it is more ethical to make copies of such software than new software that still sells. Those ignorant of copyright law have incorrectly taken this to mean that abandonware is legal to distribute, although no software written since 1964 is old enough for copyright to have expired in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise17.html |title=Copyright of Computer Programs | year=2002 | first=Lee |last=Hollaar |accessdate=August 7, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080711181121/http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise17.html| archivedate= July 11, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in cases where the original company no longer exists, the rights usually belong to someone else, though no one may be able to trace actual ownership, including the owners themselves.

Abandonware advocates also frequently cite historical preservation as a reason for trading abandoned software.&lt;ref name="ARingFAQ"/&gt; Older computer media are fragile and prone to rapid deterioration, necessitating transfer of these materials to more modern, stable media and generation of many copies to ensure the software will not simply disappear. Users of still-functional older computer systems argue for the need of abandonware because re-release of software by copyright holders will most likely target modern systems or incompatible media instead, preventing legal purchase of compatible software.

Those who oppose these practices argue that distribution denies the copyright holder potential sales, in the form of re-released titles, official emulation, and so on. Likewise, they argue that if people can acquire an old version of a program for free, they may be less likely to purchase a newer version if the old version meets their needs.

Some game developers showed sympathy for abandonware websites as they preserve their classical game titles.

| text=[...] personally, I think that sites that support these old games are a good thing for both consumers and copyright owners. If the options are (a) having a game be lost forever and (b) having it available on one of these sites, I'd want it to be available. That being said, I believe a game is 'abandoned' only long after it is out of print. And just because a book is out of print does not give me rights to print some for my friends.

==Law==
In most cases, software classed as abandonware is not in the [[public domain]], as it has never had its original copyright officially revoked and some company or individual may still own rights. While sharing of such software is usually considered copyright infringement, in practice copyright holders rarely enforce their abandonware copyrights for a number of reasons – chiefly among which the [[Digital obsolescence|software is technologically obsolete]] and therefore has no commercial value, therefore rendering copyright enforcement a pointless enterprise. By default, this may allow the product to de facto lapse into the public domain to such an extent that enforcement becomes impractical.

Rarely has any abandonware case gone to court, but it is still unlawful to distribute copies of old copyrighted software and games, with or without compensation, in any [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] signatory country.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/23/us-copyright-office-grants-abandonware-rights/ | title=US Copyright Office grants abandonware rights |first=Ross |last=Miller |accessdate = January 2, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080128134926/http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/23/us-copyright-office-grants-abandonware-rights/| archivedate= January 28, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement of copyright===
Old copyrights are usually left undefended. This can be due to intentional non-enforcement by owners due to software age or obsolescence, but sometimes results from a [[Corporation|corporate]] copyright holder going out of business without explicitly transferring ownership, leaving no one aware of the right to defend the copyright.

Even if the copyright is not defended, copying of such software is still unlawful in most jurisdictions when a copyright is still in effect. Abandonware changes hands on the assumption that the resources required to enforce copyrights outweigh benefits a copyright holder might realize from selling software licenses. Additionally, abandonware proponents argue that distributing software for which there is no one to defend the copyright is morally acceptable, even where unsupported by current law. Companies that have gone out of business without transferring their copyrights are an example of this; many hardware and software companies that developed older systems are long since out of business and precise documentation of the copyrights may not be readily available.

Often the availability of abandonware on the Internet is related to the willingness of copyright holders to defend their copyrights. For example, unencumbered games for [[Colecovision]] are markedly easier to find on the Internet than unencumbered games for [[Mattel]] [[Intellivision]] in large part because there is still a company that sells Intellivision games while no such company exists for the Colecovision.

===DMCA===
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) can be a problem for the preservation of old software as it prohibits required techniques. In October 2003, the US Congress passed 4 clauses to the DMCA which allow for reverse engineering software in case of preservation. {{quote|"3. Computer programs and video games distributed in formats that have become obsolete and which require the original media or hardware as a condition of access. ...The register has concluded that to the extent that libraries and archives wish to make preservation copies of published software and videogames that were distributed in formats that are (either because the physical medium on which they were distributed is no longer in use or because the use of an obsolete operating system is required), such activity is a noninfringing use covered by section 108(c) of the Copyright Act."|Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/1201/docs/fedreg-notice-final.pdf Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928063920/http://www.copyright.gov/1201/docs/fedreg-notice-final.pdf |date=September 28, 2012 }} by LIBRARY OF CONGRESS Copyright Office 37 CFR Part 201 (Docket No. RM 2002-4E) (October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November 2006 the Library of Congress approved an exemption to the DMCA that permits the cracking of copy protection on software no longer being sold or supported by its copyright holder so that they can be archived and preserved without fear of retribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2006/index.html Rulemaking on Exemptions from Prohibition on Circumvention of Technological Measures that Control Access to Copyrighted Works] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123031312/http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2006/index.html |date=November 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/abandonware-now-legal/1100-6162308/ |title=Abandonware now legal? - Changes in copyright rules let gamers break copy protection on old games--in some circumstances. |date=November 27, 2006 |first=Emma |last=Boyes |publisher=[[GameSpot]].com |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325120959/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/abandonware-now-legal/1100-6162308/ |archivedate=March 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US copyright law===
Currently, US copyright law does not recognize the term or concept of "abandonware" while the general concept "orphan works" is recognized (see [[Orphan works in the United States]]). There is a long-held concept of abandonment in [[trademark law]] as a direct result of the infinite term of trademark protection. Currently, a copyright can be released into the public domain if the owner clearly does so in writing; however this formal process is not considered abandoning, but rather releasing. Those who do not own a copyright cannot merely claim the copyright abandoned and start using protected works without permission of the copyright holder, who could then seek [[legal remedy]].

Hosting and distributing copyrighted software without permission is illegal. Copyright holders, sometimes through the [[Entertainment Software Association]], send [[cease and desist letter]]s, and some sites have shut down or removed infringing software as a result. However, most of the Association's efforts are devoted to new games, due to those titles possessing the greatest value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2002/01/49723?currentPage=1 | title = Abandonware: Dead Games Live On | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | last = King | first = Brad | date = January 19, 2002 | accessdate = April 2, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025232338/http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2002/01/49723?currentPage=1 | archivedate = October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the original copyright holder may be barred from bringing a court action, via a civil doctrine known as [[laches (equity)|laches]], which requires litigants to bring a viable civil action within a reasonable amount of time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

=== EU law ===
In the EU in 2012 an "Orphan Works Directive" ([[Directive 2012/28/EU]]) was constituted and is transferred into the member's laws. While the terminology has ambiguities regarding software and especially video games, some scholars argue that abandonware software video games fall under the definition of ''audiovisual works'' mentioned there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf |title=Games as Cultural Heritage Copyright Challenges for Preserving (Orphan) Video Games in the EU |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |first=Henrike |last=Maier |publisher=[[Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] |date=2015 |format=PDF |work=JIPITEC |page=120 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118035553/http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf |archivedate=January 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright expiration===
{{main|List of countries' copyright lengths}}
Once the copyright on a piece of software has expired, it automatically falls into [[public domain]]. Such software can be legally distributed without restrictions. However, due to the length of [[copyright terms]] in most countries, this has yet to happen for most software. All countries that observe the [[Berne Convention]] enforce copyright ownership for at least 50 years after publication or the author's death. However, individual countries may choose to enforce copyrights for longer periods. In the United States, copyright durations are determined based on authorship. For most published works, the duration is 70 years after the author's death. However, for anonymous works, works published under a pseudonym or works made for hire, the duration is 120 years after publication. In France, copyright durations are 70 years after the relevant date (date of author's death or publication) for either class.

However, because of the length of [[copyright enforcement]] in most countries, it is likely that by the time a piece of software defaults to public domain, it will have long become obsolete, irrelevant, or incompatible with any existing hardware. Additionally, due to the relatively short commercial, as well as physical, lifespans of most digital media, it is entirely possible that by the time the copyright expires for a piece of software, it will no longer exist in any form. However, since the largest risk in dealing with abandonware is that of distribution, this may be mitigated somewhat by private users (or organizations such as the Internet Archive) making private copies of such software, which would then be legally redistributable at the time of copyright expiry.

==Alternatives to software abandoning==
There are alternatives for companies with a software product which faces the end-of-life instead of abandoning the software in an unsupported state.

===Availability as freeware===
{{main|List of commercial video games released as freeware}}
Sometimes user-communities convince companies to voluntarily relinquish copyright on software, putting it into the public domain, or [[Software relicensing|re-license]] it as [[free software]] or as freeware. Transfer of public domain or freely licensed software is perfectly legal, distinguishing it from abandonware which still has full copyright restrictions.

[[Amstrad]] is an example which supports emulation and free distribution of [[Amstrad CPC|CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] hardware ROMs and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!msg/comp.sys.amstrad.8bit/HtpBU2Bzv_U/HhNDSU3MksAJ |title=Amstrad ROM permissions |first=Cliff |last=Lawson |publisher=comp.sys.amstrad.8bit |quote=''1) What exactly do you have to do to use Sinclair ROMs in an emulator, such as acknowledgements etc?"

There are groups that lobby companies to release their software as freeware. These efforts have met with mixed results. One example is the library of educational titles released by [[MECC]]. MECC was sold to Brøderbund, which was sold to [[The Learning Company]]. When TLC was contacted about releasing classic MECC titles as freeware, the documentation proving that TLC held the rights to these titles could not be located, and therefore the rights for these titles are "in [[limbo]]" and may never be legally released.&lt;ref name="CanAbandonware"&gt;{{cite web | last=Savetz | first=Kevin | title =Can "Abandonware" Revive Forgotten Programs? | work = | publisher=byte.com |date=September 17, 2001 |url=http://www.savetz.com/articles/byte-abandonware.php?sort=date | accessdate = March 8, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213191159/http://www.savetz.com/articles/byte-abandonware.php?sort=date | archivedate=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That the copyright situation of vintage out-of-print software is lost or unclear is not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/lost-in-limbo-on-the-hunt-for-pc-gamings-abandoned-classics/ |quote=''The saga of No One Lives Forever's resurrection has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs.

===Support by source code release===
{{main|Source code escrow}}
{{see also|List of commercial video games with later released source code}} {{see also|List of commercial software with available source code}}
The problem of missing technical support for a software can be most effectively solved when the source code becomes available. Therefore, several companies decided to release the source code specifically to allow the user communities to provide further technical software support (bug fixes, compatibility adaptions etc.) themselves,&lt;ref name="homesource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=8516 |title=Homeworld Source Code Released |date=October 8, 2003 |first=Andy |last=Largent |publisher=insidemacgames.com |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |quote=''With the release of Homeworld 2 for the PC, Relic Entertainment has decided to give back to their impressive fan community by releasing the source code to the original Homeworld.'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012012745/http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=8516 |archivedate=October 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allegiancesource"&gt;{{cite web|last=Colayco |first=Bob |title=Microsoft pledges Allegiance to its fanbase |publisher=[[gamespot.com]] |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |date=February 6, 2004 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-pledges-allegiance-to-its-fanbase/1100-6087574/ |quote=''The release of the source code came in response to the enthusiasm of Allegiance's small-but-dedicated fanbase.

For instance, in December 2015 Microsoft released the [[Windows Live Writer]] [[source code]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/microsoft-open-sources-live-writer-beloved-but-abandoned-blogging-tool/ Microsoft open-sources Live Writer, beloved but abandoned blogging tool] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612020134/http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/microsoft-open-sources-live-writer-beloved-but-abandoned-blogging-tool/ |date=June 12, 2016 }} by Peter Bright on [[Ars Technica]] ''"Opening the app means that it'll get some much-needed maintenance."'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the community to continue the support.

[[Id Software]] and [[3D Realms]] are early proponents in this practice, releasing the source code for the [[game engine]]s of some older titles under a [[free software license]] (but not the actual game content, such as levels or textures). Also [[Falcon 4.0]]'s lead designer Kevin Klemmick argued in 2011 that availability of the source code of his software for the community was a good thing: {{quote

The [[Chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] of drawing a possible lawsuit can discourage release of source code. Efforts to persuade [[IBM]] to release [[OS/2]] as [[open source software]] were ignored&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/19298/_I_m_Glad_That_IBM_Declined_to_Release_the_OS_2_Source_ | title=I'm Glad That IBM Declined to Release the OS/2 Source |date= February 7, 2008 |first= Michael |last=Reed |publisher=OSNews LLC |accessdate= May 30, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221095812/http://www.osnews.com/story/19298/_I_m_Glad_That_IBM_Declined_to_Release_the_OS_2_Source_ |archivedate=February 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since some of the code was co-developed by Microsoft.

Nevertheless, several notable examples of successfully opened commercial software exist, for instance, the web browser [[Netscape Communicator]], which was released by [[Netscape Communications]] on March 31, 1998.&lt;ref name="netscapeopensource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401072854/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html |archivedate=April 1, 2007 |date=January 22, 1998 |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |publisher=[[Netscape Communications Corporation]] |title=NETSCAPE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO MAKE NEXT-GENERATION COMMUNICATOR SOURCE CODE AVAILABLE FREE ON THE NET |quote=''BOLD MOVE TO HARNESS CREATIVE POWER OF THOUSANDS OF INTERNET DEVELOPERS; COMPANY MAKES NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR AND COMMUNICATOR 4.0 IMMEDIATELY FREE FOR ALL USERS, SEEDING MARKET FOR ENTERPRISE AND NETCENTER BUSINESSES ''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development was continued under the umbrella of the [[Mozilla Foundation]] and Netscape Communicator became the basis of several browsers, such as [[Mozilla Firefox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/netscape-celebrates-first-anniversary-of-open-source-software-release-to-mozillaorg-73806207.html |title= MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., April 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Netscape Communications and open source developers are celebrating the first anniversary, March 31, 1999, of the release of Netscape's browser source code to mozilla.org |accessdate=January 10, 2013 |date=March 31, 1999 |quote=''[...]The organization that manages open source developers working on the next generation of Netscape's browser and communication software.

There are also many examples in the video game domain: [[Revolution Software]] released their game ''[[Beneath a Steel Sky]]'' as freeware and gave the engine's source code to the authors of [[ScummVM]] to add support for the game.

In 1984, [[Robert Penn Warren]] noted that "To have great poets there must be great audiences, Whitman said, to the more or less unheeding ears of American educators. Ambitiously, hopefully, the Academy has undertaken to remedy this plight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fifty Years of American Poetry |publisher=Harry N.

==History==
The Academy of American Poets was created in 1934 in [[New York City]] by 23-year-old Marie Bullock &lt;ref&gt;http://www.poets.org/academy-american-poets/mission-history&lt;/ref&gt; with a mission to "support American poets at all stages of their careers and to foster the appreciation of contemporary poetry." In 1936, the Academy of American Poets was officially incorporated as a [[nonprofit organization]]. Marie Bullock was the president of the Academy of American Poets for the next half a century, running the organization out of her apartment for thirty of those years. In 1982, Marie Bullock received a Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture. She also had received the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences, the Award for Distinguished Service to the Arts from the National Institute of Arts and Letters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/27/obituaries/marie-bullock-75-founded-and-led-academy-of-poets.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since its earliest days, the Academy of American Poets has been guided by an honorary Board of Chancellors composed of established and award-winning poets who serve as advisors to the organization and judge its largest prizes for poets. Past Chancellors include [[W. H. Auden]], [[Elizabeth Bishop]], [[Lucille Clifton]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Marianne Moore]], and [[Mark Strand]]. Women as well as men were founding poets of the Academy; for example, Florence Hamilton.&lt;ref name="usc.edu"&gt;http://www.usc.edu/libraries/finding_aids/records/finding_aid.php?fa=0110&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the fifteen Chancellors of the Academy of American Poets are: [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)|Elizabeth Alexander]], [[Ellen Bass]], [[Marilyn Chin]], [[Kwame Dawes]], [[Forrest Gander]], [[Linda Gregerson]], [[Terrance Hayes]], [[Brenda Hillman]], [[Marie Howe]], [[Khaled Mattawa]], [[Marilyn Nelson]], [[Alicia Ostriker]], [[Claudia Rankine]], [[Alberto Ríos]], and [[David St. John]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/academy-american-poets/chancellors "Chancellors"] Poets.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of American Poets administers several programs: National Poetry Month;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poets.org/national-poetry-month/home&lt;/ref&gt; the website Poets.org, which includes a curated collection of poems and essays about poetry, over 800 recordings and videos of poets dating back to the 1960s, and free materials for K-12 teachers, including lesson plans;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/61710-poetry-gets-a-hip-new-look.html&lt;/ref&gt; the syndicated series, Poem-a-Day;&lt;ref name="kingfeatures.com"/&gt; and ''American Poets'' magazine. The organization also awards nine major prizes for poets, as well as 200 college awards sponsored at schools across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.poets.org/academy-american-poets/american-poets-prizes "American Poets Prizes"&gt; Poets.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Fred Viebahn, husband of African-American poet [[Rita Dove]], drew media attention to the lack of diversity on the Academy's Board of Chancellors; up until then, no poet of color had ever been elected to be a Chancellor, and only very few women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Viebahn |first=Fred |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~fv5w/academy.pdf |title=Unmasking the 'Gods of Poetry' |work=[[Callaloo (journal)|Callaloo]] |volume=22 |issue=1 |date=1999}} Reprinting of Fred Viebahn's essay from ''International Quarterly'', along with editorial commentary by Charles H. Rowell.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently two female  Chancellors, [[Maxine Kumin]] and [[Carolyn Kizer]], resigned in protest.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt; The Academy responded by instituting major changes and designating several new chancellors, including African-American poets [[Lucille Clifton]] and [[Yusef Komunyakaa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Dinitia |date=March 22, 1999 |title=Criticized as Elitist, Poets' Organization Revamps Its Structure |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/22/books/criticized-as-elitist-poets-organization-revamps-its-structure.html?smid=pl-share |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elizabeth Kray was hired in 1963 as the first executive director of the Academy of American Poets, and she served the organization until 1981.&lt;ref name="usc.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/24/obituaries/elizabeth-kray-patron-and-friend-of-poets-and-their-art-dies-at-71.html&lt;/ref&gt; William Wadsworth served as executive director from 1989-2001. In 2012, poet and nonprofit administrator Jennifer Benka was named executive director of the Academy of American Poets.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.newschool.edu/news/2012/06/jennifer-banka-to-lead-academy-of-american-poets/#.VKcYvIrF8-I&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards given by the Academy of American Poets==
Awards are listed in chronological order of their creation.

===Academy of American Poets Fellowship===
One Academy of American Poets Fellowship is awarded annually for "distinguished poetic achievement": Fellows are awarded a stipend which is presently $25,000.&lt;ref name=Fellowship&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/106 |title=Academy Fellowship |publisher=Academy of American Poets |accessdate=2009-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301175948/http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/106 |archive-date=2009-03-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fellowship program was created in 1946, and was the first of the organization's current portfolio of awards; the Academy's website Poets.org describes it as "the first of its kind in the United States."&lt;ref name= Fellowship /&gt;

===James Laughlin Award===
{{Main article|List of winners of the James Laughlin Award}}
Formerly known as the Lamont Poetry Selection, the Laughlin Award is given in recognition of a poet's second published book, and is considered to be the only major award honoring the publication of a poet's second book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Awards &amp; Grants |url=http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/114 |publisher=Academy of American Poets |accessdate=2009-05-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516232845/http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/114 |archivedate=16 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/109 |title=James Laughlin Award |publisher=Academy of American Poets |accessdate=2009-05-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423114721/http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/109 |archivedate=2009-04-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was first established in 1954 by a bequest from the wife of [[Thomas W. Lamont]], who specified that it be used "for the discovery and encouragement of new poetic genius."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Jeanne J. |title=Literary and Library Prizes |publisher=Bowker |year=1973 |page= |isbn=978-0-8352-0645-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Harvey Shapiro referred to the award as "roughly, a [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer]] for bardlings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shapiro |first=Harvey |title=The Timbre of Three New Voices |date=August 9, 1959 |work=The New York Times |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A14FE3E5F1A7B93CBA91783D85F4D8585F9 |accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially, the Lamont Poetry Selection was awarded to a poet's first published book; copies of the book were purchased from its publisher for distribution to the Academy's members. In 1975, the organization changed to selecting a poet's second volume; in an editorial, [[Peter Davison (poet)|Peter Davison]] welcomed the change, suggesting that publishing a second volume was becoming more difficult than publishing the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davison |first=Peter |date=April 20, 1975 |title=The Nurture of Poets: The Guest Word |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/20/archives/the-nurture-of-poets-the-guest-word.html |accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, it was endowed by a gift from the [[Drue Heinz]] Trust, and it was renamed to honor [[James Laughlin]], who founded the publishing house [[New Directions Publishers|New Directions]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="Laughlin" /&gt; At present, winners receive a cash prize of $5,000, an all-expenses-paid weeklong residency at The Betsy Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.poets.org/academy-american-poets/prizes/james-laughlin-award "James Laughlin Award"] Poets.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the Academy of American Poets purchases one thousand copies of the winning book for distribution to its membership;&lt;ref name="Laughlin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Literary Awards |url=http://www.clmp.org/resources/lit_awards.html |publisher=[[Council of Literary Magazines and Presses]] |accessdate=2009-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090413001711/http://clmp.org/resources/lit_awards.html| archivedate= 13 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the purchase and distribution essentially guarantee that the book becomes "a bestseller in the tiny poetry market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times |last=Miller |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Miller (journalist) |title=As Arts Prizes Multiply, So Do Doubts on Value |date=December 2, 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/02/theater/as-arts-prizes-multiply-so-do-doubts-on-value.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Field (poet)|Edward Field]] has described the importance of receiving the Award to his career as follows:&lt;ref name=Field&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Edward |title=A Frieze for a Temple of Love |isbn=978-1-57423-067-3 |year=1998 |publisher=David R. Godine |page=184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xF2kwZnS24C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|... perhaps it is just as well that I didn't succeed in getting a publisher earlier, since, with new poems being added all the time, the manuscript kept getting stronger. But years of rejection took their toll, and when I won the Lamont Award in 1962, I kept repeating "I will not be consoled." But I was. My life changed considerably. For one thing, I could make a living - I gave poetry readings around the country, wrote narrations for a couple of documentary films, translated a book of Eskimo poems, and, yes, even taught poetry workshops for a while.|Edward Field}}

Several of the Award's recipients have subsequently won the highest honors given to mature poets. [[Donald Hall]] was named [[Poet Laureate of the United States]] in 2004. [[Donald Justice]], [[Lisel Mueller]], [[Philip Schultz]], and [[Tracy K. Smith]] have each won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]].

===University &amp; College Poetry Prizes===
The Academy first began awarding annual $100 prizes to student poets at ten American universities and colleges in 1955. The program has since expanded to include more than 200 schools. According to the Academy, most of these prizes are endowed in perpetuity, though some are funded through other arrangements with the school or through private donors. For a school to become part of the program, a $2,500 endowment contribution is required. Individual schools set the winning criteria for their awards, within the guidelines set by the Academy: winners must be registered students at the school and the school cannot restrict the themes or styles of the entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/113 |title=University &amp; College Poetry Prizes |publisher=Academy of American Poets |accessdate=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of American Poets currently announces three judges for each year's competition in advance.&lt;ref name=Marshall /&gt; There has been some criticism of the Academy's procedures for mitigating the judges' conflicts of interest, since the judges are often acquainted with some of the poets whose volumes are nominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Lenore Marshall Prize and the Doping of Poets |work=[[Foetry.com]] |last=Cordle |first=Alan |date=December 9, 2004 |url=http://foetry.com/wp/?p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=American foetry: Pulitzer prize-winners accused of fraud and competition-fixing - who ever said poetry was boring? |last=Sutherland |first=John |authorlink=John Sutherland (author) |work=The Guardian |date=July 4, 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jul/04/news.comment | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolf Heinrich-Hansen was born in [[Copenhagen]], the son of architectural painter and later professor [[Heinrich Hansen (painter)|Heinrich Hansen]] and Margrethe Elisabeth Burmeister. He studied theology for four years at the [[University of Copenhagen]] before deciding to follow in his father's footsteps.

He had probably already worked as an assistant to his father. He studied at C.F. Andersens's sketching school and at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] from 1883 to 1886. He received a travel grant from the [[Carlsberg Foundation]] in 1890. He had had his debut at the [[Kunsthal Charlottenborg|Charlottenborg Exhibition]] in 1885 and exhibited there until 1909. He was also represented at the Nordic Exhibition in 1888 and at the World Rxhibitions in Paris in 1889 and Chicago in 1893 and exhibited in Berlin in 1783&amp;ndash;96 and in Munich in 1899. [[Den Frie Udstilling]] hosted a special exhibition of his works in 1911.

In the 1890s, he taught perspective both at the Art School for Women and the Academy.He visited Germany, Belgium, Italy and Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisWeilbach.do?kunstnerId=83&amp;wsektion=alle|title=Adolf Heinrich-Hansen|language=Danish|publisher=[[Kunstindeks Danmark]]|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Heinrich-Hansen's works include architectural paintings of churches and castles, especially their interiors. He also painted cityscapes, especially from historic Herman town centres. He also worked on the island of [[Fanø]], painting interiors with women in traditional clothes. He also painted a few portraits. Late in his life, he turned to animal painting, specializing in horses and dogs.

==Personal life==
Heinrich-Hansen married Karen Margrethe Leuning, daughter of the later Minister of Justice Carl Peter Gram Leuning. They divorced in 1917 and he later married Ellen Marie Irene Kretzschmer.

The '''Arts in Australia''' refers to the art produced in the area of, on the subject of, or by the people of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] and its preceding [[Indigenous Australian|Indigenous]] and colonial societies. [[Indigenous Australian art]], [[Indigenous Australian music|music]] and story telling attaches to a 40–60,000-year heritage and continues to affect the broader arts and [[culture of Australia]]. During its early [[Western civilisation|western]] history, Australia was a collection of British colonies, therefore, its [[Australian literature|literary]], [[Visual arts of Australia|visual]] and [[Theatre of Australia|theatrical]] traditions began with strong links to the broader traditions of [[English literature|English]] and [[Irish literature]], [[Art of the United Kingdom|British art]] and [[Music of the United Kingdom|English]] and [[Celtic music]]. However, the works of Australian artists – including Indigenous as well as [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] and [[multicultural]] migrant Australians – has, since 1788, introduced the character of a new continent to the global arts scene – exploring such themes as [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginality]], Australian landscape, migrant and national identity, distance from other Western nations and proximity to Asia, the complexities of urban living and the "beauty and the terror" of life in the [[Australian bush]].

Notable Australian writers have included the Nobel laureate [[Patrick White]], the novelists [[Colleen McCullough]] and [[Henry Handel Richardson]] and the bush poets [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Leading Australian performing artists have included [[Robert Helpmann]] of the [[Australian Ballet]], [[Joan Sutherland]] of [[Opera Australia]] and the humourist [[Barry Humphries]]. Prominent Australian musical artists have included the [[Australian country music]] singer [[Slim Dusty]], rising star [[Cody Simpson]], folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], "pop princess" [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[rock n roll]] bands the [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]], [[INXS]] and [[Powderfinger]]. Quintessentially Australian art styles include the [[Heidelberg School]] the [[Hermannsburg School]] and the [[Western Desert Art Movement]]. [[Australian cinema]] has a long tradition with a body of work producing popular classics such as ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' and ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man From Snowy River]]'', and [[arthouse]] successes such as ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' and ''[[Ten Canoes]]''. Prominent Australian trained filmed artists include [[Errol Flynn]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Cate Blanchett]].

Notable institutions for the arts include the [[UNESCO]] listed [[Sydney Opera House]], the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in [[Canberra]] and the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] in Sydney.

The arts in Australia, including the fields of [[cinema of Australia|cinema]], [[music of Australia|music]], [[art of Australia|visual arts]], [[theatre of Australia|theatre]], [[dance in Australia|dance]] and crafts often reflect general trends in Western arts. However, the arts as practiced by [[indigenous Australians]] represent a unique Australian cultural tradition, and Australia's landscape and history have contributed to some unique variations in the styles inherited by Australia's various migrant communities.&lt;ref name="painters"&gt;{{cite web

At the close of the 19th century, the painters of the [[Heidelberg School]] began to capture the unique colours of the [[Australian bush]], famed writers [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]] presented conflicting views of the harshness and romance of life in Australia, and performing artists like opera singer Dame [[Nellie Melba]] made a mark internationally in classical European culture. During the 20th century, writers and performers like [[C J Dennis]], [[Barry Humphries]] and [[Paul Hogan]] both mocked and celebrated Australian cultural stereotypes, while shifting demographics saw a diversification of artistic output, with writers like feminist [[Germaine Greer]] challenging traditional cultural norms.

Australia's capital cities each support traditional  "[[high culture]]" institutions in the form of major art galleries, ballet troupes, theaters, symphony orchestras, opera houses and dance companies. Leading Australian performers in these fields have included the opera Dames [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], dancers [[Edouard Borovansky]] and [[Robert Helpmann|Sir Robert Helpmann]], and choreographer/dancers such as [[Graeme Murphy]] and [[Meryl Tankard]]. [[Opera Australia]] is based in Sydney at the world-renowned [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/opera/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120192723/http://cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/opera/ |archivedate=20 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Ballet]], [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra|Melbourne]] and [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra|Sydney]] symphony orchestras are also well regarded cultural institutions.

Organisations such as the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] and [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] have fostered students of theatre, film, and television several of whom have continued to international success, with actors like [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]] having been associated with both institutions.

Independent culture thrives in all capital cities and exists in most large regional towns. The independent arts of [[music of Australia|music]], [[cinema of Australia|film]], [[art of Australia|art]] and [[street art]] are the most extensive. [[Melbourne]]'s independent music scene, is one of the largest in the world, whilst another can be found in the multitude of international street artists visiting Melbourne and, to a lesser extent, other major cities, to work for a period of time. As of February 2015, Arts and recreation services was the strongest industry in Australia by total number of employed persons growing by 20.59% since the same time in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finder.com.au/press-release-careers-in-australia finder's Careers In Australia Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual arts have a long history in Australia, dating back around 30,000 years, and examples of ancient Aboriginal rock art can be found throughout the continent, notably in national parks such as the [[UNESCO]]-listed sites at [[Uluru]] and [[Kakadu National Park]] in the Northern Territory, and also within protected parks in urban areas such as [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park]] in Sydney.&lt;ref name="rockart"&gt;[http://www.media.australia.com/en-au/factsheets/3321_9177.aspx Aboriginal Australia - Rock Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531014320/http://www.media.australia.com/en-au/factsheets/3321_9177.aspx |date=31 May 2013 }}, [[Tourism Australia]].

Following the arrival of permanent European settlement in Australia in 1788, the story of early Australian painting has been described{{By whom|date=September 2010}} as requiring of artists a shift from a "European sense of light" to an "Australian sense of light". The origins of distinctly Australian painting is often associated with the [[Heidelberg School]] of the 1880s–1890s. Artists such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Tom Roberts]] applied themselves to recreating in their art a truer sense of light and colour as seen in the Australian landscape. Like the European Impressionists, they painted in the open air. These artists found inspiration in the unique light and colour which characterises the [[Australian bush]].

Among the first Australian artists to gain a reputation overseas was the impressionist [[John Peter Russell]] during the 1880s. Another notable expatriate artist of the era was [[Rupert Bunny]], a painter of landscape, allegory and sensual and intimate portraits. [[Ernst William Christmas]] also made a name internationally.

Among the principal Australian artists of the 20th century are the [[surrealist]]s [[Sidney Nolan]], [[Arthur Boyd]] and [[Russell Drysdale]], the [[avant-garde]] [[Brett Whiteley]], the painter/sculptors [[William Dobell]] and [[Norman Lindsay]], the landscapists Albert Namatjira and [[Lloyd Rees]], the [[modernist]] photographer [[Max Dupain]], and the Aboriginal artist Emily Kngwarreye. Each has helped to define the unique character of the visual arts in Australia.&lt;ref name="painters"/&gt;

Modernism arrived in Australia early in the 20th century. Among the earliest exponents were [[Grace Cossington Smith]] and [[Margaret Preston]]. Humorist [[Barry Humphries]] has been a provocative exponent of [[dadaism]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hughes; ''The Art of Australia''; Penguin; Revised Edition 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular with the general community have been [[Ken Done]], best known for his design work, [[Pro Hart]] and [[Rolf Harris]], a British/Australian living in the UK who is popular as a musician, composer, painter and television host. [[Ricky Swallow]], [[Patricia Piccinini]], [[Susan Norrie]], [[Callum Morton]], [[Rover Thomas]] and Emily Kngwarreye have all represented Australians at the [[Venice Biennale]] using the traditional mediums of sculpture, photography and painting while instilling them with a renewed vigour. A new generation of Aboriginal artists, while not rejecting the culture of the past, endeavour to move the artistic dialog forward, including [[Gordon Bennett (artist)|Gordon Bennett]], [[Rosella Namok]], [[Richard Bell (artist)|Richard Bell]] and [[Julie Dowling (artist)|Julie Dowling]].

In recent years the art market has been democratised and art is judged on its merits rather than snobbery. A cohort of male artists aged under fifty ([[Dane Lovett]], [[Adam Cullen]], [[Ben Quilty]], [[Anthony Bennett (Australian artist)|Anthony Bennett]], [[Simon Cuthbert]], [[Rhys Lee]], [[Ben Frost (artist)|Ben Frost]] and [[Alasdair McIntyre]]) have an expressive style and use humour in their work.

In addition [[street art]] is also a prominent feature in major cities such as [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. Though there is some debate over the legality, some councils have expressed greater recognition of the urban art movement.

Australia has a number of notable museums and galleries, including the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in [[Melbourne]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]], [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery of Australia]] and [[National Museum of Australia]] in Canberra, and the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] in Sydney.

Australia has a long history of film production. Australia's first dedicated film studio, the [[Limelight Department]], was created by [[The Salvation Army]] in Melbourne in 1898, and is believed to have been the world's first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/SALV/STANDARD/PC_60860.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030184703/http://salvationarmy.org.au/SALV/STANDARD/PC_60860.html |archivedate=30 October 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first feature-length film was the Australian production ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang&lt;/ref&gt; After such early successes, Australian cinema suffered from the rise of [[Hollywood]].

[[File:GeoffreyRushTIFFSept2011.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Geoffrey Rush]], star of ''[[Shine (film)|Shine]]'']]

In 1933, ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'' was directed by [[Charles Chauvel (filmmaker)|Charles Chauvel]], who cast Tasmanian-born [[Errol Flynn]] as the leading actor.&lt;ref&gt;http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/wake-bounty/&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. Chauvel directed a number of successful Australian films, the last being 1955's ''[[Jedda]]'', which was notable for being the first Australian film to be shot in colour, and the first to feature Aboriginal actors in lead roles and to be entered at the Cannes Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3702/year/1955.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2006 and [[Rolf de Heer]]'s ''[[Ten Canoes]]'' that a major feature-length drama was shot in an indigenous language.

The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942's ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'', directed by [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s and 1970s an influx of government funding saw the development of a new generation of filmmakers telling distinctively Australian stories, including directors [[Peter Weir]], [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] and [[Bruce Beresford]]. Films such as ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sunday Too Far Away]]'' (1975) had an immediate international impact. The 1980s is often regarded{{By whom|date=October 2010}} as a golden age of Australian cinema, with many successful films, from the historical drama of [[Gallipoli (1981 film)|''Gallipoli'']] (1981) to the dark science fiction of the ''[[Mad Max]]'' sequels (1981–85), the romantic adventure of ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man From Snowy River]]'' (1982) or the comedy of ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/Croc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A major theme of Australian cinema has been survival in the harsh Australian landscape. A number of thrillers and horror films dubbed "outback gothic" have been created, including ''[[Wake in Fright]]'', ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'' (1971), ''[[The Cars That Ate Paris]]'' (1974) and ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' (1975), ''[[Razorback (film)|Razorback]]'' (1984) and ''[[Shame (1988 film)|Shame]]'' (1988) in the 1980s, and ''[[Japanese Story]]'' (2003), ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) and the world-renowned ''[[Wolf Creek (film)|Wolf Creek]]'' (2006) in the 21st century. These films depict the Australian outback and its wilderness and creatures as deadly, and its people as outcasts and psychopaths disconnected to modern urban Australia. These are combined with futuristic post-apocalyptic themes in the ''Mad Max'' series.

The 1990s saw a run of successful comedies such as ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'' (1992), ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Castle (1997 Australian film)|The Castle]]'' (1996), which helped launch the careers of [[Toni Collette]], [[P. J. Hogan]], [[Eric Bana]] and [[Baz Luhrmann]]. This group was joined in Hollywood by actors including [[Russell Crowe]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Heath Ledger]] who also rose to international prominence.

The domestic film industry continues to produce a reasonable{{Quantify|date=October 2010}} number of films each year. The industry is also supported by US producers who produce in Australia following the decision by Fox head [[Rupert Murdoch]] to utilise new studios in Melbourne and Sydney where filming could be completed well below US costs. Notable productions include ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'' episodes [[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|II]] and [[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|III]], and ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]].

[[File:The Magic Pudding.jpg|thumb|130px|[[The Magic Pudding]] by [[Norman Lindsay]]]]

Among the important authors of classic Australian works are the poets [[Henry Lawson]], [[Banjo Paterson]], [[C J Dennis]] and [[Dorothea McKellar]]. Dennis wrote in the Australian vernacular, while McKellar wrote the iconic patriotic poem'' [[My Country]]''. At one point, Lawson and Paterson contributed a series of verses to ''[[The Bulletin]]'' magazine in which they engaged in a literary debate about the nature of life in Australia. Lawson said Paterson was a romantic and Paterson said Lawson was full of doom and gloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/lawson/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408180527/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/lawson/ |archivedate=8 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawson is widely regarded as one of Australia's greatest writers of short stories, while Paterson's poems [[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man From Snowy River]] and [[Clancy of the Overflow]] remain amongst the most popular Australian bush poems. Significant political poets of the 20th century included Dame [[Mary Gilmore]] and [[Judith Wright]]. Among the best known contemporary poets are [[Les Murray (poet)|Les Murray]] and [[Bruce Dawe]].

Novelists of classic Australian works include [[Marcus Clarke]] (''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]''), [[Henry Handel Richardson]] (''[[The Fortunes of Richard Mahony]]''), [[Joseph Furphy]] (''[[Such Is Life (novel)|Such Is Life]]''), [[Miles Franklin]] (''[[My Brilliant Career]]'') and [[Ruth Park]] (''[[The Harp in the South]]''). In terms of children's literature, [[Norman Lindsay]] (''[[The Magic Pudding]]'') and [[May Gibbs]] (''[[Snugglepot and Cuddlepie]]'') are among the Australian classics, while eminent Australian playwrights have included [[Steele Rudd]], [[David Williamson]], [[Alan Seymour]] and [[Nick Enright]].

Although historically only a small proportion of Australia's population have lived outside the major cities, many of Australia's most distinctive stories and legends originate in the [[outback]], in the [[Drover (Australian)|drover]]s and squatters and people of the barren, dusty plains.&lt;ref name="Seal 1989 50"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Seal|first=Graham|title=The Hidden Culture: Folklore in Australian Society|page=50|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-19-554919-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary works dealing with the migrant experience include [[Melina Marchetta]]'s ''[[Looking for Alibrandi (novel)|Looking for Alibrandi]]'' and [[Anh Do]]'s memoir ''[[The Happiest Refugee]]'', which won the Indie Book of the Year Award for 2011 and tells the story of his experience as a Vietnamese refugee travelling to and growing up in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/15/3164087.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

These ritual performances gave them an understanding of themselves in the interplay of social, geographical and environmental forces. The performances were associated with specific places and dance grounds were often sacred places. Body decoration and specific gestures related to kin and other relationships (such as to Dreamtime beings with which individuals and groups). For a number of Indigenous Australian groups, their dances were secret and or sacred, gender could also be an important factor in some ceremonies with men and women having separate ceremonial traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Dance in ''[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]], Volume 1'' pp. 255–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Corroboree]] is commonly used in general Australian culture to refer to Australian Aboriginal dances, however, this term has its origins among the people of the Sydney region. In a number of places Australian Aboriginal people will perform "corroborees" for tourists.

In the latter part of the 20th century the influence of Indigenous Australian dance traditions has been seen with the development of concert dance, particularly in contemporary dance with the [[National Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Association]] providing training to Indigenous Australians in dance and the Bangarra Dance Theatre.

[[Bush dance]] has developed in Australia as a form of traditional dance, drawing from English, Irish, Scottish and other European dance. Favourite dances in the community include such as the Irish [[Céilidh]] "Pride of Erin" and the [[quadrille]] "The Lancers". Locally originated dances include the "Waves of Bondi", the [[Melbourne Shuffle]] and [[New Vogue (dance)|New Vogue]].

[[The Australian Ballet]] is the foremost [[classical ballet]] company in Australia.  It was founded by the English ballerina Dame [[Peggy van Praagh]] in 1962 and is today recognised as one of the world's major international ballet companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianballet.com.au/about_us/history&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in Melbourne and performs works from the classical repertoire as well as contemporary works by major Australian and international choreographers. As of 2010, it was presenting approximately 200 performances in cities and regional areas around Australia each year as well as international tours. Regular venues include: the [[Melbourne Arts Centre]], [[Sydney Opera House]], [[Sydney Theatre]], [[Adelaide Festival Centre]]
and [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianballet.com.au/about_us&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Helpmann]] is among Australia's best known ballerinos.

Many immigrant communities continue their own dance traditions on a professional or amateur basis. Traditional dances from a large number of ethnic backgrounds are danced in Australia, helped by the presence of enthusiastic immigrants and their Australian-born families. It is quite common to see dances from the Baltic region, as well as Scottish, Irish, Indian, Indonesian or African dance being taught at community centres and dance schools in Australia.

[[Baz Luhrmann]]'s popular 1992 film ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'', starring [[Paul Mercurio]] contributed to an increased interest in dance competition in Australia, and a number of popular dance shows including ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' have featured on television in recent years.

===Music===

====Indigenous music====
[[File:Gurrumul.jpg|thumb|left|[[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu]] is a contemporary indigenous performer who sings in the [[Yolŋu Matha languages]].]]

{{Main|Indigenous Australian music}}

Aboriginal song was an integral part of Aboriginal culture. The most famous feature of their music is the [[didgeridoo]]. This wooden instrument, used amongst the Aboriginal tribes of northern Australia, makes a distinctive droning sound and its use has been adopted by a wide variety of non-Aboriginal performers.

Aboriginal musicians have turned their hand to Western popular musical forms, often to considerable commercial success. Pioneers included [[Lionel Rose]], and [[Jimmy Little]], while notable contemporary examples include [[Archie Roach]], the [[Warumpi Band]], [[NoKTuRNL]] and [[Yothu Yindi]]. [[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu]] (formerly of Yothu Yindi) has attained international success singing contemporary music in English and in the language of the [[Yolngu]]. [[Christine Anu]] is a successful [[Torres Strait Islander]] singer.

[[Australian country music]] has been popular among indigenous communities, with performers including [[Troy Cassar-Daley]] rising to national prominence.

Amongst young Australian aborigines, [[African American|African-American]] and Aboriginal [[hip hop]] music and clothing is popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Folk music and national songs====
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover to Paterson's seminal 1905 collection of bush ballads, entitled ''Old Bush Songs'']]

The early [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] immigrants of the 18th and 19th centuries introduced folk ballad traditions which were adapted to Australian themes: "[[Botany Bay (song)|Bound for Botany Bay]]" tells of the voyage of British convicts to Sydney, "[[The Wild Colonial Boy]]" evokes the spirit of the [[bushranger]]s, and "[[Click Go the Shears]]" speaks of the life of Australian shearers. The lyrics of Australia's best-known folk song, "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", were written by the bush poet [[Banjo Paterson]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/05/05/2235263.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Adopted by Australian soldiers during World War I, this song remains popular and is often sung at sporting events, including the closure of the [[Sydney Olympics]] in 2000, by [[Australian country music]] singer [[Slim Dusty]].

Other well-known singers of Australian folk music include [[Rolf Harris]] (who wrote "[[Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport]]"), [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]], and [[Eric Bogle]] whose 1972 song "[[And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]" is a sorrowful lament to the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. [[Bush dance]] is a traditional style of dance from Australia with strong Celtic roots, and influenced [[country music]]. It is generally accompanied by such instruments as the [[fiddle]], [[accordion]], [[concertina]] and [[percussion instruments]].&lt;ref&gt;http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/Australia/bushdance.html&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known Bush band is [[The Bushwackers (band)|The Bushwackers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebushwackers.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[national anthem]] of Australia is "[[Advance Australia Fair]]":

&lt;div style="font-style:italic;"&gt;
:Australians all let us rejoice,
:For we are young and free;
:We've golden soil and wealth for toil,
:Our home is girt by sea;
:Our land abounds in Nature's gifts
:Of beauty rich and rare;
:In history's page, let every stage
:Advance Australia fair!
:In joyful strains then let us sing,
:Advance Australia fair!
&lt;/div&gt;

Unofficial pop music anthems of Australia include [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]]'s "[[I Still Call Australia Home]]" and [[Men at Work]]'s "[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]".

====Classical music====
[[File:Nellie Melba by Henry Walter Barnett.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Dame [[Nellie Melba]] (1861–1931)]]

The earliest Western musical influences in Australia can be traced back to two distinct sources: the first free settlers who brought with them the European classical music tradition, and the large body of convicts and sailors, who brought the traditional folk music of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  The practicalities of building a colony mean that there is very little music extant from this early period although there are samples of music originating from [[Hobart]] and Sydney that date back to the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Oxford, A Dictionary of Australian Music, Edited by Warren Bebbington, Copyright 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dame Joan Sutherland colour Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|140px|''La Stupenda'' - Dame [[Joan Sutherland]] in 1975]]

[[Nellie Melba]] (1861–1931) travelled to Europe in 1886 to commence her international career as an opera singer. She became among the best known Australians of the period and participated in early gramophone recording and radio broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100464b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of choral societies (c. 1850) and symphony orchestras (c. 1890) led to increased compositional activity, although many Australian classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models. A lot of works leading up to the first part of the 20th century were heavily influenced by the folk music of other countries ([[Percy Grainger]]'s ''[[Country Gardens]]'' of 1918 being a good example of this) and a very conservative British orchestral tradition.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

In the war and post-war eras, as pressure built to assert a national identity in the face of the looming superpower of the United States and the "[[Metropole|motherland]]" Britain, composers looked to their surroundings for inspiration. John Antill&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/artist/antill-john&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Sculthorpe]] began to incorporate elements of Aboriginal music, and [[Richard Meale]] drew influence from [[south-east Asia]] (notably using the harmonic properties of the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] [[Gamelan]], as had Percy Grainger in an earlier generation).&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

By the beginning of the 1960s, Australian classical music erupted with influences, with composers incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from Aboriginal and south-east Asian music and instruments, to American [[jazz]] and [[blues]], to the belated discovery of European atonality and the [[avant-garde]]. Composers like [[Don Banks]], [[Don Kay (composer)|Don Kay]], [[Malcolm Williamson]] and [[Colin Brumby]] epitomise this period.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; In recent times composers including [[Liza Lim]], [[Carl Vine]], [[Georges Lentz]], [[Matthew Hindson]], [[Nigel Westlake]], [[Ross Edwards]], [[Graeme Koehne]], [[Elena Kats-Chernin]], [[Richard Mills (composer)|Richard Mills]] and [[Brett Dean]] have embodied the pinnacle of established [[List of Australian composers|Australian composers]].

Well-known Australian classical performers include: sopranos [[Joan Sutherland|Dame Joan Sutherland]], Dame [[Joan Hammond]], [[Joan Carden]], [[Yvonne Kenny]], [[Sara Macliver]] and [[Emma Matthews]]; pianists [[Roger Woodward]], [[Eileen Joyce]], [[Michael Kieran Harvey]], [[Geoffrey Tozer]], [[Geoffrey Douglas Madge]], [[Leslie Howard (musician)|Leslie Howard]] and [[Ian Munro (pianist)|Ian Munro]]; guitarists [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]] and [[Slava Grigoryan]]; horn player [[Barry Tuckwell]]; oboist [[Diana Doherty]]; violinists [[Richard Tognetti]] and [[Elizabeth Wallfisch]]; cellists [[John Addison (cellist)|John Addison]] and [[David Pereira]]; organist [[Christopher Wrench]]; orchestras like the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]] and the [[Australian Brandenburg Orchestra]]; and conductors Sir [[Bernard Heinze]], Sir [[Charles Mackerras]], [[Richard Bonynge]], [[Simone Young]] and [[Geoffrey Simon]]. Indigenous performers like [[didgeridoo]] player [[William Barton (musician)|William Barton]] and immigrant musicians like Egyptian-born [[oud]] virtuoso [[Joseph Tawadros]] have stimulated interest in their own music traditions and have also collaborated with other musicians and ensembles both in Australia and internationally.

====Pop and rock====

{{Main|Australian rock}}

Australia has produced a large variety of popular music from the internationally renowned work of the [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]], [[INXS]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Cody Simpson]] or [[Kylie Minogue]] to the popular local content of [[John Farnham]] or [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/pop/&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the brightest stars of early Australian [[rock and roll]] was [[Johnny O'Keefe]], who formed a band in 1956; his hit ''Wild One'' made him the first Australian rock'n'roller to reach the national charts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150610b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; While US and British content dominated airwaves and record sales into the 1960s, local successes began to emerge – notably [[The Easybeats]] and the folk-pop group [[The Seekers]] had significant local success and some international recognition, while the bands the [[Bee Gees]] and [[AC/DC]] had their first hits in Australia before going on to international success.

The arrival of the 1961 underground movement into the mainstream in the early 1970s changed Australian music permanently. [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] were far from the first people to write songs in Australia by Australians about Australia, but they were the first ones to make good money doing it. The two best-selling Australian albums made up to that time put Australian music on the map. Within a few years, the novelty had worn off and it became commonplace to hear distinctively Australian lyrics and sounds side-by-side with imports.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s Australian performers continued to do well on the local and international music scenes, for example [[Cold Chisel]], [[INXS]], [[Men at Work]] and [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Natalie Imbruglia]], [[Savage Garden]] and [[Silverchair]]. In the early 21st century, bands such as [[Jet (band)|Jet]], [[Wolfmother]], [[Eskimo Joe]], [[Grinspoon]], [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]], [[The Living End]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Delta Goodrem]] and others were enjoying success internationally.

Domestically, [[John Farnham]] has remained one of Australia's best-known performers, with a career spanning over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnfarnham.info/biography/biography.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126182540/http://www.johnfarnham.info/biography/biography.htm |archivedate=26 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer-songwriter [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] whose music style straddles folk, rock, and country has been described{{By whom|date=October 2010}} as the ''poet laureate'' of Australian music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/cce/default.asp?id%3D15390 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yWGgEmZH?url=http://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/cce/default.asp?id=15390 |archivedate=8 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national expansion of [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] youth radio station [[Triple J]] during the 1990s has increased the profile and availability of home-grown talent to listeners nationwide. Since the mid-1990s a string of successful alternative Australian acts have emerged; artists to achieve both underground (critical) and mainstream (commercial) success include [[You Am I]], [[Grinspoon]], [[Powderfinger]] and [[Jet (band)|Jet]].

====Country music====

Australia has a long tradition of [[country music]], which has developed a style quite distinct from its US counterpart, influenced by Celtic folk ballads and the traditions of Australian bush balladeers like [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Pioneers of popular country music in Australia included [[Tex Morton]] in the 1930s and [[Smoky Dawson]] from the 1940s onward.

[[File:Olivia Newton-John Sydney 2008.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Olivia Newton-John]].]]

[[Slim Dusty]] (1927–2003) was known as the ''King of Australian Country Music''. His successful career spanned almost six decades and his 1957 hit "[[A Pub With No Beer]]" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, the first Australian single to go [[Music recording sales certification|gold]], and the first and only 78 rpm record to be awarded a gold disc.&lt;ref&gt;Dave" Laing, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries "Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer"], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' in the closing ceremony of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]]. Dusty's wife [[Joy McKean]] penned several of his most popular songs.

Other popular performers of Australian country music include: [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] (who wrote the iconic song "[[True Blue (John Williamson song)|True Blue]]"), [[Lee Kernaghan]], [[Kasey Chambers]] and [[Sara Storer]]. In the United States, Australian country music stars including [[Olivia Newton-John]] and [[Keith Urban]] have attained great success.

Country music has also been a particularly popular form of musical expression among the Australian [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples. [[Troy Cassar-Daley]] is among Australia's successful indigenous performers.

The [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]] is an annual country music festival held in [[Tamworth, New South Wales]]. It celebrates the culture and heritage of [[Australian country music]]. During the festival the [[Country Music Association of Australia]] holds the [[Country Music Awards of Australia]] ceremony awarding the [[Golden Guitar]] trophies.

===Theatre===
{{Main|Theatre in Australia}}

The ceremonial dances of [[indigenous Australians]] which recount the stories of the [[Dreamtime]], comprise theatrical aspects and have been performed since time immemorial during the 40–60,000 year Aboriginal occupation of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/ceremony/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120165318/http://cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/ceremony/ |archivedate=20 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; European traditions came to Australia with the [[First Fleet]] in 1788, with the first production being performed in 1789 by convicts.&lt;ref name="olioweb.me.uk"&gt;http://www.olioweb.me.uk/plays/&lt;/ref&gt; Two centuries later, the extraordinary circumstances of the foundations of Australian theatre were recounted in ''Our Country's Good'' by [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]]: the participants were prisoners watched by sadistic guards and the leading lady was under threat of the death penalty.&lt;ref name="olioweb.me.uk"/&gt;

A theatre was built on the present site of Melbourne's [[Princess Theatre, Melbourne|Princess Theatre]] in 1854. The present building now hosts major international productions as well as live performance events such as the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marrinertheatres.com.au/venue_princess.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330184333/http://www.marrinertheatres.com.au/venue_princess.jsp |archivedate=30 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Melbourne Athenaeum]] was built during this period and later became Australia's first cinema, screening ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', the world's first feature film in 1906. [[Mark Twain]], [[Nellie Melba]], [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Barry Humphries]] have all performed on this historic stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourneathenaeum.org.au/content/view/20/37/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217184130/http://www.melbourneathenaeum.org.au/content/view/20/37/ |archivedate=17 February 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Queen's Theatre, Adelaide]] opened with [[Shakespeare]] in 1841 and is today the oldest theatre on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.sa.gov.au/queens/about.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221043342/http://history.sa.gov.au/queens/about.htm |archivedate=21 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Federation in 1901, theatre productions evidenced the new sense of national identity. ''On Our Selection'' (1912) by [[Steele Rudd]], told of the adventures of a pioneer farming family and became immensely popular. Sydney's grand [[Capitol Theatre, Sydney|Capitol Theatre]] opened in 1928 and after restoration remains one of the nation's finest auditoriums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitoltheatre.com.au/explore.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210113100/http://www.capitoltheatre.com.au/explore.htm |archivedate=10 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' by [[Ray Lawler]] portrayed resolutely Australian characters and went on to international acclaim. That same year, young Melbourne artist [[Barry Humphries]] performed as [[Edna Everage]] for the first time at [[Melbourne University]]'s Union Theatre. Humphries left for London in his early 20s and enjoyed success on stage, including in [[Lionel Bart]]'s musical, [[Oliver!]]. His satirical stage creations – notably Dame Edna and later [[Les Patterson]] –– became Australian cultural icons. Humphries also achieved success in the USA with tours on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and television appearances and has been honoured in Australia and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6757531.stm | work=BBC News | title=The man behind Dame Edna Everage | date=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] was created in Sydney in 1958. This institute has since produced a list of famous alumni including [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Baz Luhrmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nida.edu.au/default.aspx?FolderID%3D15 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113103327/http://www.nida.edu.au/default.aspx?FolderID=15 |archivedate=13 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the [[Sydney Opera House]], which had been based on a design by [[Jørn Utzon]], was officially opened.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/166&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opera Australia]] made its home in the building and its reputation was enhanced by the presence of the diva [[Joan Sutherland]].

The [[Sydney Theatre Company]] was founded 1978 becoming one of Australia's foremost theatre companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/about&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bell Shakespeare Company]] was created in 1990.

The Legend of The Wild One]]'').

In ''The One Day of the Year'', [[Alan Seymour]] studied the paradoxical nature of the [[ANZAC Day]] commemoration by Australians of the defeat of the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]. ''Ngapartji Ngapartji'', by [[Scott Rankin]] and [[Trevor Jamieson]], recounts the story of the effects on the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] people of nuclear testing in the Western Desert during the [[Cold War]].

'''Audiovisual''' ('''AV''') means possessing  both a [[sound]] and a [[visual]] component, such as [[slide-tape]] presentations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barman|first=Charles R.|title=Slide-Tape Presentations on a Classroom Budget|jstor=4447864|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, church services and live theater productions.

Audiovisual service providers frequently offer web streaming, video conferencing and live broadcast services.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg 2014, Audiovisual Services&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer-based audiovisual equipment is often used in education, with many schools and universities installing projection equipment and using interactive whiteboard technology.

Another audiovisual expression is the visual presentation of sound ([[visual music]]).

==Residential audiovisual==
Generally, residential audiovisual encompasses in-ceiling speakers, flat panel TVs, projectors and projector screens. This could include lighting, blinds, cinema rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Quin 2014, Universal Home Theatre&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial audiovisual==
The '''professional audiovisual industry''' is a multibillion-dollar industry, comprising the manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, consultants, programmers, presentations professionals and technology managers of audiovisual products and services.

Commercial audiovisual can sometimes be a very lengthy process to get it right. Boardroom audio visual can be installed for a number of reasons, but usually it is because the executives of the organization/business wants to have meetings with colleagues/customers/suppliers around the world. When creating an array of boardrooms for customers it has been seen that you have to be able to balance the pattern from the audio and microphone so there is no interruption in the sound quality for the individual/s listening in.&lt;ref&gt;Quin 2014, Universal Home Theatre&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of audiovisual [[communication technology|communications technologies]], including sound, video, lighting, display and projection systems, is evident in every sector of society: in business, education, government, the military, healthcare, retail environments, worship, sports and entertainment, hospitality, restaurants, and museums. The application of audiovisual systems is found in collaborative conferencing (which includes video-conferencing, audio-conferencing, web-conferencing and data-conferencing); presentation rooms, auditoriums, and lecture halls; command and control centers; [[digital signage]], and more. Concerts and corporate events are among the most obvious venues where audiovisual equipment is used in a staged environment. Providers of this type of service are known as rental and staging companies, although they may also be served by an in-house technology team (e.g., in a hotel or conference center).

According to a 2006 market forecast study by [[InfoComm International]], a leading trade association representing the audiovisual industry, 2006 was the fourth consecutive year that significant growth was projected for the industry.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} Revenue for surveyed North American companies was expected to grow by 40% in 2006, and by 10.7% for European audiovisual companies. The single biggest factor for this increase is the increased demand for networked audiovisual products due to the integration of audiovisual and IT technology. The two leading markets for AV equipment in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] continue to be business/IT and education, especially as conference room technologies become more advanced.

==Audiovisual education==
{{main article|Audiovisual education}}
Audiovisual education is instruction where particular attention is paid to the audio and visual presentation of the material, with the goal of improving comprehension and retention.

'''Bessie Bamber''' was a British artist from [[Birkenhead]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Knowles]] on [[BBC Television]] [[Antiques Roadshow]]{{Failed verification|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was active between 1900 and 1910. It is not known if Bamber was her married name or maiden name.

Bessie Bamber worked in oils and specialised in painting cats, kittens and occasionally puppies. She usually painted on porcelain or opaline glass, and sometimes on a polished mahogany panel. She preferred to work using stuffed animals rather than live ones. There is no record of her exhibiting her paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baronfineart.com/Gallery/bessie_bamber.htm Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703182007/http://www.baronfineart.com/Gallery/bessie_bamber.htm |date=July 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A picture of three kittens with a pile of books was sold for £2,468 by [[Bonhams]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/wspd_cgi.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&amp;screen=lotdetails&amp;iSaleItemNo=1481283&amp;iSaleNo=11131&amp;sServer=http://images1.bonhams.com/&amp;sPath=2004-06/30/4154098-1-1.jpg Three kittens with a pile of books]{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403011139/http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/wspd_cgi.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=EUR&amp;screen=lotdetails&amp;iSaleItemNo=1481283&amp;iSaleNo=11131&amp;sServer=http%3A%2F%2Fimages1.bonhams.com%2F&amp;sPath=2004-06%2F30%2F4154098-1-1.jpg |date=April 3, 2005  }} (Bonhams sale report 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Created in 1967, the Stockholm '''''Big Electric Chair''''' is part of a series of works by [[Andy Warhol]] depicting an [[electric chair]]. Death by electrocution was a controversial subject in [[New York City]], where the artist lived and worked, especially after the last two executions at [[Sing Sing]] Correctional Facility in 1963. Warhol obtained a photograph of the empty execution chamber, which became the basis for this series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/251&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Japanese|美人|date=September 2014}}

[[File:Kaigetsudo Ando Yasunori - Bijin.jpg|thumb|right|A ''bijinga'' painting of a courtesan, by [[Kaigetsudō Ando]], c. 1700 - 1720]]

{{nihongo|'''''Bijin'''''|美人}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term which literally means "a beautiful person" and is synonymous with {{nihongo|'''bijyo'''|美女|extra="beautiful woman"}}. Girls are usually called {{nihongo|'''bishōjo'''|美少女}}, while men are {{nihongo|'''bidanshi'''|美男子}} and boys are {{nihongo|'''bishōnen'''|美少年}}. The term originally derives from Chinese word 美人, the word 美人 is used widely in several Asian countries including [[China]], [[South Korea]], [[North Korea]], and [[Vietnam]].

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Bijin - Eizan.jpg|thumb|317x317px|Bijin woodblock print by Kikukawa Eizan, 19th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

==Meaning==

In practice the term ''bijin'' means "beautiful woman" because the first [[kanji]] character, ''bi'' (美), has a [[feminine]] connotation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E#Translingual  Translation of kanji character 美]&lt;/ref&gt; Bijin can also be translated as "a beauty"; in a modern and informal context it means "a doll". People who are called a bijin are usually beautiful, charming and harmonious women, who wear pretty clothes.

In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], 美人 ([[Pinyin]]: ''měirén'') also means "a beautiful woman".&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E%E4%BA%BA#Mandarin Translation of 美人 in Mandarin Chinese]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mandarin Chinese, in [[Korean language]], 美人 ({{ko-hhrm|미인||Miin}}) means "a beautiful woman".

==In Japanese art==
{{Main article|Bijin-ga}}

Pictures of bijin in [[Japanese art]] are called ''bijin-ga''. Bijin-ga is described as a genre of ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' paintings. Some of the greatest bijinga artists are [[Utamaro]], [[Suzuki Harunobu]] and [[Torii Kiyonaga]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=izePWrWvE-MC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=bijin+ga+OR+bijinga+OR+Akita&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;redir_esc=y Tadashi Kobayashi, ''Utamaro: Portraits from the Floating World'', pages 89-92]&lt;/ref&gt; Until the beginning of the 20th century, ''bijin-ga'' were very popular.

==Famous bijin ==
[[Akita, Akita|Akita]], located on [[Honshu]], in northern [[Japan]], is famous for its "''bijin'' of Akita"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OBgzo4UZgO8C&amp;pg=PA379&amp;dq=bijin+ga+OR+bijinga+OR+Akita&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES ''Le Petit Futé'' : Les ''bijin'' d'Akita, page 379 (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; which are characterized by their round face, clear skin&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gthp7ZCcYPwC&amp;pg=PA543&amp;vq=Akita+bijin&amp;dq=bijin+fukuoka&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Akita%20bijin&amp;f=false Chris Rowthorn, Ray Bartlett, Andrew Bender, Michael Clark, Matthew D. Firestone, Wendy Yanagihara, ''Lonely Planet'', ''Japan'', page 543]&lt;/ref&gt; and high-pitched voice. [[Ono no Komachi]], one of the [[Thirty-six Immortals of Poetry]], was a beauty from Akita.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hI6Ity0NPh4C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=bijin+Akita+%22ono+no+komachi+%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#v=onepage&amp;q=bijin%20Akita%20%22ono%20no%20komachi%20%22&amp;f=false ''The Woman Without a Hole - &amp; Other Risky Themes from Old Japanese'', page 173]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fukuoka]], the largest city of [[Kyushu]] island in southern Japan, is also known for a large population of bijins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gthp7ZCcYPwC&amp;pg=PA666&amp;dq=bijin+fukuoka&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#v=onepage&amp;q=bijin%20fukuoka&amp;f=false Chris Rowthorn, Ray Bartlett, Andrew Bender, Michael Clark, Matthew D. Firestone, Wendy Yanagihara, ''Lonely Planet'', ''Japan'', page 666]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Utamaro's favourite models have remained famous as bijin; for example [[Naniwaya Okita]] ([[:fr:Naniwaya Okita|fr]]), a courtesan [[Hanaōgi]] ([[:fr:Hanaōgi|fr]]), [[Tomimoto Toyohina]] ([[:fr:Tomimoto Toyohina|fr]]) and Takashima Ohisa.&lt;ref&gt;''Images du Monde Flottant - Peintures et estampes japonaises XVIIe - XVIIIe siècles'', pages 300-305 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Average Beauty Theory==
Judith Langlois and Lori Roggman's cross-cultural study on beauty used composite faces suggests that attractive faces are those that represent the central tendency or average. Composite images were created by layering digital photographs of faces. Each image was smoothed, meaning that each pixel in the matrix was adjusted to the average value of the pixels immediately surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langlois|first1=Judith H.|last2=Roggman|first2=Lori A.|title=Attractive Faces Are Only Average|journal=Psychological Science|date=March 1, 1990|volume=1|issue=2|pages=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newsquest Media Group. Retrieved 2008-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The harnessing of [[wave energy]], and the sculpting of the concrete and metals, is said to produce a unique interpretation of Blackpool's natural and man-made environments. 

The instrument is played by the sea at high tide through eight pipes attached to the [[sea wall]]. These are connected under the [[promenade]] to 18 organ pipes within the sculpture. The swell of seawater at high tide pushes air up the sea-wall pipes and causes the organ pipes to sound. The best time to hear the ''High Tide Organ'' is two to three hours before or after high tide. On very calm days the organ is silent for part of its cycle. The pitches of the pipes are based on the [[harmonic]] series in [[B-flat major|B flat]].

The ''High Tide Organ'' is one of a small group of musical instruments that operate without further human intervention, among which the [[aeolian harp]] and the [[wind chime]] are the most notable.

{{short description|Two paintings (1881, 1882) by Auguste Renoir}}
{{EngvarB|date=September 2017}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Renoir, Baigneuse Blonde, 1882 PA.jpg|thumb|260px|Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1882, ''La Baigneuse blonde'', oil on canvas, 90 x 63 cm, Pinacoteca Agnelli, Turin]]
[[Auguste Renoir]] painted two very similar versions of '''''Blonde Bather''''' ('''''La baigneuse blonde''''') in 1881 and 1882 – both are now in private collections but on public display. The model was [[Aline Charigot]], later to become Renoir's wife. Influenced by seeing renaissance painting (particularly [[Raphael]]'s frescoes) in Italy in 1881, these pictures showed a marked change of style from Renoir's previous work. Some commentators consider these are works of great beauty, others that they are vulgar. There has been criticism of the conservation work performed on the 1881 painting.

==Context==
Renoir was forty and an established artist when he visited Italy in autumn 1881. Apart from a visit to [[Algiers]] earlier in the year he had not been outside  [[metropolitan France]] and indeed he had never been far from Paris. [[Ambroise Vollard]], who collected his art, reported that Renoir particularly admired the works he saw by [[Titian]] and [[Raphael]] (including ''[[Madonna della seggiola]]'' and ''[[The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple]]'') as well as [[Roman art|Pompeiian]] and [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] frescoes. More practically, in letters home Renoir wrote that he appreciated the beautiful scenery and light, and he hoped to complete many paintings which would attract good prices. He had become dissatisfied with his figure painting (which lived awkwardly beside his impressionist landscapes) and he was pleased to leave Paris where he felt obliged to do society portraits. His visit was very productive and he shipped back to Paris several crates of paintings.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Barbara Ehrlich|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=December 1969|publisher=College Art Association|volume=51|issue=4|pages=333–351|doi=10.2307/3048651|jstor=3048651|title=Renoir's Trip to Italy}}
 Note: White a major biographer of Renoir.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for ''Blonde Bather'' was his girlfriend, favourite model, and future wife [[Aline Charigot]] who was with him for part of his trip. Charigot had earlier in 1881 been included in Renoir's ''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party|Le déjeuner des canotiers]]'' (''Luncheon of the Boating Party'') where she is the woman with the little dog, on the left. She appeared in many 
of his paintings – in 1882 ''[[Dance in the Country|Danse à la campagne]]'' (''Dance in the Country'').{{refn|group=note|Charigot was born in [[Essoyes]] in 1859 and died in 1915. The couple had three sons: [[Pierre Renoir|Pierre]] (born 1885), [[Jean Renoir|Jean]] (born 1894) and Claude (born 1901).&lt;ref name=lees /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millefonti|first1=Nice|title=La baigneuse blonde|url=http://www.arte.it/guida-arte/torino/da-vedere/opera/la-baigneuse-blonde-5753|website=www.arte.it|accessdate=16 September 2017|language=it|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316072356/http://www.arte.it/guida-arte/torino/da-vedere/opera/la-baigneuse-blonde-5753|archivedate=16 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=agnelli /&gt;

===Description===
The painting, now owned (and displayed) by the [[Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute]] ("The Clark") in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], is oil on canvas {{convert|81.6|x|65.4|cm}} and Renoir explained that the picture was painted on board a boat in the [[Bay of Naples]]. On his return to Paris Renoir sold or gave the painting to Henri Vever, a modern art collector, and signed the canvas adding a dedication to Vever.&lt;ref name="lees"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lees|editor1-first=Sarah|title=Nineteenth-century European Paintings at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Volume two|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300179651|url=http://media.clarkart.edu/1955.609_EuroCat.pdf|chapter=Blonde Bather 1881|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913125525/http://media.clarkart.edu/1955.609_EuroCat.pdf|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Renoir's claim, the scene is not as from a boat. The figure appears to be seated beside the shore – behind her back there seems to be grass. However, the background has been altered after the original painting had been done.&lt;ref name=lees /&gt;

In 1926 the American art collector [[Robert Sterling Clark|Sterling Clark]] purchased the painting after some uncertainty. His wife [[Francine Clark|Francine]] thought the work was a marvel; Clark thought that he had never seen finer painting in terms of colour but it might become difficult to live with. He felt the price was excessive at $100,000 thinking it would only fetch $60,000 at auction.&lt;ref name=lees /&gt; White describes the appearance of the model as "rotund".&lt;ref name=white /&gt;

===Assessments===
Renoir's biographer, Barbara White, considers 1881 marks a significant change of style for Renoir's nudes – a new style he was to perpetuate – "A new classical impressionism inspired by the Italian frescoes ... a formal timeless view of a sober and sensuous figure".&lt;ref name=white /&gt; Renoir's friends in Paris also regarded it as a distinct change of style – the figure's contours are soft and, apart from the wedding ring, there are no signs of modernity. Renoir wrote "So, by studying out of doors I have ended up by seeing only the broad harmonies without any longer preoccupying myself with the small details that dim the sunlight rather than illuminating it."&lt;ref name=lees /&gt; He had been influenced by Raphael's frescoes at [[Villa Farnesina]] such as [[Galatea (Raphael)|Triumph of Galatea]] and so, writing from Rome, he said he had come to admire grandeur and simplicity. According to White he achieved these qualities for the first time in this painting.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;  The Clark art gallery says the painting "gives the nude a monumental presence that suggests a timeless image of womanhood".&lt;ref name=clarkart&gt;{{cite web|title=Clark Art - Blonde Bather|url=http://www.clarkart.edu/Collection/6521|website=www.clarkart.edu|publisher=The Clark Art Institute|accessdate=13 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615000029/http://www.clarkart.edu/Collection/6521|archivedate=15 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
Sterling Clark regarded Renoir of one of the greatest ever painters and he considered that his very best work was done around 1881. Clark was antipathetic to art restoration – in his will he prohibited any restoration of his bequests. On his death in 1956 most of his Renoirs were pictured in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in probably a completely unrestored condition. On the occasion of a 2012 [[Royal Academy]] exhibition ''From Paris a Taste for Impressionism'' Michael Daley took the opportunity to compare the ''Life'' photographs, one taken of ''Blonde Bather'' in 1996, and one in the exhibition catalogue, which show progressively that the contrast in the background has weakened and a halo effect has appeared around the body. Daley considers this could not be due to photographic variation but rather that the painting (and the exhibited paintings generally) have been over-cleaned at least twice since 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daley|first1=Michael|title=Reviews: Taking Renoir, Sterling and Francine Clark to the Cleaners|url=http://artwatch.org.uk/reviews-taking-renoir-sterling-and-francine-clark-to-the-cleaners/|website=ArtWatch UK online|accessdate=12 September 2017|date=2 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029160320/http://artwatch.org.uk/reviews-taking-renoir-sterling-and-francine-clark-to-the-cleaners/|archivedate=29 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Sewell]] made the same point referring to The Clark paintings generally: "Many of the paintings in the exhibition have been left a little raw by their conservators’ activities with Brillo pad and wire brush."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sewell|first1=Brian|authorlink1=Brian Sewell|title=Brian Sewell on Paintings from The Clark at the Royal Academy|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/exhibitions/brian-sewell-on-paintings-from-the-clark-at-the-royal-academy-7912351.html|work=Evening Standard|date=5 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229174355/http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/exhibitions/brian-sewell-on-paintings-from-the-clark-at-the-royal-academy-7912351.html|archivedate=29 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Lucie-Smith]] wrote of Kenneth Clark in 2014: "He also once owned ... a large icing-sugar sweet Renoir nude from the early 1880s, now in the ''Pinacoteca Agnelli'' in Turin. This flamboyantly vulgar object would undoubtedly excite new-rich billionaire collectors if it appeared today in a [[Sotheby's]] or [[Christie's]] auction. Clark’s protégé [[Victor Pasmore]] said the Renoir nude set his teeth on edge, and painted a hostile paraphrase to prove it. Clark was sporting enough to buy it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucie-Smith|first1=Edward|title=Kenneth Clark at Tate Britain: the great panjandrum|journal=The Jackdaw|date=2014|url=http://www.thejackdaw.co.uk/?p=1376|issn=1474-3914|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222041335/http://www.thejackdaw.co.uk/?p=1376|archivedate=22 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenneth Clark – Looking for Civilisation – Exhibition at Tate Britain|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/kenneth-clark-looking-civilisation|website=Tate|publisher=Tate Britain|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106185530/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/kenneth-clark-looking-civilisation|archivedate=6 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Dallas Museum of Art calls this version "This superb second painting".&lt;ref name=dmabather /&gt;

There exists a red chalk study {{convert|84.5|x|65.5|cm|sigfig=3}} on wove tissue paper mounted on board, owned by the [[Dallas Museum of Art]]. The museum regards it as "among the most important surviving drawings by Renoir" and say it relates to the 1881 painting, without question. It was first drawn in pencil and then developed in chalk. Renoir sold it to [[Ambroise Vollard]], his art dealer. The drawing was probably made from life before commencing the 1881 oil painting but there is no sign that it was used to transfer an initial outline to the canvas.&lt;ref name="dmabather" /&gt;

Renoir also made an oil study, {{convert|6.33|x|4.5|in|cm|sigfig=3|order=flip}}, for the 1881 painting.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;

The '''Castle of Alva''' ({{lang-pt|Castelo de Alva}}) is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[castle]] located in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Viade de Baixo e Fervidelas]], in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Freixo de Espada à Cinta]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Bragança District|district of Bragança]].

==History==
As part of the [[Kingdom of León|Leonese]] invasion, in June 1212, the first reference to the castle between Freixo de Espada à Cinta and Urros.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=477 |title=Castelo de Alva (IPA.00000477/PT010404060006) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Ernesto |last=Jana |first2=Marisa |last2=Costa |year=2001 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152317/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=477 |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1236 it was occupied by Leonese forces with the consent of its habitants.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; Shortly after, King D. [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]] donated the place to the municipality of Freixo "como sua aldeia" (''with its village''), ordering the expulsion of the residents who lived there during the Leonese occupation.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; At the time of the 1258 ''Inquirições'' (''Inquiries'') indicated that King Sancho had transferred the title to Freixo.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

During the reign of King D. [[Denis of Portugal|Dinis]], the municipality of Alva requested that King ''expand its settlement of 400 residents''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; But, by 1311, in a letter, the King refused the request, owing to opposition from the municipality of Freixo.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Between 1527 and 1532, the village of Alva was not listed in the ''Numeramento'', suggesting that the settlement no longer existed by the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

During the 17th century, António Coelho Gasco, external judge and captain-major of the town of Freixo, described the state of abandonment that the structure, which he referred to as the ''"Antiquario"'' (''antiquary''), during a presentation on his visit to the Archbishop of Braga, D. Rodrigo da Cunha.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; By the end of the same century, Father Carvalho da Costa, referring to the limits of Poiares in the ''Corografia Portuguesa'', included a small list of landmarks; this included the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Alva and ''"alongside it the ruined Castle with its walls, where in the past, was founded the Town of Alva"'', remembering that D. Sancho II had deprived the village of its residents.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Continuing, that he:
:''"gave the village to Freixo and later, depopulated and ruined it, remaining only the boat, that navigated the river, with the name of Alva, and the referred Hermitage of Santa Maria, where is annexed a simple benefit of the Royal Patronage"''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

==Architecture==
The castle is situated in an area of abundant archaeological vestiges; the parish of Poiares is located between the Serra do Marão and Serra de Avões, along the Couro and Douro Rivers in a rural area, situated on a {{convert|700|m|ft}} hilltop dominating the Douro valley.&lt;ref name="IGESPAR"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/72908 |title=Castelo de Alva |publisher=IGESPAR – Instituto de Gestão do Património Arquitectónico e Arqueológico (Portuguese Institute of Architectural and  Archaeological Heritage) |year=2013 |first=A. |last=Martin |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actually location is covered in vegetation and olive orchards.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Dau al Set''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈdaw əl ˈsɛt}}), the first post-[[World War II]] artistic movement in [[Catalonia]], was founded in [[Barcelona]] in September 1948 by poet [[Joan Brossa]].  The movement, best known for translating the conscious and unconscious mind into art, was heavily influenced by both the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Dada]]ist movements. In [[Catalan language|Catalan]] Dau al Set means "the seventh face of the dice", which expresses the movement's rupturist character.

== History ==
Dau al Set first began as an [[avant-garde]] artistic collective led by [[Joan Brossa]], a Catalan poet, in  September 1948. [[Joan Brossa]] established the group in response to the period’s conservative reigning government, which gained power after the [[Spanish Civil War]] known as the "[[:es:Guerra Civil Española|Guerra Civil]]". Under the new [[Fascism|fascist]] regime, [[Francisco Franco]]  radically changed many areas of the previous culture. One such example was the Spanish art community as seen in [[art and culture in Francoist Spain]]. During this time counterculture movements in Catalonia and Spain in general came to an abrupt halt.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/revista-dau-al-set-modest-cuixart-2016|title=Revista Dau al Set. Modest Cuixart|website=www.macba.cat|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such artistic groups were replaced with [[Art and culture in Francoist Spain|Nationalist Fascist Art]], which often functioned as a means for government endorsement and propaganda. In an attempt to revive the avant-garde scene in Spain Dau al Set was formed.

In 1949, with help from [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]]'s private printing press, Dau al Set published its first self-entitled magazine journal. The majority of the publication was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a language prohibited under the [[Francoist Spain|Franco Regime]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cirlot|first=Lourdes|date=December 2008|title=El grupo Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dau al Set typically ran a print between one hundred and two hundred copies,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; consisting of four to twelve pages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco Lahoz|first=Amado|date=December 2008|title=Sumario de la revista Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine journal was delivered throughout Barcelona to those with subscriptions and served a niche population at the time. The format of the magazine was 22.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 18.7&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[broadsheet]] style and never bound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These publications continued on a regular basis until the end of 1951 at which point Dau al Set began to dissolve.

In 1952, Dau al Set founding member [[Antoni Tàpies]] left the group to promote his own independent work in the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Informalism|Informal]] art styles. The following year [[Joan Ponç]] left to Brazil to continue to paint and spread his unique style. And one year later [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixcart]] left the group as well. During this time from 1953 till 1956 Dau al Set continued to be created and published by Joan-Josep Tharrats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the final years the magazine decreased from an issue a month to an issue every season to then two issues a year. The final issue was created and distributed in 1956.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Style ==
Initially, Dau al Set began as an offshoot of [[Surrealism]], but slowly grew into a distinct style with many existing components. One such component began with the incorporation of the surrealist world of dreams, where in Dau al Set expands upon by combing scientific and philosophical articles with magical undertones derived from [[Joan Brossa|Joan Brossa's]] personalized style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lletra.uoc.edu/ca/revista/dau-al-set-1948-1956/detall|title=Dau al Set (1948-1956) - lletrA - Literatura catalana a internet|last=Catalunya|first=Universitat Oberta de|website=lletra.uoc.edu|language=ca|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of magical elements pervaded throughout the entire movement to showcase an esoteric world of inner exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elcultural.com/revista/arte/Dau-al-set/14686|title=Dau al set|website=www.elcultural.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While magic was seen consistently the different members each contributed a unique style to Dau al Set. One of the most drastic was the contributions from [[Joan Ponç]]. Ponç's art frequently contained demonic images actualized with a series of different monsters throughout the work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixart's]] work often contained images of fantasy influenced by [[German Expressionism|German expressionism]] and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, [[Antoni Tàpies|Antoni Tápies]] often emulated the style of [[Paul Klee]] with obscure images surrounded by a dark atmosphere and phosphorescent lighting. With the base of magical elements these three unique techniques joined together to create the style seen in the Dau al Set movement.

== Influences ==
Dau al Set  was heavily influenced by two movements before its creation, those two being [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]].  Dadaism was a European art movement in the early 20th century which focused on the avant-garde. This style was meant to fight against the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] in society with the belief that their reason and logic were the cause of war. With an anti-reason and anti-logic sentiment most of the works of art often contained elements of chaos and irrationality. Dadaist art also utilized the following techniques of [[cubism]], [[collage]]s, [[cut-up technique]], [[photomontage]]s, and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] which can be seen in Dau al Set's work. From this movement spawned the pre-war avant-garde which was the community Dau al Set were trying to revive. Some influential artists on Dau al Set from this movement are [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Max Ernst]].

Another influence on Dau al Set was [[Surrealism]], a cultural movement greatly influenced by Dadaism, which began in the 1920s. This style was often considered a portrayal of the dream world; a reality which existed right below everyday life. It also had a large political focus which was often used to contradict a given community's social norms often imposed by the bourgeois. Some artists from this movement that influenced Dau al Set were [[Joan Miró]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Josep Vicenç Foix]], and [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other methods that were influenced was the idea of magical aspects that were often seen in the dream world surrealism created. However, in Dau al Set these magical aspects were developed and expounded upon.

== Members ==
There were six founding members of Dau al Set including a poet [[Joan Brossa]], a philosopher [[Arnau Puig]], three artists [[Joan Ponç]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], and [[Modest Cuixart]], as well as a dual painter and editor [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]].

Over the years Dau al Set ran there were occasional contributors, such as [[Juan Eduardo Cirlot]], [[Antonio Saura]], [[Enrique Tábara]], and [[Manolo Millares]]. Their contributions came often in the form of writings which helped to continued to establish Dau al Set as an intellectual piece of work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Dau al Set has had a lasting impact throughout history the most notable being the continuation of the avant-garde in Spain throughout a repressive regime. Moreover, Dau al Set contributed to the creation of the [[Informalism|Informalist]] movement seen in Spain during the fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arteespana.com/grupodaualset.htm|title=Grupo Dau al Set|website=www.arteespana.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the magical and fantasy elements of Dau al Set was seen to later emerge again in Spain in the eighties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This group also stood as a large influence for other artistic movements in Spain such as the [[Grup d'Elx|Grup d’Elx]] and El Paso, with important artists such as [[Joan Castejón]], [[Eusebio Sempere]] or [[Manolo Millares]]. Additionally, each of the members made their own impacts after the movement was dissolved. Most notably is [[Antoni Tàpies]] who continued with his style based heavily in surrealism and later became a notable artist for his work in Abstract art.

'''''Everybody's Magazine''''' was an American magazine published from 1899 to 1929.&lt;ref name="spar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Everybody's Magazine|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/USAeverybodys.htm|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was headquartered in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=William Hard|title=Unemployment as a Coming Issue|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/alablegr2&amp;div=14&amp;id=&amp;page=|work=Hein Online|accessdate=19 February 2016|date=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The magazine was founded by [[Philadelphia]] merchant [[John Wanamaker]] in 1899, though he had little role in its actual operations.&lt;ref name="mott1"&gt;[[Frank Luther Mott|Mott, Frank Luther]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ERGJfgsppfgC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sketches of 21 Magazines: 1905-1930], p. 72-87 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Initially, the magazine published a combination of non-fiction articles and new fiction stories.  By 1926, the magazine had become a [[pulp fiction magazine]] and in 1929 it merged with ''[[Romance (magazine)|Romance magazine]].

In 1903, it had a circulation of 150,000, and Wanamaker sold the magazine for $75,000 to a group headed by [[Erman Jesse Ridgway]].  A series of muckraking articles called "Frenzied Finance" in 1904 boosted circulation to well over 500,000, and it stayed above the half million mark for many years.  During America's involvement in World War I, circulation declined below 300,000.  By the late 1920s, it had declined to about 50,000.&lt;ref name="mott1"/&gt;

Beginning in 1915, the magazine began referring to itself simply as ''Everybody's''.

Writers who appeared in ''Everybody's Magazine'' included [[Jack London]], [[Talbot Mundy]], [[Victor Rousseau Emanuel|Victor Rousseau]], [[O. Henry]], [[A. A. Milne]] (Milne's novel ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' was serialised in the magazine from August to December 1921 as ''The Red House Murder'')&lt;ref&gt;Ed Hulse, ''The Blood 'n' Thunder Guide to Collecting Pulps''. Murania Press, 2009. {{ISBN|0-9795955-0-9}}  (pp. 168-169)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Pendexter]], [[Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd]], [[Raoul Whitfield]] and [[Dornford Yates]].

The last issue of ''Everybody's Magazine'' was published in March 1929.&lt;ref name="spar"/&gt;

'''''Future Anterior''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[University of Minnesota Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pillars of Preservation |url=http://www.traditionalbuildingportfolio.com/profiles/commercial/pillars.html |publisher=Traditional Building Portfolio |accessdate=1 February 2016 |author=Kim A. O'Connell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Jorge Otero-Pailos]] ([[Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation]]).

==History==
The journal was established in 2004 by Jorge Otero-Pailos and is dedicated to the "critical examination of historic preservation."&lt;ref&gt;Liz Holmes, "Alumnus Starts Preservation Journal," in Cornell College of Architecture, Art and Planning Newsletter (Fall 2004): 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Future Anterior |url=https://www.upress.umn.edu/journal-division/journals/future-anterior |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's title is a reference to the grammatical tense, [[Future perfect|futur antérieur]], and is an allusion to the field of historic preservation as "concerned both with what has not yet happened (future) and what has already happened (anterior)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Screen/Print 27: Future Anterior, a Champion of Historic Preservation |url=http://archinect.com/features/article/115813747/screen-print-27-future-anterior-a-champion-of-historic-preservation |publisher=Archinect |accessdate=1 February 2016 |author=Amelia Taylor-Hochberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
In addition to its primary focus on [[historic preservation]] history, theory, and criticism, it also includes essays on various topics including "art, philosophy, law, geography, archeology, [[Urban planning|planning]], [[materials science]], cultural anthropology, and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Columbia GSAPP Future Anterior |url=http://www.arch.columbia.edu/programs/historic-preservation/future-anterior |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each issue contains articles, an exhibition review, a feature piece, a book review, and an artist intervention.

==Impact==
At its establishment, Otero-Pailos said that the journal "signals the maturation of the field of preservation and a shift…towards an active involvement in the understanding and creative transformation of human environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ConsDistList New Journal Future Anterior |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/2004/0587.html |publisher=Conservation Online |author=Judy Jacob |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Future Anterior'' also provides a forum for discussion of the field of preservation and architecture and influenced the 2006-2007 student architect competition, ''Preservation as Provocation: Re-designing [[Saarinen]]'s [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]]'' in Michigan, that "called on students to address a complex set of criteria that roughly broke down as engagement, program, time, and technology, prompted by the theory of historic provocation suggested by Otero-Pailos's writings in the journal that he edits, Future Anterior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Preservation as Provocation |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1531-314X.2007.00151.x/full |journal=[[Journal of Architectural Education]] |author=Sharon Haar |volume=61 |issue=2 |pp=60–65 |date=November 2007 |subscription=yes|doi=10.1111/j.1531-314X.2007.00151.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal is abstracted and indexed in the [[Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index]],&lt;ref name=ISI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ip-science.thomsonreuters.com/mjl/ |title=Master Journal List |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |work=Intellectual Property &amp; Science |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Current Contents]]/Arts &amp; Humanities,&lt;ref name=ISI/&gt; and [[Scopus]].&lt;ref name=Scopus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/scopus/content-overview |title=Content overview |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |work=Scopus |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6082">The '''Gold Blend couple''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television advertising]] campaign for [[Nescafé]] Gold Blend [[instant coffee]]. The original campaign ran for twelve 45-second instalments between [[1987 in television|1987]] and [[1993 in television|1993]]. It starred [[Anthony Head]] and [[Sharon Maughan]] as Tony and Sharon, a couple who begin a slow-burning romance over a cup of the advertised coffee. The ads were in a [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] format, with each ad ending on a [[cliffhanger]]. The commercials were extremely popular, and as time went on, the appearance of a new instalment would merit considerable media attention. The ads were developed by [[McCann Erickson]]. They are one of the most famous examples of serialized advertising.

Beginning in 1990, new versions of the ads were produced for the [[United States|American]] market, where Gold Blend was called "Taster's Choice," and the ads were referred to as the "Taster's Choice saga". Head and Maughan reprised their roles, but used American accents in the reshot ads. After the first two nearly identical ads, the American ads diverged into their own storyline.

The campaign was a remarkable success, producing various tie-in products, including a novelization entitled ''Love Over Gold'' by [[Susan Moody]], a video compilation of the ads, and two music CDs. The ads had a notable effect on sales, increasing them over 50% in the UK alone. They have been heralded as a premier example of [[positioning (marketing)|positioning]], creating an atmosphere of sophistication while remaining relatable. They were frequently compared to a [[soap opera]], even sometimes favorably compared to their contemporaries, such as ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'', or ''[[thirtysomething (TV series)|thirtysomething]]''. Famously, Head and Maughan appeared on the cover of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' after their campaign concluded and the two characters confessed their love for each other.

In later years, there were two additional series of ads starring new couples. The second series starred [[Louise Hunt]] and [[Mark Aiken]] and focused on a younger, more career-oriented woman, running for six instalments until 1997. In 1998, a new version with [[Simone Bendix]] and [[Neil Roberts (actor)|Neil Roberts]] began, but the campaign was discontinued after only one ad.

In 2005, the campaign ranked at number 20 on "[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s Best Ever Ads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305130459/http://thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |archivedate=2009-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had ranked at number 31 in a [[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|similar list]] compiled in 2000 aired on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uktvadverts.com/facts/?list=ch4&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Greek art}}

'''Greek art''' began in the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] and [[Minoan civilization]], and gave birth to [[Classicism|Western classical art]] in the subsequent [[Geometric art|Geometric]], [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods (with further developments during the [[Hellenistic]] Period). It absorbed influences of Eastern civilizations, of Roman art and its patrons, and the new religion of [[Orthodox Christianity]] in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era and absorbed [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Europe]]an ideas during the period of [[Romanticism]] (with the invigoration of the [[Greek Revolution]]), until the [[Modernist]] and [[Postmodernist]].  
Greek art is mainly five forms: architecture, sculpture, painting, pottery and jewelry making.

== Ancient period ==
{{further|Cycladic art|Minoan civilization|Mycenean Greece|Archaic Greek art|Ancient Greek art|Ancient Greek sculpture|Ancient Greek pottery|Hellenistic art}}
[[File:Stag hunt mosaic, Pella.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stag Hunt Mosaic]] at the [[Archaeological Museum of Pella]] (3rd BC)]]

Artistic production in Greece began in the prehistoric pre-Greek [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] and the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] civilizations, both of which were influenced by local traditions and the [[art of ancient Egypt]].

There are three scholarly divisions of the stages of later ancient Greek art that correspond roughly with historical periods of the same names. These are the Archaic, the Classical and the Hellenistic. The [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] is usually dated from 1000 BC. The Persian Wars of 480 BC to 448 BC are usually taken as the dividing line between the Archaic and the Classical periods, and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC is regarded as the event separating the Classical from the Hellenistic period. Of course, different forms of art developed at different speeds in different parts of the Greek world, and varied to a degree from artist to artist.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Stierlin. ''Greece: From Mycenae to the Parthenon''. Taschen, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a sharp transition from one period to another.

The art of ancient Greece has exercised an enormous influence on the culture of many countries from ancient times until the present, particularly in the areas of [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]]. In the West, the art of the [[Roman Empire]] was largely derived from Greek models. In the East, [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and [[India]]n cultures, resulting in [[Greco-Buddhist art]], with ramifications as far as [[Japan]]. Following the [[Renaissance]] in [[Europe]], the [[Humanism|humanist]] aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists. Pottery was either blue with black designs or black with blue designs.

== Byzantine period ==
{{main|Byzantine art|Macedonian art (Byzantine)}}
[[File:Daphni.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic of [[Daphni Monastery]] (ca. 1100)]]

Byzantine art is the term created for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from about the 5th century until the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453. (The Roman Empire during this period is conventionally known as the [[Byzantine Empire]].)
The term can also be used for the art of states which were contemporary with the Persian Empire and shared a common culture with it, without actually being part of it, such as [[Bulgaria]], or [[Russia]], and also [[Venice]], which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other respects part of western European culture. It can also be used for the art of people of the former Byzantine Empire under the rule of [[Ottoman Empire]] after 1453. In some respects the Byzantine artistic tradition has continued in [[Russia]] and other [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;C. Mango, ed., The art of the Byzantine Empire, 312-1453: sources and documents (Inglewood Cliffs, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Byzantine art grew from the art of ancient Greece and, at least before 1453, never lost sight of its classical heritage, but was distinguished from it in a number of ways. The most profound of these was that the humanist ethic of ancient Greek art was replaced by the Christian ethic. If the purpose of classical art was the glorification of man, the purpose of Byzantine art was the glorification of God.

In place of the nude, the figures of God the Father, Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the saints and martyrs of Christian tradition were elevated and became the dominant - indeed almost exclusive - focus of Byzantine art. One of the most important forms of Byzantine art was, and still is, theded the Cretan school as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing [[Western European]] artistic influence, and also saw the first signiand the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toomey-tourell.com/?/artists/united-states/theodoros-stamos/ Theodoros Stamos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Byzantine and modern period ==
{{Main|Cretan School|Heptanese School (painting)|Modern Greek art}}
[[File:Theodora by Emmanouel Tzanes (1671, Byzantine museum).jpg|thumb|left|160px|''St Theodora'' icon by [[Emmanuel Tzanes]], an example of the [[Cretan School]]]]

''Cretan School'' describes the school of [[icon]] painting, also known as ''Post-Byzantine art'', which flourished while [[Crete]] was under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule during the late [[Middle Ages]], reaching its climax after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements; the most famous product of the school, [[El Greco]], was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe, and also the one who left the Byzantine style farthest behind him in his later career.

The ''Heptanese School'' of painting ({{lang-el|Επτανησιακή Σχολή|translation=The School of the seven islands|links=no}}, also known as the ''Ionian Islands' School'') succeeded the [[Cretan School]] as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after [[Crete]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing Western European artistic influence, and also saw the first significant depiction of secular subjects. The school was based in the [[Ionian Islands]], which were not part of Ottoman Greece, from the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;[http://www.archive.gr/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=50 archive.gr - Διαδρομές στην Νεοελληνική Τέχνη&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213213/http://www.archive.gr/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=50 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Greek art, after the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], began to be developed around the time of [[Romanticism]]. Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art, inspired by revolutionary ideals as well as the country's geography and history. After centuries of Ottoman rule, few opportunities for an education in the arts existed in the newly independent Greece, so studying abroad was imperative for artists. [[Munich]], as an important international center for the arts at that time, was the place where the majority of the Greek artists of the 19th century chose to study. Later on, they would return to Greece and pass on their knowledge. Both academic and personal bonds developed between early Greek painters and Munich artistry giving birth to the Greek "Munich School" ([[Greek academic art of the 19th century]]). [[Nikolaos Gysis]] was an important teacher and artist at the [[Munich Academy]] and he soon became a leading figure among Greek artists.  Many of these Munich School artists chose subjects such as everyday Greek life, local customs, and living conditions. Several important painters emerged at this time. [[Theodoros Vryzakis]] specialized in historical painting and especially inspired by the 1821 [[Greek War of Independence]]. [[Nikiphoros Lytras]] concentrated on realistic depictions of Greek life. [[Georgios Jakobides]] devoted his attention to infants and children and he would laterbecome the first Director of the new [[National Gallery of Athens]]. [[Georgios Roilos]] was another leading painter of the period closely associated with the Munich School, especially in his early career. [[Konstantinos Volanakis]] was inspired mostly by the Greek sea.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/01181/GreekPainting_20thcentury.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606142423/http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/01181/GreekPainting_20thcentury.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable painters of the era are [[Theodore Ralli]], [[Ioannis Altamouras]] and the folk painter [[Theofilos Hatzimichail]]. Notable sculptors of the era are [[Leonidas Drosis]] (his major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]], [[Lazaros Sochos]], Georgios Vitalis, Dimitrios Filippotis, [[Ioannis Kossos]], [[Yannoulis Chalepas]], [[Georgios Bonanos]] and Lazaros Fytalis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10530">The '''Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) Singapore''' is the curatorial division of [[LASALLE College of the Arts]], dedicated to supporting innovative and emerging creative practices. Focusing on [[art]] and [[design]] from the present, it provides an active site for contemporary [[culture]] in [[Singapore]]. It comprises five galleries that span a total of 1,500 square metres, one of the largest spaces devoted to contemporary art in Singapore. It engages local and international audiences in critical viewing and discussion through a diverse programme of exhibitions, projects, publications and events.

The ICA Singapore provides a cultural and educational tool for students and the wider public to advance their knowledge and appreciation of the contemporary local, regional and international arts.

==History==
The Dr Earl Lu Gallery was established by LASALLE College of the Arts in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yap|first1=June|title=A Brief History of the Singapore Visual Arts Scene|journal=Singapore's Visual Artists|date=2016|volume=Singapore: National Arts Council.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of a major contribution of artworks by [[philanthropist]] and artist Dr [[Earl Lu]], it presented exhibitions of traditional and contemporary arts, often with a focus on practices from [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yap|first1=June|title=A Brief History of the Singapore Visual Arts Scene|journal=Singapore's Visual Artists|date=2016|volume=Singapore: National Arts Council.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 to 2004, under the directorship of Binghui Huangfu, the gallery worked closely with LASALLE’s Contemporary Asian Art Centre, a research facility directed by T.K. Sabapathy that sought to advance knowledge and collaboration between artists across Asia through dialogue, research and publications. In 2004, Dr Earl Lu Gallery was renamed the '''Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore''' and repositioned as a centre of Singapore and international contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Eugene|title=Art in Singapore and the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore|journal=Perspectives|date=July 2007|volume=Hong Kong: Asia Art Archive|url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/Diaaalogue/Details/31|accessdate=18 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128050814/http://www.aaa.org.hk/Diaaalogue/Details/31|archivedate=28 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the institute moved along with LASALLE College of the Arts from the Goodman Road campus to a new campus on McNally Street, where it is based today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LASALLE College of the Arts|url=http://www.mimoa.eu/projects/Singapore/Singapore/LASALLE%20college%20of%20the%20arts/?abvar3|website=Mimoa: Mi Modern Architecture|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its establishment, the ICA Singapore has presented exhibitions of international [[contemporary art]]. These include solo exhibitions by [[Yeo Hwee Bin]] (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yeo Hwee Bin: Pioneer Sculptor|url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/2783|website=Collection|publisher=Hong Kong: Asia Art Archive|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630180942/http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/2783|archivedate=30 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[On Kawara]] (2004), [[Antony Gormley]] (2005), Lim Tzay Chuen (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Eugene|title=Art in Singapore and the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore|journal=Perspectives|date=July 2007|volume=Hong Kong: Asia Art Archive|url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/Diaaalogue/Details/31|accessdate=18 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128050814/http://www.aaa.org.hk/Diaaalogue/Details/31|archivedate=28 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberto Chabet]] (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippine Art off to a Rousing Start in Singapore for 2011|url=http://www.philippine-embassy.org.sg/news/2011/01/philippine-art-off-to-rousing-start-in-singapore-for-2011/|website=Embassy of the Philippines|accessdate=27 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629221713/http://www.philippine-embassy.org.sg/news/2011/01/philippine-art-off-to-rousing-start-in-singapore-for-2011/|archivedate=29 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Woo (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ian Woo: Biography|url=http://ian-woo.com/bio/|website=Tomio Koyama Gallery|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Sharma (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apropos: Jeremy Sharma|url=http://www.artsrepublic.sg/apropos/|website=Arts Republic|publisher=Singapore.|accessdate=30 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916132134/http://www.artsrepublic.sg/apropos/|archivedate=16 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Milenko Prvacki (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Lijie|title=Prvacki’s Progress|agency=Singapore.|publisher=The Straits Times|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shubigi Rao (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chia|first1=Adeline|title=Singapore Gallery Crawl: Shubigi Rao, Marina Cruz and Thukral &amp; Tagra|journal=BLOUIN ARTINFO|date=21 March 2013|url=http://sea.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/881668/singapore-gallery-crawl-shubigi-rao-marina-cruz-and-thukral|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tang Da Wu]] (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teh|first1=David|title=Tang Da Wu|journal=Artforum|date=2013|url=http://artforum.com/index.php?pn=picks&amp;id=40099&amp;view=print|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Tan (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Tan: How to do Things with Rules|url=http://sagg.info/event/jack-tan-how-to-do-things-with-rules/|website=Singapore Art Gallery Guide|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Fusinato (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marco Fusinato: Constellations|url=https://www.noisesingapore.com/Happenings/2015/8/15/Marco-Fusinato-Constellations/|website=Noise Singapore|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ana Prvacki|Ana Prvački]] (2015–16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wu|first1=Daven|title=Finding comfort in an uncomfortable imagination: Ana Prvački at ICA Singapore|url=http://www.wallpaper.com/art/ana-prvaki-at-institute-of-contemporary-arts-singapore|website=Wallpaper|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group exhibitions include ''Text &amp; Subtext: International Contemporary Asian Women Artists Exhibition'' (2000), ''Sight and Sight: Translating Cultures'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seng|first1=Yu Jin|title=Reconnecting the Past / Notes on an Art Collection|journal=The Next Chapter, Forays into LASALLE’s Permanent Collection|date=2009|volume=Singapore: Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lost to the Future: Contemporary Art from Central Asia'' (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whittaker|first1=Iona|title=Found for the Future?|journal=Randian|date=9 January 2014|url=http://www.randian-online.com/np_review/found-for-the-future/|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sound: Latitudes and Attitudes'' (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound: Latitudes and Attitudes|url=http://www.themuse.com.sg/2014/01/show-sound-latitudes-and-attitudes/|website=Muse|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Countershadows (tactics in evasion)'' (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quek|first1=Bruce|title=Dust and Shadows|journal=Randian|date=13 November 2014|url=http://www.randian-online.com/np_review/dust-and-shadows/|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artists Imagine a Nation: SG50: Pictures of People and Places from the Collections of [[Koh Seow Chuan]] and Friends'' (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Mayo|title=First SG50 Visual Art Exhibition up at LASALLE|url=http://beta2.todayonline.com/blogs/forartssake/first-sg50-visual-art-exhibition-lasalle|accessdate=10 May 2016|agency=TODAY.

==Controversies==

In February 2016, two items that were part of the group show "Fault-lines: Disparate and desperate intimacies" were removed from artist [[Loo Zihan]]'s installation "Queer objects: An archive for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Jian Xuan|last = Lee|authorlink = |coauthors = |title = Sex objects removed from art show|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/sex-objects-removed-from-art-show|work = The Straits Times|date = 16 February 2016|accessdate = 16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action was agreed after discussion between ICA Singapore staff, curator Wong Binghao, and Loo Zihan, and was due to the nature of the objects, which could potentially be considered offensive to some members of the public. The items were a penis sheath and a butt plug. The ICA Singapore, curator and artist emphasised that the decision was taken to make the exhibition accessible to all, including students of the LASALLE College of the Arts, half of whom are under 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Facebook|url = http://www.facebook.com/ICASgalleries/notifications/?section=activity_feed&amp;subsection=mention&amp;target_story=S%3A_I100000600513049%3A1228728023823870|website = www.facebook.com|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Intermuseum Conservation Association (ICA)''' is a [[non-profit]] regional [[art conservation]] center located in [[Cleveland, OH]]. It was the first such regional conservation laboratory in the [[United States]]. The ICA currently offers conservation and preservation treatments for paintings, murals, works on paper, documents, objects of all media, outdoor sculpture, monuments, and textiles. It employs over 20 conservators and staff.&lt;ref name="History Section"&gt;ICA website [http://www.ica-artconservation.org/about/history.htm History Section]. Accessed 2007-07-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:ICA History, Richard Buck.jpg|thumb|Richard Buck, founding ICA Director]]
The ICA was founded in 1952 on the campus of [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, OH]]. Six directors of major [[Midwest]]ern [[museums]] wanted to create a professional art conservation laboratory. Richard Buck from the [[Harvard|Harvard Art Department]] was the first director of the ICA and served for 20 years.&lt;ref name="History Section"/&gt;  In 2003, the ICA left Oberlin and moved to its current location on the [[Detroit Shoreway]] in [[Cleveland]]. The new building was once the headquarters of the [[Vitrolite]] Company, manufacturers of a popular opaque glass used in 1920s-1950s interior and exterior design. The Vitrolite Building is on the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Cuyahoga County, Ohio|National Register of Historical Places]]. The ICA is currently restoring the last surviving Vitrolite glass-decorated showroom in the country, for use as an educational and  public meeting space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmscleveland.com/abington/grants.cfm Abington Foundation Grant to for restoration]. Accessed 2007-08-01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The ICA has departments for architectural, object, textile, paper, and painting conservation. Beyond conserving and restoring pieces of art, the ICA offers materials analysis, disaster response services, fine art storage, insurance claim assistance, custom mounting and framing, and educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;Regional Alliance for Preservation [http://www.rap-arcc.org/index.php?page=members&amp;members_req=5 Description of members].

'''''Kalam Nawaem''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''{{lang|ar|كلام نواعم}}''', [[English language|English]]: "''Sweet Talk''") is a one-hour, female-hosted [[Arabic language|Arabic]] talk show that airs late Sunday evenings on the satellite network [[MBC 1 (MENA)|MBC1]]. Premiering in 2002, it is credited with pushing social boundaries on Arab television. As of 2007, it was classed among the top 10 programs in the [[Arab world]] and commanded the highest ad rates on MBC.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/dishing-democracy/full-episode/4381/|title=Dishing Democracy|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a notable 2011 episode, the program hosted [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shahid.mbc.net/media/video/13159/%D9%83%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85_%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A9_77|title=Video: Hillary Clinton on Kalam Nawaem (interview in English with Arabic subtitles)|publisher=MBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbc.net/portal/site/mbc-en/menuitem.6f1f176985b8912c9d172eec480210a0/?vgnextoid=a14df5c4c5f8d210VgnVCM1000008420010aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=f8b646470eeee110VgnVCM1000008420010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=corpArtDetails|title="Kalam Nawaem" hosts Hillary Clinton, in an exclusive milestone appearance on an Arab Satellite|publisher=MBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show discusses controversial topics and taboos in the middle east such as [[homosexuality]], [[gender equality]], [[terrorism]], [[masturbation]], [[incest]], [[sexual harassment]], [[rape]], [[child abuse]], [[infidelity]] and [[divorce]]. The presenters also read correspondence from viewers. Parts of the show have been censored by MBC.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;

Some of the women have also shared their personal lives with the audience. In one episode, Besiso's then-boyfriend proposed to her on the show, and later Besiso allowed the program to document her pregnancy and televise the birth of her child.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;

The '''Khakhuli triptych''' ({{lang-ka|ხახულის ხატი}}, ''khakhulis khati'') is a partially preserved large [[repoussé]] [[triptych]] [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]]) created in medieval [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. It incorporates over 100 specimens of Georgian and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[cloisonné enamel]] dated from the 8th to the 12th century. The icon is now on display at [[Art Museum of Georgia]] in [[Tbilisi]].&lt;ref name="Speel"&gt;Speel, Erika (ed., 1998), ''Dictionary of enamelling'', p. 67. Ashgate, {{ISBN|1-85928-272-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85928-272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Khakhuli crucifixion.jpg|thumb|left|"Crucifixion" from the Khakhuli triptych]]
The Khakhuli triptych derives its name from the medieval Georgian [[Khakhuli monastery]] (now Haho, [[Turkey]]), where it was originally kept. Early in the 12th century, the Georgian king [[David IV of Georgia|David the Builder]] donated several precious stones to the icon while his successor [[Demetre I of Georgia|Demetrius I]] had the icon, already revered as miraculous, transferred to the [[Gelati monastery]] near [[Kutaisi]], western Georgia, where it was further refurbished and set in a gold frame with gilded silver wings under [[Queen Tamar]]. According to the medieval Georgian chronicles, Tamar particularly honored the icon and donated to it a [[Caliph]]’s standard seized in the [[battle of Shamkor]] in 1195.&lt;ref&gt;Lordkipanidze, Mariam (1987), [http://www.georgianweb.com/history/mariam/chapter3.html ''Georgia in the XI-XII Centuries''], p. 184. Tbilisi: Ganatleba.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The icon was stolen from Gelati in 1859, allegedly at the instigation of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] governor of Kutaisi, [[Vladimir Vasilyevich Levashov|Count Levashov]]{{sup|[[:ru:Левашов, Владимир Васильевич|(ru)]]}}. Much of the gold and jewels were torn out and sold in Russia. Later, Levashov commissioned a metal reproduction from a [[Moscow]] goldsmith which was presented to the Gelati monastery in 1865. The original icon, as well as many of its medallions, subsequently entered the private collection of the Russian painter [[Mikhail Botkin]] and then the [[Hermitage Museum]]. The icon was only returned to [[Georgian SSR|Georgia]] in 1923 in a badly fragmented state.&lt;ref&gt;Eastmond, Antony (2001), ''Eastern approaches to Byzantium: papers from the Thirty-third Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, University of Warwick, Coventry, March 1999'', pp. 216-217. Ashgate/Variorum, {{ISBN|0-7546-0322-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0322-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Khakhuli icon. Doukas.jpg|thumb|"Michael VII Doukas and Maria" from the Khakhuli triptych]]  
The Khakhuli triptych is one of the largest enamel artworks in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Jane (ed., 1996), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art|Dictionary of Art]]'', vol. 12, p. 329. [[Macmillan Publishers]], {{ISBN|1-884446-00-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-884446-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mgaloblishvili, Tamila (ed., 1998), ''Ancient Christianity in the Caucasus'', p. 13. [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-7007-0633-X}}, 9780700706334&lt;/ref&gt; with its height of 1.47 m and width (with unfolded panels) of 2.02 m.&lt;ref name="Speel"/&gt; 

The centerpiece of the triptych, a large (116 × 95 cm&lt;ref name="Speel"/&gt;) icon of the Theotokos [[Hodegetria]], was originally of precious metal. The repoussé background is now lost and only the enameled face and hands of the Virgin survive. 
 
The triptych is adorned with 115 cloisonné enamels deriving from the workshops of Georgia and [[Constantinople]] from the 8th century to the 12th. The enamels are in the form of round medallions, rectangular and cruciform plaques, chiefly with depictions of saints, and some are ornamented with patterning. The cover of the reliquary is adorned with a 10th-century cloisonné plaque with a [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] scene.&lt;ref name="Speel"/&gt; 

Of particular note is the apical enamel of a royal pair whom a [[Greek language|Greek inscription]] identifies as the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Michael VII Doukas]] and his Georgian consort [[Maria of Alania|Maria]], daughter of [[Bagrat IV of Georgia]], both of whom is represented as crowning. This medallion, possibly brought in Georgia by Maria in 1072, was the only visible figural image when the triptych was closed.&lt;ref name="Eastmond"&gt;Antony Eastmond (1998), ''Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia'', p. 91.

'''La Vaughn Belle''' is an artist from the [[United States Virgin Islands]] who uses a variety of media including drawings, paintings, woodwork, ceramics, photography, and video.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/world/europe/denmark-statue-black-woman.html|title=Denmark Gets First Public Statue of a Black Woman, a ‘Rebel Queen’|last=Sorensen|first=Martin Selsoe|date=2018-03-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacqueline-bishop/la-vaughn-belles-contempo_b_5917632.html|title=La Vaughn Belle's Contemporary Art Practice of Speaking in Layers|last=Bishop|first=Jacqueline|date=2014-10-03|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is best known for co-creating with Jeannette Ehlers the 23-foot tall statue “I Am Queen Mary,” the first public statue of a black woman in Denmark, featuring labor leader [[Mary Thomas (labor leader)|Mary Thomas]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Biography ==
Belle was born on the island of [[Tobago]], but moved to the [[United States Virgin Islands]] when she was young and considers herself a native.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stcroixthisweek.com/st-croix/art/meet-cover-artist-lavaughn-belle.html|title=Meet Cover Artist LaVaughn Belle|last=Week|first=|date=|website=www.stcroixthisweek.com|publisher=St. Croix This Week|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother is from Tobago and her father is from [[Barbados]]. She attended [[Columbia University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], and in her junior year she took a painting class and decided to become an artist. However, she had already switched her major from Pre-Med to English, and couldn't switch majors again. After receiving her bachelor's degree, she started teaching and moved back to St. Croix. She received an MFA at el [[Instituto Superior de Arte]] in [[Cuba]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Works ==
Belle considers herself a contemporary artist and has stated she likes her art to speak "in layers."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She seeks to undermine and challenge the European-based hierarchical caste system in the Caribbean, which she believes places people of African descent at the bottom of the social pyramid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She regularly incorporates colonial artifacts into her work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== "Somebody’s Been Sitting In My Chair" ===
Belle created the video performance “Somebody’s Been Sitting In My Chair” where Goldilocks walks into a Great House. Inside displays several people sitting in a planter’s chair. It is meant to reflect the taboo surrounding not being able to touch anything in a Caribbean Great House.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== “Chaney” pieces ===
These feature broken ceramics from China and Denmark that often resurface after it rains in the Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== "I Am Queen Mary" statue ===
Denmark was an active participant in the transatlantic slave trade and greatly benefitted from it, though has never officially apologized. Belle co-created the statue "I Am Queen Mary" with fellow black artist Jeannette Ehlers to challenge "Denmark’s collective memory" about slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-industry-news-natural-history-museum-1257872|title=Art Industry News: Museum of Natural History Sued Over Expansion Plans + More Must-Read Stories {{!}} artnet News|date=2018-04-02|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/denmark-gets-statue-of-a-rebel-queen-who-led-fiery/article_5155dd3c-8d20-552d-aead-45cdb0796365.html|title=Denmark gets statue of a ‘rebel queen’ who led fiery revolt against colonialism|last=Times|first=Martin Selsoe Sorensen {{!}} The New York|work=The Santa Fe New Mexican|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 23-foot statue depicts [[Mary Thomas (labor leader)|Mary Thomas]], who helped lead the [[1878 St. Croix labor riot|1878 "Fireburn" labor riot]] in [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]] where workers in the [[Danish West Indies]] staged a protest.&lt;ref name="Lewishon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Divers Information on The Romantic History of St. Croix: From the Time of Columbus until Today|last=Lewishon|first=Florence|publisher=Dukane Press|year=1964|pages=48–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olwig"&gt;{{cite book|title=Small Islands, Large Questions: Society, Culture and Resistance in the Post-Emancipation Caribbean|date=14 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|editor-last=Olwig|editor-first=Karen Fog|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theglowup.theroot.com/in-queen-mary-denmarks-first-public-monument-honoring-1824263350|title=I Am Queen Mary, Denmark’s 1st Public Monument Honoring a Black Woman, Recalls a Fierce Rebel|last=Branigin|first=Anne|work=The Glow Up|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sits on a peacock chair, recalling “the iconic 1967 photograph of Huey P.

'''''Les Baigneuses''''' (also known as '''''The Bathers'''''), is a large oil painting created at the outset of 1912 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]] (1881–1953). It was exhibited at the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] in Paris during the spring of 1912; the Salon de la [[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]], Rouen, summer 1912; and the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], autumn 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/viewer/exhibit-catalog-salon-de-la-section-dor-15197 Exhibit catalog for Salon de "La Section d'Or", 1912. Walter Pach papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was reproduced in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written by Albert Gleizes and [[Jean Metzinger]] the same year: the first and only manifesto on [[Cubism]]. ''Les Baigneuses'', while still 'readable' in the [[Figurative art|figurative]] or [[Representation (arts)|representational]] sense, exemplifies the mobile, dynamic fragmentation of form and multiple perspective characteristic of Cubism at the outset of 1912. Highly sophisticated, both in theory and in practice, this aspect of [[simultaneity]] would soon become identified with the practices of the [[Section d'Or]] group. Gleizes deploys these techniques in "a radical, personal and coherent manner".&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vSvh8CytIC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=gleizes+baigneuses&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes%20baigneuses&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905-1914'', Yale University Press, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Purchased in 1937, the painting is exhibited in the permanent collection of the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mam.paris.fr/en/online-collections#/artwork/180000000000860 Albert Gleizes, ''Les Baigneuses'', Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris], Online collection entry&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1911, Dessin pour les Baigneuses, published in La Revue de France et des pays français, February - March 1912.jpg|thumb|230px|Albert Gleizes, 1911, ''Dessin pour les Baigneuses'', published in ''La Revue de France et des pays français'', February - March 1912]]
''Les Baigneuses'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 105 x 171&amp;nbsp;cm (41.3 by 67.3 inches), signed Albert Gleizes and dated 1912, lower left. This work, painted at the outset of 1912, represents a series of naked elegant women at various points in the landscape foreground, their reflections along with the blue of the sky echoing off the water at the lower edge of the canvas. Beyond the bathers can be observed protruding rock-like formations or boulders—with highlights of [[primary color]]—that appear to espouse elements of the foreground. Above these cliffs are found several [[deciduous]] woody plants of the genus [[Populus]]. Though native to many areas of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the Poplar, with its fastigiate branches tapered towards the top, is especially iconic of the western suburbs of Paris (''la [[banlieue]] ouest'') where Gleizes lived, 24 Avenue Gambetta, [[Courbevoie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/armory-show-entry-form-albert-gleizes-painting-la-femme-aux-phlox-14516 Armory Show entry form for Albert Gleizes' painting ''La Femme aux Phlox''], not after 1913. Walt Kuhn family papers, and Armory Show records, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Document shows Gleizes' address&lt;/ref&gt; The Gleizes family moved to Avenue Gambetta in 1887.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 19th century and extending through the early 20th century, Courbevoie witnessed a rapid growth in population, and a surge in the development of crafts, industry and transport (including rail). Such a scene of naked bathers actually occurring would have been highly unlikely in Courbevoie, or anywhere else near the Parisian capital.

===Optimistic reconciliation===
''Les Baigneuses''—as [[Robert Delaunay]]'s 1912 ''City of Paris'', and to some extent [[Jean Metzinger]]'s 1913 ''Meudon Landscape''—juxtaposes sharply contrasting elements. On the one hand the artist includes elements from a society in the process of inexorable industrialization, and on the other, the sereneness of timeless classical nude figures (something rarely painted by Gleizes, as Brooke points out). Yet the relationships between the two are formally resolved. This aspect of simultaneity—the optimistic reconciliation of classical tradition and contemporary life—was of particular interest to Gleizes, as it was to the [[Section d'Or]] group of Cubists (also known as the Passy group, or Puteaux group).&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The background forms a semi-urban landscape that possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, consistent with Courbevoie of the 1910s (except perhaps for the rock-like outcrops), a village or town with delicate smokestacks or factory chimneys billowing smoke that blends into the cloudy sky. Evidence that factories were already located on the Seine can be seen in Gleizes' ''Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie'' of 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/fr/gleize/page/albert-gleizes/son-uvre Albert Gleizes, 1908, ''Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie'', Fondation Albert Gleizes, Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; The statuesque nudes themselves are highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves, yet they are graceful, balletic and elegant. The source of light, rather than beaming down from one particular direction, appears to emanate from within the canvas itself, with an intensification in the vicinity of the bathers.

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) vs. Courbevoie, ca.1912, Les Bord de Seine, L'Ile de la Jatte.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Albert Gleizes, 1912, ''Les Baigneuses, The Bathers'', (left) vs. [[Courbevoie]], postcard ca.1912, Les Bord de Seine, L'Ile de la Jatte (right). The [[Île de la Jatte]] (or Île de la Grande Jatte) is an island over which Gleizes would have passed on his way to and from the center of Paris. The island is well known as the setting for [[Georges Seurat]]'s ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'' (1884), and his ''[[Bathers at Asnières]]'', in the background of which smoke emanating from industrial factories of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] can be observed; just as in Gleizes' ''Baigneuses'']]
Gleizes painted [[:fr:Île de la Jatte|L'île de la Jatte]] many times since 1901 and on at least five occasions between 1907 to 1912:

* 1907–1909, ''L'île de la Grande Jatte ou Bord de parc avec rivière animée de canots'', pastel pierre noire and ink on bistre paper, {{nobr|25 × 41.5 cm}}, private collection
* 1908, ''Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie'', Crayon, ink and gouache on paper, 23 x 32.5&amp;nbsp;cm, Fondation Albert Gleizes (Paris)
* 1908, ''L'île de la Grande Jatte'', fusain and gouache on rose paper, {{nobr|25 × 41.5 cm}}, [[Musée national d'art moderne]] (Paris)
* 1908, ''La Seine près de Courbevoie'', oil on canvas, {{nobr|54 × 65 cm}}, [[:fr:Musée Roybet Fould|Musée Roybet Fould]] (Courbevoie)
* 1908, ''Barque à Courbevoie'', fusain and chalk on paper, 30 x 38&amp;nbsp;cm, art market (Paris)

The subject matter of ''Les Baigneuses'', much as that of his monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing]]'' of the same year, is derived from an unsentimental observation of the world.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

Gleizes' interest centered on many things in the years leading up to 1912, one of which was the dynamic qualities of modern urban life. ''Les Baigneuses'', depicts "a harmonious and balanced landscape in which industrial and urban elements are imbricated with the surrounding countryside;" writes Cottington in ''Cubism in the Shadow of War'', "Poussinesque in its organizing geometry and Claudian in its specificity of place, this is the landscape not of Arcadia but of France as Gleizes wished it to be."&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt; Gleizes' formal innovations seen in this work are more closely related to the Salon Cubists ([[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] and [[Fernand Léger]]) than to those of the Gallery Cubists ([[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]).

The gestures of the bathers in the 'foreground' and the whirls of chimney-smoke in the 'background' are unified expressively through "a timeless and purportedly natural order." While the subject was "explicit in its reference to latinist classicism" writes Cottington, "and implicit in its rejection of the avant-gardist challenge of the [[Futurism|futurists]] to avoid the pictorial representation of the nude as inescapably ''passé"'', he continues, "the presence of emblems of industrialization, not juxtaposed but integrated with the rhythms of the landscape, marked a definite, if tentative, departure from the concerns he had shared with Le Fauconnier."&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt; Gleizes made use of fragmentation of form, multiple perspective views (i.e., mobile and dynamic, rather than static and from one point-of-view) along with linear and planar structural qualities. Though highly sophisticated in theory, this aspect of [[simultaneity]] would actually become quite commonly employed within the practices of the [[Section d'Or]] group. Gleizes deployed these techniques in ''"a radical, personal and coherent manner"'' (Cottington, 1998).&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;

==1912==
[[File:Recoveredgleizes.jpg|thumb|left|Albert Gleizes, 1911, ''Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon, Paysage avec personnage'', oil on canvas, 146.4 x 114.4 cm. Exhibited at Salon des Indépendants, Paris, 1911, Salon des Indépendants, Brussels, 1911, [[Galeries Dalmau]], Barcelona, 1912, Galerie La Boétie, Salon de La Section d'Or, 1912, stolen by Nazi occupiers from the home of collector Alphonse Kann during World War II, returned to its rightful owners in 1997]]
For Gleizes and those of his entourage 1912 signified a climax in the debates centering around [[modernism]] and [[classicism]] – [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] and [[Nietzsche]] – [[Euclid]] and [[Riemann]] – [[nationalism]] and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] – [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[four-dimensional space]]. It was precisely during 1912 that Gleizes and Metzinger would write the seminal treatise ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (Cubism's only manifesto),&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, ''Du "Cubisme"'', published by Eugène Figuière, Paris, 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913]&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt "to put a little order into the chaos of everything that had been written in the papers and reviews since 1911", to use the words of Gleizes.&lt;ref name="Brooke, P."&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, 1925, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form''], published in German, 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', the French version was published as ''L'Epopée (The Epic)'', in the journal ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929. Translation by Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;

It was both as artists and theorists (in painting and writing) that Gleizes and Metzinger expressed their critical and ideological discourse about the possible meanings and significance of [[Cubism]] and contemporary aesthetics. Indeed, ''Du "Cubisme"'' was much more than an unorthodox or anti-academic explanation of the avant-gardist innovations seen in Cubist paintings.

It was natural that Gleizes and Metzinger, both articulate men, should come not just to theorize on the meaning of Cubism, but to defend the movement against attacks leveled in the wake of the 1911 public exhibitions. The two had exhibited regularly at the important salons ([[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]]) since around 1903 and held divers official positions within them (e.g., hanging committee members). Both were well-versed in philosophy, mathematics and poetry. While Metzinger had participated in discussions at the [[Bateau Lavoir]] (from 1907), both he and Gleizes were largely responsible for the impression made by the Cubists on the general public during both the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne of 1910 and 1911 respectively. Intellectual and moral support for their endeavors came from members of the [[Section d'Or]] (Groupe de Puteaux).&lt;ref name="Herschel Browning Chipp"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UZ4Gu7a7V9UC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=%22discern+and+that+which+pre-exists+within+us%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F-vrNN6wHd&amp;sig=ULAMPMqjUeA5We6bwoHDI-Rkfyc&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22discern%20and%20that%20which%20pre-exists%20within%20us%22&amp;f=false Herschel Browning Chipp, with contributions by Peter Howard Selz and Joshua C. Taylor, ''Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics'', University of California Press, 1968] {{ISBN|0-520-01450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Picasso and Braque remained unknown to the general public and made no recorded statements during the crucial pre-War period. Braque's first brief aphoristic statement regarding Cubism was written in 1917 during his gradual return to health following a head-wound during the war. Picasso's first recorded statement on Cubism is dated 1923, at a time when [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Abstract art]] had become fashionable.&lt;ref name="Herschel Browning Chipp" /&gt;

By 1912 art had become much more than a dialogue between ''artist'' and ''nature''. "The three dimensions of sensorial volume", Gleizes would write in 1925, "left open the field for the introduction of the time factor".&lt;ref name="Albert Gleizes"&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''"Cubisme", Vers une conscience plastique, Essai de généralisation'', 1925, in Bulletin de l'Effort Moderne, 22–32, February 1926–Feb 1927. Also published in ''La Vie des Lettres et des Arts'', May 1925 (written as part of the Bauhaus book, ''Kubismus''). See too Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century'', 2001, {{ISBN|0-300-08964-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The diversity of the relations of line to line must be indefinite;" write Gleizes and Metzinger, "on this condition it incorporates quality, the incommensurable sum of the affinities perceived between that which we discern and that which pre-exists within us: on this condition a work of art is able to move us".&lt;ref name="Herschel Browning Chipp" /&gt;

==Cézanne==
[[File:Paul Cézanne 048.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Bathers (Les Grandes Baigneuses)'', 1894–1905, oil on canvas, 127.2 × 196.1 cm. [[National Gallery]], London]]
Cézanne, progressively leading up to 1906, moved away from classic pictorial arrangements, single view perspectives, and outlines that enclosed color. His attempt was to arrive at a "lived perspective" by capturing all the complexities that could be observed with the eye and captured by the senses, where both "sight" and "touch" became one. Cèzanne believed his paintings could capture a moment in time, that once passed it was gone, that art and nature are the same. Cèzanne claimed: "Art is a personal apperception, which I embody in sensations and which I ask the understanding to organize into a painting." The true meaning of painting grew closer as the distance from tradition increased. Just as the Cubists he would inspire, Cèzanne had little interest in the rational naturalistic painting and classical geometrical perspective inherited from the Renaissance. "Nor was he satisfied," writes Merleau-Ponty, "with the attempts of the Impressionists to dissolve this objective order into its original elements of light and atmosphere".[sic]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=odF1-rgcyRsC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=%22Art+is+a+personal+apperception,+which+I+embody+in+sensations%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JQcyvfr0PD&amp;sig=4MeurqRfE5fTl03Rajq6o-z3_3w&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Art%20is%20a%20personal%20apperception%2C%20which%20I%20embody%20in%20sensations%22&amp;f=false Maurice Merleau-Ponty, ''Sense and Non-sense''], Northwestern University Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, Northwestern University Press, IL, 1964.

==Staticity and dynamism==
[[File:Paul Cézanne 004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Bathers'', 1874–1875, oil on canvas, 38.1 × 46 cm (15 × 18.1 in), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City]]
The preoccupations of Gleizes, to considerable extent beyond those emancipated by Cézanne, was to play with the mobile, dynamic, changing aspects of the same form relative to the position of the painter.&lt;ref name="Albert Gleizes" /&gt;

''Les Baigneuses'', along with other compositions by Gleizes and his fellow Salon Cubists from this period (1911-1912), tend to coordinate a variety of views of the same subject, or a [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] (in the [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonian]] sense) of different angles in one picture. This attempt clearly shows the importance of both the ''time'' element and the ''mobile'' properties in the sequence of events. According to Gleizes, the artist would accommodate either several successive moments in time projected onto a single space, or multiple spaces projected onto the canvas at the same time. These [[kinematic]] compositions that took into account both staticity and dynamism were not just a new description of the external world created by the artist, but also the inner world.&lt;ref name="Albert Gleizes" /&gt;

Paintings of the Renaissance could not entirely convey these aspects of the world since their subjects were immobilized in a depiction based on one unique point of view; but the real world better corresponds to multiplicity of vision (we have two eyes). And here is precisely where an ambiguity or uncertainty arises as regards interpretation. This period was in fact marked by the unification of disparate concepts. Classical perspective and non-Euclidean geometry were not, after all, incompatible with one another. [[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Les Baigneuses, oil on canvas, 105 x 171 cm, Paris, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Albert Gleizes, 1912, ''Les Baigneuses'']]
[[File:Eadweard Muybridge, Plate 187 – Dancing, fancy, no. 12, Miss Larrigan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1887, ''Animal Locomotion'', Plate 187, Dancing, fancy, no. 12, Miss Larrigan]]
[[File:Nude woman washing face, animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 413 by Eadweard Muybridge.gif|thumb|right|130px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1887, ''Animal locomotion''. Plate 413, Woman washing, Collotypes; Motion study photographs]] The former was simply viewed as a special case contained within a more general concept. Reconciliation between the static classical and modern mobile approach was attainable since within the representation of successive states of an event could be found repeated images fixed for all time (as in the overlapping of several static images). Just as the dynamism of a ''motion picture'' results from a succession of still shots, the Cubists stance expounded by Gleizes and Metzinger on theoretical and plastic fronts, consisted of capturing the subject matter or object in a series of 'still shots' (static images) and suturing them together (i.e., several successive moments in time projected onto a single space). Likewise, or alternatively, the artist could depict (multiple spaces projected onto the canvas simultaneously).&lt;ref name="Albert Gleizes" /&gt;

There is a subtle difference or distinction between these two types of simultaneity Gleizes describes that deserve closer attention: inscribed onto the canvas could be either (1) the [[properties]] of two or more [[Event (philosophy)|instantiations]] or [[Event (relativity)|physical occurrence]] happening at the same [[time]] from the point of view of one [[frame of reference]] (the artist fixed in one position), or (2) the artist could inscribe (paint) the properties of one event represented over a succession of time intervals, observed from several frame of reference (or multiple points of view simultaneously expressed onto the canvas), meaning that the observational reference frame is tied to the state of motion of an observer. There are shared variables between the two concepts, involving the flow of time, i.e., temporal in nature, and involving motion (on the part of either the artist or subject), spatial in nature.

This ''cinématique'' nomenclature offered to the spectator several views of an isolated event, of the same subject, or similarly, several different subjects, a series of events, observed from one point of view. No longer was the artist restricted to a principle (or set of principles). The liberation from academicism offered by Cubism, as instigated by [[Cézanne]], resulted from the fact that the artist was no longer restricted to the representation of the subject (or the world) as seen in a photograph. No longer restricted to the imitative description of nature, and despite the complexification of visual stimuli (many views instead of one), the technique of painting became simple and direct.&lt;ref name="Albert Gleizes" /&gt;

In 1912 the photographic motion studies of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] particularly interested artists of the [[Section d'Or]], including Jean Metzinger, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and Albert Gleizes. A predecessor to cinematography and moving film, [[chronophotography]] involved a series or succession of different images, originally created and used for the scientific study of movement. These chronophotographs included a series of dancers and women washing. Though Gleizes may not have seen these specific photographs he was likely interested in the same idea, as were the [[Futurism|Futurist]]s. The motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing too at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warholstars.org/abstractexpressionism/artists/duchamp/marcelduchamp.html Katherine Kuh, ''Marcel Duchamp'', interview broadcast on the BBC program 'Monitor', 29 March 1961, published in Katherine Kuh (ed.), ''The Artist's Voice. Talks with Seventeen '', Harper &amp; Row, New York 1962, pp. 81-93]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Co7ipk-yOs0C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Muybridge,+cubism&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Muybridge%2C%20cubism&amp;f=false Stephen Kern, The Culture of Time and Space, 1880-1918: With a New Preface'', Harvard University Press, Nov 30, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Bill, ''Eadweard Muybridge, The Man Who Invented Moving Pictures'', Little, Brown, and Company, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a ''scientifique'' nomenclature offered to the spectator (the [[relativity of simultaneity]]), that artists themselves, art critics and art historians have not failed to notice. Some have attempted to refute such connections and others have embraced them. Though the name [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] was not yet a household word in 1912, there has been a rapprochement of the concept of multiplicity described above and the concept of relativity in the Einsteinian sense. While, as Einstein writes, the physicist can generally limit herself to one system of coordinates for the description of physical reality, the Cubist (particularly Gleizes and Metzinger) attempted to show the simultaneity of several such views, or, at the very least, they were unwilling to commit themselves to a single coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1578661 Paul M. Laporte, ''Cubism and Relativity with a Letter of Albert Einstein''], Introduction by Rudolf Arnheim.

==Salon des Indépendants, 1912==
At the 1912 [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] Albert Gleizes exhibited ''Les Baigneuses'' (no. 1347) — [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Nu descendant l'escalier'' was listed in the catalogue (n. 1001)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aulivrebleu.unblog.fr/page/2/ Hommage à Marcel Duchamp, Boîte-en-catalogue, 1912-2012, Salon des Indépendants, 1912, n. 1001 of the catalogue, Marcel Duchamp, ''Nu descendant l’escalier'']&lt;/ref&gt; but was supposedly withdrawn — [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] exhibited ''Artillerie'' (no. 1235) — [[Robert Delaunay]] showed his monumental ''Ville de Paris'' (no. 868) — [[Jean Metzinger]] exhibited ''[[La Femme au Cheval|La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)]]'' and ''Le Port'' — [[Fernand Léger]] showed ''La Noce'' — [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], ''Le Chasseur (The Huntsman)'' — and the newcomer [[Juan Gris]] exhibited his ''Portrait of Picasso''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Salon des Indépendants, 1912, kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel"&gt;[http://histoiremesure.revues.org/2333?lang=en Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, Histoire &amp; Mesure, no. XXII -1 (2007)], Guerre et statistiques, L'art de la mesure, Le Salon d'Automne (1903-1914), l'avant-garde, ses étranger et la nation française (The Art of Measure: The Salon d'Automne Exhibition (1903-1914), the Avant-Garde, its Foreigners and the French Nation), electronic distribution Caim for Éditions de l'EHESS (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The art critic Olivier-Hourcade writes of this exhibition in 1912 and its relation to the creation of a new French school: 'Metzinger with his ''Port'', Delaunay with ''Paris'', Gleizes with his ''Baigneuses, are close to this real and magnificent result, this victory comes from several centuries: the creation of a school of painting, 'French' and absolutely independent.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel" /&gt;
[[File:La Section d'Or exhibition, 1925, Galerie Vavin-Raspail, Paris.jpg|thumb|300px|La Section d'Or exhibition, 1925, Galerie Vavin-Raspail, Paris. Gleizes' ''[[Portrait de l’éditeur Eugène Figuière (Gleizes)|Portrait de Eugène Figuière]]'', ''[[La Chasse (painting)|La Chasse (The Hunt)]]'', and ''Les Baigneuses'' are seen towards the center]]
Gleizes, on the other hand, would write the following year (1913) of the movements continual evolution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The changes it had already undergone since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.&lt;ref name="Brooke, P." /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Never had a crowd been seen thrown into such a turmoil by works of the spirit, and especially over esemplastic works, paintings, whose nature it is to be silent", writes Albert Gleizes, "Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings—and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself—appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever."&lt;ref name="Brooke, P." /&gt;

The '''‘Made in Russia’''' national [[brand]] is a Russian communication project aimed at promoting and raising awareness of Russia’s [[export|exports]], [[business]], and culture in both domestic and foreign [[market (economics)|markets]]. 
The project was created by a team of professional translators, designers, marketers, and foreign trade specialists with the goal of improving communication - in every sense of the word - between Russian companies and international audiences.

Amongst its other activities, ‘Made in Russia’ is working to promote the country’s non-commodity goods, attracting necessary partners and target audiences through media platforms, a multi-lingual online portal, catalogues with information about domestic export companies, and a unified corporate style: visual identification systems combining all Russian exports.  
The concept and logo of ‘Made in Russia’ have been included in the second edition of an international textbook on branding called Nation Branding. Keith Dinnie, the author of the book, is a PhD candidate, an expert on branding, and a leading business school lecturer at Middlesex University in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandhorizons.com/book/nation-branding-concepts-issues-practice-2nd-edition Nation Branding: Concepts, Issues, Practice (2nd Edition) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Logo and corporate style'''

"Commercial use of Made in Russia"
[[File:"Made in Russia" printed on a "Raketa" shoping bag (2).jpg|thumb|"Made in Russia" printed on a shopping bag]]

The logo for ‘Made in Russia’ is a combination of a bar code and birch bark texture. References to business, goods production and sales, and the rich culture and history of Russian entrepreneurship are all included in the logo.

The ‘Made in Russia’ logo has been legally registered in all Nice 45 classes ([[International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services|International Classification of Goods and Services]]).

The logo and corporate style of ‘Made in Russia’ have already become a visual support element used by Russian exporters in business missions around the world organized by the Russian Ministry for Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mid.ru/maps/cu/-/asset_publisher/ZCoR8WfDPJng/content/id/1920362/pop_up?_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_viewMode=print&amp;_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_qrIndex=0 http://www.mid.ru/maps/cu/-/asset_publisher/ZCoR8WfDPJng/content/id/1920362/pop_up?_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_viewMode=print&amp;_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_qrIndex=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rights to use the national brand’s logo'''

Companies that are registered, pay taxes, and create jobs in Russia are eligible to use the logo. All companies are selected and approved by the project’s expert advisory board. The logo is issued free of charge for a period of one year, with the possibility of extension upon entrance into the ‘Made in Russia’ register.

Foreign companies may also qualify for the logo if they have joint ventures in Russia or have localized their business inside the country.

'''Official ‘Made in Russia’ portal'''

There is currently a multi-lingual portal  www.madeinrussia.ru and media platform for promoting Russian exporters, and catalogues about Russian export companies have also been created.

'''International presentation of the ‘Made in Russia’ national brand'''

The ‘Made in Russia’ national brand was presented to the international business community at the [[Expo 2015|Milan EXPO 2015]] exhibition. Its presentation comprised part of Made in Russia Day at the Russian pavilion with the participation of Igor Shuvalov, the first deputy prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.wn.com/view/2015/06/06/The_First_VicePremier_Igor_Shuvalov_promotes_the_Made_in_Rus/ http://article.wn.com/view/2015/06/06/The_First_VicePremier_Igor_Shuvalov_promotes_the_Made_in_Rus/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the project participated as an informational and visual partner in a number of events for Russian exporters both in Russia and abroad. As a result, a number of agreements were signed and contacts made, as well as an assessment of the prospects for exporting Russian products, which included a study of reactions to the new brand.

'''International experience'''
[[File:InternEng.jpg|thumb|The international branding experience]]

National brands are a common trend in many countries’ foreign policies. Similar promotion programs have been implemented in other nations.  The national brands ‘Made in…’ are also available in Germany, Canada, the USA, China, Italy, Belarus, India and other countries.

'''Expert opinion'''

“The ‘Made in Russia’ national brand offers a single system for image promotion to domestic exporters that includes a variety of tools to help Russian producers effectively present their products in the process of entering foreign markets.” (Alexey Tyupano, CEO of EXIAR) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/12/08_a_7942769.shtml http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/12/08_a_7942769.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The idea and conception of the ‘Made in Russia’ national brand seemed very interesting to me, and worthy to talk about with readers.” (author of the Nation Brand textbook on branding, Keith Dinnie – a PhD candidate, branding expert, leading business school lecturer at Middlesex University in London) &lt;ref&gt;[http://madeinrussia.ru/ru/news/98 http://madeinrussia.ru/ru/news/98]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The idea of patriotism in our time often turns into clowning... from this point of view, the website www.madeinrussia.ru is interesting. It gives a reasonable attempt, devoid of ridiculous patriotic jingoism, to summarize all brands and people whom our country can be proud of in every field - from Faberge, the jeweler to the tsars, to Igor Butman, the contemporary jazz musician.” (Leonid Kaganov, author and scriptwriter) &lt;ref&gt;[http://lleo.me/dnevnik/2013/10/11_madeinrussia.html http://lleo.me/dnevnik/2013/10/11_madeinrussia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The project aims to support and promote the best domestic achievements in various arenas: science, production, education, business, society, culture, and sports. It brings together companies that are developing their business in Russia and are creating new technologies - be it architecture, marketing, or sales - and through its work, promotes these achievements as a brand of Russian business.” (Irina Dobrokhotova, chairman of the board of directors at Best-Novostroy) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The ‘Made in Russia’ project is a powerful label integrator whose mission is to gather Russian companies and become a forceful consolidation tool for them. International experience suggests that such initiatives are both strong and promising.” (Alexey Andreyev, managing partner of Depot WPF branding agency) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depotwpf.ru/publications/414/ http://www.depotwpf.ru/publications/414/]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The open, cooperative nature of this initiative has been highlighted at the communicative level. It was important for the creator of this idea to show that it’s possible to receive government assistance quickly and easily.” (Elena Yufereva, CEO of Brandson Branding Agency) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North British Academy of Arts''' (1908 - 1924) was an art institution of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in northern [[England]].

==Overview==

The Academy, later known as the North British Academy of Arts, Science, Literature, and Music, was located in the Claremount Buildings on the western side of Barras Bridge on the corner with Eldon Place in Newcastle upon Tyne, which is now opposite the County Council Offices.&lt;ref name="YearBook"/&gt;  Its objectives were initially "for the advancement of art, the encouragement and advantages of its associates and members, and for the creation of local art patriotism and enthusiasm amongst cultured and influential classes of North Britain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=DOM19090109.2.90&amp;cl=search&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------10--1----2%22north+british+academy+of+arts+%22-- ''Dominion''], 9 January 1909, page 11e.&lt;/ref&gt;  They soon evolved to encompass "the betterment of humanity by the advancement of art, literature, science, music, education, law, medicine, manufactures, commerce, agriculture, industries, and, engineering, to the end that the sum of human knowledge may be increased",&lt;ref name="pars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nzh"/&gt;   with the Society organized into ten sections, each presided over by a distinguished specialist.&lt;ref name="nzh"/&gt;  It was founded in 1908, incorporated in 1913, and dissolved in 1924. William James Morgan (1850-1923) was the secretary throughout the life of the Academy. At various times, [[Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland|Henry John Brinsley Manners]] (1852-1925), the 8th [[Duke of Rutland]], was its president.&lt;ref name="YearBook"&gt;''The Official Year-Book of the Scientific and Learned Societies of Great Britain and Ireland'', Charles Griffin &amp; Co. Ltd., London 1910-1924. &lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' The entry for 1924 includes the annotation "[No Return.]", and there is no entry for 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazette1924"&gt;The ''London Gazette'' of 4 March 1924 [p1973a] advised that the North British Academy of Arts was voluntarily "wound up" on 5 February 1924 at an Extraordinary General Meeting of its shareholders held at 28 Bedford Row, London. Arthur Willey, accountant, of 50 North Parade, Whitley in Northamptonshire was appointed liquidator. A subsequent Extraordinary General Meeting of its shareholders confirmed these resolutions on 22 February 1924. Maisie Strobel was annotated as secretary of the Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''London Gazette'' of 29 April 1927 [p2826a] advised the registration (Reg. No. 5683 R. N'bld.) of the North British Academy of Arts had been cancelled by the Registrar of Friendly Societies as it had ceased to exist.&lt;/ref&gt; Early on the membership secretary was Frederick Huntley (1887-1960), and curator was William J. Macgarree. &lt;ref name="certificate"/&gt;

The "Entrance Fee" was two guineas, the "Annual Subscription", one guinea, and "Life Composition", twelve guineas. Annual Meetings were held in September, and exhibitions of members' works normally held twice a year. Members were described as fellows of the Academy, and entitled to append F.N.B.A. after their names.&lt;ref name="YearBook"/&gt;

==Exhibitions==

Eight exhibitions were held by the Academy before the [[Great War]].&lt;ref name="NAL"&gt;[http://catalogue.nal.vam.ac.uk/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1Y5P198854Y96.60789&amp;profile=nal&amp;uindex=NKW&amp;term=North%20British%20Academy%20of%20Arts.&amp;aspect=subtab114&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon#focus ''Catalogue of the National Art Library'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Their window boxes and flower pots were to be exhibited and judged in one of the school halls of the city in September of the following year. It was intended to extend the competition to London and other cities and towns of the United Kingdom, with school principals in North Britain being asked to encourage their charges to enter the competition.&lt;ref&gt;''Children and Flower Culture'' in ''The Limerick Chronicle'', 16 June 1910, page 2e.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarships were provided for talented poor students in the arts, music, painting, literature, etc.&lt;ref name="nzh"/&gt;

'''''Portrait of Gustave Geffroy''''' is a c. 1895 painting by the French [[Post-Impressionist]] artist [[Paul Cézanne]]. It portrays [[Gustave Geffroy]], a French novelist and [[art critic]] noted as one of the earliest historians of [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/geffroyg.htm |title=Geffroy, Gustave |publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1894, Geffroy wrote a sympathetic article in the periodical ''[[Le Journal (Paris)|Le Journal]]'' praising the work of painter [[Paul Cézanne]] who until then had received little praise in critical circles.&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;Newton, 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual friend [[Claude Monet]] arranged for a meeting between the two in November of that year which ended abruptly due to Cézanne's oft-noted erratic behavior.&lt;ref name=MurphyA&gt;Murphy, 100-01&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Geffroy continued to write favorably of Cézanne, believing, "He is a great teller of truth. Passionate and candid, silent and subtle, he will go to [[The Louvre]]."&lt;ref name=MurphyB&gt;Murphy, 163-64&lt;/ref&gt; Cézanne expressed thanks in letters to Geffroy in the months following their meeting and, in a display of gratitude (and possible feeling that Geffroy understood him), he elected to paint Geffroy's [[portrait]].&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;

The painter sent the critic a request in April 1895, after which Geffroy sat for Cézanne daily over a span of three months in the study at his home in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=MurphyA/&gt; After the three months' time, Cézanne, disappointed with the portrait's results, fled both the painting and Paris itself for his home in [[Aix-en-Provence]]. In a July 6 letter to Monet, he explained, "I am a little upset at the meager result I obtained, especially after so many sittings and successive bursts of enthusiasm and despair."&lt;ref&gt;Wadley, 103&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been speculated that, despite his words of gratitude in the same letter to Monet noting Geffroy's patience over the three-month span, the artist had built up feelings of resentment, even hostility, toward the critic, causing his abandonment of the project for seclusion in Aix.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;Howard, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for the breakdown in relations on Cézanne's part have been attributed to everything from politics to artistic principles to religion.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orsay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/gustave-geffroy-10542.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&amp;cHash=ed05bba678 |title=Paul Cézanne: Gustave Geffroy |publisher=Musée d'Orsay |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cézanne was unhappy with the painting and it was never finished, yet ''Portrait of Gustave Geffroy'' became a popular retrospective work after his death.&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt; [[Cubist]] painters were interested in the [[geometry|geometrical]] dimensions of the bookcase and [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] of vast table space in relation to the rest of the pictorial space.&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt; Geffroy noted that Cézanne painted the entire canvas at once, leaving the face and hands for last; they were ultimately unfinished.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt; The portrait has been described as angular, with the figure of Geffroy centered as a pyramidal or triangular figure, and surrounded by shelves, books and figurines complementing and converging on top of his profile.&lt;ref&gt;Wadley, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple angles of perspective, particularly with the books both in cases and on the table, have been noted for their "zig-zag" effect on the viewer, creating movement within the painting.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;

The portrait has been noted as the continuation of a recurring Cézanne theme: people in their natural environment, reserved and unimposing, immersed in their everyday tasks.&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;Schapiro, 100&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been compared to the earlier ''Portrait of Duranty'' by [[Edgar Degas]], from which critics have speculated Cézanne drew inspiration.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orsay/&gt;

The painting was donated to the French state in 1969 by the family of collector [[Auguste Pellerin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nga.gov.au/exhibition/masterpiecesfromparis/Default.cfm?IRN=191186&amp;BioArtistIRN=21796&amp;MnuID=SRCH&amp;ArtistIRN=21796&amp;ViewID=2 |title=Gustave Geffroy 1895-96 |publisher=National Gallery of Australia |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is on permanent display at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.

The '''Royal Academy of Dance''' ('''RAD''') is a UK-based [[examination board]] specialising in dance education and training, with an emphasis on [[classical ballet]]. The RAD was founded in [[London, England]] in 1920 as the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing, and was granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1935. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is patron of the RAD, and [[Darcey Bussell]] was elected to serve as President in 2012, succeeding [[Antoinette Sibley]] who served as [[President]] for 21 years.

The RAD was created with the objective to improve the standard of ballet teaching in the UK and, in pursuit of that goal, a new teaching method and dance technique was devised for the Academy by a group of eminent European dancers. The RAD is one of the largest dance organisations in the world with over 14,000 members in 79 countries,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/article.asp?id=30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201155441/http://www.rad.org.uk/article.asp?id=30|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including about 7,500 who hold Registered Teacher Status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/article_blue.asp?id=255] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724232648/http://www.rad.org.uk/article_blue.asp?id=255|date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-ballet.com/techniques.php |title=Ballet Training Techniques |publisher=The-ballet.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently about 1,000 students in full-time or part-time teacher training programmes with the RAD, and each year about 250,000 candidates enter RAD examinations worldwide.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

RAD exams are recognised by the national qualifications regulators of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, with selected exams also carrying a [[UCAS]] tariff towards university admission.  The RAD is also a validated awarding body of the [[Council for Dance Education and Training]]. The RAD works in partnership with the [[International Dance Teachers' Association]]. Royal Academy of Dance is charity 312826 registered in England and Wales. Royal Academy of Dance Enterprises Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of the RAD, which sells Academy branded merchandise, with all profits being gift-aided to the RAD.

==History==
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/01who/0111chronology.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220120946/http://www.rad.org.uk/01who/0111chronology.htm|date=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1920 ===
On 18 July 1920, [[Phillip J. S. Richardson]], then Editor of ''[[Dancing Times]]'' magazine, organised a dinner for eminent dance professionals at the former [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero Restaurant]] in [[Piccadilly]].  The diners included five special guests, representing the principal methods of ballet training in use at that time.

* [[Phyllis Bedells]] - English Method
* [[Lucia Cormani]] - Italian Method
* [[Edouard Espinosa]] - French Method
* [[Adeline Genée]] - Bournonville Method, Denmark
* [[Tamara Karsavina]] - Imperial Method, Russia

Other guests included [[Ninette de Valois]], the founder of England's [[Royal Ballet]] company, and [[Anton Dolin]], the co-founder of [[English National Ballet]].  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the poor quality of dance training in Britain at that time and following further meetings, the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing of Great Britain was formed, with [[Adeline Genée]] as its first President.  The Association would be the predecessor of the RAD.

=== 1921-1928 ===
In 1921, the Association established headquarters at the offices of ''Dancing Times'' magazine in London and the first Elementary, Intermediate and Advanced level examinations were held in the years that followed, with the first Children's syllabus being published and then examined in 1923 and 1924.  In 1927 a scholarship scheme was introduced for students studying dance with an Association member and in 1928, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] consented to become Patron of the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing.

=== 1930-1934 ===
In November 1930, the first issue of ''Dance Gazette''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/article.asp?id=249] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230142613/http://www.rad.org.uk/article.asp?id=249|date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published containing a historical review of the Association's first ten years.  'Dance Gazette' is still the official magazine of the RAD, being distributed quarterly to all fully paid members. Since 2011, it is also available to buy in selected branches of WHSmith in the UK. In 1931, the first [[Genée International Ballet Competition]] for female dancers was held in London, with awards for male dancers being introduced later in 1939.  The competition is the RAD's flagship annual event, named after Dame Adeline Genée DBE and now one of the most prestigious dance competitions in the world. The competition was introduced as an additional incentive for candidates who had passed the Solo Seal examination, and has taken place almost every year since 1931, even during the Second World War. In 1934, the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]] agreed to an alliance with the Association and a Grand Council of prestigious men &amp; women was formed to act as a governing body to advise the executive committee.

=== 1935-1937 ===
[[File:RAD Coat of Arms.png|thumb|right|250px|RAD Coat of Arms]]
In 1935 [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] approved the granting of a Royal Charter for the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing.  The charter was eventually affixed with his Great Seal in 1936, and the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing officially became the 'Royal Academy of Dancing' (RAD).  The following year in 1937, a coat of arms was designed by the [[College of Arms]] in London.

====Coat of Arms====
The RAD coat of arts was granted by the [[College of Arms]] in 1937, designed by the Hon. George Bellew, Somerset Herald of 
Arms and Registrar. The crest at the top of the coat of arms is a figure of [[Terpsichore]], one of the [[Muses]] from Greek mythology, representing dance. The supporter at either side of the shield is a winged doe, symbolising lightness and grace of movement. The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|Escutcheon]] shows a pentagram symbolising health, with a wavy and zigzag line conveying the movement of dancing. The motto 'Salus et Felicitas’ translates to mean health and happiness.

=== 1950-1954 ===
In 1950, founder President of the RAD [[Adeline Genée]] was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the New Year Honours List.  Further honours were awarded to members of the Academy in 1951, with [[Ninette de Valois]] being appointed a Dame, [[Philip Richardson]] being awarded an [[OBE|Order of the British Empire (OBE)]] and [[Margot Fonteyn]] awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).  Following the death of Queen Mary in 1953, Queen Elizabeth II consented to become the Royal Patron of the Royal Academy of Dancing and Dame Adeline Genée instituted the [[Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award]] to mark the occasion.  The award is presented annually in recognition of outstanding services to the art of ballet. The first recipient was Dame Ninette de Valois, founder of The Royal Ballet Company. The following is a list of selected recipients of the award.

The leading Principal dancer of the Royal Ballet at that time and considered the greatest Ballerina of her generation, Fonteyn was later appointed [[Prima Ballerina Assoluta]] of the Royal Ballet by Queen Elizabeth II.

=== 1963-1968 ===
In 1963, the Academy was granted charitable status.  In 1965, the first RAD summer school was held at the [[Elmhurst School for Dance|Elmhurst Ballet School]] in [[Camberley, Surrey]].  Teachers and dancers attended the summer school from the United States, Canada, New Zealand as well as the UK.  In 1968, [[Dame Margot Fonteyn]] devised a new children’s syllabus, which would become the basis for lower graded examinations.

=== 1970-1975 ===
On 23 April 1970, Founder President of the Academy, Dame [[Adeline Genée]] died at the age of 92 and in 1972, the RAD moved into its current headquarters in [[Battersea]] Square, London.  The building was fully refurbished to provide high quality dance facilities and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974.  The following year in 1975, the Academy established the Professional Dancer's Teaching Diploma, an intensive course for professional ballet dancers and other dance professionals to gain registered teacher status with the RAD and in 1976, the RAD's teacher training schemes were organised into what is now officially the Faculty of Education of the RAD.

=== 1979 ===
In 1979, a new bursary was founded and named in honour of [[Phyllis Bedells]], a founder member and former vice-president of the RAD.  The bursary of £1,000 is held annually, awarded for further training in the Academy’s method and is awarded to young dancers who are under 17 years of age and have passed RAD Advanced 1 with Distinction but have not entered for the Advanced 2 examination. Past winners have gone on to win medals in very high-profile competitions, such as the [[Genée International Ballet Competition]], and to dance with world-renowned companies including the [[Australian Ballet]], [[Dutch National Ballet]], [[English National Ballet]], [[London City Ballet]], [[Maurice Béjart]] and [[The Royal Ballet]]. Payment of the Bursary can be offset against existing tuition fees where the winner may be studying, or against material / equipment needed for the winner to continue their training.

=== 1983 ===
In 1983, the RAD opened its first International headquarters in Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia.  Since that time, the RAD has opened offices worldwide, including Brazil, China, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, United Arab Emirates and the United States of America,

=== 1990-1992 ===
In 1990, a new studio complex was opened at RAD headquarters.  Titled the 'Fonteyn Centre', it was opened by Queen Elizabeth II.  The following year in 1991, [[Dame Margot Fonteyn]] died on the 21 February in Panama City and [[Antoinette Sibley]] was elected as the RAD's third President.  Also in 1991, the 'Graded Examination Syllabus' was introduced, with Grades 6, 7 and 8 being introduced later in 1992.  The three-year teacher training course was also amended in 1992, being replaced by the RAD's first full-time Degree qualification, the BA (Hons) Art &amp; Teaching of Ballet (now the BA in Ballet Education).

=== 1995-1999 ===
The RAD celebrated its 75th Anniversary in 1995, the event being marked by events throughout the world.  In 1996, RAD President [[Antoinette Sibley]] was appointed a Dame in the Queen's New Year Honours List and the Academy's first 12 degree students attended their graduation at Durham Castle.  In 1997, the Benesh Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rad.org.uk/study/Benesh |title=The Benesh Institute &amp; Benesh Movement Notation — RAD |publisher=Rad.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was incorporated into the RAD and in 1999, The 'Faculty of Education' was established with further teaching qualifications being launched, validated by the University of Durham.

=== 2000 ===
On 20 December 2000, the RAD officially adopted its current title, "Royal Academy of Dance"  and in the same year, qualifications were established for students studying 'Benesh Movement Notation'.

=== 2010 ===
In 2010 the RAD became an Accredited Institute of the [[University of Surrey]].

=== 2011 ===
On 4 January 2011 in London and 17 January in Sydney, the RAD launched its new Intermediate Foundation &amp; Intermediate syllabi. RAD Grades 1-8 and the first five levels of the Vocational Grades were accredited by the [[Ofqual|Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] (Ofqual) in England with the RAD as an Awarding Organisation, and the Academy also achieved SQA Accreditation (Scottish Qualifications Authority Accreditation) for RAD exams. [[UCAS]] tariff points for Graded and Vocational Graded Examinations in Dance at Level 3 were confirmed in August, meaning those candidates who have achieved a Pass or higher at Grades 6-8, Intermediate or Advanced Foundation can use their exam result as contributing towards their points tariff when applying to a university or Higher Education institution in the UK. The [[Genée International Ballet Competition]] 2011 was held for the first time in Cape Town, South Africa, at Artscape Theatre Centre, looking to present the competition in New Zealand in 2012. The first ever Dance Proms took place on Sunday 13 November at the Royal Albert Hall, London, as a partnership project between the [[International Dance Teachers Association]], the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]], RAD and the [[Royal Albert Hall]] working together in celebration of dance and hosting more than 450 young dancers on the stage. UK and Republic of Ireland members from the three dance organisations were invited to video and submit a short dance piece online, and a variety of acts were then chosen both by an esteemed panel of professionals and through a public vote to perform live at the Royal Albert Hall.

== Examinations ==
The RAD offers two examination syllabi, which are suitable for both male and female students and form the basis of the RAD's work in the UK and overseas.  Each programme consists of a series of progressively more difficult practical examinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/article_green.asp?id=112] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505024837/http://www.rad.org.uk/article_green.asp?id=112|date=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grades 1-8 and the first five levels of the Vocational Grades are accredited by the [[Ofqual|Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] (Ofqual) in England, the [[DCELLS|Department for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills]] (DCELLS) in [[Wales]] and the [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment]] (CCEA) in [[Northern Ireland]].  These organisations are the Government approved qualifications regulators for their respective countries.  Candidates who successfully pass an RAD examination are awarded credit on the [[Qualifications and Credit Framework]]. The Academy also achieves SQA Accreditation (Scottish Qualifications Authority Accreditation) for RAD exams.

In 2009, the RAD launched a new syllabus at Pre-Primary and Primary level in dance.  These two new grades replace the existing Pre-Primary and Primary grades in ballet.  The Academy has since launched new work for grades 1-5

=== Graded Syllabus ===
The Graded Examination Syllabus consists of Pre-Primary, Primary, and numbered Grades 1-8. Each grade incorporates classical ballet, free movement and character dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rad.org.uk/05exams/index.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621032832/http://www.rad.org.uk/05exams/index.htm|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The syllabus is devised to progress in difficulty from one grade to the next and a student studying the grades in sequence would be expected to develop a greater degree of dance technique at each level.

* '''[[Classical Ballet]]''' is one of the most widespread dance forms in the world.  Originating in the [[Italy|Italian]] royal courts of the [[Renaissance period]], over hundreds of years it has been developed into a highly technical dance form.  Ballet is the foundation of the RAD's work and is the most important part of the Graded Syllabi.
* '''Free Movement''' is the term applied to movement from dance styles such as natural movement, [[contemporary dance|contemporary]] and Classical Greek dance.  Free movement does not have to include codified dance vocabulary and is usually an improvisation based on the students interpretation of a piece of music or stimulus.
* '''[[Character dance|Character Dance]]''' is an integral part of classical ballet repertoire.  It is the stylised representation of a traditional [[folk dance]], normally from a [[Europe]]an country and uses movements and music which have been adapted for the theatre. The RAD syllabus uses character dances based on [[Hungary|Hungarian]], Russian and [[Poland|Polish]] folk dance.

Students who have studied a complete grade from the syllabus will normally take an examination organised by their dance teacher and held at the teachers studio or a suitable venue hired for the occasion.  In the examination, the students perform the relevant grade work for an RAD examiner, who assesses the artistic and technical execution of the grade.  A successful candidate receives a certificate printed with their name and the grade passed.  They also receive a report detailing what marks were awarded and highlighting which aspects of their performance need further improvement.  Unsuccessful candidates receive a report and a certificate of participation.  The Pre-Primary grade is devised for younger students who are not old enough to enter the Primary examination.  There is no examination offered at this level, however students can take part in a Presentation Class.

Presentation Classes were introduced for students who a dance teacher feels may not benefit from, or be suitable for taking the series of examinations.  In a Presentation Class, in contrast to an examination, the teacher and a small audience of spectators are present in the room.  The students perform for an examiner but are not assessed.  They dance a condensed selection of exercises from the appropriate grade and receive a certificate of participation, which is normally presented by the examiner at the end of the class.

As a syllabus devised specifically with children in mind, examinations are not compulsory. The entry level of a new student is decided by the dance teacher based upon the child’s age, natural ability for dance or previous examination passes with another dance school or examination board, such as the [[IDTA]] or [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]].

==== Grades ====
'''The Grades are:'''
* '''Pre-Primary''' – 5 years and over
* '''Primary''' – 5 years and over
* '''Grade 1''' – 6 years and over
* '''Grade 2''' – 7 years and over
* '''Grade 3''' – 8 years and over
* '''Grade 4''' – 9 years and over
* '''Grade 5''' – 10 years and over
* '''Grade 6''' – 11 years and over
* '''Grade 7''' – 12 years and over (non-compulsory)
* '''Grade 8''' – 13 years and over (compulsory)

=== Vocational Graded Syllabus ===
The Vocational Graded Syllabus is designed primarily for older children or young adults who are considering a career in professional dance, as a performer, teacher or in another capacity.  The vocational syllabus is technically demanding and comprises only Classical Ballet and [[En pointe|Pointe Work]].  Students choosing to study this series of awards are required to be competent in the fundamentals of ballet technique and movement vocabulary.

Unlike the Graded Examination Syllabus, the vocational grades have to be studied in sequence and the student must successfully pass an examination at each level before progressing onto the next.  All vocational examinations are organised by RAD headquarters and instead of being held at a dance teachers own venue, they are held in major cities worldwide.  In this situation, the session organiser is responsible for timetabling the examinations, and it is normal for students to dance alongside the students of other dance schools in the examination room.  As with the graded syllabus, successful candidates receive a certificate personalised with their name and the level passed.  They also receive a report, however for this series of examinations, there is a different marking system and assessment criteria.

Students studying the vocational syllabus are expected to achieve a high level of technical and artistic ability in ballet and it can take a great deal of time and commitment to reach the standard required to pass these examinations.  Normally, a student will begin studying the Vocational Graded Syllabus after completing Grade 5 in the Graded Examination Syllabus, however some students will continue to study the graded syllabus at the same time.  The Intermediate Foundation and Advanced Foundation examinations are the only optional exams in this series of awards.  They are devised for students who the teacher feels may need more preparation before studying at the higher level, however they are assessed in the same way, certificates awarded in the same way and credits awarded on the National Qualifications Framework.

'''The Vocational Grades are:'''
* '''''Intermediate Foundation''' - 11 years and over (non compulsory)''
* '''Intermediate''' - 12 years and over
* '''''Advanced Foundation''' - 13 years and over (non compulsory)''
* '''Advanced 1''' - 14 years and over
* '''Advanced 2''' - 15 years and over
* '''Solo Seal'''- Must hold their Advanced 2 with distinction

== Style and technique ==
The RAD method, is a ballet technique and training system, specially devised by the founders of the RAD, who merged their respective dance methods ([[La Scala Theatre Ballet|Italian]], [[French ballet|French]], [[Royal Danish Ballet|Danish]] and [[Russian ballet|Russian]]) to create a new style of ballet that is unique to the organisation.  The RAD method produces a style of ballet that has become recognised internationally as the English style of ballet.

== Training method ==
The most identifiable aspect of the RAD method is the attention to detail when learning the basic steps, and the progression in difficulty is often very slow. While the difficulty of an exercise may only increase slightly from grade to grade, more importance is placed on whether the student is performing the step with improved technique. For example, plie exercises are employed consistently throughout the lower grades to enable the student to progressively deepen the plie and improve turnout. The principle behind this is that if enough time is spent achieving optimal technique before introducing new vocabulary, the easier it is for the student to learn the harder steps, while exercising basic technique to the maximum at all times.

== Associations ==
From 1 October 2006, the RAD began a new association with the [[International Dance Teachers Association]], a dance organisation based in [[Brighton]], England. A press release issued to members of each organisation stated that "the two organisations would embark on a process of working together for the future of dance and to the mutual benefit of their members in both teacher education and training and examinations".

As a result of this association, both organisations have formally granted teachers of the respective organisation the opportunity to enter candidates for its examinations thereby ensuring that both organisations recognise the right of qualified teachers to enter candidates for examinations of either awarding body. At the RAD these members are called ‘teachers recognised by mutual agreement’. Whilst the new association is not a merger, it is intended that it will develop co-operation between the two organisations and mutual recognition of the training and qualifications that they both provide.

Dance Proms is a partnership project between the [[IDTA]], the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]], RAD and the [[Royal Albert Hall]] working together in celebration of dance. In 2011, Dance Proms hosted more than 450 young dancers on the stage, showcasing a huge range of dance styles and cultural influences. UK and Republic of Ireland members from the three dance organisations are invited to video and submit a short dance piece online, featuring original choreography by themselves or their students in any dance genre, either as a solo, duet, or group performance. Acts are then chosen both by an esteemed panel of professionals and through a public vote to be performed live at the Royal Albert Hall, one of the world’s most iconic and prestigious venues. Dance Proms is designed to showcase the high standards of dance and dance teaching of the organisations and their members, and to raise standards and increase participation in and appreciation of dance in the UK.

==Synopsis==
{{Main article|List of Scarlet Heart episodes}}
Zhang Xiao ([[Cecilia Liu]]), a young woman from the 21st century, suffers a near-fatal accident that sends her back in time to the [[Qing Dynasty]] during the [[Kangxi Emperor]]'s ([[Damian Lau]]) reign. She finds herself trapped in the body of one of her previous incarnations: Ma'ertai Ruoxi, the teenage daughter of a [[Manchu people|Manchu]] general. In this new timeline, she has an elder sister, Ruolan ([[Annie Liu]]), who is a concubine of the Kangxi Emperor's eighth son, [[Yunsi|Yinsi]] ([[Kevin Cheng]]). Ruoxi initially tries to return to the future, but she soon adjusts to life in this era. She meets some of Kangxi's other sons, including the fourth prince [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yinzhen]] ([[Nicky Wu]]), tenth prince [[Yin'e]] (Ye Zuxin) who falls in love with her, and fourteenth prince [[Yunti, Prince Xun|Yinti]] ([[Lin Gengxin]]). She also forges a close friendship with the thirteenth prince, [[Yinxiang, Prince Yi|Yinxiang]] ([[Yuan Hong (actor)|Yuan Hong]]).

Ruoxi attracts the attention of the emperor with rumors of her brashness and bravery, and manages to charm him with her intelligence and wit. Later, at the imperial palace's "beauty draft" (during which concubines and wives are chosen for the princes or the emperor himself), conflicting arrangements are made by Yinsi and his first wife, Gogoro Minghui (Shi Xiaoqun), leading to Ruoxi being drafted into the service of the dowager empress to keep the peace. Ruoxi is given an appointment as a servant to the emperor himself, specifically to prepare and serve tea to him and those he hosts.

During Ruoxi's stay in Yinsi's house, Yinsi falls in love with her. She initially rejects him but eventually returns his feelings, and later agrees to marry him if he gives up competing for the succession to the throne. This is because Ruoxi's knowledge of history makes her aware that Yinsi's ambition will ultimately lead to his death in prison after Yinzhen becomes emperor. However, Yinsi refuses to and thus Ruoxi breaks up with him. Before leaving, Ruoxi warns Yinsi of Yinzhen's plans to usurp the throne and came up with solutions for him to prevent being taken down by Yinzhen.

Ruoxi then started to get closer to Yinzhen, and their interactions changed her unfavorable opinion of him, and she unwittingly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Yinsi and his supporters, acting on Ruoxi's advice, frame Yinzhen for plotting against the crown prince [[Yinreng]] (Zhang Lei). Yinxiang steps forward to take responsibility and is ultimately sentenced to house arrest. After this incident, Yinsi realizes that Ruoxi is now romantically involved with Yinzhen. Yinreng is deposed after his criminal ways are exposed and is imprisoned for life. Kangxi then begins showing preference for Yinti and offers Ruoxi as a concubine to him. However, Ruoxi boldly defies the emperor's order, and as a penalty, she is demoted to the laundry department.

Ruoxi works within the laundry department for a number of years, and is offered some level of protection and special treatment by ways of the princes. Kangxi falls ill during this time, and when Ruoxi is brought back to the emperor's service by Eunuch Wang to prepare pastries and help stimulate Kangxi's appetite, he pardons her and restores her to her former role as his lead tea server.

Kangxi eventually dies of his illness, and with military support from [[Longkodo]] (Zhao Jialin) and [[Nian Gengyao]] (Xing Hanqing), Yinzhen falsely claims that Kangxi named him the successor, effectively staging a coup and taking the throne from Yinti to become the [[Yongzheng Emperor]]. Yinzhen then releases Yinxiang from custody and moves Ruoxi into his quarters, eventually consummating their relationship. He does not, however, marry her, as he wants to be able to live with her and see her every day—wives and concubines have their own estates between which the emperor must divide his time. Ruoxi is pleased enough with this arrangement, as she has always been reticent about marriage and enjoys seeing Yinzhen daily as well. Ruoxi's happiness, however, is marred by Yinzhen's paranoia and his ruthless persecution of Yinsi and his followers. She is often caught between the rivaling factions of Yinzhen and Yinsi.

When Gogoro Minghui tells Ruoxi that Yinsi acted against Yinzhen years ago because of her advice based on the knowledge of the future, she is shocked, and her despair causes her to miscarry Yinzhen's child and is unable to conceive again. Enraged, Yinzhen blames Yinsi and his wife, issuing an edict forcing them to divorce, which leads her to commit suicide. Ruoxi fears Yinzhen's punitive actions against his brothers and confesses the truth to him and Yinxiang. Yinzhen is stunned when he understands why Yinsi plotted against him and starts treating Ruoxi coldly. Ruoxi is unable to withstand the mental stress and asks Yinti to help her leave the palace. Yinsi knows that Yinzhen will not allow Ruoxi to leave and decides to intervene. He discloses details of his past romance with Ruoxi, and an angered Yinzhen eventually agrees to let Ruoxi and Yinti leave the [[Forbidden City]].

Despite Yinti's excellent care, Ruoxi's emotional anguish deeply affects her health, and she begs him to send a letter to Yinzhen, requesting to see the emperor one last time before she dies. However, a misunderstanding between Yinzhen and Yinti causes the letter to be thrown aside unread. Ruoxi struggles to stay alive, but after three days, she concludes that Yinzhen's absence confirms that his love for her has ended, and she dies. When news of Ruoxi's death reaches Yinzhen, he rushes to Yinti's house, regretting his actions after learning that Ruoxi still loved him.

In the later years, Yinsi and Yintang (Han Dong) were imprisoned as Yinzhen blames them for everything that happened. Yinxiang went to visit them in prison and hands them poison, which was Ruoxi's request to him before she left the palace. Both Princes commit suicide and end their suffering. Yinxiang dies a few years later, followed shortly by Yinzhen himself, whose 12-year reign as Emperor was the shortest in Qing history. Yinti lives on but does not find another wife. Only Yin'e has a happy ending with his wife ([[Liu Yuxin]]) that he grew to love, watching [[Qianlong Emperor]] ascend the throne.

Back in 2011, Zhang Xiao regains consciousness in a hospital and is informed that she had been in a coma for weeks. She wonders if her experiences in the past were real or imaginary. After recovering, Zhang researches the Qing Dynasty era, only to find that history remains on its proper course, and there are no records on Ma'ertai Ruoxi.  However, she later visits a museum where she recognizes some Qing Dynasty-era artifacts and sees a woman in a Kangxi Emperor portrait that resembles her. Meanwhile, a man who bears a striking resemblance to Yinzhen visits the exhibition and encounters Zhang Xiao but does not recognize her. The show ends with a cliffhanger of the man walking away as Zhang Xiao's tears start to fall.

==Deviations from the novel==
[[File:Scarlet Heart's ending.jpg|200px|thumb|Zhang Xiao returns to the 21st century.]]
The show's producers have announced that the series will remain mostly faithful to ''[[Bu Bu Jing Xin]]'', the novel by Tong Hua on which it is based. However, there are some differences:

*In the novel's beginning, though in the television series Zhang Xiao remains a 25-year-old white-collar worker — her alter ego, Ma'ertai Ruoxi, was 13 years old, not 16. Another difference was that Zhang supposedly from the year 2005, not 2011.
*In the novel, Ruoxi is unable to return to her own time and ultimately succumbs to her illness, while [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yinzhen]] dies ten years later amid hopes of reuniting with Ruoxi after death. The story ends with Yinzhen's son Hongli's (whom he fathered with [[Empress Xiaoshengxian|Lady Niohuru]]) ascension to the throne as the [[Qianlong Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://book.kanunu.org/files/yuanchuang/201102/1416.html |script-title=zh:步步驚心(上、下) |accessdate= 2011-02-11 |work=努努書坊 |language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the television series, after Ruoxi and Yinzhen's deaths, Ruoxi's soul returns to her incarnation in the 21st century. Whilst struggling to get over the trauma of her experiences of time travel, she encounters a man who resembles Yinzhen and is possibly a present-day incarnation of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2011-08-16/09433387661.shtml|title=《步步惊心》预告片热播 男女主角都在哭|language=zh|work= Sina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man does not recognize her, and Zhang Xiao remains in guilt over everything that happened when she was Ma'ertai Ruoxi. She chooses not say anything and tearfully watches the man leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com.cn/h/2011/1001/c25408-3309510645.html |title=《步步惊心》悲剧收官 网友"哭"声一片 |work=People's Daily |date=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Battle of the Milvian Bridge''''', or '''''The Battle at Pons Milvius''''', is a [[fresco]] in one of the rooms that are now known as the [[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]], in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] depicting the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]. 

==Description==
''The Battle of Milvian Bridge'', located in the ''Sala di Costantino'' ("Hall of Constantine"), is by [[Giulio Romano]] and other assistants of the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]], who died in 1520. It was most likely painted to Raphael's design between 1520 and 1524.

After the master's death, Giulio Romano worked together with other members of Raphael's workshop to finish the commission to decorate with [[fresco]]es the rooms that are now known as the [[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]], in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. ''The Battle of the Milvian Bridge'' shows [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge|the battle]] that took place on 28 October 312 between the [[Roman Emperor]]s [[Constantine I]] and [[Maxentius]]. 
Legend says that Constantine had a dream where a cross appeared in the heavens; a voice told him he would win the battle of Ponte Milvio [[In hoc signo vinces|if he used the cross as his standard]]. The cross became his standard and he won the battle, and attributed his victory to the god of [[Christianity]].

The [[Ponte Milvio]] still stands in Rome in pristine condition; until only a few years ago cars were permitted to use it to cross over the Tiber. It can now be used only by pedestrians.

The '''Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier''', sometimes referred to as the '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the American Revolution''', is a [[war memorial]] located within [[Washington Square (Philadelphia)|Washington Square]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The memorial honors the thousands of soldiers who died during the [[American Revolutionary War]], many of whom were buried in mass graves in the square. The tomb and Washington Square are part of [[Independence National Historical Park]].

The memorial was first conceived in 1954 by the Washington Square Planning Committee, and was completed in 1957.&lt;ref name=ushistory&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/tour/tomb-of-the-unknown-soldier.htm "Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary Soldier"] on USHistory.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The monument was designed by architect [[G. Edwin Brumbaugh]] and includes an [[eternal flame]] and a bronze cast of [[Jean Antoine Houdon]]'s statue of [[George Washington (Houdon)|George Washington]] as the monument's  centerpiece. The tomb includes remains which were disinterred, after archeological examination, from beneath the square. The remains are that of a soldier, but it is uncertain if he was [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial]] or [[British people|British]].&lt;ref name=ushistory /&gt; An unknown number of bodies were buried beneath the square and the surrounding area. Remains are still occasionally found during construction and maintenance projects.

Engraved in the side of the tomb are these words:&lt;ref name=ushistory /&gt;

* "Freedom is a light for which many men have died in darkness"
* "The independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts of common dangers, suffering and success" ([[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington Farewell Address]], Sept. 17, 1796)
* "In unmarked graves within this square lie thousands of unknown soldiers of Washington's Army who died of wounds and sickness during the Revolutionary War."

The plaque on the tomb reads:&lt;ref name=ushistory /&gt;
* "Beneath this stone rests a soldier of Washington's army who died to give you liberty."

'''Traditional copper work in [[Mexico]]''' has its origins in the pre Hispanic period, mostly limited to the former [[Purépecha Empire]] in what are now the states of [[Michoacán]] and [[Jalisco]]. The reason for this was that this was the only area where copper could be found on the surface. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the Spanish took control of copper production, introducing European techniques but still needed indigenous labor. Copper work, like other crafts, was principally organized in Michoacán under [[Vasco de Quiroga]]. It is not known when the town of [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] came to specialize in the production of copper items, but it was well established by the mid 18th century. Copper extraction remained centered on Michoacán during the colonial period but most of the production gave out by the 19th century. After the [[Mexican Revolution]], copper smiths of Santa Clara were limited to working with scrap metal making pots, plates, casseroles and other containers. Today, it remains home to hundreds of copper smiths which work in ways little changed from the colonial period and is home to the annual Feria del Cobre (Copper Fair) in August.

==Pre Hispanic copper working==
[[File:BronzeTztztz.JPG|thumb|left|Bronze bells and tools at the site museum of Tzintzuntzan]]
Copper working has been done in central Mexico since the pre Hispanic period.&lt;ref name="herrera7"&gt;Herrera, p 7&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not the first area in the Americas to begin working with the metal. The first evidence of copper work is in what is now the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest of the United States]] as the metal was found here fairly easily on the surface without mining.&lt;ref name="horcasitas2627"&gt;Horcasitas, p 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; The next location was in the west coastal areas of [[South America]] into some areas of [[Central America]], where it was often mixed with gold.&lt;ref name="horcasitas29"&gt;Horcasitas, p 29&lt;/ref&gt; Copper working developed later in [[Mesoamerica]] because of the lack of surface copper and little to no contact with the copper cultures to the north or south.&lt;ref name="horcasitas3536"&gt;Horcasitas, p 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The one area in Mesoamerica which had developed copper work before the arrival of the Spanish was in west Mexico in what are now the states of Jalisco and Michoacán, mostly in the Purépecha Empire.&lt;ref name="horcasitas33"&gt;Horcasitas, p 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Most pre Hispanic copper work occurred in what are now the municipalities of [[Churumuco]], [[La Huacana Municipality|La Huacana]], [[Nuevo Urecho]], [[Tacámbaro]] and [[Turicato]], with a percentage of this production paid as tribute to the capital at [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] .&lt;ref name="herrera7"/&gt;  There is evidence that at least some of this copper and other minerals were extracted from shallow pits or tunnel mines.&lt;ref name="horcasitas43"&gt;Horcasitas, p 43&lt;/ref&gt; The Purépecha developed some techniques for extracting copper from rock as well as techniques for shaping it. The working of the metal had advanced enough that it was used for utilitarian objects as well as ornamental and religious ones.&lt;ref name="horcasitas3638"&gt;Horcasitas, p 36-38&lt;/ref&gt; The Purépecha made a number of objects from the metal including axes, boxes, fish hooks, knives, small bells, necklaces, bracelets and earrings.&lt;ref name="herrera7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horcasitas33"/&gt;  Copper was first worked by cold hammering but as copper loses elasticity as it is worked this way, heating was soon discovered to recondition it. The creation of objects by casting was not common for copper but was used to make small delicate objects such as bells.&lt;ref name="herrera7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horcasitas4445"&gt;Horcasitas, p 44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial period==
[[File:Vasco de quiroga.jpg|thumb|175px|Vasco de Quiroga]]
During and after the Conquest, the working of the metal by the indigenous was disrupted. Many of the villages of the [[Pátzcuaro]] area were abandoned in large part due to the abuses by conquistador [[Nuño de Guzmán]]. The Spanish were soon aware of the copper deposits of this region and the indigenous’ ability to work it. Since they were necessary to exploit this wealth, the Spanish worked to bring them back into the area into settled communities under their control.&lt;ref name="horcasitas111112"&gt;Horcasitas, p 111-112&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasco de Quiroga]] brought various kinds of craftsmen from Spain to the Pátzcuaro area to develop the region’s economy.&lt;ref name="herrera11"&gt;Herrera, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Clara founded by friar Francisco de Villafuerte and put under the direct protection of the [[Spanish Crown]]. Its foundation would later be attributed to Vasco de Quiroga, probably due to his work establishing copper smithing.&lt;ref name="horcasitas114"&gt;Horcasitas, p 114&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish introduced European smelting techniques and organized the work by family owned workshops, passed down from generation to generation, which remains in effect to this day.&lt;ref name="herrera1011"&gt;Herrera, p 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; Uses for copper during the colonial period was mostly for arms and for cooking utensils.&lt;ref name="horcasitas9899"&gt;Horcasitas, p 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known when Santa Clara began to specialize in copper work as much of its records have been lost due to various fires over its history. The earliest surviving record is from 1748 and notes the working of the metal to be well-developed.&lt;ref name="horcasitas109110"&gt;Horcasitas, p 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial period, copper mining was most extensive in Michoacán, continuing the development of the metal started by the Purépecha. Main extraction areas included [[Tlalpujahua]], [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán|Tzintzutzan]], [[Charo, Michoacán|Charo]], Santa Clara del Cobre and [[Ozumatlán]] .&lt;ref name="horcasitas9091"&gt;Horcasitas, p 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; The copper which was worked in the early colonial period came from mine within a 50&amp;nbsp;km radius, in ore which was purified in the town.&lt;ref name="herrera13"&gt;Herrera, p 13&lt;/ref&gt; At first this was in Santa Clara itself but later records state that the copper being worked here was coming from [[Inguarán]] and [[Opopeo]] .&lt;ref name="horcasitas109110"/&gt;  The smelting of copper in the area ended by the mid 17th century as the mines gave out.&lt;ref name="horcasitas116"&gt;Horcasitas, p 116&lt;/ref&gt;

When mining in Mexico waned during and just after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], copper working survived here. Its prominence ebbed and waned during Mexico’s tumultuous history in the 19th century, with the very last of copper mining ending at the end of this same century.&lt;ref name="horcasitas109110"/&gt;  Mexico still has large reserves of copper, mostly in the form of [[sulphide]]s, which have not been mined because of cost.&lt;ref name="horcasitas334"&gt;Horcasitas, p 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copper work in Santa Clara today==
[[File:PunzoWorkshop19.JPG|thumb|left|View of a traditional workshop in Santa Clara del Cobre]]
Santa Clara del Cobre is where traditional copper working in Mexico survives. There are at least 2,000 copper smiths working in over 300 workshops in the municipality. Most of the workshops in the town operate much as they did in the past, receiving various exemption from federal labor laws and tax breaks designed to preserve the craft. The workshops are still independent and family owned with different members in charge of the various tasks such as finance, production and sales.&lt;ref name="horcasitas131132"&gt;Horcasitas, p 131-132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herrera20"&gt;Herrera, p 20&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops are roofed areas with few or no walls. This allows protection from rain but allows for ventilation, especially around the forge.&lt;ref name="horcasitas138"&gt;Horcasitas, p 138&lt;/ref&gt;  These workshops contain a wide variety of tools, many of which are created by the artisans themselves.&lt;ref name="gmasters305306"&gt;Fernández de Calderón, p 305-306&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Mexican Revolution]], all residual mining and smelting activities in the area ceased, leaving only the working of already-extracted copper or scrap copper.&lt;ref name="horcasitas130"&gt;Horcasitas, p 130&lt;/ref&gt; The copper comes from industrial scrap, including old electrical motors and cables from junkyards and telephone and electrical companies.&lt;ref name="herrera20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gmasters305306"/&gt; The process begins by removing the impurities from the scrap metal then placing  the pure copper pieces into the center of the forge to be melted together. The material is covered with pine briquettes to produce a fire of an intense and even temperature. The temperature of the fire is raised with the use of bellows, which may still be hand operated.&lt;ref name="gmasters329330"&gt;Fernández de Calderón, p 329-330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herrera21"&gt;Herrera, p 21&lt;/ref&gt; The melted metal is not poured into molds but is molded by the bed of ash which is surrounded by rocks.&lt;ref name="herrera21"/&gt; The use of wood fired forges have diminished the surrounding forests by up to seventy percent.&lt;ref name="herrera25"&gt;Herrera, p 25&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PunzoWorkshop82.JPG|thumb|Beginning the decorative process of a vase]]
The quantity of copper needed for any given piece is carefully calculated before any working begins.&lt;ref name="gmasters329330"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horcasitas140"&gt;Horcasitas, p 140&lt;/ref&gt; The basic process is hammering, thinning out, shaping, trimming, bleaching, polishing and decoration, especially by embossing.&lt;ref name="herrera23"&gt;Herrera, p 23&lt;/ref&gt; To begin work, the block or pieces is heated to red-hot. The first round of hammering is usually to flatten the piece into a circle which is usually done by a group of man wielding sledgehammers. Smaller hammers are used as the piece thins out and to make the sides curve up to form a vessel. The work needs to be precise as it is almost impossible to correct errors in the shaping without starting over. This is particularly true for very small pieces.&lt;ref name="horcasitas140141"&gt;Horcasitas, p 140-141&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the basic shape includes animal heads or feet to function as handles or stabilizers for the pot.&lt;ref name="gmasters305306"/&gt; Many different types of tools are used, many of which are made in the same workshop as the copper pieces. They include chisels, pliers, tongs, scissors, shears, punches, mallets, various anvils and hammers which are used to shape and emboss the pieces.&lt;ref name="gmasters329330"/&gt;  Modern techniques can diminish the efforts of thinning out the metal by seventy percent, but most workshops still do it the old fashioned way.&lt;ref name="herrera23"/&gt;
After the basic shape is obtained, the decorative and finishing work begins. The embossing, also called [[repoussé and chasing|repoussé]], is a form of decorating the basic shape of a vessel or other piece. It consists of hammering the piece from the inside to push the shape outwards. After this shape is made, details are added by chiseling and engraving.&lt;ref name="gmasters329330"/&gt; Etching may be done with acid or with a chisel.&lt;ref name="herrera23"/&gt;  To give pieces an added shine, they are treated with [[sulfuric acid]], soap, water and steel wool.&lt;ref name="gmasters329330"/&gt;

Most of the work is the making casseroles, pots, plates, jars, vases, ashtrays, bells, mugs, [[still]]s, [[brazier]]s and hearths. Some jewelry is made but it is not the main focus.&lt;ref name="herrera23"/&gt; Almost all of the objects are hammered into shape from a single piece or block of copper, including details like handles and decorative figures which are shaped along with the main body. This eliminates the need for soldering.&lt;ref name="gmasters329330"/&gt;

==Noted copper artisans==
The Punzo Ángel family are well known in Santa Clara del Cobre for their copper work. Two of the most active smiths in the family, Abdón and Ignacio maintain large active workshops and have trained their children in the techniques that they have learned from their father. They create mostly large pieces with innovative designs with are often detailed. They also work in silver. Both have received a large number of acknowledgements and awards for their work.&lt;ref name="gmasters329330"/&gt;&lt;ref name="señores"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los señores del martillo |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/suplementos/2011/317881/6/los-senores-del-martillo.htm |newspaper= El Informador |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=August 28, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The lords of the hammer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesús Pérez Ornelas is considered to be the master of engraving and [[sgraffito]] in copper because of his designs and the quality of the finishes. He has worked abroad and spends much of his time teaching his techniques of hammering copper. His works are generally covered with engraved designs which include frets, animals, [[rhombus]] shapes, flowers and more.&lt;ref name="gmasters305306"/&gt;

==Feria del Cobre==
The first Feria del Cobre was held in Santa Clara in 1946 held in August to coincide with the feast day of the patron saint of [[St. Clare of Assisi|Saint Claire]] .&lt;ref name="herrera20"/&gt;  The Feria del Cobre exhibits hundreds of pieces of hammered copper from about 250 artisans, demonstrations of copper working techniques and more. The main event is the Concurso Nacional de Cobre Martilado (National Hammered Copper Contest).  The contest has four categories: Maestros (Masters), Jóvenes (Youth), Nuevos talentos (New talents) and Infantiles (Children) with over 84 prizes.The event drew over 6,000 people in 2010. The fair has been held each year since 1965.&lt;ref name="arranca"&gt;{{cite news |title= Arranca la Feria del Cobre en Michoacán |author= Gibrán Valdez Durán |url= http://www.oem.com.mx/laprensa/notas/n1734241.htm |newspaper= El Occidental |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=May 12, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Copper Fair im Michoacán starts up }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tropicália''' ({{IPA-pt|tɾopiˈkaʎɐ, tɾɔpiˈkaljɐ}}), also known as '''Tropicalismo''' {{IPA-pt|tɾopikɐˈlizmu, tɾɔpikaˈ-|}}, was a Brazilian artistic movement that arose in the late 1960s. It encompassed art forms such as theatre, poetry, and music. The movement was characterized by a combination of the popular and the avant-garde, as well as a fusion of traditional Brazilian culture with foreign influences.

Today, Tropicália is chiefly associated with the musical faction of the movement, which merged [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian]] and [[Music of Africa|African rhythms]] with [[pop-rock]]. Musicians who were part of the movement include [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Os Mutantes]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Tom Zé]], and the poet/lyricist [[Torquato Neto]], all of whom participated in the 1968 album ''[[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis]]'', which served as a musical manifesto.

==Background==
A dominant principle of Tropicália was [[antropofagia]], a type of cultural cannibalism that encouraged the conflation of disparate influences, out of which could be created something unique. The idea was originally put forth by poet [[Oswald de Andrade]] in his ''[[Manifesto Antropófago]]'', published in 1928, and was developed further by the tropicalistas in the 1960s.

==Musical movement==
[[File:Caetano Veloso no III Festival da Música Popular.tif|thumb|[[Caetano Veloso]] performing at the third Popular Music Festival, October 21, 1967. [[Brazilian National Archives]].]]
The 1968 album [[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis]] is regarded as the musical manifesto of the Tropicália movement. Although it was a collaborative project, the main creative forces behind the album were [[Caetano Veloso]] and [[Gilberto Gil]]. The album experimented with unusual time signatures and unorthodox song structures, and also mixed tradition with innovation. Politically, the album expressed criticism of the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|coup d'état of 1964]]. Key artists of the movement include ''[[Os Mutantes|Os Mutantes]]'', ''[[Gilberto Gil|Gilberto Gil]]'', ''[[Gal Costa|Gal Costa]]'' and ''[[Caetano Veloso|Caetano Veloso]]''.{{cn|date=October 2018}} According to [[Maya Jaggi]], "Gil was partly inspired by [[Jorge Ben Jor]], a Rio musician on the fringes of the movement, who mixed urban samba and bossa nova with rhythm and blues, soul and funk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jaggi|first=Maya|authorlink=Maya Jaggi|date=13 May 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/may/13/popandrock|title=Blood on the Ground|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anarchistic, anti-authoritarian musical and lyrical expressions of the ''Tropicalistas'' soon made them a target of censorship and repression by the military junta that ruled Brazil in this period, as did the fact some of the collective, including Veloso and Gil, also actively participated in anti-government demonstrations. The Tropicalistas' passionate interest in the new wave of American and British psychedelic music of the period - most notably the work of [[The Beatles]] - also put them at odds with Marxist-influenced students on Brazil's left, whose aesthetic agenda was strongly nationalistic, and oriented towards 'traditional' Brazilian musical forms. This leftist faction vigorously rejected anything - especially Tropicalismo - which they perceived as being tainted by the corrupting influences of Western capitalist popular culture. The politico-artistic tensions between leftist students and the Tropicalistas reached a climax in September 1968, with Caetano Veloso's watershed performances at the third International Song Festival, held in the auditorium of Rio's Catholic University, where the audience not surprisingly included a large contingent of left-wing students.

[[File:Gal Costa.tif|thumb|left|upright|[[Gal Costa]] in 1969. [[Brazilian National Archives]].]]
Veloso had won a major song prize at the previous year's Festival, when he was backed by an Argentinian rock band, and although his unconventional performance caused some initial consternation, he managed to win over the crowd and was feted as a new star of Brazilian popular music. By late 1968, however, Veloso was fully immersed in the Tropicalia experiment, and his performances, which were expressly intended as provocative art "happenings", caused a near-riot. In the first round of the competition on 12 September, Veloso was initially greeted by enthusiastic applause, but the mood quickly changed when the music started. Veloso came on dressed in a bright green plastic tunic, festooned with electrical wires and necklaces strung with animal teeth, and his backing band Os Mutantes were also dressed in similarly outlandish attire. The ensemble launched into a barrage of psychedelic music, played at high volume, and Veloso further outraged the students with his overtly sexual stage movements. The crowd reacted angrily, shouting abuse at the performers and booing loudly, and their fury was only exacerbated by the surprise appearance of an American pop singer, [[John Dandurand]], who joined Veloso on stage and grunted incoherently into the microphone. 

[[File:Os Mutantes.tif|thumb|Os Mutantes, 1972. [[Brazilian National Archives]].]]
After such a powerful negative reaction, Veloso was unsure whether to appear in the second round on 15 September, but his manager convinced him to go on, and this chaotic  performance was recorded live and later released as a single. The students in the audience began hissing as soon as Veloso's name was announced, even before he had even taken the stage. Wearing the same green costume (minus the wires and necklaces), Veloso came on with Os Mutantes amid a storm of catcalls, and the group launched into a provocative new song Veloso had written for the occasion, "É Proibido Proibir" ("It is Forbidden to Forbid"), the title of which he had taken from a photo of a Parisian protest poster, which he had seen reproduced in a local magazine. The booing and jeering was soon so loud that Veloso struggled to be heard over the din, and he again deliberately taunted the leftists with his sexualised stage actions. Within a short time the performers were being pelted with fruit, vegetables, eggs and a rain of paper balls, and a section of the audience expressed their disapproval by standing up and turning their backs to the performers, prompting Os Mutantes to respond in kind by turning their backs on the audience. Infuriated by the students' reaction, Veloso stopped singing and launched into a furious improvised monologue, haranguing the students for their behaviour and denouncing what he saw as their cultural conservatism. He was then joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support for Veloso, and as the tumult reached a crescendo, Veloso announced he was withdrawing from the competition, and after deliberately finishing the song out of tune, the Tropicalistas defiantly walked offstage, arm-in-arm.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Langland, "Il est Interdit d’Interdire: The Transnational Experience of 1968 in Brazil", ''Estudios Interdisciplinarios de América Latina y el Caribe'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1969, Veloso and Gil were arrested and imprisoned by the military government over the political content of their work. After two months, the two were released and subsequently forced to seek exile in [[London]], where they lived and resumed their musical careers until they were able to return to Brazil in 1972. 

In 1993, Veloso and Gil released the album ''[[:pt:Tropicália 2|Tropicália 2]]'', celebrating 25 years of the movement and commemorating their earlier musical experiments.&lt;ref name=behague&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[Béhague, Gerard]] |date=Spring–Summer 2006 |title=Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985&amp;ndash;95) |journal=Latin American Music Review |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=79–90 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/latin_american_music_review/v027/27.1behague08.html |doi=10.1353/lat.2006.0021 |first1=Gerard. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Carmen Miranda in The Gang's All Here trailer cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Carmen Miranda]] in 1950. Although initially despised by national intellectuals, Miranda's [[kitsch]] and [[campy]] aesthetic exaggeration and association with a tropical, stereotypical Brazil was embraced by tropicália.]]
The singer and actress [[Carmen Miranda]] is considered a forerunner of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tropicalia.com.br/ruidos-pulsativos/geleia-geral/carmen-miranda Carmen Miranda - Tropicália]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropicalismo has been cited as an influence by rock musicians such as [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]], [[Beck]], [[The Bird and the Bee]], [[Arto Lindsay]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[El Guincho]], [[Of Montreal]], and [[Nelly Furtado]]. In 1998, [[Beck]] released ''[[Mutations (Beck album)|Mutations]]'', the title of which is a tribute to Os Mutantes. Its hit single, "[[Tropicalia (Beck song)|Tropicalia]]", reached number 21 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Modern Rock singles chart.

In 2002 Caetano Veloso published an account of the Tropicália movement, ''Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil''.  The 1999 compilation ''Tropicália Essentials'', featuring songs by [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Tom Zé]], and [[Os Mutantes]], is an introduction to the style. Other compilations include ''The Tropicalia Style'' (1996), ''Tropicália 30 Anos'' (1997), ''Tropicalia: Millennium'' (1999), ''Tropicalia: Gold'' (2002), and ''Novo Millennium: Tropicalia'' (2005). Yet another compilation, ''Tropicalia: A Brazilian Revolution In Sound'', was released to acclaim in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/various/tropicalia |title=Tropicalia: A Brazilian Revolution In Sound |accessdate=2008-05-16 |author=Staff |work=[[Metacritic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 documentary film, ''Tropicália'', was made on the subject and artists in general; directed by Brazilian filmmaker Marcelo Machado, where [[Fernando Meirelles]] served as one of its executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1497880/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wimmelbilderbuch''' (German, literally "teeming picture book"), '''wimmelbook''', or '''hidden picture book''' is a type of large-format, wordless [[picture book]]. It is characterized by [[Book design#Page spread|full-spread]] drawings (sometimes across [[gatefold]] pages) depicting scenes richly detailed with humans, animals, and objects. Typically made for children, the drawings are filled with characters and items that may be discovered.

[[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] and [[Hans Jurgen Press]] are regarded as the fathers of the format.  Contemporary Wimmelbook authors include [[Richard Scarry]], [[Ali Mitgutsch]], [[Rotraut Susanne Berner]], and [[:de:Eva Scherbarth|Eva Scherbarth]]. In the United Kingdom and the United States, Wimmelbooks gained popularity with the success of the ''[[Where's Wally?]]'' series by the British illustrator [[Martin Handford]].
