The '''Accession Day tilts''' were a series of elaborate festivities held annually at the court of [[Elizabeth I of England]] to celebrate her [[Accession Day]], 17&amp;nbsp;November, also known as Queen's Day.&lt;ref&gt;which was elevated into a [[Protestant]] [[feast day]] by adding it to the [[Anglican]] [[Church calendar]]: "All over England the Queen's subjects expressed their joy in her Government by prayers and sermons, bell-ringing, bonfires and feasting", notes Roy C. Strong, "The Popular Celebration of the Accession Day of Queen Elizabeth I" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''21'''.1/2 (January 1958:86-103) p 87; see also, whereon sttod a [[Lion and Unicorn|lyon and a dragon]], supporters Strong (1984):19 and Hutton 1994:146-151&lt;/ref&gt;  The tilts combined [[theatre|theatrical]] elements with [[jousting]], in which Elizabeth's [[courtier]]s competed to outdo each other in [[allegory|allegorical]] [[armour]] and [[costume]], [[poetry]], and [[Medieval pageant|pageant]]ry to exalt the queen and her realm of [[England]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Strong 1977, p. 129-133&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Elizabethan Accession Day tilt was held in November 1602; the queen died the following spring.  Tilts continued as part of festivities marking the Accession Day of [[James I of England|James I]], 24&amp;nbsp;March, until 1624, the year before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1987):137-138; Young, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Henryleegarniture.jpg|thumb|left|The Greenwich garniture of [[Sir Henry Lee]], in the Jacob Album]]
Sir [[Henry Lee of Ditchley]], [[Queen's Champion]], devised the Accession Day tilts, which became the most important [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] court festival from the 1580s.&lt;ref&gt;Festivities surrounding installations of the [[Order of the Garter]] were less frequent, less elaborate and less public.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrations are likely to have begun somewhat informally in the early 1570s.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; By 1581, the Queen's Day tilts "had been deliberately developed into a gigantic public spectacle eclipsing every other form of court festival", with thousands in attendance; the public were admitted for a small charge.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, p. 133, &amp; 1984:51&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee himself oversaw the annual festivities until he retired as Queen's Champion at the tilt of 1590, handing over the role to [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]].&lt;ref&gt;The ceremonial transfer is described in detail in Yates, p. 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Lee's retirement, orchestration of the tilts fell to the [[Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester|Earl of Worcester]] in his capacity of [[Master of Horse]] and to the queen's [[favourite]], the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], although Lee remained as a sort of Master of Ceremonies at the request of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The pageants were held at the [[tiltyard]] at the [[Palace of Whitehall]],&lt;ref&gt;except in 1593, when they were relocated to the grounds of [[Windsor Castle]] due to an outbreak of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in [[London]]; see Young, p. 122, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; where the royal party viewed the festivities from the Tiltyard Gallery.  The [[Office of Works]] constructed a platform with staircases below the gallery to facilitate presentations to the queen.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 119-122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
[[Image:Devereaux essex4.jpg|left|thumb|[[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] in "sable sad" armour, probably for the Tilt of 1590,&lt;ref&gt;Young p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; by [[William Segar]].]]

===Knights===
Tilt lists for the Accession Day pageants have survived; these establish that the majority of the participating jousters came from the ranks of the Queen's [[Gentlemen Pensioners]].  Entrants included such powerful members of the court as the [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], the [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]], the [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]], Lord [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Howard of Effingham]],&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; and the Earl of Essex.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;Hutton 1994, p. 146-151&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those participating had seen active service in Ireland or on the Continent, but the atmosphere of romance and entertainment seems to have predominated over the serious military exercises that were medieval tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1984):51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir James Scudamore]], a knight who tilted in the 1595 tournament, was immortalized as "Sir Scudamour" in Book Four of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' by [[Edmund Spenser]].
[[File:Scudamorehelmet.jpg|thumb|[[Greenwich armour]] of [[Sir James Scudamore]], 1590s. Jousting was crucial to Scudamore's reputation at court.&lt;ref&gt;The armet shown was made by restorer Daniel Tachaux in 1915 to replace the missing original, and faithfully reproduces the style's distinctive high visor.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Knights participating in the spectacle entered in pageant cars or on horseback, disguised as some heroic, romantic, or [[metaphor]]ical figure, with their servants in [[fancy dress]] according to the theme of the entry.  A squire presented a [[Card stock|pasteboard]] pageant shield decorated with the character's [[Personal device|device]] or ''impresa'' to the Queen and explained the significance of his disguise in prose or poetry.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Strong 1977, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Entrants went to considerable expense to devise themes, order armour and costumes for their followers, and in some cases to hire poets or dramatists and even professional actors to carry out their programmes.  

Classical, [[pastoral]], and [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] settings were typically combined with story lines flattering to the queen, but serious subtexts were common, especially among those who used these occasions to express public contrition or desolation for having aroused the queen's displeasure, or to plead for royal favour.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 167-77&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting on the left, Essex wears black (sable) armour, which he wore as part of his 1590 entrance to the tilts.  At this particular tilt, Essex entered as the head of a funeral procession, carried on a bier by his attendants.  This was meant to atone for his failure to subdue Ireland, but Elizabeth was not impressed and did not forgive him readily.

===Poets===
Poets associated with court circles who wrote allegorical verses to accompany the knights' presentations include [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]], [[Edward de Vere]], [[Philip Sidney]]&lt;ref&gt;'Two Songs for an Accession Day Tilt', in ''Sir Philip Sidney: The Major Works'', Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-284080-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the young [[Francis Bacon]], who composed speeches and helped stage presentations for his [[patron]], the Earl of Essex.&lt;ref&gt;'A Conference of Pleasure' (speeches composed for the Earl of Essex for the Queen’s Accession Day Tilt, 1594): 'In Praise of Knowledge', 'In Praise of Fortitude', 'In Praise of Love', 'In Praise of Truth'; 'The Device of the Indian Prince' (Speeches composed for the Earl of Essex for the Queen’s Accession Day Tilt, 1594): 'Squire', 'Hermit', 'Soldier', 'Statesman'.   [http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-dates.html Dates of Francis Bacon's works, retrieved 29 November 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011022037/http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-dates.html |date=October 11, 2007 }}; and see Strong (1987), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;  Sidney, in particular, as both poet and knight, embodied the [[chivalry|chivalric]] themes of the tilts; a remembrance of Sidney was part of the tilt programme of 1586, the year after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney's friend and protégé [[Sir James Scudamore]], who would go on to be one of the primary competitors in the Accession Day tilt in 1595, carried the pennant of Sidney's arms at the age of eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;Atherton, Ian. Ambition and Failure in Stuart England: The Career of John, First Viscount Scudamore, Manchester University Press, 1999. p.34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Spenser]] wrote of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', which turns upon the Accession Day festivities as its fundamental structural device: "I devise that the Faery Queen kept her Annuall feast xii. days, upon which xii. severall days, the occasions of the xii. severall adventures hapned&lt;!--hapned in original--&gt;, which being undertaken by xii. severall knights, are in these xii. books severally handled and discoursed";&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Spenser to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] quoted in Roy C. Strong 1958:86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A visitor's account==
[[File:Armor Garniture of George Clifford (1558–1605), Third Earl of Cumberland MET DP295743.jpg|thumb|[[Greenwich armour]] of [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]] (1558–1605), 1586.  This has a different design to that in the miniature by [[Nicholas Hilliard]] (at top).]]
The fullest straightforward account of a Tilt is by Lupold von Wedel, a German traveller who saw the 1584 celebrations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now approached the day, when on November 17 the tournament was to be held... About twelve o’clock the queen and her ladies placed themselves at the windows in a long room at Weithol [Whitehall] palace, near Westminster, opposite the barrier where the tournament was to be held. From this room a broad staircase led downwards, and round the barrier stands were arranged by boards above the ground, so that everybody by paying 12d. would get a stand and see the play... Many thousand spectators, men, women and girls, got places, not to speak of those who were within the barrier and paid nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the whole time of the tournament all those who wished to fight entered the list by pairs, the trumpets being blown at the time and other musical instruments. The combatants had their servants clad in different colours, they, however, did not enter the barrier, but arranged themselves on both sides. Some of the servants were disguised like savages, or like Irishmen, with the hair hanging down to the girdle like women, others had horses equipped like elephants, some carriages were drawn by men, others appeared to move by themselves; altogether the carriages were very odd in appearance. Some gentlemen had their horses with them and mounted in full armour directly from the carriage. There were some who showed very good horsemanship and were also in fine attire. The manner of the combat each had settled before entering the lists. The costs amounted to several thousand pounds each.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a gentleman with his servants approached the barrier, on horseback or in a carriage, he stopped at the foot of the staircase leading to the queen’s room, while one of his servants in pompous attire of a special pattern mounted the steps and addressed the queen in well-composed verses or with a ludicrous speech, making her and her ladies laugh. When the speech was ended he in the name of his lord offered to the queen a costly present.. .Now always two by two rode against each other, breaking lances across the beam.. . The fête lasted until five o’clock in the afternoon...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shafe.co.uk/art/Tudor_13_-_Tournaments_and_Royal_Progresses.asp SHAFE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203170842/http://www.shafe.co.uk/art/Tudor_13_-_Tournaments_and_Royal_Progresses.asp |date=December 3, 2008 }} Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, New Series IX (1895)pp. 258-9, quoted Strong, 1984, Yates ''Astrea'' etc&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Agris Helmet ''' ({{lang-fr|'''Casque d'Agris'''}}) is a ceremonial [[Celts|Celtic]] helmet from {{circa|350}}&amp;nbsp;BC that was found in a cave near [[Agris]], Charente, France, in 1981.
It is a masterpiece of [[Celtic art]], and would probably have been used for display rather than worn in battle.
The helmet consists of an iron cap completely covered with bands of bronze.
The bronze is in turn covered with unusually pure gold leaf, with embedded coral decorations attached using silver rivets.
One of the cheek guards was also found and has similar materials and designs.
The helmet is mostly decorated in early Celtic patterns but there are later Celtic motifs and signs of Etruscan or Greek influence.
The quality of the gold indicates that the helmet may well have been made locally in the Atlantic region.

==Discovery==

The Agris helmet was found in a cave near [[Angoulême]] in 1981.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
The Perrats cave had been known for just over a week when [[caver]]s found two contiguous parts of the front of the helmet on 9–10 May 1981.
The fragments were on a cone of debris thrown out from a badger burrow in the cave's main chamber.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
An excavation team was quickly formed to search the site. They found scraps of gold leaf, two fragments that joined to form a larger triangular piece, and then the helmet itself, which was well-preserved other than the part that had been torn off by the badgers.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}

The site shows signs of having been occupied from the [[Bronze Age]] through the [[Iron Age]], the Gallo-Roman period and into the [[Middle Ages]].
The entrance collapsed and closed the cave in the 13th or 14th century AD.{{sfn|Gomez|1983|p=196}}
At the time of discovery almost all the parts of the helmet had been disturbed by burrowing animals.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
In 1983, the cheek guard and three fragments of ornamentation from the side of the helmet were discovered during excavations.
Other fragments were found in 1986, including the base of the helmet's crest, several meters from where the helmet had been found.
They seem to have been carried there accidentally, either by people or by badgers.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The second cheek guard and the ornamentation of the summit of the helmet have not been found.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}

The government bought the found objects from the proprietor of the land.
The helmet was restored by Laszlo von Lehóczky at the [[Romano-Germanic Central Museum (Mainz)]].{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
It is now held by the ''[[Musée d'Angoulême]]'' in [[Angoulême]], France.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}{{efn|It is sometimes reported that the helmet was given to the Archaeological and Historical Society of the Charente. This is incorrect.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}} }}
The helmet is considered one of the masterpieces of Celtic art and has been featured in several international exhibitions.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
It has even formed the basis for a graphic novel, ''Le casque d'Agris'' (2005).{{sfn|Luccisano|2005}}

==Context==
{{Location map|France|caption=Location of [[Agris]] to the west of the [[Massif Central]] in France|relief=y|lat_deg= 45.7755|lon_deg=0.3358}}
Excavations in 2002 show that the cave entrance was guarded by a mud wall and a ditch, and would have been a sanctuary until the early [[Roman Empire]].
The helmet is isolated, with no sign of a human burial, and was buried deliberately.
At the time of burial at least some of the external ornaments had been broken off and placed in the interior of the helmet.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
The helmet had been carefully placed.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}
The archaeologists who found it think it may have been buried as part of a ritual to the underworld spirits.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
Roman sources say that the Celtic warriors generally did not wear helmets.{{sfn|Green|2012|p=43}}
The helmet would have been used for display, and would have indicated the high rank of the owner, or their wish to obtain such a rank.{{sfn|Green|2012|p=376}}

The helmet dates from the early period of the [[La Tène culture]].{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}
The gold leaf is extremely pure, and the helmet may be one of the oldest refined gold objects of Western Europe.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=18}}
It was found further west than most other examples of high-status La Tène metalwork.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
A few similar objects have been found in France at [[Amfreville-sous-les-Monts]] (Normandy), [[Saint-Jean-Trolimon]] (Brittany) and Montlaurès near [[Narbonne]] (Aude) and in Italy at [[Canosa di Puglia|Canosa (Puglia)]].{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}

The design of the inner iron cap is similar to that of a series of helmets that have mostly been found in the Central Alps.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The veneer of bronze strips recalls Italian helmets of the [[Montefortino]] type.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The [[palmette]]-based design links it to the early style of the La Tène culture.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
Most of the motifs in the decoration belong to the first western style of the culture, or are closely derived from this style.
Other motifs are from an intermediate stage with the [[Waldalgesheim style]].{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}

Authorities differ on the date of the helmet.
In a 2001 paper José Gomez De Soto suggests the middle or the second half of the 4th century.{{sfn|Gomez de Soto|2001|p=213}}
D. W. Harding says the stratigraphic association of the helmet with a Dux-type ''[[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]'' from La Tène B and other signs indicate that it was made in the later part of the 4th century.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
However, in a 2010 paper Gomez de Soto and Stephane Verger conclude that the decorations, when viewed as a whole, indicate that the helmet was made in the 2nd quarter or the middle of the 4th century.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

==Structure==
[[File:Casque d'Agris, musée d'Angoulême, Lamiot 2015 01.JPG|thumb|View of the helmet showing the neck guard (lower left) and cheek protector (lower center)]]
The helmet has been described as having a jockey-cap shape, but the "bill" of the cap is actually a neck-guard.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=75}}
It is {{convert|21.4|cm}} high and {{convert|23|by|19|cm}} laterally.{{sfn|Eluère|1984|p=110}}
The inner cap of the helmet is of iron, now heavily corroded.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
It is made of a single piece of hammered iron, with the neck guard riveted to the back.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}
The iron is entirely covered by ornamental bronze bands with low-relief decoration formed partly by [[casting]] and partly by [[repoussé and chasing]].{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}
The four wide horizontal strips of bronze are fully covered with gold leaf on the outside surface.
The decorations include embedded [[cabochon]]s of shaped and polished [[Precious coral|coral]].{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}

All the relief decorations were formed on the bronze strips before the [[gold leaf]] was applied.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The gold leaf, about 70 microns thick, was affixed by pressing it closely onto the bronze relief with a tool that may have been made of wood or bone.
The gold leaf would have been held in place by the grooves and imitation [[filigree]] in the bronze.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=10}}
The coral cabochons were attached to the bronze by silver rivets whose heads are decorated with motifs such as diamonds or palm leaves.{{efn|The rivets are made of an alloy with at least 80% silver, 20% gold and almost 1% copper. This would have been relatively easy to work, but stronger than pure gold or silver.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=12}} }}{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=12}}
Sometimes the hollow that holds the coral was at least partially gold-covered before the coral was placed.
Gold leaf was then applied generously around the coral to form a small cup.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=11}}

There is a finely wrought cheek-piece.{{sfn|Green|2012|p=43}}
The cheek guard (''paragnathide'') and the side and top ornaments used the same materials and techniques as the main helmet.
There are signs that organic materials such as wood and leather were also used.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

==Decoration==

The helmet is particularly richly ornamented.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}
The main theme is a series of palmettes, with many of the palmettes and studs infilled with coral.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
The ornamentation is arranged into three superimposed bands completely covered by compositions inspired by plants.
The many different patterns combined into complex compositions make the headpiece one of the richest of ancient Celtic artworks.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

In the lower and upper panels a series of unconnected palmettes are arranged formally in friezes.
The central panel decorations are based on a formal arrangement of S-curves terminating in swelling leaves, with a  filler pattern that includes palmettes, comma-leaves and over-and-under tendrils.
The neck-guard has a less formal and more fluid pattern.
The cheek guard has a palmette design in which may be seen a curled serpent that appears to be horned.
Horned serpents are often found in Romano-Celtic works in Britain and France, but very rarely in early La Tène.
The depiction on the helmet may have some special significance.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}

The decoration mainly reflects the 5th century Early Style of Celtic Art, but some motifs are characteristic of the Waldalgesheim style of the 4th century,{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}
The central panel designs show similarities to the [[Waldalgesheim]] bracelets.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
This indicates that the helmet was made in the first half of the 4th century.
The large palmettes with seven petals in the lower band and the main frieze in the central band may have been inspired by architectural [[terracotta]] from [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrrhenian]] central Italy in the 5th and 4th centuries.
The neck guard combines Waldalgesheim style with elements of 4th century Greek or Etruscan work.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

==Origin==
[[File:Casque d'Amfreville Eure.jpg|thumb|The Amfreville helmet, another Celtic prestige helmet from the Atlantic region.]]
Three main regions of the Celtic world have been proposed as the origin of the helmet. The first is the northern or central Adriatic region of Italy.
Some think the new plant-style compositions were developed by Celtic craftsmen who settled in Italy and were influenced by Etruscan or Greek craftsmen with whom they had direct contact.
The complexity of the montage and decoration may be explained by proximity to advanced metalworking centers such as those of [[Taranto]] or [[Campania]].
The objection is that all Celtic helmets from the period found in Italy were in one piece.
Those with riveted neck guards have all been found in the Alps, the regions north of the Alps or the Atlantic region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}

The second proposed region of origin is the North Alpine area that formed the ancient center of Celtic culture.
The materials and techniques, and the general composition and decoration, seem to place the work among the best 5th century Celtic works from this region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}
The conical shape of the top of the helmet seems to be derived from Celtic helmets from the start of the second Iron Age.
Where these were decorated, the decorations were in superimposed bands.
Some details of the plant ornamentation are very similar to small Celtic ornaments from Austria, the Alpine regions and western Switzerland.
This is the area where helmets with riveted neck guards are found most often.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}

The third possibility is that the helmet was made in the area where it was found.
It is one of a small set of prestige helmets that were mostly found in western France, the most famous being the completely decorated helmet of [[Amfreville-sous-les-Monts]] in the Eure.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}
All were made of an iron or bronze cap covered with bands of another metal that were completely decorated.
They have red ornaments, mostly coral.
Riveted neck pieces are also found in this region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}

Gold samples from various parts of the helmet are exceptionally pure, typically 99% gold, 0.5% silver and 0.2% copper.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}
This degree of purity is very unusual in the ancient world.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}
Analysis of Greek and Etruscan objects of the period shows much higher silver content.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=18}}
Most ancient objects with this degree of purity have been found to the southwest of the [[Loire]], the region that includes Agris.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=18}}
The only comparable objects are 3rd century Celtic jewelry from this region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}
Probably the helmet was made in the West by craftsmen trained in the North Alpine School.{{sfn|Gomez de Soto|2001|p=213}}
The gold may well have come from mines in the west of the [[Massif Central]], which had been in operation since at least the 5th century BC.
Other high-quality works of Celtic art have been found in the Western region, so a local provenance is entirely possible.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3775">'''Al-Qatt Al-Asiri''' (also called '''''nagash'' painting''' or '''''majlis'' painting'''), is an Arabic art style. It originated in the decoration of [[majlis|''majlis'']] (the front parlour of traditional Arab homes) in the [[Asir]] province of [[Saudi Arabia]] and adjoining parts of [[Yemen]]. These wall paintings, typically in the form of a of [[mural]] or [[fresco]], present geometric designs in bright colors. Called ''nagash'' in Arabic, the wall paintings are often considered a mark of pride for a woman.&lt;ref name="Aramco"&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201304/the.majlis.painters.htm Yunis, Alia, "The Majlis Painters,"] Saudi Aramco World Magazine, July/August 2013, pages 24-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Intangible cultural heritage|Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] in 2017 as Al-Qatt Al-Asiri.&lt;ref name='UNESCO'&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Qatt Al-Asiri|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/al-qatt-al-asiri-female-traditional-interior-wall-decoration-in-asir-saudi-arabia-01261|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometric designs and heavy lines seem to be adapted from the area’s textile and weaving patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199901/doors.of.the.kingdom.htm Maha Al Faisal and Khalid Azzam. 1999]. "Doors of the Kingdom" Saudi Aaramco World. This article appeared on pages 68-77 of the January/February 1999 print edition of Saudi Aramco World]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women’s artwork==
Women in the Asir region are traditionally responsible for plastering and painting the walls, corridors, and ceilings of their homes. A family’s wealth often is signified by the skill, color, and complexity of the paintings, with poorer homes decorated in basic straight, simple lines in red, green, yellow, and brown. Women within the same neighborhood sometimes compete to make the most vivid and extravagant designs. Several Saudi women have become famous as ''majlis'' painters, such as [[Fatima Abou Gahas]].&lt;ref name="Aramco"/&gt; Women's artwork is heavily influenced by their love for music, their view of culture and general perception of life; for example, the artwork of more conservative women is more likely to feature conservative and modest colors.

The interior walls of the home are brightly painted, employing defined patterns of lines, triangles, squares, diagonals and tree-like patterns.&lt;ref name="Aramco"/&gt;

Women from the region sometimes sell miniature ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Asiri'' houses as souvenirs and [[knickknack]]s, which are popular among Saudi city-dwellers, who find these colorful houses a source of wonder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199804/the.suqs.of.asir.htm|author=Ni'Mah Isma'il Nawwab|year=1998|title=The Suqs of 'Asir}} This article appeared on pages 2-9 of the July/August 1998 print edition of Saudi Aramco World.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airport art==
The Saudi provincial airport in [[Abha]] reflects the region's cultural heritage. Airport Director Abdul Aziz Abu Harba said that "the seating arrangement at the airport lounge has been in the form of a traditional ''majlis'' and the walls are painted in various colors reflecting the natural beauty of Asir".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/378076|author= Mishaal Al-Tamimi|title=2011 "Abha airport reflects heritage|publisher=Arab News|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''All the Young Men''''' is a 1960 [[Korean War]] [[feature film]] starring [[Alan Ladd]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] dealing with [[desegregation in the United States Marine Corps]]. Poitier plays a sergeant unexpectedly placed in command of the survivors of a [[platoon]] in the [[Korean War]]. The film explores the [[Executive Order 9981|racial integration]] of the American military, centering on the [[African-American]] sergeant's struggle to win the trust and respect of the men in his unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939200,00.html |title=Cinema: The New Pictures, Aug. 29, 1960 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
When a lieutenant is mortally wounded in a winter ambush that decimates his platoon, he passes command to the highest ranking survivor, Sergeant Towler ([[Sidney Poitier]]). However, with the exception of African-American Towler, all of the men left alive are white. Towler feels Private Kincaid ([[Alan Ladd]]), an ex-sergeant with eleven years experience (demoted for doing things his way), is better suited for command, but the lieutenant orders him to take charge and complete their vital mission: to take and hold a farmhouse strategically positioned in a mountain pass for the advance of their [[battalion]]. After the lieutenant dies, [[White Southerners|Southerner]] Private Bracken ([[Paul Richards (actor)|Paul Richards]]) initially refuses to take orders from Towler, but Towler forces him, at gunpoint, to back down. 

With their radio not working, Towler leads ten healthy survivors and a badly wounded Private Casey on a stretcher to their objective. As they warily approach the farmhouse, one soldier spots someone inside and throws a grenade, which wounds a Korean woman. The only other occupants are her young son and her adult, part-French daughter Maya. Kincaid and some of the others want to leave before the enemy attacks, but Towler keeps them there.

They repel an attack later that night. Hunter, a [[Navajo]], volunteers to scout the area in place of Towler. They agree on a password. Hunter is captured, but despite being hit repeatedly, refuses to say the password when he is forced toward the outpost manned by Towler and Kincaid. After his challenges are not answered, Towler fires, striking Hunter and some enemy soldiers. After the enemy is repelled, Hunter gives the password. Towler and Kincaid find him; he talks to Towler before dying.

Bracken tries to force himself on Maya. Her scream brings Towler, but Bracken ignores Towler's order to leave and strikes him. Towler knocks him down, but Bracken remains defiant.

Lazitech, manning the outpost, is the next casualty. At his own request, Casey is carried to a gunport to fight; he dies in the next assault. Towler and Kincaid start brawling when Towler catches Kincaid slacking off afterward, but they break off when they hear a tank approaching. After driving off the accompanying infantrymen with a machine gun, Towler and Kinkaid use kerosene and torches to set the tank on fire. When a tank man opens the hatch, Kinkaid tosses in a grenade. The tank runs over his leg when he jumps off; Corpsman Wade has to amputate it, but the only man who has the right type blood for a transfusion is Towler. The operation is a success, despite Wade's lack of training.

When a column of tanks is spotted, Towler sends his men and the civilians up the pass, while he goes back and carries Kinkaid to the outpost. Fortunately, friendly aircraft appear and bombard the enemy infantry as they advance, signalling the approach of the battalion.

==Production==
[[Hall Bartlett]] designed a film as a vehicle for [[Sidney Poitier]], based on the integration of the military in the [[Korean War]]. Bartlett came up with the original story with Gene Coon and wrote the script himself. He  aimed to make the film independently, though the exact start date was going to be dependent on Poitier's success in ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pryor|first1=Thomas M.|title=Poitier Will Play Marine in Movie — Signs to Star in 'All the Young Men' — Replacement Sought for Lana Turner|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/10/18/91424647.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=436|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=March 4, 1959|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Columbia Pictures]] agreed to finance on the proviso that Bartlett rewrite the script for a white co-star.  Bartlett found the only major star willing to do the movie was [[Alan Ladd]] who co-produced the film.&lt;ref name="Aram"&gt;pp.180-181 Goudsouzian, Aram '' Sidney Poitier: Man, Actor and Icon'' 2004 UNC Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ladd, Poitier to Co-Star in War Movie Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) [Chicago, Ill] 06 May 1959: b3.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartlett:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I could have done it [the film] on a shoestring in some canyon in the Hollywood Hills, but I felt that now is the time for me to prove myself with a picture in the million-plus category. I realized that I could not stay in my ivory tower forever, making nice, small, critically praised films. You don't go very far here if you're not successful when the right time comes.&lt;ref name="hal"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The film features an unusual cast who works well together. In addition to Ladd and Poitier, the cast includes comedian Mort Sahl, who does a comedy routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schumach|first1=Murray|title=U.S. Legionnaires to Hear Red Issue — California Unit Will Take Resolution Criticizing Film Industry to Convention|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/07/07/89219847.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=36|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=July 7, 1959|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Darren]] who sings the title song (he was meant to sing three songs in all&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ole in Warm Film to James Darren — Actor Will Join the Cast of 'All the Young Men' — 'Powder Keg' Planned|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/06/19/80586050.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=28|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=June 19, 1959|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and boxer [[Ingemar Johansson]] in his American film debut.

''All the Young Men'' was filmed in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in Montana and [[Mount Hood]], Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communitywalk.com/location/glacier_park_all/movies/1189617&lt;/ref&gt; Poitier's commitment to make the film meant he had to leave the run of ''A Raisin in the Sun'' early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zolotow|first1=Sam|title=Play is Canceled by Michael Ellis — Tryout of 'Intermission' by Ned Armstrong Dropped — Author Brings Charges|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/07/28/80540613.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=24|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=July 28, 1959|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia planned two separate advertising campaigns for the film to white and black audiences.&lt;ref&gt; ''Shared Pleasures: A History of Movie Presentation in the United States'', Gormery, Douglas, University of Wisconsin Press, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia also used [[Quentin Reynolds]] to promote the film in advertising campaigns.  A [[paperback]] novelisation of the film was written by [[Marvin Albert]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysteryfile.com/GM_Albert/goldmedal_albert.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marine Corps provided [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Clement J. Stadler, who had been awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/02_awards/index_nx/index-NXs.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[World War II]] as a [[technical advisor]]; a function he also performed in ''[[Hell to Eternity]]'', ''The Outsider'', ''[[Ambush Bay]]'' and ''[[The Lieutenant]]'' television series. The [[United States Marine Corps]] had disbanded separate black Marine units and bases since 18 November 1949.&lt;ref&gt; ''African-Americans at War:An Encyclopedia'', Sutherland, Jonathan, 2004 ABC-CLIO, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Bosley Crowther]], critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote, "Racial integration in the United States Marines is sluggishly celebrated in a variation on a well-used Western plot in the picture that opened at the Forum yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/08/27/archives/screen-korean-episode-bias-under-fire-seen-in-all-the-young-men.html |title=Screen: Korean Episode; Bias Under Fire Seen in 'All the Young Men' |author=Bosley Crowther |date=August 27, 1960 |newspaper=The New York Times |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Art and Scholasticism''''' ({{lang-fr|Art et scolastique}}) is a 1920 book by the philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]], his major contribution to [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hal05|Haldane 2005]]. p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gary Furnell, the work "was a key text that guided the work of writers such as [[Allen Tate]], [[Caroline Gordon]], Sally and [[Robert Fitzgerald]], [[François Mauriac|Francois Mauriac]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[John Howard Griffin]], [[Flannery O'Connor|Flannery O’Connor]] and [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fu15|Furnell 2015]]. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Maritain's Thomist-Aristotelian distinction between Art and Prudence was highly influential on the sculptor [[Eric Gill]], and were developed further in the seminal essay on theological aesthetics, entitled 'Art and Sacrament', by poet and painter [[David Jones (artist-poet)|David Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epoch and Artist|last=Jones|first=David|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|year=1955|isbn=978-0571242054|location=|pages=143-179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heikki Marila 01.JPG|thumb|[[Heikki Marila]], winner of First Prize, 2012]]
The '''Carnegie Art Award''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] art award event established in 1998 by Swedish financial group [[Carnegie Investment Bank]] to recognize and promote [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] [[contemporary art|contemporary painting]] and artists. With a total prize sum of SEK 2.1m, the Carnegie Art Award was one of the world’s largest art awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegieartaward.com/ Carnegie Art Award], Carnegie Investment Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event took place every second year from 2003 to 2014 and consisted of four parts: an exhibition on tour in all Nordic countries, a book and a film presenting the artists and their work, and the awards proper to the three winning artists. Further, one young artist was awarded a [[scholarship]]. 

In order to participate, artists had to be born or live in one of the Nordic countries. They could then be nominated by one of about 30 professionals in the field of contemporary art. A jury then selected the works to be included in the exhibition and the award winners.

'''Cross-Cultural Dance Resources''' ('''CCDR''') is a non-profit [[dance research]] organization in the United States, formed in 1981 and based in [[Tempe, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;"Cross-Cultural Dance Resources" in ''Associations Unlimited'', [[Thomson Gale]]&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains a non-lending library devoted to the study of dance, with over 15,000 shelved items&lt;ref name=herberger/&gt; plus the archives of [[Eleanor King]], [[Gertrude Prokosch Kurath]] and [[Joann Kealiinohomoku]]. The organization also produces the ''CCDR Newsletter'' (ISSN 1069-7241), which is issued twice per year and provides information on dance research, news, and upcoming events. In 2000, the organization was recognized for a special preservation award by the Dance Heritage Coalition, as well as being recognized by the [[White House Millennium Council]], as part of "[[Save America's Treasures]]".&lt;ref name=greatness&gt;{{cite news|title=Dancing into greatness|work=[[Asbury Park Press]]|date=2000-08-20|author=Collins, Karyn D.|quote=Preservation awards went to the Katherine Dunham Center in East St. Louis, Il., Cross-Cultural Dance Resources  in Flagstaff, Ariz., and the Halla Huhm Foundation in Honolulu. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehouse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/Initiatives/Millennium/AndersonCottage_ListofGrants.html|publisher=[[National Archives]]|accessdate=2008-06-03|title=President Clinton announces FY2000 Save America's Treasures grants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Founded in 1981, the CCDR's mission is to promote dance resources, preserve and research dance materials, and foster a dynamic environment for dance events. It provides consultation on [[dance theory]] and methods, [[ethnomusicology]], cultural dynamics and ethics.  The organization sponsors concerts and visiting artists and lectures.  CCDR also maintains a non lending library of over 15,000 shelved items, including artwork, audiovisual materials, books, clippings, monographs, periodicals, costumes, dolls, and musical instruments, as well as the archives of [[Gertrude Prokosch Kurath]], [[Eleanor King]], [[Joann Kealiinohomoku]] (in progress), and the [[Daniel J. Crowley]] musical instrument collection.

Since 1989, the organization's director is Joann Kealiinohomoku, known for her 1970 essay, "An Anthropologist Looks at Ballet as a Form of Ethnic Dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A forecast of dance's future|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=1989-07-02|author=Popper, Regina|quote=Joann Kealiinohomoku, a cultural anthropologist who directs Cross-Cultural Dance Resources in Flagstaff, Ariz., and who in 1970 wrote an essay titled ''An Anthropologist Looks at Ballet as a Form of Ethnic Dance.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Theory and methods for an anthropological study of dance", her 1976 doctoral dissertation.

The CCDR receives partial funding from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the Arizona Commission on the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CCDR Newsletter|url=http://www.ccdr.org/Newletters/issue23-2003-dec.pdf|date=December 2003|issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a library which is open to the public Monday through Friday from 10-5, and by appointment.  It is also searchable online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdhs.org/resources/res-libraries.html |title=Online Resources: Libraries and research institutions |publisher=[[Society of Dance History Scholars]] |accessdate=2008-06-03 |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516234211/http://www.sdhs.org/resources/res-libraries.html |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, it was announced that the CCDR's collections are being transferred to the [[Herberger College of the Arts]] at [[Arizona State University]], Dance Department. The organization's vice president, [[Elsie Ivancich Dunin]], made a gift to the College to provide for the collection's permanent care and [[Cultural heritage management|curation]].&lt;ref name=herberger&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herbergercollege.asu.edu/news/press_release.php?id=650|title=The Power of Place: Renowned collection comes to ASU Herberger College Dance with $1.15 million gift from international dance scholar |publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|format=press release|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2000, CCDR was recognized by  President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[White House Millennium Council]], "[[Save America's Treasures]]". The DHC was awarded a grant on behalf of three archives, one in Hawaii, one in Missouri and CCDR in Arizona.  CCDR received one third of  the grant, specifically for the preservation of the Gertrude Kurath, Eleanor King, and Kealiinohomoku Collections.&lt;ref name=greatness/&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehouse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dance notes|work=[[Star-Ledger]]|date=2000-08-09|author=Johnson, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cross of Lothair''' or '''Lothair Cross''' ({{lang-de|Lotharkreuz}}) is a ''[[crux gemmata]]'' (jewelled cross) [[processional cross]] dating from about 1000 AD, though its base dates from the 14th century. It was made in Germany, probably at [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, p. 115; agreement on the approximate date is unanimous among the works cited, except for Lasko p. 101, who sees no need to date it later than the 980s, and also describes it as an "altar cross"&lt;/ref&gt; It is an outstanding example of medieval goldsmith's work, and "an important monument of imperial ideology",&lt;ref&gt;Barasch, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; forming part of the [[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]], which includes several other masterpieces of sacral [[Ottonian art]]. The measurements of the original portion are 50&amp;nbsp;cm height, 38.5&amp;nbsp;cm width, 2.3&amp;nbsp;cm depth. The cross comes from the period when Ottonian art was evolving into [[Romanesque art]], and the engraved crucifixion on the reverse looks forward to the later period.

==History==
The Cross takes its name from the large engraved greenish [[rock crystal]] seal near its base bearing the portrait and name of the [[Carolingian]] ruler [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]], King of [[Lotharingia]] (835–869), and a nephew of [[Charles the Bald]]. The cross was actually made over a century after Lothair’s death for one of the [[Ottonian]] dynasty, the successors of the Carolingian dynasty; possibly for [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 115, and most scholars except Lasko 101, who sees no need to date it later than the 980s.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have been donated to the Cathedral as soon as it was made.

The Cross is still used in processions today. On high feast days it is carried into Aachen Cathedral where it is placed next to the main altar during [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]. For the rest of the time it is on display in the Cathedral Treasury Museum.

==Description and interpretation==
[[File:Augstus kameo.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The [[Augustus]] cameo at the center of the ''Cross of Lothair'']]
The oak core of the Lothair Cross is encased in gold and silver and encrusted with jewels and [[engraved gem]]s – a total of 102 gems and 35 [[pearl]]s. The front of the cross (in the terms used here) is made of gold and silver plate and is richly decorated with precious stones, pearls, gold [[filigree]] and [[cloisonné enamel]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, p. 261, n. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a case for describing this as the reverse side, as some sources do, as it may have been carried that way in processions, with the plain engraved crucifixion facing forward, and the gem-encrusted face facing the emperor who followed the cross. The enamel is on the bands of the terminals that are interrupted by the points of the triangular sections. The gems in the centre rows are mounted in raised drum-like platforms, their sides decorated with arcades in filigree. The flat surface of the arms is decorated all over with filigree [[tendril]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See the close-up photo in external links&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting point of the arms is a first-century AD [[sardonyx]] three-layered [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] of the Roman Emperor [[Augustus]] holding an eagle [[sceptre]],&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 115&lt;/ref&gt; also mounted on a raised drum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bildagentur-rath.de/typo3temp/pics/de3319e20d.jpg Close-up photo]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the assumption that the Ottonians were aware that the cameo was a portrait of Augustus, it served to link the Ottonian dynasty with the original Roman emperors, and assert them as God's representatives on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, p. 115. He makes this assumption.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an [[engraved gem]] portrait of Augustus's daughter [[Julia the Elder|Julia]] (or [[Julia Flavia]], daughter of the emperor [[Titus]]) at the top of the "Escrain de [[Charlemagne]]", an elaborate treasure given to the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] by Charles the Bald, was treated as an image of the [[Virgin Mary]]. Another gem portrait of the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]] had a cross and the name of [[Saint Peter]] added to it before use in metalwork for the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris. It is now impossible to know the degrees of awareness of this iconographic recycling among the different categories of people creating and seeing these objects.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, pp. 110–111 for the "Escrin", or Lasko 24-6 and figs. 23 &amp; 24 for the 1790s drawing – he uses "Escrain". The Julia gem is [[:File:CdM, intaglio di giulia, figlia di tito, seconda metà del I secolo dc., acquamarina firmata da Evodos, montatura carolingia (IX sec.) con 9 zaffiri e 6 perle.JPG|here]], and the Caracalla gem is [[:File:Intaglio Caracalla Cdm Paris Chab2101.jpg|here]]. Both now survive in the French national library, the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]'' (BnF) detached from their original settings, which were destroyed during the French Revolution. The BnF now identifies the Julia as the daughter of the emperor [[Titus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The second largest gem, below Augustus, was probably Lothair's seal and has his portrait with the inscription "+XPE ADIVVA HLOTARIVM REG" ("O Christ, help King Lothar").&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 49 points out that the inscription is not reversed, and so would not have read correctly on a wax impression, making it unlikely it was actually used as a seal&lt;/ref&gt; This served a similar function, linking the Ottonians with the [[Carolingian dynasty]] who had established the position of [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Other gems on the cross have classical carvings on them, including an [[amethyst]] with the [[Charites|Three Graces]] and a lion in [[onyx]], both of which are mounted with the images placed sideways.&lt;ref&gt;The Three Graces are the central purple gem two down from Augustus, and the lion is black, on the left of the top section of the main shaft. See the close-ups in the external links section.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse side of the Cross is a plain gold plate engraved with the “[[Crucifixion of Jesus]]”, with above it the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] holding a victor's wreath containing the dove of the [[Holy Ghost]]; here this represents [[God the Father]]'s acceptance of Christ's sacrifice. This is the earliest known appearance of the dove in this motif, which introduces the whole [[Trinity]] into a crucifixion, an iconography that was to have a long future.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, pp. 108, 122&lt;/ref&gt; The Serpent, representing [[Satan]], is twined round the bottom of the cross. In medallions at the ends of the arms are [[personification]]s of the sun and moon with heads bowed and surmounted by their symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Swartzenski, p. 42 and figs. The clearest photo illustration is in Schiller, II, fig. 395, and Lasko, p. 100 has a drawing.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hand with the wreath was a common motif in [[mosaic]]s in Rome, and also used in art associated with the early [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, including in [[illuminated manuscript]] portraits of themselves, to emphasize their authority from God.
[[File:Otto Mathilden Kreuz.jpg|thumb|upright|The Mathilda Cross of c. 973 has many similarities, but has a sculpted Christ on the front, above a figurative enamel plaque.]]

This is an outstanding and moving example of the “[[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]”, closely related to the slightly earlier life-size wooden [[Gero Cross]] in Cologne, which was a crucial work in developing the Western image of the dead crucified Christ, whose head is slumped to his shoulder, and whose sagging body forms a S shape, showing the marks of his suffering, here with blood spurting from the spear-wound in his side.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, p. 142. See also [[Richard Harries, Baron Harries of Pentregarth|Richard Herries]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=BKM_M7iu4KUC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=%22Lothair+Cross%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=5gc4S4DmBqqGyQTVm9DZAQ&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lothair%20Cross%22&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt; Engraved backs are found in many jewelled crosses of the period.&lt;ref&gt;See for example those illustrated in Legner, III, H28, H29 and H31&lt;/ref&gt; The cross is now mounted on a 14th-century [[Gothic art|Gothic]] stand, itself decorated with two small crucifixions and other figures.

This style of gem-studded gold decoration, re-using material from antiquity, was usual for the richest objects at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 115, Lasko 99–106 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the motif of the glorified jewelled cross, a "transformation of the crude gibbet on which Christ died", goes back to [[Late Antiquity]], when pagan opponents of Christianity often mocked the mean nature of the primary Christian symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 202–209, quotation, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Until about the 6th century, crosses rarely showed the figure of [[Christ]], but by 1000 other grand jewelled crosses had already moved the crucifixion, usually in gilded cast bronze, to the front face of the cross, to make them [[crucifix]]es, which would remain the most common Catholic form of cross. Some examples are the crosses of [[Bernward of Hildesheim]] (c. 1000, [[Hildesheim Cathedral]]), [[Gisela of Hungary]] ([[Regensburg]], 1006, now [[Munich Residenz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Schatzkammer_Residenz_Muenchen_Giselakreuz_1206.jpg Commons photo of Cross of Gisela of Hungary] and [[:de:Giselakreuz|German Wikipedia article]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and Mathilda of Essen (973, [[Essen Cathedral]], see left),&lt;ref&gt;All covered and illustrated in Lasko, or see Beckwith, pp. 138–143, and Swartzenski, p. 42 and figs.&lt;/ref&gt; which uses a virtually identical design for the terminals of the arms to the Lothair Cross.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lothair Cross is in this respect a somewhat conservative object, leaving the front free for imperial symbolism, and also perhaps as a deliberate revival of [[Carolingian art|Carolingian style]]; for example most rich crosses of similar date made more use of enamel. The two sides can be taken to represent Church and state, fittingly for an Imperial donation that was carried in front of the Holy Roman Emperors as they processed into the church.&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 273&lt;/ref&gt; The broad form of the design matches that of the small cross at the front of the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (c. 973/83?), which also has a jewelled front side and an engraved crucifixion on the rear.&lt;ref&gt;Both sides illustrated in Lasko, plates 81 and 82&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Danish Design Award''' is an annual international design prize awarded by the member organization Design denmark and [[Danish Design Centre]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Danish Design Award demonstrates the value and impact of design in Denmark today and inspires and stimulates the use of design and design thinking in companies and society. 

The new partnership behind the Danish Design Award brings together the design industry and the entire country around an annual design event celebrating the difference design can make.

Fifty years ago, in 1965, the first Danish design award, the ID Prize was launched. This was followed by the IG Prize in 1980, which merged, into the Danish Design Award in 2000.

Now, the Danish Design Award is presented in a new version as a joint creation from the Danish Design Centre and the alliance of design professionals, Design denmark.

Danish Design Award encompasses all disciplines within the realm of design and adopts a three-dimensional focus on form, function and value creation.

The fifteen award categories range from design that has created jobs or cut costs over health solutions and resource sharing to visionary concepts demonstrating the wide range and diversity of the capability of design to bring added value.

== History ==
;1965 - Industrial Design Prize
Acknowledging the best in [[Danish design]] with an annual award began in 1965. At that time the award was called the {{Interlanguage link multi|ID Prize|da|3=ID Prisen}}.&lt;ref name="en.ddc.dk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.ddc.dk/article/more-40-years-design-awards |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122184254/http://en.ddc.dk/article/more-40-years-design-awards |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 January 2010 |first=Pia Dandanell |last=Parrot |title=More than 40 Years of Design Awards |publisher=Danish Design Center |date=30 September 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish design had become an important concept, not just in Scandinavia but worldwide. Danish design represented - and continues to represent - simple, pure and aesthetic design with a clear user focus.&lt;ref name="en.ddc.dk"/&gt;

;1980 – Industrial Graphic Design Prize
In 1980 the ID Prize had a sister award, the {{Interlanguage link multi|IG Prize|da|3=IG Prisen}}, which celebrated the best industrial graphic design.

;2000 – The Danish Design Prize
In 2000, the ID Prize and the IG Prize merged to become the Danish Design Prize. With the brief pause in 2005 and 2006, the Danish Design Prize 2007 marked an anniversary for Danish design: the design prizes were awarded for the fortieth time.

;2007 – The Designmatters Award
A new introduction in 2007 was the Designmatters Award. This award goes to a small or medium-sized company that has made a serious effort to incorporate design and achieved a positive effect on the bottom line. The first recipient of the Designmatters Award was the lighting company Lightyears.&lt;ref name="en.ddc.dk"/&gt;

The '''Eagle Gate monument''' is a historical monument—more in the form of an arch than a gate—seventy-six feet across, situated at the intersection of State Street at South Temple, adjacent to [[Temple Square]], in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Desert States |first= Michael Schelling |last= Durham |authorlink= |year= 1990 |publisher= [[Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang]] |location= |isbn= 1-55670-109-8 |oclc= |page= 365 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QZ95AAAAMAAJ |accessdate= 2009-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument was erected in 1859 and commemorates the entrance to [[Brigham Young]]'s property at the mouth of [[City Creek (Utah)|City Creek Canyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Brigham Young Monument and Eagle Gate |url= http://www.lds.org/placestovisit/location/0,10634,1783-1-1-1,00.html |date= |work= Places to visit |publisher= [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] |accessdate= 16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally topped by a wooden eagle, refurbished several times and eventually replaced by the current 4,000-pound, [[bronze]] eagle, with a wingspan of {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Carved by Ralph Ramsay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Church Chronology: A Record of Important Events Pertaining to the History of |last= Jenson |first= Andrew |authorlink= |year= 2004 |publisher= [[Kessinger Publishing]] |location= |isbn= 1-4179-6854-0 |oclc= |page= 16 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XEpUpEqDCfgC |accessdate= 2009-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the original wooden eagle is on display at the [[Daughters of Utah Pioneers]] Museum located at 300 North Main Street.

The first Eagle Gate was remodeled and enlarged with new stone piers and wider inverted arches in the early 1890s (with Ralph Ramsay's eagle rebuilt and fortified); designed by [[Don Carlos Young]], an architect son of Brigham Young.  Due to the widening of State Street in the early 1960s, the prior monument including Ramsay's eagle was removed and replaced with a much wider and larger third generation Eagle Gate, designed by Salt Lake City architect George Cannon Young.  Young was the son of Don Carlos Young and the grandson of Brigham Young. The monument is one of Salt Lake City's most well known pioneer landmarks, and its current design is one of Salt Lake City's best standing examples of [[Mid-Century Modern]] design.&lt;ref&gt;Deseret News, Friday, Nov. 24, 2006, "Eagle Gate spans the history of Salt Lake."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3644">An '''edited volume''' or '''edited collection''' is a collection of [[scholarly]] or [[scientific]] chapters written by different authors. The chapters in an edited volume are original works (not republished works). 

Alternative terms for edited volume are ''contributed volume'', ''edited collection'' and ''multiauthor volume''. All these terms emphasize that the book is a collection of chapters contributed by different authors and harmonized by an editor. Edited volumes are of interest in [[academic publishing]] because they present different viewpoints and experiences on a common theme. 

An edited volume is unlike an [[anthology]], which is a collection of republished short literary works by different authors. It is also not a [[collected edition]], which brings together already-published works by a single author and is edited by a [[publisher]]. It is different from a [[Basal reader|reader]], which contains collected texts for learning purposes. Finally, it is different from [[proceedings]], which contain articles written by different authors who present them at a scientific conference.

== Role of the editor==
The [[editor]] (or editors, often there are several) of an edited volume is the key figure in conceiving and producing the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information for volume editors|url=http://www.oup.com/us/corporate/authorresources/VolumeEditors.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He or she is responsible for determining the book's purpose, structure and style (as laid out in a book proposal); for signing a book contract with an interested publisher; and for selecting the individual contributors who will write the chapters (and possibly the [[foreword]]). Selecting the contributions may involve an open call for papers or may be conducted privately. The editor is also responsible for keeping the writing process on schedule and serves as the liaison between the publisher and the contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for editors of contributed volumes|url=http://press.georgetown.edu/languages/our-authors/guidelines/guidelines-editors-contributed-volumes|publisher=Georgetown University Press|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the task of "chasing contributions" can be substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editing an Essay Collection|url=https://www.palgrave.com/gp/editing-an-essay-collection/7487710|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The editor may also be a contributor to the volume, by writing some chapters (often with other authors) and especially by preparing a [[preface]], an introduction or an [[afterword]] summarizing the main points. The editor also carries out the linguistic and substantive editing of the chapters before submitting the book manuscript to the publisher, and coordinates authors' review and correction of the proofs (preprints).

==Contributors' responsibilities==
Authors of individual chapters (contributors) sign ''contributor agreements'' that outline the topic and length of the chapter they are to write, the deadline for delivery, the copyright policy and the compensation (e.g. copies of the printed book). By accepting to contribute to the volume, they agree to prepare their chapters according to the book's style regarding, for example, the use of headings, illustrations, formatting and other text features.

'''Franz Eisenhut''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Eisenhut Ferencz''; [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: ''Франц Ајзенхут''; 25 January 1857 &amp;ndash; 2 June 1903) was a prominent [[Danube Swabians|Danube Swabian]] [[Realist visual arts|Realist]] and [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painter. He is considered one of [[Austria-Hungary]]'s greatest academic painters in the second half of the 19th century. His most famous and recognizable paintings include ''Death of Gül Baba'', ''Battle of Zenta'', ''Slave trade'' and ''Cock fighting'' and many other, depicting mostly motifs from the [[Orient]]. His works can be found in many European museums across the continent.

==Biography==

Franz Eisenhut was born in Nova Palanka, [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]], [[Austrian Empire]] (today [[Bačka Palanka]], [[Vojvodina]] province, [[Serbia]]) in a German family. His father, Georg Eisenhut was from Palanka, and his mother Theresia Sommer was from [[Mladenovo|Bukin]].

His father had hoped for Franz to become a merchant, but the Hungarian painter [[Telepy Károly]] discovered his talent for painting. Influential citizens of Palanka at the time, led by lawyer Karl Mezey and pharmacist Karlo Harliković, collected money for his studies. He studied at [[Hungarian University of Fine Arts|Hungarian Royal Drawing School]] in [[Budapest]] from 1875 until 1877. Afterwards, he became a student of the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Munich]]. He studied there until 1883 in class of [[Gyula Benczúr]], the Hungarian painter.

After finishing the Academy, he went on a trip to the Orient for the first time, visiting the [[Caucasus]]. The next year, he held his first exhibition in [[Budapest]]. The Orient became his main source of inspiration and Orientalist paintings will become his most famous works. In 1883 and 1884, he went to the Caucasus once again, visiting [[Tbilisi]] and [[Baku]]. In 1886 and 1887, he traveled from [[Naples]] to [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]]. His first great success was the 1886 painting "Healing through the [[Koran]] in [[Beirut]]". 
[[File:Glaspalast München 1897 077.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[Battle of Zenta]]'' (detail, 1896)]]
Many of his paintings were reproduced by woodcutting workshops across Europe, because, as his friend Lyka Karoly claimed, "his paintings showed the authentic Orient". Lyka Karoly also gave a detailed description of Eisenhut's studio in Munich, which was located at Mozartstrasse 13/4. Another famous painting made at the time was ''Death of Gül Baba'', for which he won the State Gold Medal at an exhibition in Budapest. Afterwards, he had exhibitions in [[Munich]], [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]]. In 1894, he painted the interior of [[Boscolo Budapest Hotel|New York Palace]] in Budapest.

Franz Eisenhut's most famous work is the painting "Battle of Zenta", made in 1896 for the Hungarian Millennium Exhibition, celebrating 1000 years since the [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] settlement in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]]. The painting was ordered by the [[Bács-Bodrog County]] and is still exhibited in [[Sombor]] City Hall, as Sombor was the county seat at the time. This painting, with dimensions of 7x4 meters, is the largest oil painting in the [[Balkans]] today.

In 1897, he returned to Palanka, where he married Adriana Reichl, daughter of Friedrich Reichl, owner of the Reichl cement factory in Neu-Palanka and brother of the famous architect from Apatin. Franz Reichl. In 1898 they had a daughter, who died soon afterwards on their journey to [[Samarkand]], when the family was returning from [[Emirate of Bukhara]]. Eisenhut was invited to Bukhara personally by the Emir [['Abd al-Ahad Khan]]. In 1901, their second daughter Judith was born, and in 1903, his only son Franz Georg, who was later the founder of leather industry Merkur in Bačka Palanka. However, Franz got seriously ill while in Munich and died on 2 June 1903. He was buried in the [[Ostfriedhof (Munich)|Ostfriedhof]] cemetery in Munich. A street in Palanka was named "Eisenhutgasse" after him.

'''Herbert Chevalier Haseltine''' (1877–1962) was an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[France|French]]/[[United States|American]] [[animalier]] [[sculpture|sculptor]], most known as an [[Equestrian sculptor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artist.christies.com/Haseltine-Herbert-1877-1962-26164.aspx|title=Herbert Haseltine|publisher=''[[Christie's]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stahl |first=Joan |title=American Artists in Photographic Portraits: From the Peter A.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Rome]], then still Lazio and not part of Italy as such, the son of the wealthy [[United States|American]] landscape painter [[William Stanley Haseltine]] (1835–1900) who was  associated with the [[Hudson River School]] and [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]], he studied at [[Harvard University]]. After graduating in 1899, Haseltine went to [[Munich Academy]] in [[Germany]] to study drawing and then to the [[Académie Julian]] in [[Paris, France]] where he studied painting.

==Career==
After his first piece of sculpture met with success, he pursued that artistic avenue. Inspired by the gathering of artists from around the world to the [[Montparnasse Quarter]] of Paris, Haseltine chose to make Paris his home for the next thirty-five years until the [[German occupation of France during World War II]]. He moved to the United States where he remained until 1947 at which time he returned to France.

Haseltine sculpted a variety of animals but is best known for his equestrian sculptures, most notably the 1934 life-size statue of the [[thoroughbred]] [[race horse]] [[Man o' War]] at the [[Kentucky Horse Park]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] and "George Washington on Horseback", [[Bronze|Gilded bronze]] statue at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] made in 1959.&lt;ref name="George Washington on Horseback"&gt;{{cite web | author=Save Outdoor Sculptures! | year=1993 | title=George Washington on Horseback(sculpture)  | work=SOS! | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!6543~!0#focus}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also traveled to India, where he made an oversized statue of one of the ancestors of the [[Maharaja]] of [[Nawanagar State|Nawanagar]],  Jam Shri Rawalji in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159479392 |title=A model of the monument to Jam Shri Rawalji:  plaster with gilding and polychrome |publisher=''[[Sotheby's]]'', New York }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can still be seen there. He replicated many of his large works in table-top sizes. The author of a number of books on animalier art, Haseltine was well connected in [[American upper class]] society and did a three-year project to create a work for heiress [[Barbara Hutton]]. This project included two horses heads which were gilded bronze, with precious and semi precious stones. After her death the heads disappeared and resurfaced a few years ago at an auction in New York.

The '''invisible auditor''' model is a variation of the [[invisible witness]] model. The invisible witness model was put forth by classical [[film theorist]]s such as [[Hugo Münsterberg]], [[V. Pudovkin]], and [[André Bazin]]&lt;ref name="James Lastra 2000"&gt;James Lastra, “Fidelity Versus Intelligibility,” in: Sound Technology and the American Cinema (Columbia UP, 2000), 138-14&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to "account for narration by claiming that editing mimicked the perception of an "invisible observer".&lt;ref name="James Lastra 2000"/&gt; This model presents the idea that the edits reflect the shifting perception of a "real witness" who moves around the space viewing the scenes.&lt;ref name="James Lastra 2000"/&gt; When watching a film, it's never shot strictly from the Point of view of the [[cameraman]] but it's shot from a series of different angles all around the scene jumping from [[first person perspective]] to [[bird's-eye view]] to give the perception to the audience that they can see as much detail and perspective of the scene as possible. 

James Lastra takes this model and applies it to [[sound]]. Where the invisible auditor model states that the recording should produce a sound as though it were being heard from the best seat in the house.This can best be understood when talking about "[[sound fidelity]]";the sound recorded or the sound output is as close to the sound of its origins. This created point of [[auditor]], where sound was recorded as though it were being listened to by an invisible auditor from the best seat in the house. This is what music artists strive for in their recordings. "This denotes that there is a [[linear relationship]] between input and output and that the notion of sound fidelity in a [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]/ reproduction system is an assessment of this transparency; a measure of how faithful the reproduction is to the original".&lt;ref&gt;Dow, Robert J. (2010) "Sound Diffusion and the Sonic Image". Retrieved from: http://www.robertdow.org/papers/rdow-sounddiffusion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7902">'''Joy Postle''' was a pioneering American environmental artist and creator of celebrated murals depicting [[Florida]] wildlife.

==Early years and education==

Katherine Joy Postle was born on January 20, 1896 in [[Chicago]] to architect Oliver Hambleton Postle (1851-1900)&lt;ref&gt;The Chicago Daily News Almanac and Political Register for 1900, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary M. Brown.&lt;ref name="American West 1998, page 252"&gt;''An Encyclopedia of Women Artists of the American West'', By Phil Kovinick and Marian Yoshiki-Kovinick, Published by University of Texas Press, 1998, page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in an atmosphere of respect for aesthetic achievement.  Postle's father was well known in Chicago architectural circles, having served as treasurer of the Chicago Artists Business Association in 1900.  In partnership with David E. Postle (1853-?) his professional offices were in the [[Marquette Building (Chicago)]] and they advertised in the ''[[House Beautiful]]'' magazine — a magazine begun by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s friends and clients Chanucey Williams and William Herman Winslow's Auvergne Press.  Among other works, the Postle firm created the neo-classical Pattington Apartments of 1903.,&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Architecture, By Charles Waldheim, Katerina Rüedi, Katerina Rüedi Ray, page 374&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-pattington.com/&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Prairie Style]] David E Postle House in [[Elgin, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;Prairie Style Architecture in Elgin and Edwardsville, http://www.mcnees.org/architecture/flw_architecture_elgin.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the Masonic Temple in Elgin, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;''Stone; an Illustrated Magazine'', 1902, page 483&lt;/ref&gt;  Joy earned a scholarship to attend the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] where she studied music and art. After graduation, Postle went west to rural [[Idaho]] and became certified to teach music and art.&lt;ref&gt;"Joy Postle, Florida Nature Artist", an on-line biography from the Joy Postle Collection at the University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in Idaho==

Postle and her brother Vernon bought a ranch in southern Idaho along the [[Snake River]] Canyon.&lt;ref name="American West 1998, page 252"/&gt;  Postle often saddled her horse and rode into the hills or desert to sketch during the 1920s while she lived on the ranch.&lt;ref&gt;''Idaho Women in History'', by Betty Penson-Ward, page 150
&lt;/ref&gt;  Postle opened an art studio in [[Boise, Idaho]] and was receiving attention as an [[interior decorator]] and artist.  A journalist named Robert Blackstone came to interview her. They were married a year later on Dec. 6, 1928, and he became her manager.

==Travels in nature==

Following their marriage, the couple travelled through the western United States in a home-made "flivver bungalow", a trailer that they dubbed the "Brownie House".  They explored the country; Postle honed her art, accepted commissions and drew inspiration from the American landscape for her future work.&lt;ref name="A Rare Bird 2009"&gt;"A Rare Bird: The Art and Life of Joy Postle", by Denise Hall; in ''Reflections'', a journal of the Orange County Regional History Center, Spring 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronicler of the Florida environment==

They arrived in Florida in 1934 and continued their nomadic life, camping, hiking and [[bird watching]]; these explorations gave Postle the opportunity of closely studying nature and refining her craft. In 1937, Postle was involved in the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] Art Project. Three years later, Blackstone conceived the idea for their "Glamour Birds" act in which bird song, recorded by Blackstone, and music accompanied Postle as she painted birds and educated her audience.  Postle and Blackstone eventually settled in a modest home and studio on Lake Rose at [[Orlo Vista, Florida|Orlo Vista]] near [[Gotha, Florida]] in 1942.

Postle counted many creative people in her circle of friends including the Chicago / Florida [[Prairie Style]] architect [[Hermann V. von Holst]] whose portrait she drew.  "Joy told me once that she had performed for [[Carl Sandburg]]," her step-grandson Daren Kelly remembers. After her show, the famous poet approached her, took her hand in his huge one, and said, "I can see you’re a seeker. I'm a seeker too!"&lt;ref&gt;"Joy Postle" Florida Nature Artist", an on-line biography from the Joy Postle Collection at the University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt;

Postle used Florida’s environment as the chief subject for art.  She waded through swamps, climbed trees,endured bugs and stayed up all night" to observe her beloved birds and other wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Postle, Joy, ''Orlando Sentinel'' obituary, June 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Postle maintained that "a painting must have movement. It's a dance performed with a brush and pigment on a stage of canvas. It should be spontaneous and joyous".&lt;ref name="A Rare Bird 2009"/&gt;

Postle was an effective and inspirational art teacher.  As one student has said: "Joy Postle taught me to observe and draw from real life and then to escape into my own art and add design and a lot of me."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Myers Kirton, interviewed on www.gallerydir.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murals==

Postle is best remembered for the [[murals]] that she created in commercial buildings and homes, adorning walls in [[Texas]], [[North Carolina]] and Florida.  In [[Beaumont, Texas]], Postle created murals evoking Texas and Beaumont history in a hotel lobby.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanjacinto-museum.org/Herzstein_Library/Manuscripts/Finding_Aids/Aston/&lt;/ref&gt; In North Carolina, she created four walls of murals for the Canton Area Historical Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inst.ncecho.org/PhotoDetail.aspx?siteno%3D00508%26photono%3D046 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306160058/http://www.inst.ncecho.org/PhotoDetail.aspx?siteno=00508&amp;photono=046 |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Florida, her murals graced the First National Bank of [[Stuart, Florida|Stuart]], the Fort Gatlin Hotel in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], the San Carlos Hotel in Pensacola (1931, demolished 1993) and Casa Iberia at [[Rollins College]] in [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]],&lt;ref name="A Rare Bird 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aspdev2.rollins.edu/OlinLibrary/arch/casa_iberia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703080936/http://aspdev2.rollins.edu/OlinLibrary/arch/casa_iberia.htm |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many private residences, including "[[Rowallan]]" in [[Ormond Beach, Florida|Ormond Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;"Joy at the Beach" by Joy Postle researcher Rick Kilby, from his blog "Visual Ephemera", March 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of eighty, Postle completed a mural at Orlando's Fashion Square Mall.&lt;ref&gt;America's Auction Network&lt;/ref&gt;  Surviving murals by Postle continue to be identified and recorded in Central Florida.

==Later years==

A fire at their home in 1968 killed Blackstone and badly injured Postle.  After years of extensive surgery, she resumed her performances and exhibitions. She continued taking commissions for pet portraits, exhibiting her work, and selling paintings well into old age. In 1984, Postle broke her hip and moved into West Orange Manor Nursing Home; nevertheless she continued painting. Joy Postle died on June 1, 1989 and her ashes were spread at her home at Lake Rose in Florida.&lt;ref name="A Rare Bird 2009"/&gt;

==Publications by Joy Postle==

Postle published several books, including: 
* ''Fine Feathers'' - 1941
* ''Glamour Birds of the Americas: Drawings and Poems'' - 1944
* ''Drawing Animals'' - 1953
* ''Drawing Birds'' - 1963

although the definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The crafts items in the list adhere to the current definition and have been designated National Treasures according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties that came into effect on June 9, 1951. 

The items are selected by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] based on their "especially high historical or artistic value".&lt;ref name="bunkapamphlet"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt; The list presents 131 entries from Classical to early modern Japan, spanning from the 7th century [[Asuka period|Asuka]] to the 18th century [[Edo period]]. The number of items is higher, however, since groups of related objects have been joined as single entries. The listed objects are of many types and include household goods, objects related to Buddhism, armour and harnesses. Some of the oldest objects were imported from China at the time.

The listed items consist of materials such as wood over clay or to bronze. Often the articles were decorated using a variety of artistic techniques like [[gilding]] of precious metals, line engraving, [[maki-e]], [[mother of pearl]] inlay or [[lacquer]]. The objects are housed in Buddhist temples, [[Shinto shrine]]s or museums.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"&gt;{{cite web

=== Pottery ===
Japanese pottery is one of the country's oldest art forms dating to the [[neolithic]] period, and some of the world's oldest [[earthenware]] from about 14,000&amp;nbsp;BC has been discovered in Japan. Early pottery objects were made of clay, unglazed and without ornamentation. Later, during the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]], [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] and [[Kofun period]]s, simple patterned designs and molded ornamentations were added. Such early techniques were formed by coiling or scratching and firing pieces at low temperatures.&lt;ref name="gardner-p208"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kleiner|2008|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal-p298"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moco.or.jp/en/intro/history_j.html |work=History of Oriental Ceramics|title=The evolution of Japanese ceramics|publisher=[[The Museum of Oriental Ceramics]]|location=Osaka|accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-fired Korean [[Sue ware]], and with it the pottery wheel, arrived in Japan around the 6th century, marking the beginning of major technological advances imported from the mainland.&lt;ref name="deal-p298"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moco"/&gt; [[Stoneware]] originated in Japan with the development of green-glazed and other color [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] pottery in the second half of the 7th century. The oldest item in this list is a green-glazed funerary pot from the 12th century.&lt;ref name="moco"/&gt;

The popularity of the [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] among the ruling class had a significant influence on ceramic production. To satisfy the demand for high quality pottery items necessary to the tea ceremony a large number of [[celadon]] vases and [[tenmoku]] ash-glazed teabowls initially were imported from China from the mid-11th to the 16th centuries. These imported items were copied and produced locally at the Seto kiln in [[Owari Province]].&lt;ref name="deal-p298"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tenmoku"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyohaku.go.jp/eng/dictio/data/touji/tenmoku.htm |work=Ceramic Stories|title=Tenmoku Teabowls|publisher=[[Kyoto National Museum]]|accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the mid-16th century adjacent Mino took over as a production center of conservative Chinese inspired Seto style pottery. The [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions of Korea]] from 1592–1598, and subsequent relocation of Korean potters to [[Kyushu]], brought new pottery styles to Japan.&lt;ref name="deal-p298"/&gt; From the late-16th century, Mino potters developed new, distinctly Japanese techniques such as [[Shino ware]] or [[Raku ware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pitelka|2003|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also motivated by a general shift of tastes among teamasters and others, who came to prefer simpler unglazed tea bowls formed by hand rather than on a pottery wheel.&lt;ref name="deal-p298"/&gt; Of the 14 pottery items in this list, eight entries are [[chawan]] bowls used in the tea ceremony, three are flower vases, one is an incense burner, one a tea-leaf jar and one a funerary pot. Eight objects originated in China, five in Japan and one in Korea.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

=== Metalwork ===
Bronze and iron casting were introduced to Japan from the mainland in the [[Yayoi period]], initially bringing to Japan from Korea and China iron knives and axes, and later bronze swords, spears and mirrors.&lt;ref name="gardner-p208"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AofJ-yayoi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Noma|2003|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge-yayoi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shiveley|McCullough|Hall|1993|pp=80–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yamasa-yayoi"&gt;{{cite web

==== Mirror icons ====
Mirror icons or kyōzō (鏡像) are drawings on the surface of a mirror. They first appeared around the mid-[[Heian period]] and are a representation of ''[[honji suijaku]]'', fusing Buddhist deities with local [[Shinto]] [[kami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moerman|first1=D.

==== Temple bells ====
The introduction of Buddhism to Japan in the mid-6th century led to the development of [[Bonshō|large hanging bronze bells]] without a clapper rung with a mallet or hanging beam. They are generally suspended in dedicated bell towers or ''[[shōrō]]''. The oldest extant of these bells date to the late-7th century and have been designated as National Treasures. The bells were either engraved or cast in relief, with outer surfaces showing vertical and horizontal relief bands, a boss ornament on the upper wall that sometimes included text, and handles typically shaped in a dragon motif.&lt;ref name="rossing-p179"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rossing|2000|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen Japanese and one Korean temple bell have been designated as National Treasures.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

====Mirrors====
Bronze mirrors arrived to Japan from China as early as the [[Yayoi period]] and continued to be imported through the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). During that period mirrors cast in Japan were imitations of Chinese prototypes and subsequently Japanese designs were established. All of these mirrors were generally circular, with a polished front, and a back decorated with molded or engraved reliefs, sometimes inlaid with gold or silver. Three mirrors or sets of mirrors&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Two National Treasures consist of one mirror each, one National Treasure is a set of two mirrors.&lt;/ref&gt; decorated with floral and animal motifs have been designated as National Treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lacquer ===
[[Japanese lacquerware]] has a long history, back as far as the [[Jōmon period]], because of decorative value and the quality as protective finish.&lt;ref name="deal-p301"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Habu|2004|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially lacquer was used to enhance properties of utilitarian objects such as watertight drinking vessels, cooking and household goods.&lt;ref name="dick-p123"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dick|1906|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant decorated item dates to the 6th century; in the medieval and early modern period lacquer was used in the manufacture of many products such as toiletry boxes, inkstone cases, eating utensils, plates, bowls, containers, furniture, saddles, stirrups or armour.&lt;ref name="deal-p301"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dick-p123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huish-p268"&gt;{{Harvnb|Huish|2008|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dick-p124"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dick|1906|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacquerware is produced in a three-step process: first the base is prepared. Most often the base consists of wood, but it can also be of paper or leather. Next is the application of lacquer, which hardens while drying, thereby sealing the base. Generally several layers of lacquer are applied. The lacquer is then decorated with a variety of methods.&lt;ref name="deal-p301"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huish|2008|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huish-p252"&gt;{{Harvnb|Huish|2008|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[maki-e]] technique, a powdered metal (usually gold or silver) is sprinkled on the lacquer before completely hardened. This technique was developed and popular in the [[Heian period]] but continued to be used with refinements into the early modern period.&lt;ref name="deal-p301"/&gt; Over the next centuries various other methods that employ precious metals were developed, such as the ''ikakeji'' technique originating in the [[Kamakura period]] in which a finely ground gold powder was spread in sufficient quantities to mimic solid gold.&lt;ref name="deal-p301"/&gt; The use of metallic powders was complemented with other techniques such as polished shell inlay or gold leaf (''kirikane''). The former was used in the Heian and Kamakura periods and popular motifs included water, rocks, trees or flowers.&lt;ref name="frederic-p591"/&gt; Starting in the Kamakura period, larger and more solid objects such as toiletry chests were decorated with realistic images.&lt;ref name="frederic-p591"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the medieval period (late-16th century), simpler designs were favoured in decorations.&lt;ref name="deal-p301"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p591"/&gt; [[Honami Kōetsu]] who lived around this time is the earliest lacquer artist known by name.&lt;ref name="huish-p258"&gt;{{Harvnb|Huish|2008|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dick-p133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dick|1906|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Japanese lacquerwork reached its apogee in the 17th century [[Edo period]] when lacquer was used for decorative objects as well as everyday items such as combs, tables, bottle, headrests, small boxes or writing cases.&lt;ref name="deal-p301"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dick-p124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p591"/&gt; The most famous artist of this time was the lacquerer painter [[Ogata Kōrin]].&lt;ref name="huish-p260"&gt;{{Harvnb|Huish|2008|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dick-p134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dick|1906|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to use mother of pearl and [[pewter]] in larger quantities for decorating lacquerware.&lt;ref name="dick-p134"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huish-p261"&gt;{{Harvnb|Huish|2008|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Harnesses ====
Saddles were made of wood and were designed as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early saddles of the [[Nara period]] were of Chinese style ''karagura'' and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the [[Heian period]] onward.&lt;ref name="deal-p156"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artisans and carpenters became involved in the saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the [[Kamakura period]], with decorations in mother of pearl inlay, gold leaf and multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions.&lt;ref name="deal-p156"/&gt; Three Japanese style lacquered wooden saddles and a complete set of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

=== Dyeing and weaving ===
By the late 3rd century, sewing, followed later by weaving, was introduced to Japan from Korea. Early textiles were made of simple twisted cords from wisteria, mulberry, hemp or [[ramie]] fibres. Following a gift of silk clothes and silk worms from the Chinese court, the Japanese court started to support textile and silk production from the 4th century onward.&lt;ref name="greene-p11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese and Korean weavers were encouraged to exhibit their fabrics bringing new techniques such as those used to make [[brocade]]s or delicate silk [[gauze]]s.&lt;ref name="greene-p12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|2005|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century [[Nara period]], Japanese weavers employed a variety of techniques such as tie-dyeing, stenciling, [[batik]], and embroidery. They skillfully imitated continental weaves, including rich [[damask]]s, many types of brocades and chiffon-like gauzes.&lt;ref name="greene-p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge-p394"/&gt; Because of a general change in aesthetics in the [[Heian period]] weaving and dyeing techniques became less varied with less colourful brocades, smaller patterns, and less elaborate gauzes.&lt;ref name="cambridge-p394"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hall|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese aristocracy preferred plain silks over woven or dyed designs.&lt;ref name="greene-p12"/&gt; A total of seven National Treasures have been designated in the weaving and dyeing category, including: two [[mandala]]s, two monk's surplices or [[Kasaya (clothing)|kesa]], one brocade, one embroidery with a Buddhist motif and a set of garments presented to a shrine.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

=== Armour ===
[[Japanese armour|Armour]] has been employed in battles in Japan since the [[Yayoi period]]. Some of the oldest extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from [[kofun]] and have been designated as [[List of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials)|archaeological National Treasures]]. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate [[cuirass]] (''tankō'') and a skirted [[Lamellar armour|lamellar]] type (''keikō''), both believed to be based on Chinese or Korean prototypes.&lt;ref name="bryant-p28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|McBride|1991|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal-p169"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2002|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-[[Heian period]] (9th to 10th centuries).&lt;ref name="bryant-p46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|McBride|1991|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally [[Japanese lacquer|lacquered]] to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century.&lt;ref name="deal-p169"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bryant-p46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson-p173"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2002|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal-p170"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, [[greave]]s, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia-p1058"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=1058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parklove-yoroi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Park|Love|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, there were two popular kinds of armour: the [[ō-yoroi]] (lit. "great armour") with a boxlike appearance, mainly worn by high-ranking [[samurai]] on horseback, and the lighter and more flexible [[dō-maru]] that wrapped around the body and was initially worn by lower-ranking foot soldiers.&lt;ref name="parklove-oyoroi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Park|Love|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bryant-p48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|McBride|1991|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parklove-domaru"&gt;{{Harvnb|Park|Love|2009|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ō-yoroi was made of leather and iron [[Lamé (armor)|lames]] bound together in horizontal layers, ornamented and reinforced with leather, silk and gilt metal.&lt;ref name="deal-p170"/&gt; It originated around the 10th century but was only commonly used starting with the [[Genpei War]] at the end of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="bryant-p49"/&gt; Being the most complete and elaborate Japanese armour, it was also worn for ceremonies.&lt;ref name="stone-oyoroi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1999|p=478}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tighter fitting dō-maru, developed in the 11th century, was generally made of a combination of leather and metal and did not include a solid breastplate or sleeves.&lt;ref name="parklove-domaru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bryant-p49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|McBride|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases its armour plates were replaced with scales of metal, leather or whalebone laced together with silk or leather cords.&lt;ref name="stone-domaru"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1999|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it was a plainer armour compared to the ō-yoroi, upper class samurai started to adopt it around 1300, as battles began to be fought on foot favouring a more comfortable suit.&lt;ref name="parklove-oyoroi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bryant-p49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson-p186"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2002|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three dō-maru, fifteen ō-yoroi armours and one pair of [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]] have been designated as National Treasures. Most of the items include a helmet and large sleeve protectors.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

[[Frank Weston Benson]] made paintings, drawings and etchings of '''Wildlife'''. He also made portraits, waterscapes, landscapes, interiors and other works of art.

Benson, an avid [[birdwatching|birdwatcher]] and hunter from a young age, spent nearly every non-winter weekend hunting or fishing.&lt;ref name=Bedford17&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford, 17.]]&lt;/ref&gt; He initially became interested in painting to capture the [[wildlife]] he enjoyed, particularly birds.&lt;ref name=Bedford8&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford, 8.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Benson's interest in painting initially grew out of his desire to be an [[ornithology|ornithological]] illustrator. As a teenager, he spent the spring, summer and fall outdoors nearly every weekend bird watching, hunting or fishing.&lt;ref name="Bedford17"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bedford8&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford, 8.]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892 Benson bought a hunting shack on [[Cape Cod]] with his brothers-in-law, Edward Peirson and Maurice Richardson. ''Swan Flight'', exhibited at the St. Botolph Club in 1893, was Benson's first known exhibition of [[Anatidae|wildfowl]].&lt;ref name=Bedford263&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford, 263.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Entering the turn of the century wildfowl was not a marketable subject, but once he began creating and exhibiting his works the wildfowl paintings always sold.&lt;ref name=Bedford26&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford]], 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson, a sportsman at heart, had a solid body of work of [[wildlife]] scenes and birds, generally [[Anseriformes|waterfowl]]. His works included oil paintings, watercolors, etchings and drypoint.

Benson made ''Swan Flight'', a group of wild swans in formation against a gray sky from the [[Cape Cod]] hunting cabin off of Nauset that he bought with his brothers-in-law. It was the first work he exhibited of wildfowl, a subject matter that Benson explored over the years of his artistic career. The painting was sold soon after it was completed, a dynamic that continued throughout his career. To a New York dealer, Benson once expressed: "I made a [painting of a wildfowl] the other day at home and I looked forward to exhibiting it and, almost before it was dry, a visitor saw it and carried it off! It’s my good fortune to be doing what people like, but it keeps me on the jump."&lt;ref name=Bedford26/&gt; 4

Early Morning" is the culmination of Benson's appreciation of birds and Japanese composition, which was popular both in Boston and Paris. The silhouetted images of the birds flying over water is similar to the Japanese screen by Maruyama Ōkyo "Geese Flying over a Beach". One of Benson's early interests was depiction of the bird life near Salem; His first oil paintings are still lifes of birds. Benson may have seen that screen at Boston importer Bunkyo Matsuki's shop or the Matsuki home in Salem before it was purchased by Charles Freer in 1898. Having seen the work at a New York exhibition in 1900, a [[New York Times]] critic noted that it was "especially good… with the ducks in flight and the gray expanse of marsh and sky rose-flushed in the east with the dawn."&lt;ref&gt;[[#BMA|''Early Morning'', Boston Museum of Art.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">The '''National Campaign for the Arts''' ('''NCA''') is a [[United Kingdom]] lobbying group campaigning for all the arts. Their [http://forthearts.org.uk website] states "We campaign for more public investment in the arts because we believe that the arts are for everyone and make everyone’s lives better."

The current Chair is the actor and director [[Samuel West]]. Other Board members include the visual artist [[Bob and Roberta Smith]], the writer and broadcaster [[A. L. Kennedy]] and Artistic Director of the [[Holland Festival]], [[Ruth Mackenzie]] CBE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forthearts.org.uk/who-we-are/our-board/ title=NCA Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==
The NCA publish the ''[http://forthearts.org.uk/publications/arts-index-england-2007-2014/ Arts Index]'', a bi-annual "health check for the arts". ''50p for Culture'' is a campaign which ranks Local Authorities by the amount of their investment in culture and encourages constituents to write to them in support or encouragement. ''Hearts for the Arts'' is an annual award that recognises excellence in Local Authority support for the arts.

== History ==
The NCA came into being in 1985 through the merger of the National Lobby for the Arts (NLA) and British Arts Voice (BRAVO). It was established as a membership organization, receiving no government funding.

The NCA was initially funded by six organizations which represent professional artists: the [[Association of British Orchestras]]; [[British Actors' Equity Association]]; the [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union]] (BECTU); the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]]; the [[The Society of London Theatre|Society of West End Theatres]] and the [[Theatrical Management Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forthearts.org.uk/who-we-are/our-history/ title=NCA History]&lt;/ref&gt;

NCA is a charity and a company limited by guarantee, established to campaign with and on behalf of the public and the arts sector for more public funding and investment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15461">The '''Norrœna Society''' was the imprint of a private publishing venture that between 1905 and 1911 produced multi-volume sets of reprints of classic 19th-century editions, mostly translations, of [[Old Norse]] literary and historical works, Northern European folklore, and medieval literature.

==Historical background==

The Norrœnna Society was founded around 1896 as "a federation of Anglo-Nordic men of letters",&lt;ref&gt;The American Register, Vol. 5, Issue 7, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[King Oscar II]] of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] for the purpose of “resurrecting, reproducing, collecting and collating or indexing every thing that pertained to the early history of the [[Anglo Saxon]], [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Teutons|Teutonic]], and [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] races—to furnish the people of Northern Europe with their own vital history.” &lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Harold D., ''The International Anglo-Saxon Society; Its History and Purpose'' in The Register of Kentucky State Historical Society, Vol. 6, 1908, pp. 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under his ægis, the Society grew  rapidly, becoming international in scope, represented in [[London]], [[Stockholm]], [[Copenhagen]], [[New York City]] and [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;American Register, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Great Britain]], where the name of the Society was changed to the Anglo-Saxon Society, membership reached 30,000. Upon expanding into America, the name was again changed to The International Anglo-Saxon Society. At that stage, the Society began issuing elaborate, official certificates of membership. According to surviving examples, known members included Dr. Johnathan Ackerman Coles (1843–1926) of [[Newark, New Jersey]]&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in the World, 1912, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; and Edward Francis Wehrle (1868–1941) of [[Los Angeles, California]]. 

The Norrœna Society was led by [[Rasmus B. Anderson]], who served as [[United States Ambassador]] to [[Denmark]] (1885–89)&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, John William, Albert Nelson Marquis, editors. ''Who's Who in America'', Volume 6, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and the founding head of the Department of [[Scandinavia]]n Studies at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the oldest such department in an American university.&lt;ref&gt;Hustvedt, Lloyd. ''Rasmus Bjørn Anderson, Pioneer Scholar''. pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dr5q-WBlW1cC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=Hustvedt,+Rasmus+Bj&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4Ixb0b4lk2&amp;sig=JlxUqlzKKmJzksz-E8K-E7QoE4w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5ZUTTcaBL4HjrAfU14ztCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=when%20he%20resigned%20in%201883%2C%20it%20was%20a%20foregone%20conclusion%20that%20his%20work%20would%20be%20continued&amp;f=false 122], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dr5q-WBlW1cC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=Hustvedt,+Rasmus+Bj&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4Ixb0b4lk2&amp;sig=JlxUqlzKKmJzksz-E8K-E7QoE4w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5ZUTTcaBL4HjrAfU14ztCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=In%20order%20to%20add%20impressiveness%20to%20the%20set%2C%20a%20fictitious%20society%20was%20created%20as%20sponsor%2C%20and%20on%20each%20title%20page%20appeared%20the%20name%20Norroena%20Society&amp;f=false 334].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WAWN161&gt;Wawn, Andrew. ''The Vikings and the Victorians: Inventing the Old North in Nineteenth-Century Britain''. [[Boydell &amp; Brewer|Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd]], 2002. {{ISBN|0-85991-644-8}}. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; He spearheaded the "large literary venture"&lt;ref&gt;Knaplund, Paul. Rasmus B. Anderson, Pioneer and Crusader (Volume 18: p. 23). [http://www.naha.stolaf.edu/pubs/nas/volume18/vol18_2.htm NAHA]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his lifelong aim to educate others, particularly Americans, about the culture, history and pre-Christian religion of [[Northern Europe]], publishing a wide range of works on these subjects. 

In [[Old Norse]], ''[[:wikt:norrœnn|norrœnn]]'' means "Norse" or "northern"; the feminine ''norrœnna'', as a substantive, refers to either the Old Norse language, or to a northern breeze.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guðbrandur Vigfússon|Vigfusson, Gudbrand]] and Richard Cleasby. ''An Icelandic-English Dictionary'', Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1957, p. 457, s.v. "Norræna," "Norrænn."&lt;/ref&gt;  Anderson himself used the term to apply to medieval Northern European literature, which he also referred to as Anglo-Saxon classics, according to faceplates in all volumes of the Norrœna Library. In academic references to these publications, the word Norrœna is commonly transliterated as Norroena and less often as Norraena. 

From 1905 to 1907, Rasmus Anderson acted as editor-in-chief of the Norrœna Library,&lt;ref&gt;Progressive Publishing Company. ''Progressive Americans of the Twentieth Century, containing biographical sketches of distinguished Americans'', 1910, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; a multi-volume subscription set, which he considered “the crowning part of my efforts in the service of Scandinavian literature.”&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rasmus Björn. ''The Life Story of Rasmus B. Anderson'', 1915, p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this effort was to make reprints of important works in the field widely available to the English-speaking world, particularly the American public. Eight of the volumes were his own translations. The remainder were by other translators with their consent. Various bibliographic references to these sets list either fifteen or sixteen volumes (the sixteenth being ''The Flatey Book and recently discovered Vatican Manuscripts concerning America as early as the tenth century, etc.'').&lt;ref&gt;Motter, H.L. ''The International Who's Who in the World'', 1912, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common number of volumes listed is fifteen. [[James William Buel]] (1849–1920), a prolific American author, compiler, and editor of numerous books in a wide range of subjects,&lt;ref&gt;Buel, J.W. ''Heroes of the Dark Continent: A Complete History of All the Great Explorations and Discoveries in Africa, from the Earliest Ages to the Present Time'', 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; acted as managing editor. T.H. Smart held the copyright. Despite the fact that the Norroena Society has been recognized as a federation of learned men, Professor Andrew Wawn questions the existence of an actual society. The majority of the editions contain a frontispiece stating that the volumes were “privately printed for members,” and a "certificate of membership" was bound into the first volume at least one known set. The most common criticism of these editions is the fact that they were considered inexpensive or abridged reprints of earlier works with little new added to the content. Still many collectors held these sets, many finely bound, in high regard. In a letter to Anderson, U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] stated that he kept his set in the most valued part of his library.&lt;ref name=Anderson665/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/profile/20030/24/andrew_wawn|title=  Post-medieval reception of medieval literature|publisher= University of Leeds|author= Andrew Wawn|accessdate= March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of their publication, the Norrœna Library was the largest collection of medieval Nordic literature published outside of Scandinavia. Bound in ten different historical bindings, each set originally sold for USD $50 to $2,500 per set, priced according to print, paper quality, illustrations, and binding.&lt;ref name=Anderson665&gt;Anderson, p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt; Each edition had a limited print run. These sets were usually hand-numbered and all contained hand-colored illustrations. The [[Stanford University Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]] hold unnumbered sets. In some sets, individual works do not contain markings indicating volume number. Assigned volume numbers sometimes vary in catalogued library holdings.

==Editions==
Known editions of the set include:

:The Imperial Edition (1905), with a print run of 350 sets. Leather bound with gilt-tooled designs on front and back covers. All volumes have gilt top edge and marbled endpapers. There are ten cover designs. Volumes (1,2), (3,4,5) and (7.8.9) share the same cover designs. With the exception of Volume 15, the cover designs are based on historically significant gilt cover designs. The cover designs of volume six is based on the cover of Historia Belli Dacici designed by "Le Gascon" (Gillede)

:The Royal Edition (1907), bound in red leather, with a print run of 450 complete sets.
:The Editor’s Autograph Edition (1907), with a print run of 500 sets.
:The Memorial Edition (1907), with a print run of 350 complete sets.
:The Imperial Autograph Edition, with a print run of 350 sets. 
:The American Limited Edition, bound in dark blue leather, embossed with elaborate gilt designs, with a print run of 10 complete sets.

Each of these contain an elaborately illustrated color frontispiece stating, "Anglo-Saxon Classics. Norrœna Embracing the History and Romance of Northern Europe” with the words  “privately printed for members” at the base of the illustration. The remainder of the sets contain a simple frontispiece consisting of a decorated border framing the descriptive phrase, "The History and Romance of Northern Europe; a Library of Supreme Classics Printed in Complete Form.” These editions include:

:The Viking Edition (1906) of which there are at least two known versions, each consisting of a print run of 650 copies. One version is bound in dark green cloth with an illustrated lithograph, containing the title of the work, pasted to the spine. The other is bound in dark blue cloth with black leather trim joined with gold thread, embossed with gilt-tooled designs.
:The Vinland Edition (1906), with a print run of "100 numbered and registered complete sets."

===The Saxo Edition===

In his 1908 biography of Icelandic Sagas, Halldor Hermannsson references a "Viking Edition" set and mentions a "Saxo Edition". &lt;ref&gt;Cornell University Libraries. Islandica, Vol. 1-2, 1908, "Bibliography of the Icelandic Sagas," p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The Saxo Edition is mentioned by no other source and no example of the set has been either presented for sale or listed in a library collection.

===Eight Volume Edition===

Author Andrew Wawn claimed that an eight-volume set existed but offered no sources in support of the claim. In the same book, he claimed that Benjamin Thorpe's 1866 ''Edda'' and Thomas Percy's ''Northern Antiquities'' were included in the eight-volume set. &lt;ref&gt;The reference to an eight-volume set is by Wawn, p. 161: "Eight volumes were duly published in a limited edition including Oliver Elton's Saxo Grammaticus translation, Benjamin Thorpe's 1866 ''Edda'', Thomas Percy's ''Northern Antiquities'' in the revised 1847 edition, Laing's ''Heimskringla'', and two volumes by George Dasent—''Popular tales from the Norse'', and ''Burnt Njal''." There are no known Norroena Library editions of Mallet's Northern Antiquities or Benjamin Thorpe's 1866 ''Edda''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complete Works==

Volume numbers are based on the Imperial Edition (1905). According to bibliographic references, volume numbering may have varied by edition. Since volumes do not contain internal markings indication their order, these variations may be due to individual library cataloging procedures.

In [[literary criticism]], '''purple prose''' is [[prose]] text that is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw excessive attention to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Word a Day – purple prose |url=http://www.wordsmith.org/words/purple_prose.html |website=Wordsmith.org |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purple prose is characterized by the excessive use of adjectives, adverbs, and [[metaphor]]s. When it is limited to certain passages, they may be termed '''purple patches''' or '''purple passages''', standing out from the rest of the work.

Purple prose is criticized for desaturating the meaning in an author's text by overusing melodramatic and fanciful descriptions. As there is no precise rule or absolute definition of what constitutes purple prose, deciding if a text, passage, or complete work has fallen victim is a somewhat subjective decision. According to [[Paul West (writer)|Paul West]], "It takes a certain amount of sass to speak up for prose that's rich, succulent and full of novelty. Purple is immoral, undemocratic and insincere; at best artsy, at worst the exterminating angel of depravity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=Paul|title=IN DEFENSE OF PURPLE PROSE|journal=New York Times|date=15 December 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/books/in-defense-of-purple-prose.html?pagewanted=2|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huron Moccasin.png|thumb|220px|[[Wyandot people|Huron]] quillwork moccasin]]
'''Quillwork''' is a form of [[textile]] embellishment traditionally practiced by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] that employs the [[quill]]s of [[porcupine]]s as an aesthetic element. Quills from bird feathers were also occasionally used in quillwork.

==History==
[[File:Upper MO quillwork pre1804 UPenn.jpg|thumb|Backside of loomed quillwork collected from an [[Plains Indians|Upper Missouri tribe]] by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], pre-1804. All [[natural dyes]]. Collection of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]]]]
Porcupine quillwork is an art form completely unique to North America. Before the introduction of glass beads, quillwork was a major decorative element used by the peoples who resided in the porcupine's natural habitat,&lt;ref name="worldtex"&gt;Gillow and Sentance 223&lt;/ref&gt; which included [[indigenous peoples of the Subarctic]], [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]], and [[Northern Plains]]. The use of quills in designs spans from [[Maine]] to [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="Orchard"&gt;Orchard&lt;/ref&gt; Quillworking tools were discovered in [[Alberta, Canada]] and date back to the 6th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin 265&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cheyenne]] [[oral history]], as told by Picking Bones Woman to George Bird Grinnell, says quilling came to their tribe from a man who married a woman, who hid her true identity as a buffalo. His son was also a buffalo. The man visited his wife and son in their buffalo home, and, while among the buffalo, the man learned the art of quilling, which he shared with the women of his tribe.&lt;ref name="Penney and Horse Capture, 119"&gt;Penney and Horse Capture 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Joining the Cheyenne Quilling Society was a prestigious honor for Cheyenne women. Upon entering the Society, women would work first on quilling [[Moccasin (footwear)|moccasins]], then [[cradle board|cradleboards]], rosettes for men's shirts and [[tipi]]s, and ultimately, hide robes and backrests.&lt;ref name="Penney and Horse Capture, 119"/&gt;

Porcupine quills often adorned [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]] and tanned hides, but during the 19th century, [[Wiigwaasi-makak|quilled birch bark boxes]] were a popular trade item to sell to European-Americans among Eastern and Great Lakes tribes. Quillwork was used to create and decorate a variety of Native American items, including those of daily usage to Native American men and women. These include clothing such as coats and moccasins, accessories such as bags and belts, and furniture attachments such as a cradle cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Christina|last2=Herald|first2=Susan|year=2010|title=The History and Analysis of Pre-Aniline Native American Quillwork Dyes|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=tsaconf|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings|volume=|pages=|via=Digital Commons@University of Nebraska-Lincoln}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[Image:Quill knife sheath.png|thumb|left|140px|A quillwork knife sheath.]]
Quills suitable for embellishment are two to three inches long and may be dyed before use.&lt;ref name="worldtex" /&gt; In their natural state, the quills are pale yellow to white with black tips. The tips are usually snipped off before use. Quills readily take dye, which originally was derived from local plants and included a wide spectrum of colors, with black, yellow, and red being the most common. By the 19th century, aniline dyes were available through trade and made dying easier.&lt;ref&gt;Feest 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The quills can be flattened with specific bone tools or by being run through one's teeth. Awls were used to punch holes in hides, and [[sinew]], later replaced by European thread, was used to bind the quills to the hides.

The four most common techniques for quillwork are [[Applique|appliqué]], [[embroidery]], wrapping, and [[loom]] weaving.&lt;ref&gt;Feest 215&lt;/ref&gt; Appliquéd quills are stitched into hide in a manner that covers the stitches.&lt;ref name="worldtex" /&gt;  In wrapping, a single quill may be wrapped upon itself or two quills may be intertwined.&lt;ref name="worldtex" /&gt;

Quills can be appliquéd singly to form curvilinear patterns, as found on [[Odawa people|Odawa]] pouches from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent 15&lt;/ref&gt; This technique lends itself to floral designs popularized among [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|northeastern tribes]] by [[Ursulines|Ursuline nuns.]] [[Wyandot people|Huron]] women excelled at floral quillwork during the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plains Indians|Plains]] quillwork is characterized by bands of rectangles creating geometrical patterns found also in Plains painting.&lt;ref&gt;Feest 140&lt;/ref&gt; Rosettes of concentric circles of quillwork commonly adorned historical Plains men's shirts, as did parallel panels of quillwork on the sleeves. These highly abstracted designs had layers of symbolic meaning.

The [[Pembina Band of Chippewa Indians|Red River Ojibwe]] of [[Manitoba]] created crisp, geometric patterns by weaving quills on a loom in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent 28 and 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
[[File:Ferdy's dragonfly.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary quillwork design on [[birch bark]], by Ferdy Goode]]

Quillwork never died out as a living art form in the Northern Plains. Some communities that had lost their quillwork tradition have been able to revive the art form. For instance, no women quilled in the [[Dene]] community of [[Wha Ti, Northwest Territories]] by the late 1990s. The Dene Cultural Institute held two workshops there in 1999 and 2000, effectively reviving quillwork in Wha Ti.&lt;ref&gt;Marie and Thompson, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The art form is very much alive today. Examples of contemporary, award-winning quillworkers include [[Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty]], ([[Sioux]]-[[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]]) artist;&lt;ref&gt;Durbin 279 and 304&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Brave Eagle ([[Oglala Lakota]]) of [[Denver, Colorado]];&lt;ref&gt;Melmer, David.

'''Richard George Rogers, Baron Rogers of Riverside''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CH|FRIBA|FCSD|FREng|RA}} (born 23 July 1933) is a British architect noted for his [[modernist]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] designs in [[high-tech architecture]].

Rogers is perhaps best known for his work on the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou Centre]] in Paris, the [[Lloyd's building]] and [[Millennium Dome]] both in London, the [[Senedd]] in [[Cardiff]], and the [[European Court of Human Rights building]] in Strasbourg. He is a winner of the [[Royal Gold Medal|RIBA Gold Medal]], the [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Architecture|Thomas Jefferson Medal]], the RIBA [[Stirling Prize]], the [[Chartered Society of Designers|Minerva Medal]] and [[Pritzker Prize]]. He is a Senior Partner at [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]], previously known as the Richard Rogers Partnership.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Lloyds building, London at night.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lloyd's building]] in 1991]]
Richard Rogers was born in [[Florence]] ([[Tuscany]]) in 1933 into an Anglo-Italian family. His father, William Nino Rogers (1906–1993), was the cousin of Italian architect [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]]. His ancestors moved from [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] to [[Venice]] in about 1800, later settling in [[Trieste]], [[Milan]] and [[Florence]]. In 1939 William Nino Rogers decided to come back to England.&lt;ref name="RR"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=o6P1DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT450&amp;lpg=PT450&amp;dq=su+brumwell+born+1939&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ksQX9UX1sO&amp;sig=ZKbN6GMza8xl8q67zqytrKd0HKs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnov3i-Y7WAhWmBcAKHRw7DPsQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=su%20brumwell%20born%201939&amp;f=false| title=Richard Rogers | publisher=Canongate Books| accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon moving to England, Richard Rogers went to [[St John's School, Leatherhead|St Johns School, Leatherhead]]. Rogers did not excel academically, which made him believe that he was "stupid because he could not read or memorize his school work"&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt; and as a consequence he stated that he became "very depressed".&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt; He wasn't able to read until the age of 11,&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nyc-architecture.com/ARCH/ARCH-ROGERS.htm| title=Richard Rogers | publisher=www.nyc-architecture.com| accessdate=31 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until after he had his first child that he realised that he was dyslexic.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt; After leaving St Johns School, he undertook a foundation course at Epsom School of Art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/stirling-prize-for-architecture-2006--riba-uk-|title=Stirling Prize for Architecture 2006 (RIBA UK), Studio International|last=Spens|first=Michael|website=Studio International - Visual Arts, Design and Architecture|language=en-gb|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[University for the Creative Arts]]) before going into [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]] between 1951 and 1953.&lt;ref name="RR"/&gt; He then attended the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] in London, where he gained the Architectural Association's Diploma (AA Dipl) from 1954 until 1959, subsequently graduating with a master's degree (M Arch) from the [[Yale School of Architecture]] in 1962 on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholarship]].&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://dyslexia.yale.edu/rogers.html | title= Richard Rogers, Architect | publisher=[[Yale School of Medicine]] | accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.richardrogers.co.uk/render.aspx?siteID=1&amp;navIDs=1,{{formatnum:518107}} | title=Richard Rogers | publisher=Richard Rogers Partnerships | accessdate=31 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying at Yale, Rogers met fellow architecture student [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and planning student [[Su Rogers|Su Brumwell]].

After leaving Yale he joined [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; On returning to England in 1963, he, Norman Foster and Brumwell set up architectural practice as [[Team 4]] with [[Wendy Foster|Wendy Cheeseman]] (Brumwell later married Rogers, Cheeseman married Foster).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Lambot (Ed.), "Norman Foster&amp;#58; Buildings and Projects Volume 1 1964–1973", Watermark Publications (1991), pp. 14–15, {{ISBN|1-873200-01-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers and Foster earned a reputation for what was later termed by the media [[high-tech architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://designmuseum.org/design/richard-rogers|publisher=Design Museum|title=Richard Rogers + Architects – From the House to the City|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1967, Team 4 had split up, but Rogers continued to collaborate with [[Su Rogers]], along with John Young and Laurie Abbott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsh-p.com/Asp/uploadedFiles/Image/News/RR_pritzker.pdf|title=Richard Rogers, Pritzker Speech|publisher=[[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]]|accessdate=11 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715210750/http://www.rsh-p.com/Asp/uploadedFiles/Image/News/RR_pritzker.pdf|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1968 he was commissioned to design a house and studio for [[Humphrey Spender]] near [[Maldon, Essex]], a glass cube framed with I-beams. He continued to develop his ideas of prefabrication and structural simplicity to design a Wimbledon house for his parents. This was based on ideas from his conceptual [[Zip-Up House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Rogers-EN/ENS-Rogers-EN.html#beginnings|title=Richard Rogers: Beginnings|publisher=Pompidou Centre|accessdate=23 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424022301/http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Rogers-EN/ENS-Rogers-EN.html#beginnings|archivedate=24 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the use of standardized components based on refrigerator panels to make energy-efficient buildings.

[[File:Pompidou center.jpg|thumb|left|Pompidou Centre]]

Rogers subsequently joined forces with Italian architect [[Renzo Piano]], a partnership that was to prove fruitful. His career leapt forward when he, Piano and [[Gianfranco Franchini]] won the [[Architectural design competition|design competition]] for the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou Centre]] in July 1971, alongside a team from [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup]] that included Irish engineer [[Peter Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrepompidou.fr/pompidou/Communication.nsf/0/B90DF3E7C7F18CAEC1256D970053FA6D?OpenDocument&amp;sessionM=3.1.12&amp;L=2 |publisher=Centre Pompidou website |title=Architecture of the Building |accessdate=3 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204030132/http://www.centrepompidou.fr/pompidou/Communication.nsf/0/B90DF3E7C7F18CAEC1256D970053FA6D?OpenDocument&amp;sessionM=3.1.12&amp;L=2 |archivedate=4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This building established Rogers's trademark of exposing most of the building's services (water, heating and ventilation ducts, and stairs) on the exterior, leaving the internal spaces uncluttered and open for visitors to the centre's art exhibitions. This style, dubbed "[[Bowellism]]" by some critics, was not universally popular at the time the centre opened in 1977, but today the Pompidou Centre is a widely admired Parisian landmark. Rogers revisited this inside-out style with his design for London's [[Lloyd's building]], completed in 1986 – another controversial design which has since become a famous and distinctive landmark in its own right.

==Later career==
[[File:Richard Rogers talking about the Lloyd's building (London).png|thumb|upright|Richard Rogers in 2013]]

After working with Piano, Rogers established the [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners|Richard Rogers Partnership]] along with [[Marco Goldschmied]], [[Mike Davies (architect)|Mike Davie]]s and John Young in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.faqs.org/abstracts/Business-international/Competitively-speaking-a-born-organiser-Marco-Goldschmied-of-Richard-Rogers-Partnership-is-being-tip.html#ixzz0shxml2TU|title= Competitively speaking: a born organiser, Marco Goldschmied of Richard Rogers Partnership is being tipped as a possible future RIBA president|publisher= Advameg Inc. |accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became [[Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners]] in 2007. The firm maintains offices in London, Shanghai and Sydney.

Rogers has devoted much of his later career to wider issues surrounding architecture, urbanism, sustainability and the ways in which cities are used. One early illustration of his thinking was an exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1986, entitled "''London As It Could Be''", which also featured the work of [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and Rogers' former partner Norman Foster. This exhibition made public a series of proposals for transforming a large area of central London, subsequently dismissed as impractical by the city's authorities.

In 1995, he became the first architect to deliver the BBC's annual [[Reith Lectures]]. This series of five talks, titled Sustainable City, were later adapted into the book ''Cities for a Small Planet'' (Faber and Faber: London 1997, {{ISBN|0-571-17993-2}}). The BBC made these lectures available to the public for download in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13891740 | publisher=BBC News | title=BBC Radio 4 unveils 60 years of Reith Lectures archive | date=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he set up the Urban Task Force at the invitation of the British government, to help identify causes of urban decline and establish a vision of safety, vitality and beauty for Britain's cities. This work resulted in a [[white paper]], ''[[Towards an Urban Renaissance]]'', outlining more than 100 recommendations for future city designers. Rogers also served for several years as chair of the [[Greater London Authority]] panel for Architecture and [[Urbanism]]. He has been chair of the board of Trustees of [[The Architecture Foundation]]. From 2001 to 2008 he was chief advisor on architecture and urbanism to [[Mayor of London]] [[Ken Livingstone]]; he was subsequently asked to continue his role as an advisor by new mayor [[Boris Johnson]] in 2008. He stood down from the post in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=23738|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110604031741/http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=23738|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 June 2011|title=Richard Rogers steps down as advisor to mayor|publisher=Mayor of London's office|accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers has also served as an advisor to two mayors of Barcelona on urban strategies.

Amidst this extra-curricular activity, Rogers has continued to create controversial and iconic works. Perhaps the most famous of these, the [[Millennium Dome]], was designed by the Rogers practice in conjunction with engineering firm [[Buro Happold]] and completed in 1999. It was the subject of fierce political and public debate over the cost and contents of the exhibition it contained; the building itself cost £43 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardrogers.co.uk/render.aspx?siteID=1&amp;navIDs=1,4,25,661|title=Millennium Dome|publisher=RHSP|accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, Rogers' practice was chosen as the architect of [[175 Greenwich Street|Tower 3]] of the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|new World Trade Center]] in New York City, replacing the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|old World Trade Center]] which was destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks]].

Some of Rogers's recent plans have failed to get off the ground. The practice was appointed to design the replacement to the [[Birmingham Central Library|Central Library]] in the [[Eastside, Birmingham|Eastside]] of [[Birmingham]]; however, his plan was shelved for financial reasons. City Park Gate, the area adjacent to the land the library would have stood on, is now being designed by [[Ken Shuttleworth (architect)|Ken Shuttleworth]]'s [[Make Architects]].

Rogers was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1991 by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52563 |date=15 June 1991 |page=2 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52858 |date=10 March 1992 |page=4257}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was created '''Baron Rogers of Riverside''', of [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] on 17 October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54559 |date=23 October 1996 |page=14045}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sits as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] peer in the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]. [http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/labour_members.cfm Parliament.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025033159/http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/labour_members.cfm |date=25 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers was appointed a Member of the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] (CH) in the [[Birthday Honours 2008|2008 Birthday Honours list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=58729 |date=14 June 2008 |page=4 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers was awarded the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] in 1985 and made a Chevalier, L’Ordre National de la [[Légion d'honneur]] in 1986. He received a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 10th [[Mostra di Architettura di Venezia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/awards/ Biennale Architecture: 10th International Architecture Exhibition (2006), Official Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214093759/http://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/awards/ |date=14 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Richard Rogers Partnership was awarded the [[Stirling Prize]] for Terminal 4 of [[Barajas Airport]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/go/Architecture/Also/Awards_2006.html|title=RIBA Stirling Prize 2006|publisher=RIBA|accessdate=27 October 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019002400/http://www.architecture.com/go/Architecture/Also/Awards_2006.html|archivedate=19 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2009 for Maggie's Centre in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAStirlingPrize/RIBAStirlingPrize.aspx|title=RIBA Stirling Prize 2009|publisher=RIBA|accessdate=26 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930145808/http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAStirlingPrize/RIBAStirlingPrize.aspx|archivedate=30 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also appointed as a Honorary [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]&lt;ref name="raenglist"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Fellows|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/people-council-committees/the-fellowship/list-of-fellows}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005. In 2007 Rogers was made Laureate of the [[Pritzker Prize|Pritzker Architecture Prize]] – architecture's highest honour.&lt;ref name="pritzker_nyt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/arts/design/28cnd-pritzker.html?hp | title=British Architect Wins 2007 Pritzker Prize | author=Robin Pogrebin | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=28 March 2007 | date=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the Minerva Medal by the [[Chartered Society of Designers]] in the same year. In 2012, Rogers was among the [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icons]] selected by artist Sir [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of the last six decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New faces on Sgt Pepper album cover for artist Peter Blake's 80th birthday|url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/02/peter-blake-sgt-pepper-cover-revisited|agency=The Guardian|date= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers has been awarded honorary degrees from several universities, including Alfonso X El Sabio University in Madrid, [[Oxford Brookes University]], the [[University of Kent]], the [[Czech Technical University in Prague]] and the [[Open University]]. In 1994, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the [[University of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bath.ac.uk/ceremonies/hongrads/ |title=Honorary Graduates 1989 to present  | publisher = [[University of Bath]] |website=bath.ac.uk |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palestine controversy==
In February 2006, Rogers hosted the inaugural meeting of the campaigning organisation Architects and Planners for Justice in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] (APJP) in his London offices. At that time his practice had secured a number of projects in New York, including the redevelopment of the [[Silvercup Studios]] site, a masterplan for the East River Waterfront and a commission for a $1.7 billion expansion of the [[Jacob K. Javits]] Convention Centre in Manhattan. Rogers however publicly dissociated himself from the group within weeks, following an outcry from generally pro-Israeli New York voters and politicians, which threatened him with the loss of prestigious commissions including projects in New York and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/03/post_87.html | publisher=The Guardian | location=London | title=Boiling point | date=9 March 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced his withdrawal with the statement, "I unequivocally renounce Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine and have withdrawn my relationship with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/09/usa.israel | publisher=The Guardian | location=London | title=Israel-Palestine conflict engulfs Rogers's .7bn New York project | first=Oliver | last=Burkeman | date=9 March 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Rogers is married to [[Ruth Rogers]], chef and co-owner of [[The River Café (London)|The River Café]] restaurant in west London. They have two sons together, Roo and Bo (deceased 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8866749/Lord-Rogers-son-Bo-found-dead-in-bath.html | location=London | publisher=The Daily Telegraph | first=Sarah | last=Rainey | title=Lord Rogers' son Bo found dead in bath | date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers also has three sons, Ben, Zad and Ab, from his first marriage to Su Brumwell. He has twelve grandchildren and a younger brother, Peter William Rogers, a property developer and co-founder of Stanhope.

In 2015, he was named one of ''[[GQ]]'''s 50 best dressed British men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 Best Dressed Men in Britain 2015 |url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2015-01/05/best-dressed-men-2015/ |publisher=GQ |date=5 Jan 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107145128/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2015-01/05/best-dressed-men-2015 |archivedate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shell necklaces (Cook Islands).jpg|thumb|Necklaces made in [[Raratonga]], [[Cook Islands]]]]
[[File:Sépulture de Teviec (5).jpg|thumb|A [[Stone Age]] burial in [[Brittany]] dating from 5000-7000 BC shows the skeletons of two women who were buried wearing necklaces made of numerous [[gastropod shell|shells]] of the [[sea snail]] ''[[Trivia (gastropod)|Trivia]]''.]]

'''Shell jewelry''' is [[jewelry]] that is primarily made from [[seashell]]s, the shells of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[mollusk]]s. Shell jewelry is a type of [[shellcraft]]. One very common form of shell jewelry is [[necklace]]s that are composed of large numbers of [[bead]]s, where each individual bead is the whole (but often drilled) [[Gastropod shell|shell]] of a small [[sea snail]]. Numerous other varieties of shell jewelry are made, including [[bracelet]]s and [[earring]]s.

As well as sea snail shells, shell jewelry also sometimes uses the shells of clams ([[bivalves]]) and tusk shells ([[scaphopod]]s). Occasionally shell jewelry is made from the shells of non-marine mollusks such as the shells of [[land snail]]s [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1627/2907.full], or the shells of freshwater mollusks. Not all shell jewelry is made from whole shells; some kinds are made from parts of shells, including the shell layer known as [[mother of pearl]] or [[nacre]], and the "trapdoor" or  [[operculum (gastropod)|operculum]] which is part of some sea snails.

In recent times, inexpensive shell jewelry is often found at tropical beach destinations, where it is offered to tourists as informal wear, or as a [[souvenir]]. However, shell jewelry has a very ancient past, and is of great importance in [[archeology]] and [[anthropology]]. In fact, shell beads are the oldest form of jewelry known, dating back over 100,000 years.

==In prehistory==
The oldest known jewelry in the world consists of two perforated beads made from shells of the sea snail ''[[Nassarius gibbosulus]]''. These beads were discovered at [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids|Skhul]] in Israel, and were recently dated to between 100,000 and 135,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 1731| date=Jun 2006 | issn = 0036-8075| doi = 10.1126/science.312.5781.1731| issue = 5781| title = Archaeology.

One example is the site of [[Oued Djebbana]] in Algeria, for example, where an ''N. gibbosulus'' bead was found; at the time the shell was used there, this site was at least 190&amp;nbsp;km away from the sea.&lt;ref name="Vanhaeren et al 2006" /&gt;

Shell ornaments were very common during the [[Upper Paleolithic]], from 50–40,000 years ago onwards, when they spread with modern humans to Europe and Asia. They generally take the form of perforated shells (as well as other hard organic material such as [[tooth]], [[bone]], [[antler]] and [[mammoth]] ivory) which are thought to have been suspended and used as jewelry. The most commonly found species are ''[[Homalopoma sanguineum]]'', ''[[Littorina obtusata]]'', ''[[Cyclope]]'' species, ''[[Nassarius mutabilis]]'' and ''Nassarius gibbosulus''. Fossil shells were used alongside those of contemporary species. Some shells were stained with [[ochre]]. In Europe, the shells of both [[Atlantic]] and [[Mediterranean]] species were used, again circulating over distances of hundreds of kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernández|first=Esteban Álvarez|last2=Jöris|first2=Olaf|title=Personal Ornaments in the Early Upper Paleolithic of Western Eurasia: an Evaluation of the Record|journal=Eurasian Prehistory|year=2007|volume=5|issue=2|pages=31–44|url=https://rgzm.academia.edu/OlafJ%C3%B6ris/Papers/802932/Personal_Ornaments_in_the_Early_Upper_Paleolithic_of_Western_Eurasia_an_Evaluation_of_the_Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[neolithic]] period shell [[necklaces]] were made with the shells of  3 genera [[Spondylus]], [[Glycymeris (shells)|Glycymeris]] and [[Charonia]].&lt;ref name="Gardelková-Vrtelová"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gardelková-Vrtelová |first=Anna |last2=Golej |first2= Marián |date=2013 |title=The necklace from the Strážnice site in the Hodonín district (Czech Republic).

The group was formed around [[Lucian Blaga]] and other intellectuals from [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], who had settled in Sibiu after the [[Babeş-Bolyai University|University of Cluj]] had moved there in 1940, in the wake of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] occupation of [[Northern Transylvania]]. The most active members of the group were [[Ion Negoițescu]], [[Radu Stanca]], [[Ion Desideriu Sârbu]], [[Cornel Regman]], [[Ștefan Augustin Doinaș]], [[Nicolae Balotă]], [[Eugen Todoran]], [[Eta Boeriu]], [[Radu Enescu]], and [[Ovidiu Cotruş]]. The group disbanded in 1945.

'''''Soul Food''''' is an American drama series that aired Wednesday nights on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] from June 28, 2000 to May 26, 2004. Created by [[George Tillman, Jr.]] and developed for television by [[Felicia D. Henderson]], ''Soul Food'' is based upon Tillman's childhood experiences growing up in [[Wisconsin]], and is a continuation of his 1997 [[Soul Food (film)|film of the same name]]. Having aired for 74 episodes, it is the longest running drama with a predominantly [[black people|black]] cast in the history of [[North America]]n prime-time television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5054030/ "No black dramas left on television"], [[msnbc.com|MSNBC.com]], May 24, 2004.  Retrieved August 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, Ovetta.  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A56036-2004May25 "Last Call for 'Soul Food{{'"}}], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 26, 2004.  Retrieved August 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
''Soul Food'' follows the triumphs, struggles, and rivalries of the Josephs, a tight-knit [[African American]] family living in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The series picks up six months after the events in the 1997 film, as the family tries to hold together after the death of the Joseph sisters' mother [[Josephine Joseph (Soul Food)|Josephine]] ([[Irma P. Hall]], reprising her role in flashback sequences), usually referred to as Mama, Mother Joe, or Big Mama.

==Response==
''Soul Food'' was one of the first long-running and successful dramatic series on television to feature a predominantly African-American cast. Short-lived series such as ''[[Under One Roof (1995 American television series)|Under One Roof]]'' and ''[[City of Angels (2000 TV series)|City of Angels]]'' featured predominantly black casts but never gained recognition due to lack of [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] and viewership. The show tackled topics of politics, homosexuality, racial discrimination, and certain forms of abuse (drug, domestic, and sexual). Because it aired on Showtime,  there was use of mild profanity and partial nudity. Certain episodes even served as launching pads for up-and-coming new musical artists. Many known performers such as [[Gerald Levert]], [[Montell Jordan]], [[India.Arie]], [[Sunshine Anderson]] and [[Common (rapper)|Common]] have made appearances as well.

==Popularity==
The show received five [[NAACP Image Awards]] nominations for Outstanding Drama Series and won three consecutive times in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Also, a three-book series was launched in 2002.

The ''Soul Food'' cast was interviewed by comedian [[Mo'Nique]] about fan reaction to the series. The cast explained that fans of the show would approach them at various places, including the airport, and would talk to them about story lines that they enjoyed or disliked. Nicole Ari Parker commented on studio executives telling the cast and crew that they were not marketable overseas; yet, after the show ended, the series gained a fan base in France.

==Syndication==
In 2004, [[Black Entertainment Television]] (BET) acquired the rights to air reruns of the series (in the United States).  The episodes have been edited to allow for commercials, and to meet [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] content standards for basic cable networks.  BET aired syndicated reruns of ''Soul Food'' for several years, until it shifted the series to its sister network, [[BET Her|BET J]] (now known as Centric). On March 15, 2010, the principal cast members (excluding Rockmond Dunbar), appeared together on the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] late-night talk show ''[[The Mo'Nique Show]]''. [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] began airing reruns of the series in January 2012. Syndication rights are currently held by [[Aspire (TV network)|Aspire]], which began airing reruns of the series in January 2016.

==Home releases==
On June 24, 2003, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] Home Entertainment released the first season of ''Soul Food'' on DVD, just two weeks after the series wrapped its fourth season. After a long delay, the remaining four seasons were released in 2007 and 2008 by Paramount and [[CBS Home Entertainment]]. While season one (billed as "the complete first season") runs in its unedited form, the remaining seasons do not, primarily due to musical licensing issues.

International rights to the series are held by Fox, which has yet to release DVD sets in other territories.

'''''The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the Italian artist [[Caravaggio]]. According to Andrea Pomella in ''Caravaggio: An Artist through Images'' (2005), the work is widely considered to be Caravaggio's masterpiece as well as "one of the most important works in Western painting."&lt;ref name="CaravaggioPomella2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pomella|first=Andrea|title=Caravaggio: an artist through images|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDH4lOa8qRgC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=ATS Italia Editrice|isbn=978-88-88536-62-0|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] has described ''The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist'' as one of the ten greatest works of art of all time: "Death and human cruelty are laid bare by this masterpiece, as its scale and shadow daunt and possess the mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website =[[The Guardian]]|url =https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/mar/21/the-10-greatest-works-art-ever|title =The 10 greatest works of art ever|first =Jonathan|last =Jones|date =21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The painting, in oil on canvas, is {{cvt|12|feet|m}}  by  {{cvt|17|feet|m}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partel|first=Francis J.|date=2011|title=The Chess Players, a Novel of the Cold War at Sea|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=5NYBiLaTD3MC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=baroque+architecture+in+merchant+street+valletta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitp4XK-tjRAhXHXRQKHWGOBgUQ6AEIMDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=baroque%20architecture%20in%20merchant%20street%20valletta&amp;f=false|publisher=Navy Log LLC|isbn=9780615414515|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prominent are the vivid [[red]] and warm [[yellow]] colours, common to the Baroque period with the use of [[chiaroscuro]].&lt;ref name="sammut"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientia|last=Sammut|first=E.|date=1949|title=Caravaggio in Malta|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Scientia%20(Malta)/Scientia.%2015(1949)2(Apr.-Jun.)/03.pdf|volume=15|issue=2|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image depicts the execution of [[John the Baptist]] while nearby [[Salome]] stands with a golden platter to receive his head.

The scene, popular with Italian artists in general and with Caravaggio himself, is not directly inspired by the [[Bible]], but rather by the tale as related in the ''[[Golden Legend]]''.&lt;ref name="Hibbard1985"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=The Caravaggio: Reflections on Political Change and the Clinton Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SwLpTgpjAVYC&amp;pg=PA228|date=1983|publisher=Harper &amp; Row,|isbn=978-0-06-430128-2|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the only work by Caravaggio to bear the artist's signature, which he placed in red blood spilling from the Baptist's cut throat.&lt;ref name="Rowland2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rowland|first=Ingrid Drake|title=From heaven to Arcadia: the sacred and the profane in the Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yke1Kx4v9sYC&amp;pg=PA163|year=2005|publisher=New York Review of Books|isbn=978-1-59017-123-3|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable empty space in the image, but because the canvas is quite large the figures are approximately life-sized.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard (1985), 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio drew the background for his work from his memories of his time in a prison of the Knights of Malta.&lt;ref name="VarrianoCaravaggio2006"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Varriano|first=John L.|title=Caravaggio: the art of realism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMhkLIxpOWkC&amp;pg=PA116|year=2006|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-02717-3|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically of his later paintings, the number of props and the detail in the props used is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Varriano (2006), 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio did several pieces depicting the moments after the event depicted here. One of these is on display in London's [[National Gallery]]; the other, in the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]. It is believed that one of these may be the image that Caravaggio was said to have sent in an effort to appease [[Alof de Wignacourt]], [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the Knights who expelled Caravaggio, but this is not certainly known.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard (1985), 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Four Elements''''' is a series of paintings by Italian artist [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] in 1566 during the [[Renaissance]]. They were commissioned by [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The portraits display figures in profile formed by different animals or objects. ''Earth'' is represented by land animals, ''Air'' by birds, ''Water'' by marine creatures and ''Fire'' by burning wood and cannons. This series attempts to express harmony out of chaos with wild animals forming distinct faces. It also praises Maximilian, suggesting that he is a ruler who controls even the four primal elements. 

[[File:ArcimboldoFourElements.jpg|1000px]]

==Historical Background==
After training in Milan, Arcimboldo moved to Vienna and became the court painter for the Habsburgs. Giuseppe gained knowledge of exotic and local animals because at the time Prague was a cultural center. Exotic creatures such as the lion and elephant came from all over the world.

==Description==
''Air'' displays a cornucopia of small birds that combine to create a slender male face. The majority of the birds are only partially visible which allow the artist to create the face and hair. The body is formed by a [[peacock]]; the goatee is a tail of a [[pheasant]], and a [[duck]] forms the eyelids. The [[eagle]] and peacock are references to the Habsburg dynasty. Giuseppe included this reference to please his patrons and form a permanent bond between the painting and the Habsburgs.

Unlike the others, ''Fire'' is formed from inanimate objects. ''Flint'' and ''steel'' form the nose and ear. Burning wood creates a crown of glowing hair. Arcimboldo uses guns to create the main part of the body. ''Fire'' has the most references to the Habsburg dynasty. The [[golden fleece]] hangs in front of the body, which is a reference to the most important knightly orders time. The double headed eagle, a symbol of the Holy Roman Empire, sits proudly on the torso. The two large cannons refer to the strength of the Habsburg armies in their ongoing war with the Turks.

''Earth'' is perhaps the most skilfully blended piece the land animals curving together to create a strong, thick face. Antlered creatures surround the head, forming a crown. An [[elephant]] creates the cheek and ear while a [[wolf]] eating a [[mouse]] forms the eyelid and pupil. A full [[cow]] represents the neck. Like its siblings, the lion and the fleece are references to the Habsburg dynasty.

''Water'' features the most realistic depictions. A chaotic mess of sea creatures create a woman's face. Her breast plate is a [[crab]], [[turtle]] and [[lobster]] along with an [[octopus]] on her shoulder. The animals that make up her head are obscure but a clear crown is formed by the spines on the back of a fish and long pieces of [[coral]]. Almost seeming out of place, a [[pearl]] necklace lies across her neck framing her face and completing the pattern of order from confusion. She also wears a pearl earring.

This series matched another of Arcimboldo’s sets called ''[[The Four Seasons (Arcimboldo)|The Four Seasons]]''. They have the same number of pieces, and correspond to each other. ''Air'' goes with ''Spring'', fire with ''Summer'', ''Earth'' with ''Autumn'' and ''Water'' with ''Winter''. This creates linked themes of chaos brought into harmony and the glorification of the Habsburg dynasty.

'''''The Gross Clinic''''', or, '''''The Clinic of Dr. Gross''''', is an 1875 painting by American artist [[Thomas Eakins]]. It is [[oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and measures {{convert|8|ft|cm}} by {{convert|6.5|ft|cm}}.

Many art historians consider ''The Gross Clinic'' to be one of the best American paintings ever made. Dr. [[Samuel D. Gross]], a seventy-year-old professor dressed in a black frock coat, lectures a group of [[Jefferson Medical College]] students.  Included among the group is a self-portrait of Eakins, who is seen at the right-hand side of the painting, next to the tunnel railing, with a white cuffed sleeve sketching or writing.&lt;ref name=Smarth&gt;{{cite web|last=Floryan|first=Meg|title=Eakins's The Gross Clinic|url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/eakins-the-gross-clinic.html|work=[[Smarthistory]]|publisher=[[Khan Academy]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seen over Dr. Gross's right shoulder is the clinic clerk, Dr. Franklin West, taking notes on the operation.

Eakins's signature is painted into the painting, on the front of the surgical table.

==Description==
Admired for its uncompromising [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]], ''The Gross Clinic'' has an important place documenting the history of medicine—both because it honors the emergence of [[surgery]] as a healing profession (previously, surgery was associated primarily with [[amputation]]), and because it shows us what the [[operating theater|surgical theater]] looked like in the nineteenth century.

The painting is based on a surgery witnessed by Eakins, in which Gross treated a young man for [[osteomyelitis]] of the [[femur]].  Gross is pictured here performing a conservative operation as opposed to an amputation (which is how the patient would normally have been treated in previous decades).

Here, surgeons crowd around the anesthetized patient in their frock coats.  This is just prior to the adoption of a hygienic surgical environment (see [[asepsis]]).  ''The Gross Clinic'' is thus often contrasted with Eakins's later painting ''[[The Agnew Clinic]]'' (1889), which depicts a cleaner, brighter, surgical theater, with the participants in "[[white coat]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, "Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress", ''Fashion Theory'', (2015), pp.1-23. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653 doi=10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653]&lt;/ref&gt; In comparing the two, the advancement in understanding of the prevention of infection is seen.  Another noteworthy difference in the later painting is the presence of a professional nurse, Mary Clymer, in the operating theater.

It is assumed that the patient depicted in ''The Gross Clinic'' was a teenage boy, although the exposed body is not entirely discernible as male or female; the painting is shocking for both the odd presentation of this figure and the matter-of-fact goriness of the procedure.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"&gt;Kimmelman, Michael (June 21, 2002). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5D6153FF932A15755C0A9649C8B63 Art Review: A Fire Stoking Realism.] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to the drama is the lone woman in the painting seen in the middle ground, possibly the patient's mother, cringing in distress.&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt;  Her dramatic figure functions as a strong contrast to the calm, professional demeanor of the men who surround the patient. This bloody and very blunt depiction of surgery was shocking at the time it was first exhibited.

==Critical reception==
[[File:Gross Clinic on display at the 1876 Centennial.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Gross Clinic'' on display in the U.S. Army Post Hospital at the [[1876 Centennial Exposition]].]]

The painting was submitted for the 1876 [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], but was rejected by the Committee of Selection. When it was eventually displayed in Ward One of the U.S. Army Post Hospital, a critic for the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' wrote that it was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...one of the most powerful, horrible, yet fascinating pictures that has been painted anywhere in this century...but the more one praises it, the more one must condemn its admission to a gallery where men and women of weak nerves must be compelled to look at it, for not to look at it is impossible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another critic, writing in 1885, said:

{{quote|It is characterized by so many excellent artistic qualities, that one regrets that the work as a whole fails to satisfy. Admirable draughtsman as this painter is, one is surprised that in the arrangement of the figures the perspective should have been so ineffective that the mother is altogether too small for the rest of the group, and the figure of the patient so indistinct that it is difficult to tell exactly the part of the body upon which the surgeon is performing the operation. The monochromatic tone of the composition is, perhaps, intentional, in order to concentrate the effect on the bloody thigh and the crimson finger of the operating professor. But as it is, the attention is at once and so entirely directed on that reeking hand as to convey the impression that such concentration was the sole purpose of the painting. In similar paintings by [[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]], [[Henri Regnault|Regnault]],&lt;ref&gt;Here the writer no doubt refers to Regnault's 1870 painting, [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/execution-sans-jugement-381.html?no_cache=1 Summary Execution under the Moorish Kings of Grenada], which depicts a decapitation.&lt;/ref&gt; and other artists of the horrible, as vivid a result is obtained without sacrificing the light and color in the other parts of the picture; and the effect, while no less intense, is, therefore, less startling and loud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Greene Wheeler Benjamin|S. G. W. Benjamin]], ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40604/40604-h/40604-h.htm Art in America: A Critical and Historical Sketch]'', Harpers, 1880. p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These assessments were not universal. The critic for Philadelphia's ''The Evening Telegraph'', who may have been aware of the personal politics involved in the advisory group of artists who rejected it, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing so fine in the American section of the Art Department of the Exhibition, and it is a great pity that the squeamishness of the Selecting Committee compelled the artist to find a place for it in the United States Hospital building. It is rumored that the blood on Dr. Gross' fingers made some of the members of the committee sick, but, judging from the quality of the work exhibited by them we fear that it was not the blood alone that made them sick. Artists have before now been known to sicken at the sight of pictures by younger men which they in their souls were compelled to acknowledge were beyond their emulation.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Clark, ''The Evening Telegraph'', June 16, 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Controversy about the painting has centered on its violence, and on the melodramatic presence of the woman. Modern scholars have suggested that the painting may be read in terms of castration anxiety and fantasies of mastery over the body (e.g. [[Michael Fried]]), and that it documents Eakins's ambivalence about representing sex difference (e.g. [[Jennifer Doyle]]). The painting has also been understood to be drawing an analogy between painting and surgery and as identifying the work of the artist with the emergence of surgery as a respected profession.

In 2002 [[Michael Kimmelman]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "hands down, the finest 19th-century American painting."&lt;ref name="kimmelman"/&gt;  In 2006, in response to the impending sale of this painting, ''The New York Times'' published a "close reading" which sketches some of the different critical perspectives on this work of art.&lt;ref name="shattuck"&gt;Shattuck, Kathryn (November 17, 2006).   [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/arts/design/19shat.html "Got Medicare? A $68 Million Operation"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
After its purchase for US$200 at the time of the Centennial Exhibition, the painting was housed in the College Building of [[Jefferson Medical College]], [[Thomas Jefferson University]] in Philadelphia until it was moved in the mid-1980s to Jefferson Alumni Hall. Although undocumented, in the late-1970s there was a rumor of a substantial offer by a collector who wished to donate the painting to the [[National Gallery of Art]]. On November 11, 2006, the Thomas Jefferson University [[Board of directors|Board]] voted to sell the painting for US$68 million to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington and the new [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]], then under construction in [[Bentonville, Arkansas]]. The sale would represent a record price for an artwork made in the United States prior to World War II.&lt;ref name="vogel"&gt;Vogel, Carol (November 11, 2006). Eakins Masterwork Is to Be Sold to Museums. ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed sale was seen as a secretive act.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;Salisbury, Stephan (November 14, 2006), A divisive deal, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/16005417.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In late November 2006, efforts began to keep the painting in Philadelphia, including a fund with a December 26 deadline to raise money to purchase it and a plan to invoke a clause regarding "historic objects" in the city's historic preservation code.  In a matter of weeks the fund raised $30 million, and on December 21, 2006, [[Wachovia]] Bank agreed to loan the difference until the rest of the money has been raised, keeping the painting in town at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] and the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]].

Pledges alone were not enough to cover the US$68 million purchase price. The [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] was forced to deaccession Eakins's ''The Cello Player'' to an unidentified private buyer; and the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] deaccessioned Eakins's ''Cowboy Singing'', along with two oil sketches for ''Cowboys in the Badlands'', to the [[Anschutz collection]] and the [[Denver Art Museum]]. The Denver-based [[Anschutz collection]] purchased ''Cowboys in the Badlands'' at a 22 May 2003 auction at [[Christie's|Christie's New York]] for $5,383,500, which was the previous record for an Eakins painting.&lt;ref&gt;Antiques and the Arts Online (May 27, 2003).

==Restorations==
{{main|Conservation-restoration of Thomas Eakins' The Gross Clinic}}
The painting has [[art restoration|been restored]] three times. The first restoration between 1917 and 1925 substantially damaged the painting, rendering secondary figures in the composition inconsistently bright or reddish in color.&lt;ref name="K1"&gt;Kennedy, Randy [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/arts/design/19eakins.html "Shedding Darkness on an Eakins Painting", ''The New York Times'', July 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1929, [[Susan Macdowell Eakins]], the artist's widow, wrote a letter of complaint regarding the "fancy red light" that had falsified the painting's intended tones.&lt;ref name=Smarth/&gt;&lt;ref name="K1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMARestore1961&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conservation Project|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/14.html?page=2|work=Philadelphia Museum of Art (website)|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting's backing was reinforced with plywood by H. Stevenson in 1915. This was replaced in 1940 by [[Hannah Mee Horner]], who glued the painting to a plywood backing. Within two decades this backing began to warp and threatened to tear the painting in half.&lt;ref name=PMARestoreProject&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1961 Conservation Treatment of ''The Gross Clinic''|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/14.html?page=3|work=Philadelphia Museum of Art (website)|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, at the request of Jefferson Medical College, the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) undertook another restoration, under conservator Theodor Siegl.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Siegl. The Thomas Eakins Collection. Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1978. {{ISBN|0-8122-1162-6}}. Page 9&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Tucker, a later PMA conservator, described the work as "a rescue mission... They were saving the painting from tearing itself in half. These were the nail heads that were starting to work forward into the canvas and show as bumps on the front... Yeah. It was just hair-raising."&lt;ref name=Seattle&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2011860177_grossclinicpainting15.html?syndication=rss 'Gross Clinic' painting undergoes its own public surgery]. Stephan Salisbury. The ''Seattle Times'', May 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Siegl used a [[power plane]] to remove the plywood down to the last, thin ply. The rest of the wood and the tenacious glue were painstakingly removed by hand. Siegl and his colleagues also restored, to some extent, the faces in the upper right of the canvas.&lt;ref name=PMARestore1961/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seattle"/&gt;

In 2009, in response to long term concerns regarding inconsistencies in the painting's disposition of darkness and light, conservators at the Philadelphia Museum of Art undertook restoration of ''The Gross Clinic'' from July 2009 to July 2010, during which time the painting was not publicly visible.&lt;ref name="K1"/&gt; The restoration sought to revert changes that had been made by the Jefferson Medical College during the 1917 restoration. Definition of parts, including Eakins' self-portrayal, was restored, using as reference an [[ink wash]] copy of the painting made by the artist, as well as a photograph taken by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] previous to the Medical College's changes in 1917.&lt;ref name="K1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMARestoreVisual&gt;{{cite web|title=The Visual Record of Changes|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/14.html?page=4|work=Philadelphia Museum of Art (website)|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Het_Kanonschot_-_Canon_fired_(Willem_van_de_Velde_II,_1707).jpg|thumb|350px]]
'''''The Gun Salute''''' (Dutch - ''Het kanonschot'') is a c.1680 oil on canvas painting by [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]], showing a ship of the Dutch navy firing a gun salute. It and its [[pendant painting|pendant work]] ''The Gust of Wind'' (''De windstoot'') were painted after his arrival in England around 1672, where he later succeeded [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|his father]] as court painter to [[Charles II of England]].

The two works remained together for a long while and by the 18th century had joined [[Sir Philip Stephens, 1st Baronet|Sir Philip Stephens]]'s collection. In 1834 the Amsterdam-based banker and collector Adriaan van der Hoop bought ''The Gun Salute'' at auction. He believed it portrayed ''[[Dutch ship De Zeven Provinciën (1665)|De Zeven Provinciën]]'', flagship of the Dutch naval hero [[Michiel de Ruyter]] - de Ruyter had a high opinion of van de Velde and even fired cannon for him to allow him to study the light effects this produced. However, this identification has now been refuted.

In 1845, van der Hoop lent the painting to an old masters' exhibition- in a review of the exhibition the art critic Alexander Oltmans gave it its present title. It was initially assigned to the Museum van der Hoop, before being transferred to the [[Rijksmuseum]] in 1885 - ''The Gust of Wind'' is also in the Rijksmuseum collection.

'''''The People in the Trees''''' is the 2013 [[debut novel]] of author [[Hanya Yanagihara]]. Yanagihara stated that her novel was in part inspired by [[Daniel Carleton Gajdusek]] who was revered in the scientific community before being accused of [[child molestation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking with Hanya Yanagihara About Her Debut Novel, The People in the Trees|url=http://www.vogue.com/872937/talking-with-hanya-yanagihara-about-her-debut-novel-the-people-in-the-trees/|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yanagihara based the physical look and shape of Ivu'ivu on [[Angra dos Reis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Stephenie|title=HANYA YANAGIHARA The strange truths of travel and fiction|url=http://bookpage.com/interviews/15513-hanya-yanagihara#.VjA4sLerR7o|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the late 1990s Dr. Ronald Kubodera, a colleague of [[Nobel Laureate]] Dr. Abraham Norton Perina, mourns Norton's downfall after being convicted of [[incest|sexually abusing his own children]]. Kubodera encourages Norton to write his memoirs from his prison isolation and marks them with footnotes.

Norton writes of his childhood in the small town of Lindon, Indiana, where his interest in science was piqued by his paternal aunt Sybil, a doctor. While attending medical school Norton attracts the attention of Gregory Smythe, and is hired to work in his lab. Norton is eventually invited to Smythe's home for dinner where Smythe cries in front of him. Repulsed by Smythe, Norton quits the lab. Shortly before graduation however Norton is approached to be the medical doctor on an anthropological mission to U'ivu led by a man named Paul Tallent. Norton realizes that Smythe recommended him in order to send him as far away as possible from him. Despite the fact that the mission is considered career suicide, Norton accepts.

Norton meets Tallent for the first time before they leave from [[Hawaii]] to U'ivu and finds him beautiful and enigmatic. When they arrive in U'ivu they meet the other member of the team, a woman named Esme Duff whom Norton immediately dislikes. Tallent leads Norton and Esme to a smaller island that is part of U'ivu called Ivu'ivu. There they meet three hunter guides who lead them deep into the jungle of the island where eventually Tallent reveals to Norton that there is a legend among the U'ivu people about a [[Uncontacted peoples|lost tribe]] that has been gifted with eternal life but also deep stupidity and that their guides have actually seen one of these people. Shortly after they discover a woman who is devoid of language, completely nude and seems unable to function as a regular human being. The explorers dub the woman Eve and quickly discover a tribe of other people like her whom they dub "Dreamers" all of whom have varyingly poor grasp of language. Through some of the more lucid dreamers Tallent discovers that though they all have a mark of a turtle on them, which indicates they are 60, they are actually all well over 100 years old.

Shortly after discovering the Dreamers the explorers also discover a group of Ivu'ivu's who had lost contact with the U'ivuians. They are allowed to observe the village as long as they do not bring the Dreamers in contact with them. While there Norton observes the villagers engaging in the ritualistic rape of a young ten-year-old boy. While Esme finds the ritual disturbing Norton decides that it is not rape or abuse but simply a cultural difference. Later on he has a sexual encounter with the boy who was raped.

He and the group also observe the chief of the village engaging in a ritual to celebrate his 60th year where he eats a turtle. Norton quickly realizes that there is a link between eating the turtle and the seeming immortality and brain damage exhibited by the dreamers. After interviewing one of the dreamers he is taken to a small pond where the turtles comes from and later, against Tallent's advice, returns and kills one of the turtles to bring back its flesh for experiments in America. He and Tallent also bring back four of the Dreamers for further observation.

Back in America, working at [[Stanford]], Norton feeds the turtle to mice and realizes that their life cycle can be extended 6 times that of regular mice. He publishes his paper at first to derision and eventually to acclaim. Tallent warns him that his paper has condemned the people of U'ivu and this eventually proves true; the turtles of Ivu'ivu are eventually hunted to extinction by pharmaceutical companies and the island itself destroyed, eventually U'ivu is colonized as well. Norton continues to visit the island and begins to adopt local abandoned children in great numbers. In 1980 he sees a decrepit man he believes was the boy he had the sexual encounter with when he first came to Ivu'ivu who foists his son on Norton. Norton takes the boy home and names him Victor.

As Victor grows older he and Norton develop an increasingly contentious relationship. Norton claims that on Christmas Victor locked Norton out of his home leaving him to die after which Norton locked Victor in the basement for a few days. When Victor is a teenager he goes to Norton's brother, Owen, and tells him that Norton [[rape]]d him, causing a rift between the brothers and leading to Norton's imprisonment.

In December 2000, Dr. Kubodera writes that he and Norton have escaped from his parole officer. He confesses to feeling guilty for having omitted a portion of Norton's memoirs and includes it as a post-script. The omitted portion reveals that Norton raped not only Victor but many of his other adopted sons.

==Reception==
Yanagihara received rave reviews for her novel. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called her " a writer to marvel at" while ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the book an "ambitious debut".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CIURARU|first1=CARMELA|title=Bitter Fruit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/books/review/the-people-in-the-trees-by-hanya-yanagihara.html|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kitamura|first1=Katie|title=The People in the Trees by Hanya Yanagihara – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/10/people-in-trees-hanya-yanagihara-review|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[The Independent]]'' was also overwhelmingly positive calling the novel "an absorbing, intelligent and uncompromising novel which beguiles and unnerves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kidd|first1=James|title=Review: "The People in the Trees", By Hanya Yanagihara|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/review-the-people-in-the-trees-by-hanya-yanagihara-9015493.html|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Visit''''' ({{lang-de|Der Besuch der alten Dame}}) is a 1956 [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] play by Swiss dramatist [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]].

==Brief plot summary==
An enormously wealthy older woman returns to her former hometown with a dreadful bargain: She wants the townspeople to kill the man who got her pregnant, then jilted her. In exchange, she will provide enough money to revitalize the decrepit town. The townspeople eventually agree.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=March 2012}}

===Act I===
The story opens with the town of Güllen preparing for the arrival of famed billionaire Claire Zachanassian, who grew up there. Güllen has fallen on hard times, and the townspeople hope that Claire will provide them with much-needed funds. Anton Schill (Alfred Ill in the [[German language]] version) is the owner of Güllen's general store and the most popular man in town. He was Claire's lover when they were young, and agrees with the [[mayor]] that the task of convincing her to make a donation should fall to him.

After settling into the hotel, Claire joins the rest of the town, who have gathered outside for a homecoming celebration. Claire takes the opportunity to announce that she will make a huge donation: one Billion (presumably [[Swiss franc]]s), half for the town and half to be shared among the families. The townspeople are overjoyed, but their happiness is dampened when Claire's butler steps forward to reveal her condition for the donation. The butler was once the Lord Chief Justice of Güllen, and had heard the [[paternity suit]] that Claire had brought against Anton. In the suit, Anton produced two false witnesses (who have since been transformed into Claire's eunuchs), and the court ruled in his favor. Her donation is conditional on someone killing Anton. The mayor refuses and the town seems aghast, but Claire says that she will wait.

===Act II===
As time passes, Anton becomes increasingly paranoid as he sees everyone purchasing especially costly items on credit in his shop. Anton visits the police officer and the mayor, who have also bought new expensive items, and they dismiss his concerns. He then visits the priest, who attempts to calm him, but finally admits they have been paid off, and advises Anton to flee.

Anton heads to the railway station to escape, but finds that the entire town is gathered there. They ask him where he is going, and he says that he is planning to move to [[Australia]]. They wish him well, again assuring him that he has nothing to fear in Güllen, but Anton grows increasingly nervous nonetheless. The train arrives, but he decides not to board, believing that someone will stop him anyway. Paralyzed, he collapses in the crowd, crying, “I’m lost!”

===Act III===
Claire weds a new husband in the Güllen cathedral. The doctor and the schoolmaster go to see her and explain that the townspeople have run up considerable debt since her arrival. The schoolmaster begs her to abandon her desire for vengeance and help the town out of the goodness of her heart.

Anton's terror grows as the townspeople buy more expensive products on credit. Hearing of Claire's wedding, reporters are everywhere, and they enter the store to interview Anton. The schoolmaster, drunk, tries to inform the press about Claire's proposal, but the townspeople stop him. The schoolmaster and Anton have a discussion and the schoolmaster explains Anton will be killed. Anton accepts his guilt and acknowledges the town's suffering is his fault.  Anton is then confronted by the mayor who asks if Anton will accept the town's judgment. Anton says that he will.

Claire tells Anton that she never stopped loving him, but that over time her love has grown into something monstrous.

When Anton arrives at the town meeting, it is flooded with the press, and the town publicly announces their acceptance of Claire's donation. The inhabitants then go through the formality of a vote, which is unanimous, and the mayor states that they have Anton to thank for their newfound wealth. The doors are locked and the lights dimmed. Anton is killed by a townsman. Just as a reporter reappears in the auditorium, the doctor announces that Anton has died of a heart attack. The reporters gather and declare that Anton has died of joy. Claire examines the body, gives the mayor his check, and leaves the town with Anton's body in the casket that she brought with her when she arrived.

==Themes==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2012}}

===Main theme===

The author often emphasized that ''The Visit'' is intended first and foremost as a [[comedy]]. However, it is difficult to ignore the serious, dark points being made about human nature throughout the play. The use of unsettling humor was popular among German-language authors of this period as a method of pointing out concerns they considered important. The main theme is that ''money corrupts'' even the most morally strong people.

===Women's Rights===
Women did not achieve full [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland|suffrage]] in Switzerland until 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Switzerland's Long Way to Women's Right to Vote|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in one canton until 1990), along with neighboring Liechtenstein, the only European country to limit women's voting rights at the time. Women still lacked voting rights when the author refashioned the play as an opera libretto for [[Gottfried von Einem]] (premiered 1971). The sham vote at the end, where Claire has no say, followed by the false ascription of the town's new wealth to Anton, highlights this injustice in Swiss society. Symbolically, Claire lacks a hand and foot –  tools to control her destiny. She has been thrown by men into prostitution against her will.

==Satire==
===European Art and History===
In the play, Dürrenmatt uses the sold out museum in the city as a way to satirize the art and history of Europe. The Güllen museum talked about in the story sold everything it had to other museums located in America. This satirizes the idea that to learn about the history of Europe, one must travel to America.

===Democracy===
Democracy in ''The Visit'' can be seen satirized in Act III, where the townsfolk gather to vote on the issue of whether or not to kill Ill. This event also brings up the fact that everyone thinks that somebody will kill Ill, but it won't be them. In the end, the vote goes against Ill and he is killed for the reward. This gives readers an example of how a democracy can indeed be worse than other forms of government.

===Human Bodies as Objects/Human Labor===
A few examples of this subject arise in the play. One is Claire's prostitution, another is Ill's worth of a billion dollars. In Claire's case, Dürrenmatt pokes at the idea of selling one's body. He describes the prostitution as almost the same as labor jobs. He asks if there is a difference between those two occupations in terms of giving your body away for money. 
Alfred Ill's situation brings up another subject with the same kind of subject. Ill's body is priced at a billion dollars. This suggests that his body can be bought, sold, and consumed just like things in the economy. Ill's body is made into an object once Claire puts a price on him.

==Adaptations==

''The Visit'' is a popular production to attend for [[German language]] students, as it is considered one of the keystones of twentieth century German-language literature.  The play is also often used as a text for those taking German as a foreign language.

Premiered as ''Besuch der alten Dame'' at [[Schauspielhaus Zürich]], [[Ruedi Walter]] played in 1956 the blind eunuch ''Loby''.&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-ruediwalter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Ruedi_Walter|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|title=Walter, Ruedi|author=|language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original 1956 play by Friedrich Dürrenmatt was adapted for American audiences by [[Maurice Valency]]; this version features a number of significant alterations. Its first [[Broadway theatre]] production, in 1958, was directed by [[Peter Brook]] and starred [[Alfred Lunt]] and [[Lynn Fontanne]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/29/nyregion/maurice-valency-93-theatrical-master-dies.html New York Times], Maurice Valency 93 theatrical master dies&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish, it was performed in Teatro Español, [[Madrid]], in 1959, and in [[Catalan language]] it was created in Barcelona in 1962.

The play was adapted as an [[opera]] [[libretto]] by the author and set to music by composer [[Gottfried von Einem]], entitled ''[[Der Besuch der alten Dame]]'' and translated as ''The Visit of the Old Lady'', and was first performed in 1971.

In 1976 ''The Visit'' was adapted for Lebanese National Television "Tele Liban" (the only broadcasting station in Lebanon at that time) as the full sixth episode of the hit TV series "Allo Hayeti ألو حياتي" directed for TV by Antoine Remi [[:ar:أنطوان ريمي|أنطوان ريمي]], and Starring Hind Abi Al Lamaa [[:ar:هند أبي اللمع|هند أبي اللمع]] as Claire (or Clara as called in the Lebanese production) and Abdel Majeed Majzoob [[:ar:عبد المجيد مجذوب|عبد المجيد مجذوب]] as her lover Alfred, Layla Karam, Philip Akiki (as the Mayor) and Elias Rizk (as the teacher). This production made Friedrich Dürrenmatt known to the Lebanese public as well as to Arabic viewers.

[[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Anthony Quinn]] starred in a much-altered film adaptation, also called ''[[The Visit (1964 film)|The Visit]]'', directed by [[Bernhard Wicki]], in 1964.  A significant alteration is in the ending.  Just as Alfred Ill (Serge Miller in the movie) is about to be executed on the trumped-up charges the town has created, the billionairess stops the execution.  She declares that she will give the money to the town as pledged.  Her revenge on Miller is that now, as she declares, he must live in the town amongst the people who would have executed him on false charges for money.

In 1988 a [[TV movie]] titled ''Bring Me the Head Of Dobie Gillis'' was a version of ''The Visit'' adapted to the characters and world of ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.

In 1989 a [[TV movie]] titled ''Визит дамы'' (''The Visit of the Lady'') was created in the ''Mosfilm'' studio ([[Russia]], at that time the [[USSR]])

Mira Stupica, famous Serbian actress performed character of  Claire Zachanassian.

[[Senegalese]] director [[Djibril Diop Mambéty]]'s film ''Hyènes'', from 1992, is based on the play.

''The Visit'' was performed at Chichester Arts Festival of 1995.&lt;ref name=chichester&gt;{{url|1=http://www.cft.org.uk/1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players included [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Joss Ackland]].

A fairly faithful [[Musical theater|musical]] ''[[The Visit (musical)|The Visit]]'', with music by [[John Kander]], lyrics by [[Fred Ebb]], and book by [[Terrence McNally]], received its first production at [[Chicago]]'s Goodman Theatre, starring [[Chita Rivera]] and [[John McMartin]] in 2001.  That production was choreographed by [[Ann Reinking]] and directed by [[Frank Galati]].  The musical was revised and played from May 13 – June 22, 2008, at [[Signature Theatre (Arlington, Virginia)|Signature Theatre]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], in a production once again starring Rivera, this time with [[George Hearn]].  It received glowing reviews from the critics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  In 2015, Chita Rivera and [[Roger Rees]] brought this adaptation of ''The Visit'' to Broadway when it began preview performances on March 26, 2015 at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]] under the Tony Award-winning direction of [[John Doyle (director)|John Doyle]] (''[[Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]''). It opened on April 23, 2015 and closed on June 14, 2015. The 95-minute production debuted in the summer of 2014 at the  [[Williamstown Theater Festival]], with choreography by Broadway veteran [[Graciela Daniele]] ([[The Rink (musical)|''The Rink'']], [[Ragtime (musical)|''Ragtime'']]).

The [[Chile]]an [[telenovela]] ''Romané'' loosely use some elements of the plot in the script. It gives the story a slightly happier ending, though; the main characters aren't fully reconciled, but they manage to sort out their differences before Jovanka, the Claire equivalent, leaves the town.

''The Visit of the Old Lady'' (''Vana daami viisit'', 2006) is a faithful, dark adaption for TV from [[Estonia]]n theatrical veterans [[Roman Baskin]] (director), [[Ita Ever]] (Claire) and [[Aarne Üksküla]] (Ill). [[Tallinn]], the capital of Estonia, substitutes for Guellen.

″The Visit″ 2016 production directed by Stan Wlasick and performed at El Rancho High School.

A [[Russian language]] production, directed by Alexander Morfov, has been running in the repertoire of the [[Lenkom Theatre]] in Moscow since 2008.

An adaptation entitled ''[[Miss Meena]]'' was performed in 2010 by [http://www.perch.co.in/about.html Perch] in [[Bengaluru]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangashankara.org/home/rangatest//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=32&amp;favm=2010-10-3 Rangashankara.org]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2011|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use [[Cite web]] or similar to provide source details.}}

A second musical adaptation, starring Pia Douwes and Uwe Kroeger, premièred at the Thun musical festival in Switzerland in the summer of 2013. It opens, with the same two leads, at the Ronacher Theatre, Vienna, in February 2014.

Indian playwright [[Madhu Rye]] adapted the play as ''Sharat'' in the [[Gujarati language]].

Paulo Coelho's The Devil and Miss Prym mentions the author, but not the story directly referenced- the concept of Coelho's book is based on the German 1956 play, The Visit, by Friedrich Dürrenmatt.

'''''Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder''''' is a collection of essays in the [[history of philosophy]] by 20th century philosopher and historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]]. Edited by [[Henry Hardy]] and released posthumously in 2000, the collection comprises the previously published works ''Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas'' (1976) – an essay on [[Counter-Enlightenment]] thinkers [[Giambattista Vico]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] – and ''The Magus of the North: J. G. Hamann and the Origins of Modern Irrationalism'' (1993), concerning [[irrationalism|irrationalist]] [[Johann Georg Hamann]]. 

==Overview==
Berlin's initial interest in the critics of the Enlightenment arose through reading the works of [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian of ideas [[Georgi Plekhanov]].&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=berlin |title=Isaiah Berlin |first=Joshua |last=Cherniss, |first2=Henry |last2=Hardy |author2-link=Henry Hardy |date=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Zeev Sternhell]] has raised questions concerning the editing of the work, pointing to Henry Hardy's replacement of Berlin's citations of secondary sources with primary sources on a number of occasions. He suggests that Hardy's editing "raises doubts as to Berlin's reading of his sources," and concludes with the following observation: "The question whether systematically omitting the secondary sources and replacing them with texts that Berlin himself did not mention, which probably means he did not read them, can be considered a legitimate procedure is highly dubious."&lt;ref name=Sternhell2010&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vico and Herder are portrayed by Berlin as alternatives to the [[rationalism|rationalistic]] epistemology which characterized the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=Password2006&gt;{{cite journal

|quote= Suggesting in effect that it can be better to theorize boldly than to engage in circumscribed projects, Berlin characterizes the "creative imagination" and "imaginative reconstruction of forms of life" in Vico and Herder as legitimate criticisms of scientific rationalism and the Enlightenment…In theory as well as in art, imagination represents an alternative to arid rationality.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin held that the agenda of the Enlightenment could be understood in a number of ways, and that to view it from the perspectives of its critics (i.e. Vico, Herder and Hamann) was to bring its distinctive and controversial aspects into sharp focus.&lt;ref name=McGrath2001&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Three Critics'' was one of Berlin's many publications on the Enlightenment and its enemies that did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterised as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and organic,&lt;ref&gt;[[Darrin McMahon|Darrin M. McMahon]], "The Counter-Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature in Pre-Revolutionary France" ''Past and Present'' No. 159 (May 1998:77-112) p. 79 note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and which he associated most closely with German [[Romanticism]].

Berlin identifies Hamann as one of the first thinkers to conceive of human [[cognition]] as [[language]] – the articulation and use of symbols. Berlin saw Hamann as having recognised as the rationalist's [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] fallacy the notion that there are "clear and distinct" ideas "which can be contemplated by a kind of inner eye", without the use of language.&lt;ref name=Bleich2006&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herder, coiner of the term ''Nazionalismus'' ([[nationalism]]) is portrayed by Berlin as conceiving of the [[nation]] as a "people's culture," the unique way of life of a particular folk, bound by ties of kinship and ties to land, defined by their unique history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cosgrove | first = Charles | title = Cross-Cultural Paul | publisher = W.B.

'''Umm ar-Rasas''' ({{lang-ar|أم الرّصاص}}) (Kastrom Mefa'a, Kastron Mefa'a) is located 30&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Madaba, which is the capital city of the [[Madaba Governorate]] in central Jordan. It was once accessible by branches of the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]], and is situated in the semi-arid steppe region of the Jordanian Desert. The site has been allied to the biblical settlement of Mephaat mentioned in the Book of [[Jeremiah]]. The Roman military utilized the site as a strategic garrison, but it was later converted and inhabited by Christian and Islamic communities. In 2004, the site was inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]],&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1093&lt;/ref&gt; and is valued by archaeologists for its extensive ruins dating to the Roman, Byzantine, and early Muslim periods. [[Studium Biblicum Franciscanum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/SBFinfo.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205194202/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/SBFinfo.html |archivedate=2007-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out excavations at the north end of the site in 1986, but much of the area remains buried under debris.

==Early history==
Particularly during the epochs of the Early Bronze Age III-IV, Iron Age II, and Roman-Byzantine eras, dense populations inhabited the topographical regions beyond the western banks of the [[Dead Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dearman|1997|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these ancient settlements, the site of Mephaat has been mentioned in biblical texts as one of the cities upon the plateau to be condemned to great destruction (Jeremiah 48:21).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|May|Metzger|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many branches of the King's Highway provided a means for reaching the more remote ancient cities, but the main route served as the forerunner for the [[Via Traiana Nova]] built by the Roman Emperor Trajan (53-117 A.D.).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dearman|1997|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This road with its many branches facilitated travel, and Roman military encampments were set in place along the way as a defensive measure against barbarian assaults across the Roman desert frontier known as the [[Limes Arabicus]]. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] identified Mephaat as the camp site of a Roman army near the desert in his Onomasticon (K.128:21).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Timm|2010|p=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the excavation of a Byzantine church here exposed an inscription naming the area as "Castron Mephaa" further supporting the theory that Umm-ar Rasas and the biblical Mephaat are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dearman|1997|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosaics==
[[Image:Umm_Rasas_Fisherman.JPG|thumb|Fisherman, top half of figure erased]]
The most important discovery on the site was the [[mosaic]] floor of the Church of St Stephen. It was made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel, hunting and fishing scenes are depicted, while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region including Philadelphia ([[Amman]]), [[Madaba]], Esbounta ([[Heshbon]]), Belemounta ([[Ma'an]]), Areopolis (Ar-Rabba), Charac Moaba ([[Al Karak|Karak]]), [[Jerusalem]], [[Nablus]], [[Caesarea]], and [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus, and Abdela. It overlays another, damaged, mosaic floor of the earlier (587) Church of Bishop Sergius. Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration.

==Byzantine period==
[[Image:Rasas_bishop_sergius_icon.jpg|thumb|left|The only known remaining icon left in the complex]]
By the 4th century C.E., the advent of [[pilgrimage]] caused [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to become the nucleus of the Christian world, and scores of pious men and women traversed the desert seeking sites of scriptural significance as well as communion with their creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilken|1988|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of pilgrims intensified by the 5th century C.E., and many Christians chose to settle in the desert establishing monastic communities. Umm ar-Rasas was converted into an ecclesiastical center boasting numerous Byzantine churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Britt|2015|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the notable finds unearthed at Umm-ar Rasas is the Church of Saint Stephen, which features elaborate and sophisticated mosaics. The discovery of Greek inscriptions within the mosaics confirmed dating to 756-785 C.E.&lt;ref name="Wilken_236"&gt;{{harvp|Wilken|1988|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date range coincides with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] period of Muslim rule, and demonstrates Christian occupation later than surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="Wilken_236"/&gt; The mosaics illustrate municipal vignettes with explanatory text covering a series of cities in Palestine, Jordan, and along the Nile Delta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bowersock|2006|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absent from the mosaics at Umm ar-Rasas are portrayals of principal holy places revered by pilgrims such as Bethlehem, Hebron or Nazareth unlike the [[Madaba Map]] found nearby.

==Muslim conquest==
[[File:Umm ar-Rasas 66.JPG|thumb|upright|Stylite tower]]
Muslim armies penetrated Palestine during the summer of 634 C.E., and initially assaulted regions along the Mediterranean coast including the [[Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilken|1988|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discontented with Byzantine control, local Arab-speaking tribesmen living in the desert expanses willingly aided the Muslim invaders easing their conquest. The efficacious campaign was characterized by limited destruction, and many cities of the [[Holy Land]] surrendered on terms to Muslim rule.&lt;ref name="Schick_220"&gt;{{harvp|Schick|1988|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine churches were infrequently transformed into mosques, but especially during the Abbasid period, the Muslim government actively enforced restrictive laws against Christian images.&lt;ref name="Schick_220"/&gt; Mosaics were defaced by the removal and reassembly of colored tessarrae ([[Tessera]]) as shown at the Church of Saint Stephen at Umm ar-Rasas. Following the Muslim victory, Christians continued to make pilgrimages to holy places, however, the numbers declined with the threat of imprisonment by Muslim officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schick|1988|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the monasteries and churches built by Byzantine Christians were ultimately abandoned.

==Stylite tower==
The salient feature of Umm ar-Rasas stands about {{convert|1|mi}} north of the walled ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilken|1988|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreted to be a [[Stylite]] tower, the soaring structure served as a platform for Christian ascetics living in isolation at the top as well as an altar for a call to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ball|2000|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ornamented with carved Christian symbols on all four sides, the square pillar endures in the distance as evidence of the once flourishing community established in the Byzantine era as a center for spiritual enlightenment.

[[File:Cleveland Museum of Art - damaged Thinker.jpg|thumb|Vandalized cast of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] ''[[The Thinker]]'', [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]], US]]

'''Vandalism of art''' is intentional damage of an artwork. The object, usually exhibited in public, becomes damaged as a result of the act, and remains in place right after the act.  This may distinguish it from  [[art destruction]] and [[iconoclasm]], where it may be wholly destroyed and removed, and [[art theft]], or [[Looted art|looting]].

Numerous acts of vandalism against art exhibits are known and some objects, such as ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' and ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'', have been intentionally damaged several times. Many vandals were diagnosed with a mental disorder and some, such as [[Hans-Joachim Bohlmann]], had a history of attacking artworks. A vast amount of damage consists of leaving a minor scratch, a stuck chewing gum, a pencil mark and so on, and usually escapes publicity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gamboni|Gamboni]], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; More visible acts of vandalism were premeditated, as the tool of destruction&amp;nbsp;– a knife, paint, acid or hammer&amp;nbsp;– was intentionally brought to the scene. In most cases, the artworks were restored. Restorations were costly and time-consuming and in many cases were followed by shielding the artwork from future attacks.

== History of the term ==

The term ''vandalisme'' was coined in 1794 by [[Henri Grégoire]], bishop of [[Blois]], to describe the destruction of artwork following the [[French Revolution]]. The term originated from the invasion of Rome in 455 by the [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribe]] of [[Vandals]], which resulted in destruction of numerous artworks, and was quickly adopted across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merrills |first1=Andy |last2=Miles |first2=Richard |title=The Vandals |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6068-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTIHPoyMOFYC&amp;printsec=frontcover|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repeated vandalism ==

=== Hans-Joachim Bohlmann ===

[[Hans-Joachim Bohlmann]] (1937–2009) was a German serial vandal. Between 1977 and 2006, he damaged over 50 paintings worth more than 270&amp;nbsp;million [[Deutsche Mark]]s (about 138&amp;nbsp;million euros) by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] and other artists. Bohlmann had a [[personality disorder]] and was treated in various psychiatric hospitals since a young age. In most acts, he sprayed paintings with [[sulfuric acid]], targeting faces of the personages.&lt;ref name=sp2&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42008774.html Ich bin mein eigener Sklave].

=== Mona Lisa ===

''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci]] has long been attracting vandals and is currently one of the best-protected artworks. In 1956, the lower part of the painting was severely damaged when a vandal doused the painting with acid while it was on display at a museum in Montauban, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5392000.stm|title=Faces of the week|work=BBC|date=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December of the same year, a young Bolivian named Ugo Ungaza Villegas threw a rock at the painting; this resulted in the loss of a speck of pigment near the left elbow, which was later painted over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140328010816/http://www.monalisamania.com/faq.htm Mona FAQ]. Mona Lisa Mania&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[bulletproof glass]] has shielded the Mona Lisa from more recent attacks. In April 1974, a handicapped woman, upset by the museum's policy for the disabled, sprayed red paint at the painting while it was on display at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GgwUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CIsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2980,1609749|title=Mona Lisa sprayed|work=[[The Free-Lance Star]]|date=20 April 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2009, a Russian woman, distraught over being denied French citizenship, threw a [[terracotta]] mug or teacup, purchased at the museum, at the painting in the Louvre; the vessel shattered against the glass enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/12/content_11868974.htm|title=Mona Lisa attacked by Russian woman|work=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/russian-tourist-hurls-mug-at-mona-lisa-in-louvre/article/feed/66265|title=Russian tourist hurls mug at Mona Lisa in Louvre|agency=Associated Press|date=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the painting was undamaged.

=== Night Watch ===
[[File:Vandalized Night Watch 1975-09-16c.jpg|260px|thumb|Rembrandt's ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' after being cut by William de Rijk in September 1975]]
Rembrandt's ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' (1642) is one of the most popular paintings at the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam. It is viewed by about 4,000 to 5,000 visitors daily with its value estimated at $925,000 in the 1970s. The painting was vandalized on several occasions. On 13 January 1911, an unemployed navy cook tried to cut it with a knife, but could not cut through the thick varnish on the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E1DB1331E233A25757C1A9679C946096D6CF Slashes famous picture.; Discharged Naval Cook Mutilate Master's "Night Watch" at Amsterdam], ''New York Times'', 14 January 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=t1&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1956922_1956921_1956951,00.html Rembrandt's Night Watch], ''Time'', 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, William de Rijk, an unemployed school teacher, cut dozens of zigzag lines in the painting with a knife before he was wrestled by the guards. The day before, de Rijk had been turned away from the museum because he arrived after closing time. After the event, he was identified with a mental disorder; he was sent to a psychiatric hospital and committed suicide there on 21 April 1976. It took six months to restore the painting, and traces of the cuts still remain.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;&lt;ref name=c1978/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goss, Steven (Summer 2001) [http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/3/toolsofartvandalism.php A Partial Guide to the Tools of Art Vandalism], ''Cabinet Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM87KqxAuO8C&amp;pg=PA114|page=114|title=Un iconoclasme moderne: théorie et pratiques contemporaines du vandalisme artistique|author=Gamboni, Dario |publisher=Editions d'En bas|year=1983|isbn=2-8290-0051-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, a man threw acid on the painting.

=== The Little Mermaid ===
[[File:Little mermaid examined.jpg|260px|thumb|Police technicians examine the damage to [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]] after it was blasted off its base on 10 September 2003.]]

''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' is a statue of the mermaid from the [[The Little Mermaid|fairy tale of the same name]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. The statue is located in the harbor of [[Copenhagen]] and is an icon and a major [[tourist attraction]] of the city. The statue has been damaged and defaced so many times since the mid-1950s that in 2007, Copenhagen officials announced that the statue may be moved further out in the harbor to avoid further vandalism and to prevent tourists from climbing onto it.

The main focus of vandalism for the statue has been [[decapitation]].  On 24 April 1964, the statue's head was sawn off and stolen by politically oriented artists of the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] movement. The head was never recovered and a new head was produced and attached to the statue.&lt;ref name=m3/&gt; On 6 January 1998, the statue was decapitated again;&lt;ref name=m1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/45721.stm|date=8 January 1998 | work=BBC News | title=Feminists claim responsibility for statue attack}}&lt;/ref&gt; the culprits were never found, but the head was returned anonymously to a nearby TV station, and re-attached on 4 February.

On the night of 10 September 2003, the statue was knocked off its base with explosives and later found in the harbor's waters. Holes were blasted in the mermaid's wrist and knee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3103906.stm Little Mermaid's unexpected swim], BBC News, 12 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Paint has been poured on the statue several times, including one episode in 1963 and two in March and May 2007. On 8 March 2006, green paint was poured over the statue and a [[dildo]] was attached to its hand.&lt;ref name=m3&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/reise/europa/0,1518,druck-572601,00.html Alter schützt Meerjungfrau nicht vor Rabauken (Age does not protect against Mermaid bullies)].

== Acid and paint ==
{{see also|Hans-Joachim Bohlmann}}
In 1880, exhibits of the Russian painter [[Vasily Vereshchagin]] in [[Vienna]] caused the opposition of the Catholic Church, which culminated in an attack on two paintings, ''Holy family'' ({{lang-ru|Святое семейство}}) and ''Resurrection'' ({{lang-ru|Воскресение Христово}}). A monk splashed enough acid on the paintings to virtually destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centre.smr.ru/win/artists/veresh/biogr_veresh.htm Peaceful painter]. centre.smr.ru (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Tony Shafrazi]] wrote "KILL LIES ALL" with red spray paint over the work ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]]. Shafrazi was ostensibly protesting [[Richard Nixon]]'s pardon of [[William Calley]] for the latter's actions during the [[My Lai massacre]]. The paint was removed with relative ease from the varnished surface.&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman, J.

On 15 June 1985, Rembrandt's 17th-century painting ''[[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Danaë]]'' was attacked in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in Russia. A man, later judged insane, first threw [[sulfuric acid]] on the canvas and then cut it twice with a knife.

In 1997, [[Alexander Brener]] painted a green dollar sign on [[Kazimir Malevich]]'s painting [[:File:Suprematist Composition - Kazimir Malevich.jpg|''Suprematisme'']]. The painting was restored and Brener was sentenced to 5&amp;nbsp;months in prison.

On 16 January 1913, a 29-year-old [[iconographer]] Abram Balashev attacked the painting [[Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan|''Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan'']] by [[Ilya Repin]] in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in Moscow. With three knife blows, he cut through the faces of both Ivans. Balashev was found mentally ill and restricted to a psychiatric hospital. The painting was restored by two leading Russian experts within a week; the work was greatly assisted by the availability of good-quality photographs of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rusk.ru/st.php?idar=25141 Scene of Blood, or how Ilya Repin killed Tsarevich Ivan.

On 10 March 1914, militant suffragette [[Mary Richardson]] walked into the [[National Gallery]] of London and attacked [[Diego Velázquez]]'s painting ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'' with a [[meat cleaver]].

On 6 April 1978, a 31-year-old Dutch artist, disgruntled over the non-payment of his welfare by the Amsterdam authorities, made three 30–40&amp;nbsp;cm long cuts in the center of the painting ''[[:File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 084.jpg|La Berceuse]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]] at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam.

In 1986, a man "wishing to take revenge on abstract art" cut with a knife the painting ''[[Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue]] III'' by [[Barnett Newman]]. The restoration took 5&amp;nbsp;years and cost $450,000.

A rather unusual case, which might not qualify as vandalism, occurred in 1908. An exhibition was set up for May of that year with paintings by [[Claude Monet]], which had already been praised by critics and were estimated at $100,000 (1908 prices). Despite this, Monet decided that he was not satisfied with his work and in a sudden move destroyed all the paintings with a knife and a paint brush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1956922_1956921_1956949,00.html Monet's Rage of Perfectionism], ''Time'', 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Smashing and shattering ==

On 7 February 1845, the [[Portland Vase]], a [[Roman glass|Roman]] [[cameo glass]] vase dated to between 5 and 25&amp;nbsp;BCE, was shattered by a drunken William Lloyd while on display in the [[British Museum]]. The vase was pieced together and underwent several further repairs, all not entirely successful.

Most broken pieces were collected by the service people but some were taken by tourists. The sculpture was repaired and is now protected by bulletproof glass. Toth was not charged with a crime, but was found socially dangerous and confined for two years to a psychiatric institution in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1956922_1956921_1956949,00.html Michelangelo's Pietà], ''Time'', 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2565,00.html Whatever happened to Laszlo Toth, the man who smashed Michelangelo's Pieta in 1972?] ''Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gamboni|Gamboni]], p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The artwork, which was worth an estimated $2,830,000, was on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art in [[Avignon]], France. First attempts to remove the mark using about 30 various chemicals were unsuccessful. Sam was tried in a court in Avignon for "voluntary degradation of a work of art". She defended herself by saying to the court: "It was just a kiss, a loving gesture. I kissed it without thinking; I thought the artist would understand...

In July 1987, a man named Robert Cambridge entered the [[National Gallery]] in London with a sawn-off shotgun concealed under his coat. He then shot the drawing ''[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist]]'' by Leonardo da Vinci from a distance of about 2&amp;nbsp;meters (7&amp;nbsp;feet). The pellets did not penetrate the protective glass, but shattered it, and the splinters caused significant damage to the artwork. Cambridge told the police that he wanted to express his disgust with "political, social and economic conditions in Britain"; he was placed in a mental institution. The restoration of the drawing took more than a year to complete.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/arts/restoring-a-leonardo-drawing-that-was-hit-by-a-shotgun-blast.html Restoring a Leonardo Drawing That Was Hit by a Shotgun Blast], ''New York Times'',

In 2007, the painting ''The Triumph of David'' by [[Ottavio Vannini]] (1640), exhibited at the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]], was attacked by a 21-year-old man with a history of mental illness. He pulled the painting off the wall, stomping on it several times. The man was reportedly disturbed by the image of Goliath's severed head.&lt;ref name="vannini"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/visitor-attacks-valuable-painting/2007/04/05/1175366394722.html|title=Visitor attacks valuable painting – April 5, 2007| work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, vandals broke into the [[Orsay Museum]] in Paris in the early morning, set off the alarm and damaged the painting ''Bridge at Argenteuil'' by Claude Monet. They left a {{Convert|10|cm|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}} tear in the middle, either with a hand blow or with a sharp object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-486280/Monet-masterpiece-slashed-drunks.html Monet masterpiece slashed by drunks], ''Daily Mail'', 8 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a 49-year old man punched a large hole in [[Claude Monet]]'s ''[[Argenteuil Basin with a Single Sailboat]]'', valued at €10 million, while it was being displayed at the [[National Gallery of Ireland]]. Despite claiming to have a heart condition, a police investigation revealed that the act was deliberate and the man was jailed for six years.&lt;ref name=ie&gt;{{cite web |title=The moment vandal was caught punching Monet| publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/the-moment-vandal-was-caught-punching-monet-30805237.html|date= 7 December 2014 |accessdate= 15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 18 months of restoration work, on 1 July 2014, the painting was re-hung in the gallery, behind protective glass.&lt;ref name=RteRestore&gt;{{cite web |title=Restored Monet returned to National Gallery| publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0701/627635-monet-national-gallery/ |date= 1 July 2014 |accessdate= 18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration saw 7% of the damaged area being lost, in a process that involved sewing microscopic threads back together.&lt;ref name=BelfastRestore&gt;{{cite web |title=Vandalised Monet work restored| publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/vandalised-monet-work-restored-30397673.html |date= 1 July 2014 |accessdate= 18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a sub-project of the [[Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project]] where the artists are growing a [[leather]] jacket without killing any animals. Growing the victimless leather problematizes the concept of [[garment]] by making it semi-living. This artistic grown garment is intended to confront people with the moral implications of wearing parts of dead animals for protective and aesthetic reasons and confronts notions of relationships with manipulated living systems.

__TOC__

==Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project==

The [[SymbioticA]] website explains what it is, "an artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning, critique and hands-on engagement with the life sciences.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symbiotica.uwa.edu.au/ Official SymbioticA website] Retrieved 03.20.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The artists work with tissue, constructing and growing complex organisms that can live outside the body, making the new objects semi-living. Their projects are meant to question life, identity and the relationship between humans and other living beings and environments. They are also interested in the ethics around partial life and the possibilities around this type of technology in the future.&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;[http://tcaproject.org/ TC&amp;A website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===

These are some of the sub-projects that are also part of the TC&amp;A project, in addition to Victimless Leather:

'''NoArk''' – NoArk is a collection of cells and tissue from many different organisms, growing together inside a "vessel", a reference to [[Noah's Ark]]. The project website states that NoArk is "a tangible as well as symbolic ‘craft’ for observing and understanding a biology that combines the familiar with the other".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/noark.html TC&amp;A – NoArk] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Worry Dolls''' – Seven modern versions of the Guatemalan [[Worry doll]] were hand-crafted of degradable [[polymers]] and surgical sutures and seeded with skin, muscle and bone tissue. The tissue was then allowed to grow inside a bioreactor, replacing the polymers as it degrades, thus creating seven semi-living dolls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/ars/main_frames.html TC&amp;A – Worry Dolls] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''Disembodied Cuisine''' – Along with Victimless Leather, this is part of the "Victimless Utopia". The idea for this project was to take cells from a frog and grow them into something possible to eat, displaying it next to the still living frog the food came from. This problemetizes the whole meat industry – how we kill animals to eat them. Growing tissue outside of the body of the animal is a way to "make" meat while the animal stays healthy and living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/disembodied/dis.html TC&amp;A – Disembodied Cuisine] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Extra Ear – ¼ Scale''' – Using human tissue, a quarter-scale replica of artist [[Stelarc]]'s ear was grown. The project wanted to confront the cultural perceptions of life now that we are able to manipulate living systems, and also discuss the notions of the wholeness of the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/extra/extra_ear.html TC&amp;A – Extra Ear – ¼ Scale] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''The Pig Wings Project''' – This project bases its ideas on [[xenotransplantation]] and genetically modifying pigs so their organs can be transplanted to humans. The artists used tissue engineering and stem cell technologies to grow pig bone tissue, forming three different sets of wings. One set shaped as bat wings ("evil"), one as bird wings ("good") and one as pterosaurs wings ("neutral").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/pig/pig_main.html TC&amp;A – The Pig Wings Project] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Idea==
An aim for the "Victimless Leather" project is to explore and provoke scientific truths, using conceptual art projects to encourage better understanding of cultural ideas around scientific knowledge. The project website point out how clothing has always been used to protect the fragile skin of humans, but lately have evolved into a fabricated object used as a tool to show one's identity. Based on this, clothing can be explored as a tangible example of the relationship between humans and others, and how humans treat others. As the artists put it: "This particular project will deconstruct our cultural meaning of clothes as a second skin by materialising it and displaying it as an art object."&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

The intention to grow artificial leather without killing an animal is meant as a contribution to a cultural discussion between art, science and society. Making this jacket presents a possibility of wearing leather that is not part of a dead animal. The projects are presented in Workshops and exhibitions throughout the world to address ethical questions related to [[bioscience]] and [[technology]]. The artists want the project to be seen in this cultural context, not a commercial one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Genetologic Research] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Their intention is not to create a consumer product, but to offer a starting point for the cultural discussion points mentioned above. As with most of the TC&amp;A projects the artists are concerned with the relationship between humans and other living systems, both natural and scientific made or manipulated.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

== The Victimless Leather project ==

[[File:Victimless leather.jpg|thumb|left|x450px|Victimless leather, photo from TC&amp;A webpage [http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/vl/images.html]]]

===Growing the jacket===
The artists wanted to make a leather-like material using living tissue, and ended up making it in the shape of a stitchless jacket. The artists based the jacket on a biodegradable polymer, coated it with [[3T3 cells|3T3]] mouse cells to form connective tissue and topped it up with human [[bone cells]] in order to create a stronger skin layer.

To create the victimless leather, the team needed an artificial environment where semi-living entities are grown, so it is grown inside a bioreactor that acts as a surrogate body. The bioreactor used in this project was custom made, based on an organ perfusion pump designed by [[Alexis Carrel]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]]. It has an automatic dripping system which feeds the cells.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt; The artists assumed that when the polymer degraded, an integrated jacket would appear. The resulting jacket was tiny, about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high and 1,4&amp;nbsp;inches wide and would just fit a mouse.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 Wired – Jacket Grows From Living Tissue] Retrieved 10.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

To idealize the "victimless" of the jacket, immortalized cell lines or cells that divide and multiply forever once they are removed from an animal or human host forming a renewable resource, have been used in the project. The 3T3 mouse cells all come from a mouse who lived in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 The technoscientific body] Retrieved 03.31.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
The research and development of “Victimless Leather” has been conducted in SymbioticA: the Art and Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia and in consultation with Professor Arunasalam Dharmarajan from the School of Anatomy and Human Biology as well as Verigen, a Perth-based company that specializes in tissue engineered cartilage for clinical applications. Western Australia state made the investment in the project through ArtsWa in Association with the Lotteries Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Victimless Leather Jacket] Retrieved 05.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Killing the Jacket====
The victimless leather was featured in the exhibition “Design and the Elastic Mind” at [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], United States. [http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2008/elasticmind/index.html] [http://www.moma.org/] February 24 – May 12, 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/news.html TC&amp;A News] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The project was scheduled to grow continuously until May 12 when the exhibition ended. There were some problems though, when the leather started expanding too quickly, clogging tubes inside the bioreactor. The exhibition leader therefore decided to unplug the project before the end of the exhibition – in a way, killing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/54636/ TheScientist – Victimless Jacket, R.I.P.] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===

Because the artificial leather is made semi-living, the project might be seen as speculative and provocative to some people – questioning whether it is better to kill semi-living beings rather than living beings. "One of the most common and somewhat surprising comments we heard was that people were disturbed by our ethics of using living cells to grow living fabric, while the use of leather obtained from animals seems to be accepted without any concern for the well-being of the animals from which the skin has been removed." artist Ionat Zurr uttered after showing the jacket to the public on "The Space Between" exhibition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacebetween.org.au/ The Space Between] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

The project also focuses on human consumption, highlighting that there are victims on every level of it, and that the boundaries between harm and benefit often are blurred. The French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] strongly opposed hunting of animals for vanity and the commercial purpose of the skin. From an indigenous point of view, the context must be{{according to whom|date=June 2012}} seen different. An [[Inuit]] hunts the [[Pinniped|seal]] and uses the whole body of the animal as a basic resource for his survival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bambusspiele.de/spiele/nanuuk/e_nunavut.htm – Arctic hunters], Retrieved 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to ethics like this, is the interest for artificial meat production due to reactions against the livestock sector because of health and environmental problems. A 2006 UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO report pointed out the livestock sector as one of the most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems like soil degradation and water pollution. And because of methane, it spews out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200908170494.html – All Africa] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Washington at Princeton''''' is a painting by [[Charles Willson Peale]].  The original was commissioned by the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania for its council chamber in [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] in Philadelphia.  Peale made eight copies of the painting. The original, now owned by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, was completed in early 1779, when Washington sat for Peale in Philadelphia.  In January 2005, the painting sold for $21.3 million - setting a record for the highest price paid for an American portrait.  Six of the paintings are in United States institutions including the [[United States Senate]]; the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; [[Yale University Art Gallery]]; [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]]; [[Colonial Williamsburg]]; [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]; and [[Princeton University Art Museum]].

[[Image:Ch5 wakamurasaki.jpg|thumb|Scene from ''The Tale of Genji'' by [[Tosa Mitsuoki]], from the 17th century [[Tosa school]] revival of the style]]
{{nihongo|'''''Yamato-e'''''|大和絵}} is a style of [[Japanese painting]] inspired by [[Tang dynasty painting]]s and fully developed by the late [[Heian period]]. It is considered the classical Japanese style. From the [[Muromachi period]] (15th century), the term Yamato-e has been used to distinguish work from contemporary [[Chinese painting|Chinese-style]] paintings (''{{transl|ja|kara-e}}'' {{lang|ja|唐絵}}), which were inspired by Chinese [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]]-era [[ink wash paintings]].

Characteristic features of Yamato-e include many small figures and careful depictions of details of buildings and other objects, the selection of only some elements of a scene to be fully depicted, the rest either being ignored or covered by a "floating cloud", an oblique view from above showing interiors of buildings as though through a cutaway roof, and very stylised depiction of landscape.

Yamato-e very often depict narrative stories, with or without accompanying text, but also show the beauty of nature, with famous places (''meisho-e'' {{lang|ja|名所絵}}) or the four seasons (''shiki-e'' {{lang|ja|四季絵}}).  The pictures are often on scrolls that can be hung on a wall (''[[kakemono]]'' {{lang|ja|掛け物}}), handscrolls (''[[emakimono]]'' {{lang|ja|絵巻物}}) that are read from right to left, or on a folding screen (''[[byōbu]]'' {{lang|ja|屏風}}) or panel (''shōji'' {{lang|ja|障子}}). Although they received their name from the [[Yamato period]] ({{lang|ja|大和}}), no Yamato-e paintings from this period survive, nor from several centuries afterwards.  Yamato-e pictures rather stand for a style and are not restricted to a particular period.

There was a revival of the Yamato-e style in the 15th century by the [[Tosa school]], including a return to narrative subjects, and although the rival [[Kanō school]] grew out of the alternative tradition of Chinese-style works, the style it developed from the late 16th century for large paintings decorating [[Japanese castle]]s included some elements of the Yamato-e style.  In the 17th century, the simplified and stylised depiction of landscape backgrounds in Yamato-e was revived as a style for large landscape works by the [[Rinpa school]] ({{lang|ja|琳派}}).  Later the narrative element of Yamato-e, the interest in the depiction of everyday life, and the choice of oblique and partial views in a composition heavily influenced the [[ukiyo-e]] ({{lang|ja|浮世絵}}) style, as well as the [[Nihonga]] ({{lang|ja|日本画}}).

[[Image:Japanischer Maler 001.jpg|thumb|Uji Bridge Screen, an example of later Yamato-e from the 17th century]]

The term Yamato-e is found in Heian texts, although the precise range of works it covered then, and also in subsequent periods, is a much debated topic.  There are also references showing a distinction within Yamato-e between "women's painting" and "men's painting".  This distinction is also much debated but the typical assumptions as to its meaning can be illustrated by works from each group discussed in the next two sections; both are famous masterpieces and [[National Treasure (Japan)|National Treasures of Japan]]. 

The range of works discussed below, all usually considered to be embraced by the term Yamato-e, is considerable, but most are narrative handscrolls with many small figures.  There were evidently also many screens and works in other formats in the various styles, of which few traces remain. The Yamato-e style is apparent in the landscape background of some of the Buddhist paintings which are the most numerous survivals of Heian painting.

===The ''Genji Monogatari Emaki''===
The oldest Yamato-e works to survive are four famous 12th century handscrolls of parts of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', three in the [[Tokugawa Art Museum]] in [[Nagoya]], with another from the same set in the [[Gotoh Museum]] in [[Tokyo]]; together they are known as the ''[[Genji Monogatari Emaki]]''.  Only a small proportion, about 15%, of the original survives, assuming this was complete. The original scrolls would have totalled about 450 feet long, in 20 rolls which alternate text with images, containing over 100 paintings, with over 300 sections of [[calligraphy]]. The surviving scrolls consist of only 19 paintings, 65 sheets of text, and 9 pages of fragments.&lt;ref&gt;Okudaira, 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings show an already mature tradition that has developed a considerable way from its Chinese origins.  Conventions include the angled view from above into roofless rooms, and very simplified facial details, allowing minimal expressiveness.  The colours are fresh and bright, built up in a technique called ''[[tsukuri-e]]'' ("make-up") where a first outline is covered by several layers of [[pigment]], with final lines added on top.  Only one example survives from so early comparable to the painted [[fusuma]] screens shown at the rear in the interior scene illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, 133–135; the one screen from this period shows a panoramic landscape and small figures; [[:File:Landscape Screens Toji.jpg|image]]&lt;/ref&gt;  As female figures, mostly shown in a state of elegant lassitude, far outnumber the men, this is taken as an exemplar of "women's painting".

===The ''Legend of Mount Shigi''===
The ''[[Shigisan-engi]]'' or "Legend of [[Mount Shigi]]" tells the story of the 9th century [[Shingon]] monk Myoren, founder of the [[Chogosonshi-ji]] temple.  Like contemporary Western [[hagiographies]], the narrative contains [[miracle]]s, including a famous episode of the "flying storehouse" (illustrated).  The story takes place mostly among ordinary country people, and is shown as one continuous picture about 30 feet long, with the same characters recurring in different scenes which are connected by a continuous background (something also found in medieval Western art).  The images are done in a very different technique, with ink drawing lightly coloured by washes.  Most figures are men, and when women are shown, as in [[:File:Shigisan Engi Emaki - Women excitement.jpg|another scene where the missing rice returns]], they are shown in a very different way to the figures in the ''Genji Monogatari Emaki''. Facial features are shown in far more detail than in the ''Genji Monogatari Emaki'', and a wide range of expressions are expertly depicted.  This is an example of one version of what "men's painting" is taken to refer to.

===Other works===
The ''[[Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki]]'' is a now incomplete illustrated version of {{nihongo|''[[The Diary of Lady Murasaki]]''|紫式部日記|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki}}, the author of ''The Tale of Genjii'', today surviving in four sections, with images of court ceremonies.

An early military and political work is the ''[[Ban Dainagon Ekotoba]]'' (伴大納言絵詞 The Tale of Great Minister Ban), a late 12th century ''[[emakimono]]'' (handscroll painting) depicting the events of the [[Ōtenmon Conspiracy]], an event of Japan's early Heian period. The painting, attributed to [[Tokiwa Mitsunaga]], is over 20m long and about 31.5&amp;nbsp;cm tall.

The ''[[Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga]]'' represents a very different style within Yamato-e, with very lively pen drawings of men and anthropomorphic animals in a number of scenes.

Rather more examples survive from the following [[Kamakura period]] (1185-1333), including many showing scenes of life among the ordinary people, and also stories of wars from Japanese history.  The ''[[Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba]]'' (蒙古襲来絵詞 Illustrated Account of the Mongol Invasion) are a pair of illustrated handscrolls from between 1275 and 1293. They were commissioned by the samurai [[Takezaki Suenaga]] in order to record his battlefield valour and deeds during the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]].

From near the end of the first period of works in the style, the ''[[Yūki Kassen Ekotoba]]'' is a handscroll nearly 3 metres long, with a single wide battle scene after a text section, illustrating the suicide of [[Ashikaga Mochiuji]] after his rebellion in 1439.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bunka.nii.ac.jp/SearchDetail.do?heritageId=85010&amp;imageNum=7 Shihon Chakushoku Yūki Kassen Ekotoba], Cultural Heritage Online {{ja icon}} accessed on July 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phemba''', also known as '''[[Yombe people|Yombe]] maternity figures''', refers to sculptural objects that depict the figures of a mother and child.&lt;ref name="AfAmInstitute1980"&gt;{{cite book | title=Masterpieces of the People's Republic of the Congo: the African-American Institute, September 25, 1980-January 24, 1981 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaPuAAAAMAAJ | accessdate=28 May 2013 | year=1980 | publisher=African-American Institute  |  page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phyllis2009"&gt;{{cite book | author=Phyllis Martin | title=Catholic women of Congo-Brazzaville: mothers and sisters in troubled times | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DWqkajkbmUC&amp;pg=PA197 | accessdate=28 May 2013 | year=2009 | publisher=Indiana University Press | isbn=978-0-253-22055-4 | pages=197–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Phemba are iconic examples of [[Kingdom of Kongo#Art_of_the_Kongo_Kingdom|Kongo art]] and  according to Thompson (1981) "reflect the degree to which women are treasured in Kongo culture, not just for their fecundity, but as seers and guardians of the spirit".&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2018}} 
Kongo societies are [[matrilineal]].&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In special cases, communities honored women by commissioning stone icons depicting a mother and child to be placed on their tombs. This was also considered dangerous, as it represented an insertion of the source of life - the mother - into the world of the dead.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|title=The four moments of the sun : Kongo art in two worlds|year=1981|publisher=National Gallery of Art, Washington|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=089468003X|author2=Cornet, Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kikongo]] word ''phemba'' translates to "the white",&lt;ref&gt;Herbert M. Cole, ''ICONS'' (1989), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the white earth ([[Kaolinite]]) that is a sign of fertility in the region. The name is interpreted by  [[John M. Janzen]] (1979) as denoting "'the one who gives children in-potentia.' A phemba child is a magically conceived [[nkisi]] child, a fragile emissary of the spirit world."&lt;ref name="African Religions"&gt;{{cite book|title=African religions: a symposium|year=1979|publisher=NOK Publishers|location=New York|edition=2nd printing, corr.|editor=Newell S. Booth,}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phemba statuary falls into two groups: mothers cradling or holding their babies, and mothers nursing.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;
The very different styles of phemba sculptures illustrate regional and even personal variations on the same theme.
Oral tradition holds that the phemba cult was established by a famous midwife.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7398">The '''Young Macedonian Literary Society''' was founded in 1891, in Sofia, together with its magazine [[Loza (magazine)|Loza]]. The society formed primarily as a scholarly and literary organization.

After a distinct Bulgarian state was established in 1878, Macedonia remained outside its borders. In the 1880s, the Bulgarian codificators rejected the idea of a Macedono-Bulgarian linguistic compromise, and chose eastern Bulgarian dialects as a basis for standard Bulgarian. One purpose of the Young Macedonian Literary Society magazine was to defend the [[Macedonian dialects]], and to have them more represented in the [[Bulgarian language]]. The articles were historical, cultural, and ethnographic.

An article in the official [[People's Liberal Party]] newspaper "Svoboda" blamed the organization for lack of loyalty and separatism. The Society rejected these accusations for linguistic and national separatism,&lt;ref&gt;"Loza", Issue 1, p.91-96&lt;/ref&gt; and in a response to "Svoboda" claimed that their "society is far from any separatist thoughts, in which we were accused and to say that the ideal of Young Macedonian Literary Society is not separatism, but unity of the entire Bulgarian nation".&lt;ref&gt;"Loza", Issue 1, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; Still some linguists identify this magazine as an early platform of Macedonian ''linguistic separatism'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.uchicago.edu/~vfriedm/Articles/003Friedman75.pdf "Macedonian Language and Nationalism During the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries"], Victor Friedman, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.mk/books?id=I9p_m7oXQ00C&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=Macedonians+Loza&amp;hl=mk&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7xsiUYvzAqf14QTb9IGwAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Macedonians%20Loza&amp;f=false Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans], Victor Roudometof, Roland Robertson, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors considered themselves [[Macedonian Bulgarians]].&lt;ref&gt;"Though Loza adhered to the Bulgarian position on the issue of the Macedonian Slavs' ethnicity, it also favored revising the Bulgarian orthography by bringing it closer to the dialects spoken in Macedonia." Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0810862956}}, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Young Macedonian Literary Association's Journal, Loza, was also categorical about the Bulgarian character of Macedonia: "A mere comparison of those ethnographic features which characterize the Macedonians (we understand: Macedonian Bulgarians), with those which characterize the free Bulgarians, their juxtaposition with those principles for nationality which we have formulated above, is enough to prove and to convince everybody that the nationality of the Macedonians cannot be anything except Bulgarian." Freedom or Death, The Life of Gotsé Delchev, Mercia MacDermott, The Journeyman Press, London &amp; West Nyack, 1978, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland. They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism. ''Region, Regional Identity, and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe'', Ethnologia Balkanica Series, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2010, {{ISBN|3825813878}}, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a whole, the Lozars demonstrated both Bulgarian and Macedonian loyalty, and combined their Bulgarian nationalism with Macedonian regional and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;"Macedonian historiography often refers to the group of young activists who founded in Sofia an association called the ‘Young Macedonian Literary Society’. In 1892, the latter began publishing the review Loza [The Vine], which promoted certain characteristics of Macedonian dialects.

At the same time, the activists, called ‘Lozars’ after the name of their review, ‘purified’ the Bulgarian orthography from some rudiments of the Church Slavonic. They expressed likewise a kind of Macedonian patriotism attested already by the first issue of the review: its materials greatly emphasized identification with Macedonia as a genuine ‘fatherland’. In any case, it is hardly surprising that the Lozars demonstrated both Bulgarian and Macedonian loyalty: what is more interesting is namely the fact that their Bulgarian nationalism was somehow harmonized with a Macedonian self-identification that was not only a political one but also demonstrated certain ‘cultural’ contents. "We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe", Diana Miškova, Central European University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9639776289}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Bulgarian historians, such as Veselin Angelov, Nikola Achkov and Kosta Tzarnushanov continue to publish their research backed with many primary sources to prove that the term 'Macedonian' when applied to Slavs has always meant only a regional identity of the Bulgarians. "Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Chris Kostov, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3034301960}}, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's founders included [[Kosta Shahov]], its chairman. In May 1894, after the fall of Stambolov, the '' Macedonian Youth Society'' in Sofia revived the Young Macedonian Literary Society. The new group had a newspaper called ''Glas Makedonski'', and opened a Reading Room Club. The group included a number of educators, revolutionaries, and public figures from Macedonia—[[Evtim Sprostranov]], [[Petar Pop Arsov]], [[Thoma Karayovov]], [[Hristo Popkotsev]], [[Dimitar Mirchev]], [[Andrey Lyapchev]], [[Naum Tyufekchiev]], [[Georgi Balaschev]], [[Georgi Belev (revolutionary)|Georgi Belev]], etc.—all known as the ''Lozars''.&lt;ref&gt;"100 years IMORO", prof. Dimitŭr Minchev, prof. Dimitŭr  Gotsev, Macedonian scientific institute, 1994, Sofia, p. 37; (Bg.)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, for a short time in the company were involved also [[Dame Gruev]], [[Gotse Delchev]], [[Luka Dzherov]], [[Ivan Hadzhinikolov]] and [[Hristo Matov]].&lt;ref&gt;History of the Sofia University "St. Kliment Okhridski", Georgi Naumov, Dimitŭr Tsanev, University publishing house "St. Kliment Okhridski", 1988, p. 164; (Bg.)&lt;/ref&gt; These activists went on to various careers. Some became leaders in the Macedonian revolutionary movement—both the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] in 1894, and the [[Supreme Macedonian Committee]] in 1895. Others became later prominent Bulgarian intellectuals, and  [[Andrey Lyapchev]] became prime minister of Bulgaria.
