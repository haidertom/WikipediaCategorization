'''Actinobiology''' is the study of the effects of [[radiation]] upon living organisms. Actinobiology has become particularly relevant in space travel due to the abundance of cosmic radiation, which may negatively impact unprotected living organisms in space. 

Radiations are the most important physical mutagens. H.J. Muller who used X-rays for the first time to increase the rate of mutation in ''Drosophila'', opened an entirely new field in inducing mutations. So Muller is considered as the 'Father of Actinobiology'.

In 2002, Russian scientists found melanin-rich fungi growing near [[ground zero]] at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]. It was soon discovered that these fungi were using radiation as an energy source in much the same way that plants use the sun for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Chernobyl Fungus Feeds on Radiation| last=Melville| first=Kate| publisher=Science a Gogo| date=2007-05-23| accessdate=2012-05-28| url=http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20070422222547data_trunc_sys.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiotrophic bacterium have also been discovered deep underground, feeding on [[uranium]] emissions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1211">'''Bis-peptides''' are analogues of [[peptide]]s, but consist of [[bis-amino acid]]s, which bear two [[carboxyl group]]s and two [[amino group]]s. The connection of specific bis-amino acids leads to the formation of bis-peptides with well-defined molecular shape, which is of great interest for designing nano-structures.

Possible applications that are currently investigated include the binding and inactivation of [[cholera toxin]] and the cross linkage of surface [[protein]]s of various viruses ([[HIV]], [[Ebola virus]]). Further the group of Christian Schafmeister developed molecular hinges, which can be used for the construction of [[molecular machine]]s, such as nano-[[valve]]s or [[data storage device|data storage]] systems.

'''Buddhology''' is the study of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] or [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;
"buddhology." Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English, Preview Edition (v 0.9.7). Lexico Publishing Group, LLC. 09 Sep. 2008. &lt;Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/buddhology&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used as a synonym for [[Buddhist Studies]], contemporary academic investigation of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Japanese Association of Indian and Buddhist Studies, "Summary of the Activities of the Japanese Association of Indian and Buddhist Studies"{{cite web |url=http://www.jaibs.jp/English/english.html |title=日本印度学仏教学会 |accessdate=2008-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915194020/http://www.jaibs.jp/English/english.html |archivedate=2009-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are varied and nuanced understandings of the precise nature of a Buddha expressed in the different Buddhist traditions and movements.

==Theravada==

===Basic View: Buddha was a Perfect Human Being===
[[Theravada]] Buddhists base their view of the Buddha on the [[Pali Canon]], which appear to be the oldest surviving Buddhist scriptures. From the accounts contained in the Pali Canon emerges the view that Buddha was a human being &amp;mdash; a perfected human being. Buddha was also possessed of all the various supernatural powers, and mastered these to the greatest extent possible ([[Digha Nikaya]] 11: Kevatta Sutta). The body and mind of a Buddha (while alive) are impermanent and changing, just like the body and mind of ordinary people. A Buddha does recognize the unchanging nature of the Dharma, which is an eternal principle, and an unconditioned and timeless phenomenon.

When Buddha died at the age of 80, his body and mind both came to an end. After death, the state of Buddha is undefinable ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN 22]]). However, a Buddha definitely does not experience [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] after death, but experiences the attainment of [[Parinibbana]] (the ultimate [[Nirvana]]). There is thus an end to the life-continuity of rebirths succeeding one another (this is one of the meanings of [[samsara]]).

In Theravada, a Buddha is not regarded as a [[god]] nor as having created the universe or ruling over it.

===Meaning of 'Whoever Sees the Dharma Sees Me'===
Theravada Buddhism interprets the statement by Buddha that "whoever sees the Dharma sees me (that is; the Buddha)"&lt;ref&gt;Pali Canon, S III.XXII.87(5.5) / S III.120&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of the whole conversation which the Buddha held on that occasion. The goal of this teaching was to make clear that the physical body of the Buddha is not the essence of his being, and that seeing his body doesn't tell you much about him at all. Even when one is sitting next to him, if one doesn't know his teaching (or sees the truth he discovered: [[Dharma]]), one is really far from him. But when one sees the Dharma, even if one is very far away, it is as if one is very close to him, because one really sees what Buddhahood is about. According to the Theravada tradition, the context of the teaching thus does not support any claim for the Buddha to have meant that his existence is God-like (permanent, unchanging, timeless), which is how this sentence is sometimes interpreted in Mahayana Buddhism.

==Early Buddhist Schools==

===Sarvastivada===

====Dharmakāya====
{{Main|Dharmakaya}}

====Vipāka-kāya / Rūpa-kāya====

====Nirmāna-kāya====

===Mahāsānghika===
According to the descriptions of sectarian tenets by [[Vasumitra]], [[Bhavaviveka]] and [[Vinitadeva]], the main [[Mahāsāmghika|Mahāsānghika]] theses, apparently also held in common by all the [[Mahāsānghika]] sub-groups, concerning the nature of Buddhas were:
* Buddhas are supramundane.
* Buddhas are devoid of all impurities (''anāsrava'') and mundane qualities.
* Buddhas preach the Dharma with every verbal utterance they make.
* Buddhas can express all elements of the Dharma by uttering a single sound.
* The material body (''rūpakāya'') of Buddhas is unlimited (''anatman'')
* The supernatural powers (''prabhāva'') of Buddhas are unlimited.
* The longevity of Buddhas is unlimited.
* In order to convert beings and to generate pure faith within them, Buddhas have no thought of satiation
* Buddhas neither sleep nor dream
* Buddhas reply to questions without the need for reflection.
* Buddhas never actually utter any words since they abide in eternal [[samādhi]] or meditative concentration, but beings perceive words to have been uttered.
* Buddhas understand all things with one momentary thought.
* Buddhas know all things because insight or ''prajñā'' is conjoined to that one momentary thought.
* The knowledge of cessation and of non-arising in the future are sustained continuously in Buddhas until they enter [[parinirvāna]].
* There are Buddhas dwelling in all directions of the compass.

==Mahayana==

===Early Mahayana===

===Mid-period Mahayana===

====Eternal Buddha====
{{main|Eternal Buddha}}
An important doctrine that flourished during the middle period of the unfolding of the Mahayana - and is still important today amongst certain Mahayana schools of Buddhism - is that of the Buddha's immortality and eternity. The idea of an eternal Buddha is a notion popularly associated with the Mahayana scripture, the [[Lotus Sutra]], which was written down about 500 years after [[Shakyamuni]]`s preaching of it.. The Lotus Sutra has the Buddha indicating that he became awakened countless, immeasurable, inconceivable trillions of aeons ("kalpas") ago and that his lifetime is "forever existing and immortal". The sutra itself, however, does not directly employ the phrase "eternal Buddha"; yet similar notions are found in other Mahayana scriptures, notably the [[Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], which presents the Buddha as the ultimately real, eternal ("nitya"/ "śāśvata"), unchanging, blissful, pure Self (Atman) who, as the [[Dharmakaya]], knows of no beginning or end. The notion of an eternal Buddha perhaps finds resonance with the earlier idea of eternal Dharma/Nirvana, of which the Buddha is said to be an embodiment.

While Theravada Buddhism holds back from stating that the Buddha is eternal and emphasises all-round impermanence, some expressions of Mahayana Buddhism, however, regard such an understanding as incomplete. The [[Tathagatagarbha]] sutras provide an allegedly culminational doctrine of a pure Selfhood (the eternal yet ungraspable hypostasis of the Buddha) which no longer generates karma and which subsists eternally in the realm of Nirvana, from which sphere help to suffering worldly beings can be sent forth in the forms of various transitory physical Buddhas ("nirmānakāyas"). While the bodies of these corporeal Buddhas are subject to disease, decline and death - like all impermanent things - the salvational Tathagata or Dharmakaya behind them is forever free from impairment, impermanence and mortality. It is this transcendent yet immanent Dharmakaya-Buddha which is taught in certain major Mahayana sutras to be immutable and eternal and is intimately linked with Dharma itself. According to the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], worldly beings fail to see this eternality of the Buddha and his Dharma. The Buddha declares in that latter Mahayana sutra, which presents itself as the last and most definitive of all sutras: "I say that those who do not know that the Tathagata [Buddha] is eternal are the foremost of the congenitally blind."

====''Buddha-dhatu'' theories====
{{main|Buddha nature}}
'''Buddha-nature''' ([[Classical Chinese]]: 佛性, modern [[pinyin]] ''fó xìng'', literally corresponds to the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], ''Buddha-dhatu'' - "Buddha Element", "Buddha-Principle", but seems to have been used most frequently to translate the Sanskrit ''[[Tathagatagarbha doctrine|Tathāgata-garbha]]'', meaning "Buddha Matrix", which would be more directly translated into Chinese as 如来蔵) is a doctrine important for many schools of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]]. The Buddha Nature or Buddha Principle (''Buddha-dhatu'') is taught to be a truly real, but internally hidden immortal potency or element within the purest depths of the mind, present in all [[sentience|sentient]] beings, for [[bodhi|awakening]] and becoming a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].

====Trikaya theories====
{{Main|Trikaya}}
The ''Trikaya'' doctrine ([[Sanskrit]], literally "Three bodies or personalities"; 三身 [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''Sānshén'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''sanjin'') is an important Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and what a Buddha is. By the 4th century CE the trikaya doctrine had assumed its current form. Briefly the doctrine says that a Buddha has three ''kayas'' or ''bodies'': the ''[[nirmanakaya]]'' or ''created body'' which manifests in time and space; the ''[[sambhogakaya]]'' or ''body of mutual enjoyment'' which is an archetypal manifestation; and the ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' or ''reality body'' which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries.&lt;ref name="purifymind.com"&gt;Welwood, John (2000). ''The Play of the Mind: Form, Emptiness, and Beyond''. Source:  http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm (accessed:  Saturday January 13, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the view of [[Anuyoga]], the '[[Mindstream]]' (Sanskrit: ''citta santana'') is the 'continuity' (Sanskrit: ''santana''; Wylie: ''rgyud'') that links the Trikaya.&lt;ref name="purifymind.com"/&gt; The Trikaya, as a triune, is symbolised by the [[Gankyil]].

'''Cleaner production''' is a preventive, company-specific [[environmental protection]] initiative.  It is intended to [[waste reduction|minimize waste]] and [[Air pollutants|emissions]] and maximize product output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yacooub |first=Ali |author2=Johannes Fresner |title=Half is Enough - An Introduction to Cleaner Production |year=2006 |publisher=LCPC Press |location=[[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] |isbn=978-3-9501636-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By analysing the flow of materials and [[energy]] in a company, one tries to identify options to minimize waste and emissions out of [[Industry|industrial]] processes through [[source reduction]] strategies.  Improvements of organisation and technology help to reduce or suggest better choices in use of materials and energy,  and to avoid waste, [[waste water]] generation, and gaseous emissions, and also [[waste heat]] and noise. 

The concept was developed during the preparation of the [[Rio Summit]] as a programme of UNEP ([[United Nations Environmental Programme]]) and UNIDO ([[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060528092455/http://www.unido.org/doc/4460 National Cleaner Production Center Programme]&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of Jacqueline Aloisi de Larderel, the former Assistant Executive Director of UNEP. The programme was meant to reduce the environmental impact of industry. It built on ideas used by 3M in its 3P programme (pollution prevention pays). It has found more international support than all other comparable programmes. The programme idea was described "...to assist developing nations in leapfrogging from pollution to less pollution, using available technologies". Starting from the simple idea to produce with less waste Cleaner Production was developed into a concept to increase the [[resource efficiency]] of production in general. UNIDO has been operating [[National Cleaner Production Centers]] and Programmes (NCPCs/NCPPs) with centres in Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051208113414/http://www.unido.org/en/doc/4460 UNIDO NCPC Programme, including lessons learned, and contact to National Cleaner Production Centers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the term [[pollution prevention]] is more commonly used for cleaner production.

Examples for cleaner production options are: 

*'''Documentation of consumption''' (as a basic analysis of material and energy flows, e. g. with a [[Sankey diagram]]) 
*'''Use of indicators and controlling''' (to identify losses from poor planning, poor education and training, mistakes)
*'''Substitution of raw materials and auxiliary materials''' (especially [[renewable]] materials and energy) 
*'''Increase of useful life of auxiliary materials and process liquids''' (by avoiding drag in, drag out, contamination) 
*'''Improved control and automatisation''' 
*'''[[Reuse]] of waste''' (internal or external) 
*'''New, low waste processes and technologies'''

One of the first [[Europe]]an initiatives in cleaner production was started in [[Austria]] in 1992 by the BMVIT (Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie). This resulted in two initiatives: "Prepare" and [[EcoProfit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701221957/http://www.prepare.at/ Prepare]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoprofit.com ECOPROFIT Plattform]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080109072549/http://www.cpc.at/unternehmen/un_Allgemeines_e.htm Cleaner Production Center Austria] Official ECOPROFIT Trainings &amp; Distribution Center&lt;/ref&gt;

The "PIUS" initiative was founded in Germany in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pius-info.de PIUS: Produktionsintegrierter Umweltschutz]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] operates the National Cleaner Production Centre Programme with centres in [[Central America]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6673">'''Computational musicology''' is defined as the study of [[music]] with computational modelling and simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Coutinho, Gimenes, Martins and Miranda (2005): "Computational Musicology: An Artificial Life Approach", &lt;http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/publications/computationalmusicology.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It saw its beginning in the 1950s and originally did not use computers, but more of statistical and [[mathematical]] methods. Nowadays computational musicology depends mostly on complex [[algorithms]] to either go through vast amounts of information or produce music using given parameters. Several  alternative names and subdisciplines of the field include mathematical music theory, computer music, systematic musicology, music information retrieval, computational musicology, digital musicology, sound and music computing and music informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meredith|first1=David|title=Computational Music Analysis|date=2016|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-3319259291|page=v|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Lejaren Hiller]] acted as one of the foremost pioneers by creating one of the first musical compositions with a computer in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Lejaren Hiller Wikipedia article, [[Lejaren Hiller]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s research continued using statistical and mathematical methods, and started to use computers in an increasing manner as their capabilities grew. 1970s and 1980s were especially significant times for computational musicology as many discoveries were made. Since then the field has suffered a general lack of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Laine, Pauli (2005): "Tietokoneavusteisen musiikintutkimuksen menetelmistä" (in Finnish)&lt;http://www.musiikkilehti.fi/1-2005/2.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Most of the work in computational musicology is done with computers that run specifically designed programs. Commonly they employ the theory and methods statistical science, mathematics and music theory. Comprehension of the physics of hearing and sound are also required in analysis of raw audio data.

== Applications ==

=== Music databases ===
One of the earliest applications in computational musicology was the creation and use of musical [[databases]]. Input, usage and analysis of large amounts of data can be very troublesome using manual methods while usage of computers can make such tasks considerably easier.

=== Analysis of music ===
Different computer programs have been developed to analyze musical data. Data formats vary from standard notation to raw audio. Analysis of formats that are based on storing all properties of each note, for example [[MIDI]], were used originally and are still among the most common methods. Significant advances in analysis of raw audio data have been made only recently.

=== Artificial production of music ===
Different algorithms can be used to both [[algorithmic composition|create complete compositions]] and [[machine improvisation|improvise music]]. One of the methods by which a program can learn [[improvisation]] is analysis of choices a human player makes while improvising. [[Artificial neural networks]] are used extensively in such applications.

=== Historical change and music ===
One developing sociomusicological theory in computational musicology is the "Discursive Hypothesis" proposed by Kristoffer Jensen and [[David G. Hebert]], which suggests that "because both music and language are cultural discourses (which may reflect social reality in similarly limited ways), a relationship may be identifiable between the trajectories of significant features of musical sound and linguistic discourse regarding social data."&lt;ref&gt;McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David (2014) [https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Historical-Ethnomusicology-Jonathan-McCollum/dp/0739168266 ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''] Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman &amp; Littlefield {{ISBN|0739168266}}; p.62. Some of Jensen and Hebert’s pioneering findings from 2013 on tendencies in US [[Billboard Hot 100]] songs have since been replicated and expanded upon by other scholars (e.g. Mauch M, MacCallum RM,Levy M, Leroi AM. 2015 The evolution of popular music: USA 1960–2010. R. Soc. Open sci. 2: 150081. https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.150081).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this perspective, analyses of "[[big data]]" may improve our understandings of how particular features of music and society are interrelated and change similarly across time, as significant correlations are increasingly identified within the musico-linguistic spectrum of human auditory communication.&lt;ref&gt;Kristoffer Jensen and David G. Hebert (2016). Evaluation and Prediction of Harmonic Complexity Across 76 Years of Billboard 100 Hits. In  R. Kronland-Martinet, M. Aramaki, and S. Ystad, (Eds.), [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-46282-0_18 ''Music, Mind, and Embodiment'']. Switzerland: Springer Press, pp.283-296. {{ISBN|978-3-319-46281-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-western music ===
Strategies from computational musicology are recently being applied for analysis of music in various parts of the world. For example, professors affiliated with the [[Birla Institute of Technology]] in India have produced studies of harmonic and melodic tendencies (in the [[raga]] structure) of [[Hindustani classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, S., Mazzola, G., Tewari, S., Patra, M. (2014) [https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319114712 "Computational Musicology in Hindustani Music"] New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

[[RISM|RISM's]] [http://www.rism.info/ (Répertoire International des Sources Musicales)] database is one of the world's largest music databases, containing over 700,000 references to musical manuscripts. Anyone can use its search engine to find compositions.&lt;ref&gt;RISM database, &lt;http://www.rism.info/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre for History and Analysis of Recorded Music (CHARM) has developed the [[Mazurka Project]],&lt;ref&gt;Mazurka Project, &lt;http://mazurka.org.uk/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which offers "downloadable recordings . . . analytical software and training materials, and a variety of resources relating to the history of recording."

'''Cre-Lox recombination''' is a [[site-specific recombinase technology]], used to carry out [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]], [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]] and [[Chromosomal inversion|inversions]] at specific sites in the DNA of cells. It allows the DNA modification to be targeted to a specific cell type or be triggered by a specific external stimulus. It is implemented both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. The Cre-lox recombination system has been particularly useful to help neuroscientists to study the brain in which complex cell types and neural circuits come together to generate cognition and behaviors. NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research has created several hundreds of Cre driver mouse lines which are currently used by the worldwide neuroscience community.

The system consists of a single enzyme, [[Cre recombinase]], that [[Genetic recombination|recombines]] a pair of short target sequences called the ''Lox'' sequences. This system can be implemented without inserting any extra supporting proteins or sequences. The Cre enzyme and the original ''Lox'' site called the ''LoxP'' sequence are derived from [[bacteriophage]] [[P1 phage|P1]].

Placing Lox sequences appropriately allows genes to be activated, repressed, or exchanged for other genes. At a DNA level many types of manipulations can be carried out. The activity of the Cre enzyme can be controlled so that it is expressed in a particular cell type or triggered by an external stimulus like a chemical signal or a heat shock. These targeted DNA changes are useful in cell lineage tracing and when mutants are lethal if expressed globally.

The Cre-Lox system is very similar in action and in usage to the [[FLP-FRT recombination]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turan |first1=S. |last2=Galla |first2=M. |last3=Ernst |first3=E. |last4=Qiao |first4=J. |last5=Voelkel |first5=C. |last6=Schiedlmeier |first6=B. |last7=Zehe |first7=C. |last8=Bode |first8=J. | year = 2011 | title = Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE): traditional concepts and current challenges | url = | journal = J.

==History==
Cre-Lox recombination is a special type of [[Site-specific recombinase technology|site-specific recombination]] developed by Dr. [[Brian Sauer]] that operated in both mitotic and non-mitotic cells, and was initially used in activating gene expression in mammalian cell lines ([[DuPont]]).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last1 = Sauer | first1 = B. | year = 1987 | title = Functional expression of the Cre-Lox site-specific recombination system in the yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' | url = | journal = Mol Cell Biol | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 2087–2096 | pmid = 3037344 | pmc = 365329 | doi=10.1128/mcb.7.6.2087
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, researchers in the laboratory of Dr. [[Jamey Marth]] demonstrated that Cre-Lox recombination could be used to delete loxP-flanked chromosomal DNA sequences at high efficiency in specific developing T-cells of transgenic animals, with the authors proposing that this approach could be used to define endogenous gene function in specific cell types, indelibly mark progenitors in cell fate determination studies, induce specific chromosomal rearrangements for biological and disease modeling, and determine the roles of early genetic lesions in disease (and phenotype) maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orban | first1 = P.C. | last2 = Chui | first2 = D. | last3 = Marth | first3 = J.D. | year = 1992 | title = Tissue– and site–specific recombination in transgenic mice | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 6861–6865 | doi=10.1073/pnas.89.15.6861| pmc = 49604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, researchers in the laboratory of Prof. Klaus Rajewsky reported the production of pluripotent embryonic stem cells bearing a targeted loxP-flanked (floxed) DNA polymerase gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gu | first1 = H. | last2 = Zou | first2 = Y.R. | last3 = Rajewsky | first3 = K. | year = 1993 | title = Independent control of immunoglobulin switch recombination at individual switch regions evidenced through Cre–loxP–mediated gene targeting | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 1155–1564 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(93)90644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Combining these advances in collaboration, the laboratories of Drs. Marth and Rajewsky reported in 1994 that Cre-lox recombination could be used for conditional gene targeting in developing T-cells in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gu | first1 = H. | last2 = Marth | first2 = J.D. | last3 = Orban | first3 = P.C. | last4 = Mossman | first4 = H. | last5 = Rajewsky | first5 = K. | year = 1994 | title = Deletion of the DNA polymerase beta gene in T cells using tissue-specific gene targeting | url = | journal = Science | volume = 265 | issue = | pages = 103–106 | doi=10.1126/science.8016642}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observed ~50% of the DNA polymerase beta gene was deleted in T cells based on DNA blotting. It was unclear whether only one allele in each T-cell or 50% of T cells had 100% deletion in both alleles.  Researchers have since reported more efficient Cre-Lox conditional gene mutagenesis in the developing T cells by the Marth laboratory in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hennet | display-authors = etal   | year = 1995 | title = T-cell specific deletion of a polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase gene by site-directed recombination | doi =  10.1073/pnas.92.26.12070 | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 12070–74 | pmc = 40298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incomplete deletion by [[Cre recombinase]] is not uncommon in cells when two copies of floxed sequences need to be targeted due to efficiency problems, which is discussed in the Efficiency of Action section below. 

Independently, [[Joe Z.

==Overview==
Cre-Lox recombination involves the targeting of a specific sequence of [[DNA]] and splicing it with the help of an enzyme called [[Cre recombinase]]. Cre-Lox recombination is commonly used to circumvent embryonic lethality caused by systemic inactivation of many genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shen | first1 = J | display-authors = etal   | year = 1997 | title = Skeletal and CNS defects in Presenilin-1-deficient mice | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 4| pages = 629–39 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80244-5| pmid = 9160754 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Y | display-authors = etal   | year = 1994 | title = Whisker-related neuronal patterns fail to develop in the trigeminal brainstem nuclei of NMDAR1 knockout mice | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 76 | issue = 3| pages = 427–37 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90108-2| pmid = 8313466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Cre–Lox recombination provides the best experimental control that presently exists in transgenic animal modeling to link genotypes (alterations in genomic DNA) to phenotypes (the biological outcomes).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feng | first1 = R | display-authors = etal   | year = 2001 | title = Deficient neurogenesis in forebrain-specific presenilin-1 knockout mice is associated with reduced clearance of hippocampal memory traces | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 32 | issue = 5| pages = 911–26 | doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00523-2| pmid = 11738035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cre-lox system is used as a genetic tool to control site specific [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] events in genomic DNA. This system has allowed researchers to manipulate a variety of genetically modified organisms to control gene expression, delete undesired DNA sequences and modify chromosome architecture.

The [[Cre recombinase|Cre]] protein is a site-specific DNA recombinase, that can catalyse the recombination of DNA between specific sites in a DNA molecule. These sites, known as ''loxP'' sequences, contain specific binding sites for Cre that surround a directional core sequence where recombination can occur.

[[Image:Cre Lox71-66 Recombination Method.png|800px|thumb|A diagram describing how Lox71 and Lox66 sites can be used to combine two plasmids into one contiguous plasmid.]]

When cells that have ''loxP'' sites in their genome express Cre, a recombination event can occur between the ''loxP'' sites. Cre recombinase proteins bind to the first and last 13 bp regions of a lox site forming a [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]. This dimer then binds to a dimer on another lox site to form a [[tetramer]]. Lox sites are directional and the two sites joined by the tetramer are parallel in orientation.  The double stranded DNA is cut at both ''loxP'' sites by the Cre protein. The strands are then rejoined with [[DNA ligase]] in a quick and efficient process. The result of recombination depends on the orientation of the ''loxP'' sites. For two lox sites on the same chromosome arm, inverted ''loxP'' sites will cause an inversion of the intervening DNA, while a direct repeat of ''loxP'' sites will cause a deletion event. If ''loxP'' sites are on different chromosomes it is possible for [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] events to be catalysed by Cre induced recombination. Two [[plasmid]]s can be joined using the variant lox sites 71 and 66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hastie | first1 =  | last2 = Pruitt | first2 =  | year = 2007 | title = Yeast two-hybrid interaction partner screening through in vivo Cre-mediated Binary Interaction Tag generation | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/AAV84941.1 | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 35 | issue = 21| page = e141 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkm894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cre recombinase===

The Cre protein (encoded by the locus originally named as "'''C'''auses '''re'''combination", with "'''C'''yclization '''re'''combinase" being found in some references)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/AAV84941.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 =  | last2 = Hamilton | first2 =  | year = 1981 | title =  Bacteriophage P1 site-specific recombination| doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(81)90375-2 | journal = J.

The total protein has 343 [[amino acid]]s. The C domain is similar in structure to the domain in the [[Integrase]] family of enzymes isolated from [[lambda phage]]. This is also the [[catalytic site]] of the enzyme.

===''loxP'' site===

''loxP'' (locus of X-over P1) is a site on the bacteriophage P1 consisting of 34 [[Base pairs|bp]]. The site includes an asymmetric 8 bp sequence, variable except for the middle two bases, in between two sets of symmetric, 13 bp sequences. The exact sequence is given below; 'N' indicates bases which may vary, and lowercase letters indicate bases that have been mutated from the wild-type. The 13 bp sequences are palindromic but the 8 bp spacer is not, thus giving the loxP sequence a certain direction. Usually loxP sites come in pairs for genetic manipulation. If the two loxP sites are in the same orientation, the floxed sequence (sequence flanked by two loxP sites) is excised; however if the two loxP sites are in the opposite orientation, the floxed sequence is inverted. If there exists a floxed donor sequence, the donor sequence can be swapped with the original sequence. This technique is called [[recombinase-mediated cassette exchange]] and is a very convenient and time-saving way for genetic manipulation. The caveat, however, is that the recombination reaction can happen backwards, rendering cassette exchange inefficient. In addition, sequence excision can happen ''in trans'' instead of a ''in cis'' cassette exchange event. The loxP mutants are created to avoid these problems&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite journal

==Holliday junctions and homologous recombination==
During genetic recombination, a [[Holliday junction]] is formed between the two strands of DNA and a double-stranded break in a DNA molecule leaves a 3’OH end exposed. This reaction is aided with the endonuclease activity of an enzyme. 5’ Phosphate ends are usually the substrates for this reaction, thus extended 3’ regions remain. This 3’ OH group is highly unstable, and the strand on which it is present must find its complement. Since homologous recombination occurs after DNA replication, two strands of DNA are available, and thus, the 3’ OH group must pair with its complement, and it does so, with an intact strand on the other duplex. Now, one point of crossover has occurred, which is what is called a Holliday Intermediate.

The 3’OH end is elongated (that is, bases are added) with the help of DNA Polymerase. The pairing of opposite strands is what constitutes the crossing-over or Recombination event, which is common to all living organisms, since the genetic material on one strand of one duplex has paired with one strand of another duplex, and has been elongated by DNA polymerase. Further cleavage of Holliday Intermediates results in formation of Hybrid DNA.

This further cleavage or ‘resolvation’ is done by a special group of enzymes called Resolvases. RuvC is just one of these Resolvases that have been isolated in bacteria and yeast.

For many years, it was thought that when the Holliday junction intermediate was formed, the branch point of the junction (where the strands cross over) would be located at the first cleavage site. Migration of the branch point to the second cleavage site would then somehow trigger the second half of the pathway. This model provided convenient explanation for the strict requirement for homology between recombining sites, since branch migration would stall at a mismatch and would not allow the second strand exchange to occur. In more recent years, however, this view has been challenged, and most of the current models for Int, Xer, and Flp recombination involve only limited branch migration 1–3 base pairs) of the Holliday intermediate, coupled to an isomerisation event that is responsible for switching the strand cleavage specificity.

==Site-specific recombination==
{{main article|Site-specific recombination}}
Site-specific recombination (SSR) involves specific sites for the catalyzing action of special enzymes called recombinases. Cre, or cyclic recombinase, is one such enzyme. Site-specific recombination is, thus, the enzyme-mediated cleavage and ligation of two defined deoxynucleotide sequences.

A number of conserved site-specific recombination systems have been described in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In general, these systems use one or more proteins and act on unique asymmetric DNA sequences. The products of the recombination event depend on the relative orientation of these asymmetric sequences. Many other proteins apart from the recombinase are involved in regulating the reaction. During site-specific DNA recombination, which brings about genetic rearrangement in processes such as viral integration and excision and chromosomal segregation, these recombinase enzymes recognize specific DNA sequences and catalyse the reciprocal exchange of DNA strands between these sites.

'''Mechanism of action'''
[[Image:CreLoxP experiment.png|500px|thumb|A model experiment in genetics using the Cre-lox system: the premature stop sequence present in floxed mice is removed only from cells that express Cre recombinase when the mice are bred together]]

Initiation of site-specific recombination begins with the binding of recombination proteins to their respective DNA targets. A separate recombinase recognizes and binds to each of two recombination sites on two different DNA molecules or within the same DNA strand. At the given specific site on the DNA, the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine in the recombinase attacks a phosphate group in the DNA backbone using a direct [[transesterification]] mechanism. This reaction links the recombinase protein to the DNA via a phospho-tyrosine linkage. This conserves the energy of the phosphodiester bond, allowing the reaction to be reversed without the involvement of a high-energy cofactor.

Cleavage on the other strand also causes a phospho-tyrosine bond between DNA and the enzyme. At both of the DNA duplexes, the bonding of the phosphate group to tyrosine residues leave a 3’ OH group free in the DNA backbone. In fact, the enzyme-DNA complex is an intermediate stage, which is followed by the ligation of the 3’ OH group of one DNA strand to the 5’ phosphate group of the other DNA strand, which is covalently bonded to the tyrosine residue; that is, the covalent linkage between 5’ end and tyrosine residue is broken. This reaction synthesizes the [[Holliday junction]] discussed earlier.

In this fashion, opposite DNA strands are joined together. Subsequent cleavage and rejoining cause DNA strands to exchange their segments. Protein-protein interactions drive and direct strand exchange. Energy is not compromised, since the protein-DNA linkage makes up for the loss of the phosphodiester bond, which occurred during cleavage.

Site-specific recombination is also an important process that viruses, such as bacteriophages, adopt to integrate their genetic material into the infected host. The virus, called a ''prophage'' in such a state, accomplishes this via integration and excision. The points where the integration and excision reactions occur are called the attachment (att) sites.  An attP site on the phage exchanges segments with an attB site on the bacterial DNA.  Thus, these are site-specific, occurring only at the respective att sites. The [[integrase]] class of enzymes catalyse this particular reaction.

'''Efficiency of action'''

Two factors have been shown to affect the efficiency of Cre's excision on the lox pair.  First, the nucleotide sequence identity in the spacer region of lox site. Engineered lox variants which differ on the spacer region tend to have varied but generally lower recombination efficiency compared to wildtype loxP, presumably through affecting the formation and resolution of recombination intermediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = G | last2 = Saito | first2 = I | year = 1998 | title = Role of nucleotide sequences of loxP spacer region in Cre-mediated recombination | url = | journal = Gene | volume = 216 | issue = 1| pages = 55–65 | pmid = 9714735 | doi=10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00325-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor is the length of DNA between the lox pair. Increasing the length of DNA leads to decreased efficiency of Cre/lox recombination possibly through regulating the dynamics of the reaction.&lt;ref name="stars"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = S-z | first1 = Wang | last2 = B-h | first2 = Liu | last3 = Tao | first3 = HW | last4 = Xia | first4 = K | last5 = Zhang | first5 = LI | year = 2009 | title = A Genetic Strategy for Stochastic Gene Activation with Regulated Sparseness (STARS) | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 1| page = e4200 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004200 | pmid=19145242 | pmc=2615212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zheng | first1 = B | last2 = Sage | first2 = M | last3 = Sheppeard | first3 = EA | last4 = Jurecic | first4 = V | last5 = Bradley | first5 = A | year = 2000 | title = Engineering Mouse Chromosomes with Cre-loxP: Range,Efficiency, and Somatic Applications | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 648–655 | doi=10.1128/mcb.20.2.648-655.2000| pmid = 10611243 | pmc=85158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiuGenesis"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1= J | last2 = Willet| first2 = SG| last3=Bankaitis| first3=ED| year =2013 | title = Non-parallel recombination limits Cre-LoxP-based reporters as precise indicators of conditional genetic manipulation | journal = Genesis | volume = 51 | issue = 6  | page = 436-42| doi=10.1002/dvg.22384 |pmid = 23441020 | pmc=3696028}}&lt;/ref&gt;Genetic location of the floxed sequence affects recombination efficiency as well probably by influencing the availability of DNA by [[Cre recombinase]]&lt;ref name="LiuGenesis"/&gt;.The choice of Cre driver is also important as low expression of [[Cre recombinase]] tends to result in non-parallel recombination. Non-parallel recombination is especially problematic in a [[fate mapping]] scenario where one recombination event is designed to manipulate the gene under study and the other recombination event is necessary for activating a reporter gene (usually encoding a fluorescent protein) for [[cell lineage]] tracing&lt;ref name="LiuGenesis"/&gt;. Failure to activate both recombination events simultaneously confounds the interpretation of cell [[fate mapping]] results.

'''Temporal control'''

Another variant that aids in the control of the expression of the gene in terms of its timing is the tamoxifen-inducible system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walrath | first1 = CJ | last2 = Hawes | first2 = JJ | last3 = Dyke | first3 = VT | last4 = Reilly | first4 = MK | year = 2010 | title = Chapter 4 - Genetically engineered mouse models in cancer research | url = | journal = Advances in Cancer Research | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 113–164 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-230X(10)06004-5 | pmc = 3533445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;This is done through the addition of a ligand binding domain(estrogen receptor) on the Cre recombinase which is specifically activated by tamoxifen. Once both sequences of the mutated Cre and the loxP genes are located in one mouse, the absence of tamoxifen will result in the shuttling of the mutated recombinase into the cytoplasm. The protein will stay in this location in its inactivate state until tamoxifen is given. Once tamoxifen is introduced, the mutated recombinase is shuttled back into the nucleus and is able to cleave the lox sites, resulting in a loss of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kristianto | first1 = J | last2 = Johnson | first2 = MG | last3 = Zastrow | first3 = RK | last4 = Radcliff | first4 = AB | last5 = Blank | first5 = RD | year = 2017 | title = Spontaneous recombinase activity of Cre-ERT2 in vivo | url = | journal = Transgenic Research | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 411–417 | doi = 10.1007/s11248-017-0018-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural function of the Cre-lox system==
The [[P1 phage]] is a [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] phage that causes either a [[Lysogenic cycle|lysogenic]] or [[lytic cycle]] when it infects a bacterium. In its lytic state, once its viral genome is injected into the host cell, viral proteins are produced, virions are assembled, and the host cell is lysed to release the phages, continuing the cycle. In the lysogenic cycle the phage genome replicates with the rest of the bacterial genome and is transmitted to daughter cells at each subsequent cell division. It can transition to the lytic cycle by a later event such as UV radiation or starvation.

Phages like the [[lambda phage]] use their site specific recombinases to integrate their DNA into the host genome during lysogeny. P1 phage DNA on the other hand, exists as a [[plasmid]] in the host. The Cre-lox system serves several functions in the phage: it circularizes the phage DNA into a plasmid, separates interlinked plasmid rings so they are passed to both daughter bacteria equally and may help maintain copy numbers through an alternative means of replication.&lt;ref name=Lobocka2004&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1128/JB.186.21.7032-7068.2004| issn = 0021-9193| volume = 186| issue = 21| pages = 7032–7068| last = Łobocka| first = Małgorzata B.|author2=Debra J.

The P1 phage DNA when released into the host from the virion is in the form of a linear double stranded DNA molecule. The Cre enzyme targets loxP sites at the ends of this molecule and cyclises the genome. This can also take place in the absence of the Cre lox system&lt;ref name=Hoess1983&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1146/annurev.ge.17.120183.001011| volume = 17| issue = 1| pages = 123–154| last = Sternberg| first = N|author2=R Hoess| title = The Molecular Genetics of Bacteriophage P1| journal = Annual Review of Genetics| accessdate = 2012-03-26| year = 1983| url =  http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ge.17.120183.001011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the help of other bacterial and viral proteins. The P1 plasmid is relatively large (~90Kbp) and hence exists in a low copy number - usually one per cell. If the two daughter plasmids get interlinked one of the daughter cells of the host will lose the plasmid. The Cre-lox recombination system prevents these situations by unlinking the rings of DNA by carrying out two recombination events (linked rings -&gt; single fused ring -&gt; two unlinked rings). It is also proposed that rolling circle replication followed by recombination will allow the plasmid to increase its copy number when certain regulators (repA) are limiting.&lt;ref name=Lobocka2004/&gt;

==Implementation of multiple loxP site pairs==
Multiple variants of loxP,&lt;ref&gt;Editor's Summary (1 November 2007) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7166/edsumm/e071101-01.html Over the brainbow]. ''Nature.'' Accessed 15 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular lox2272 and loxN, have been used by researchers with the combination of different Cre actions (transient or constitutive) to create a "[[Brainbow]]" system that allows multi-colouring of mice's brain with four fluorescent proteins.

Another report using two lox variants pair but through regulating the length of DNA in one pair results in stochastic gene activation with regulated level of sparseness.&lt;ref name="stars"/&gt;

Their penetration tests were permformed from both whitebox and blackbox perspectives. Cure53 focused primarily on trying to find vulnerablilities in the web application (something that the previous audit did not focus on), but they also looked at the hardening environment around the web application and application server. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2754">In [[electrical engineering]], electrical terms are associated into pairs called '''duals'''.  A dual of a relationship is formed by interchanging voltage and current in an expression.  The dual expression thus produced is of the same form, and the reason that the dual is always a valid statement can be traced to the [[Duality (electricity and magnetism)|duality of electricity and magnetism]].

Here is a partial list of electrical dualities:

* [[voltage]] &amp;ndash; [[Electric current|current]]
* [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel &amp;ndash; serial]] (circuits)
* [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] &amp;ndash; [[Electrical conductance|conductance]]
* [[voltage divider|voltage division]] &amp;ndash; [[current divider|current division]]
* [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] &amp;ndash; [[admittance]]
* [[capacitance]] &amp;ndash; [[inductance]]
* [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] &amp;ndash; [[susceptance]]
* [[short circuit]] &amp;ndash; [[wikt:open circuit|open circuit]]
* [[Kirchhoff's current law]] &amp;ndash; [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]].
* [[Thévenin's theorem]] &amp;ndash; [[Norton's theorem]]

== History ==
The use of duality in [[circuit theory]] is due to Alexander Russell who published his ideas in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Belevitch, V, "Summary of the history of circuit theory", ''Proceedings of the IRE'', '''vol 50''', Iss 5, pp.848-855, May 1962 {{doi|10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288301}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Russell, ''A Treatise on the Theory of Alternating Currents'', volume 1, chapter XXI, Cambridge: University Press 1904 {{OCLC|264936988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Constitutive relations ===

* Resistor and conductor (Ohm's law)

:: &lt;math&gt;v=iR \iff i=vG \, &lt;/math&gt;

* Capacitor and inductor&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; differential form

:: &lt;math&gt;i_C=C\frac{d}{dt}v_C \iff v_L=L\frac{d}{dt}i_L&lt;/math&gt;

* Capacitor and inductor&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; integral form

:: &lt;math&gt;v_C(t) = V_0 + {1 \over C}\int_{0}^{t} i_C(\tau) \, d\tau \iff  i_L(t) = I_0 + {1 \over L}\int_{0}^{t} v_L(\tau) \, d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

=== Voltage division &amp;mdash; current division ===

:&lt;math&gt;v_{R_1}=v\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} \iff i_{G_1}=i\frac{G_1}{G_1 + G_2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Impedance and admittance ===

* Resistor and conductor

:: &lt;math&gt;Z_R = R \iff Y_G = G &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;Z_G = {1 \over G } \iff Y_R = { 1 \over R } &lt;/math&gt;

* Capacitor and inductor

:: &lt;math&gt; Z_C = {1 \over Cs} \iff  Y_L = {1 \over Ls} &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; Z_L = Ls  \iff  Y_c = Cs&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1075">A '''duodrama''' is a theatrical [[melodrama]] for two [[actor]]s or singers, in which the spoken voice is used with a musical accompaniment for heightened dramatic effect. It was popular at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.

Closely related to [[opera]], the most famous example were the 1775 works ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos (Benda)|Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' and ''[[Medea (Benda)|Medea]]'' by [[Georg Benda]]. [[Mozart]] admired Benda's work and used similar techniques in ''[[Zaide]]'' (1780) and ''[[Thamos, König in Ägypten]]'' (c. 1773-1780). He considered writing a duodrama himself, to be called ''Semiramis''. [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'' (1805-1814) and [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) also contain duodramas. The style is also used in [[lieder]] and song. &lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', 782 pages,  {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1175">'''Dynamic timing verification''' refers to verifying that an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] design is fast enough to run without errors at the targeted clock rate.  This is accomplished by simulating the design files used to synthesize the [[integrated circuit]] (IC) design.  This is in contrast to [[static timing analysis]], which has a similar goal as dynamic timing verification except it does not require simulating the real functionality of the IC.&lt;ref name="ASIC world"&gt;"ASIC world: vol 10", page 13, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbyists often perform a type of dynamic timing verification when they over-clock the CPUs in their computers in order to find the fastest clock rate at which they can run the CPU without errors.  This is a type of dynamic timing verification that is performed after the silicon is manufactured.  In the field of ASIC design, this timing verification is preferably performed before manufacturing the IC in order to make sure that IC works under the required conditions before mass production of the IC.&lt;ref name="ASIC world"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10079">'''Ethics in mathematics''' is a field of [[applied ethics]], the inquiry into ethical aspects of the applications of [[mathematics]]. It deals with the professional responsibilities of [[mathematicians]] whose work influences decisions with major consequences, such as in law, finance, the military, and environmental science.

==Need for ethics in the mathematics profession==
Mathematicians in industrial, scientific, military and intelligence roles crucially influence decisions with large consequences. For example, complex calculations were needed for the success of the [[Manhattan Project]], while the overextended use of the [[Copula (probability theory)|Gaussian copula]] formula to price derivatives before the [[Global Financial Crisis]] of 2008 has been called "the formula that killed Wall Street",&lt;ref&gt;Felix Salmon, [https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wp-quant/ Recipe for disaster: the formula that killed Wall Street"], ''Wired''23 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory of global warming depends on the reliability of [[climate models|mathematical models of climate]]. For the same reason as in [[medical ethics]] and [[engineering ethics]], the high impact of the consequences of decisions imposes serious ethical obligations on practitioners to consider the rights and wrongs of their advice and decisions.

==Disasters and scandals involving the use of mathematics==
These illustrate the major consequences of numerical mistakes and hence the need for ethical care.
* The [[Club of Rome]]'s 1972 mathematical-model based predictions in ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' of widespread collapse of the world system by the end of the century.
* [[Sally Clark|Wrongful conviction of Sally Clark]] (1999), An English solicitor, Sally Clark, was wrongfully convicted of murdering her two children – each of whom had died due to [[sudden infant death syndrome]] – due to a fundamental statistical error in the testimony of an "expert".&lt;br&gt;The error was further compounded by the "[[prosecutor's fallacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1432762/Misleading-statistics-were-presented-as-facts-in-Sally-Clark-trial.html Derbyshire, D., "Misleading statistics were presented as facts in Sally Clark trial", ''The Telegraph'', (12 June 2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical issues in the mathematical profession==
Mathematicians in professional roles in finance and similar work have a particular responsibility to ensure they use the best methods and data to reach the right answer, as the prestige of mathematics is high and others rely on mathematical results which they cannot fully understand. Other ethical issues are shared with [[information economy]] professionals in general, such as [[duty of care]], [[confidentiality]] of information, [[whistleblowing]], and avoiding [[conflict of interest]].

==Misuse of statistics==
{{Main|Misuse of statistics}}
Much of mathematics as used in applications involves the drawing of conclusions from quantitative data. It is recognised that there are many difficulties in reaching and communicating such conclusions accurately, honestly and with due regard to the uncertainties that remain. It is easy for a statistician to mislead clients whose understanding of data and inference is less developed, so statisticians have professional responsibilities to act fairly.

==Ethics in pure mathematical research==
The [[American Mathematical Society]] publishes a code of ethical guidelines for mathematical researchers. The responsibilities of researchers include being knowledgeable in the field, avoiding plagiarism and giving credit, to publish without unreasonable delay, and to correct errors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/policy-statements/sec-ethics American Mathematical Society Policy Statement on Ethical Guidelines], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Mathematical Society]] Ethics Committee also publishes a code of practice relating to the publication, editing and refereeing of research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euro-math-soc.eu/system/files/uploads/COP-approved.pdf Code of Practice – European Mathematical Society].&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that as pure mathematical research is relatively harmless, it raises few urgent ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Reuben Hersh]], [http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1068&amp;context=hmnj Mathematics and ethics], ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'' 12 (3) (1990), 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that raises the question of whether and why pure mathematics is ethically worth doing, given that it consumes the lives of many highly intelligent people who could be making more immediately useful contributions.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]], [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF03024064 Ethics of mathematics], ''Mathematical Intelligencer'' 13 (1) (1991), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching ethics in mathematics==
Courses in the ethics of mathematics remain rare. The [[University of New South Wales]] taught a compulsory course on Professional Issues and Ethics in Mathematics in its mathematics degrees from 1998 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, [http://www.austms.org.au/Publ/Gazette/2005/May05/franklin.pdf A “Professional issues and ethics in mathematics” course], ''Gazette of the Australian Mathematical Society'' 32 (2005), 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Modern HE lenses.png|left|frame|Modern high explosive lenses. The colored areas are the fast explosive, while the white areas are the slow explosives.]]
[[Image:Implosion nuclear weapon design - explosive lenses.svg|right|thumb|250px|In an implosion-type nuclear weapon, polygonal lenses are arranged around the spherical core of the bomb. Thirty-two "points" are shown. Other designs use as many as 96 or as few as two such points.]]

An '''explosive lens'''—as used, for example, in [[nuclear weapon]]s—is a highly specialized  [[shaped charge]]. In general, it is a device composed of several [[explosive charge]]s. These charges are arranged and formed with the intent to control the shape of the detonation wave passing through them. The explosive lens is conceptually similar to an [[optical lens]], which focuses light waves.  The charges that make up the explosive lens are chosen to have different rates of detonation. In order to convert a spherically expanding [[wavefront]] into a spherically converging one using only a single boundary between the constituent explosives, the boundary shape must be a [[paraboloid]]; similarly, to convert a spherically diverging front into a flat one, the boundary shape must be a [[hyperboloid]], and so on. Several boundaries can be used to reduce aberrations (deviations from intended shape) of the final wavefront.

==Invention==
As mentioned by [[Hans Bethe]], the invention of the explosive lens device was contributed and designed by [[John von Neumann]] &lt;ref name="MMA"&gt;{{cite video |title=John Von Neumann Documentary |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |year=1966 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47VBYF9Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in nuclear weapons==
In a nuclear weapon, an array of explosive lenses is used to change the several approximately-spherical diverging detonation waves into a single spherical converging one. The converging wave is then used to collapse the various shells (tamper, reflector, pusher, etc.) and finally compresses the core ([[pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]]) of [[fissile material|fissionable material]] to a [[prompt critical]] state. They are usually machined from a [[plastic bonded explosive]] and an inert insert, called a wave-shaper, which is often a dense [[foam]] or [[plastic]], though many other materials can be used. Other, mainly older explosive lenses do not include a wave shaper, but employ two explosive types that have significantly different [[explosive velocity|velocities of detonation]] (VoD), which are in the range from 5 to 9&amp;nbsp;km/s. The use of the low- and high-speed explosives again results in a spherical converging detonation wave to compress the physics package. The original [[The gadget|Gadget]] device used in the [[Trinity test]] and [[Fat Man]] dropped on [[Nagasaki]] used [[Baratol (explosive)|Baratol]] as the low-VoD explosive and [[Composition B]] as the fast, but other combinations can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coster-Mullen |first=John |date=2012 |title=Atom Bombs: The Top Secret Inside Story of Little Boy and Fat Man |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |asin=B0006S2AJ0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gadget-schematic-crosssection.png|thumb|left|Cross-section of the [[Trinity test|"Trinity" gadget]]. The alternating high and slow explosives (in purple) are the explosive lens which forces the spherical [[pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] to compress into [[prompt critical]]ity.]]

The illustration to the left represents a cross section through a segment of a polygonal wedge. The wedges are fitted together to form a [[sphere|spherical]] device. The [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]] at the far left triggers a semi-spherical [[shock wave|detonation wave]] through the high-speed outer explosive. (It is semi-spherical because the exploding-bridgewire acts as a point-detonator.)  As the wave is transferred to the precisely shaped inner explosive, a new spherical wave—centered on the object—is formed. The successful functioning of this device hinges on the simultaneous initiation of the wave in each segment, uniformity and precision in the speed of the wave, and correctness and accuracy in the shape of the interface between the two explosives.

A series of experiments was performed in 1944 and 1945 during the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop the lenses for a satisfactory implosion. One of the most important tests was the series of [[RaLa Experiment]]s.

Initially, a 32 "point" assembly was used (each of which had a pair of exploding-bridgewire detonators).

Later, a 96 "point" assembly was tried, with the objective of obtaining a smaller assembly with improved performance.

Finally, with the success of the [[Swan (nuclear primary)|Swan]] device, a two "point" assembly became feasible. Swan used an "air lens" system in addition to shaped charges and became the basis of all [[United States|U.S.]] successor designs, nuclear and thermonuclear alike, and featured small size, light weight, and exceptional reliability and safety, as well as using the least amount of [[strategic material]]s of any design.

==Other uses==
Lenses using alternate design techniques and producing flat "plane wave" outputs are used for high transient pressure physics and materials science experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Pimbley |author2=Mader |author3=Bowen |title=Plane Wave Generator Calculations |number=LA-9119 |institution=Los Alamos National Labs |date=October 1982 |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Freedom Trail''' is a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} path through [[Downtown Boston|downtown]] [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], that passes by 16 locations significant to the [[history of the United States]]. Marked largely with brick, it winds between [[Boston Common]] to the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]]. Stops along the trail include simple explanatory ground markers, graveyards, notable churches and buildings, and a historic naval frigate. While most of the sites are free or suggest donations, the [[Old South Meeting House]], the [[Old State House (Boston)|Old State House]], and the [[Paul Revere House]] charge admission. The Freedom Trail is overseen by the City of Boston's Freedom Trail Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/ |title=Freedom Trail |publisher=City of Boston |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported in part by grants from various nonprofits and foundations, private philanthropy, and [[Boston National Historical Park]].

The Freedom Trail was conceived by local journalist William Schofield, who in 1951 suggested building a pedestrian trail to link important local landmarks. Boston mayor [[John Hynes (politician)|John Hynes]] decided to put Schofield's idea into action. By 1953, 40,000 people were walking the trail annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Northeastern University Press |isbn = 1-55553-161-X |publication-place = Boston |title = Building a new Boston: politics and urban renewal, 1950–1970 |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1737146M/Building_a_new_Boston |author = O'Connor, Thomas H. |publication-date = 1993 |id = 155553161X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Park Service operates a visitor's center on the first floor of Faneuil Hall, where they offer tours, provide free maps of the Freedom Trail and other historic sites, and sell books about Boston and United States history.

Some observers have noted the tendency of the Freedom Trail's [[Framing (social sciences)|narrative frame]] to omit certain historical locations, such as the sites of the [[Boston Tea Party]] and the [[Liberty Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Trouble with the Freedom Trail |author=Alfred F. Young |date=21 Mar 2004 |work=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]] or [[planetary science]], the '''frost line''', also known as the '''snow line''' or '''ice line''', is the particular distance in the [[Protoplanetary disk|solar nebula]] from the central [[protostar]] where it is cold enough for [[volatiles|volatile]] compounds such as [[water]], [[ammonia]], [[methane]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]] to condense into solid ice grains. This condensation temperature depends on the volatile substance and the partial pressure of vapor in the protostar nebula.
The actual temperature and distance for the snow line of water ice depend on the physical model used to calculate it and on the theoretical solar nebula model:

The radial position of the condensation/evaporation front varies over time, as the nebula evolves. 
Occasionally, the term ''snow line'' is also used to represent the present distance at which water ice can be stable (even under direct sunlight). This ''current snow line'' distance is different from the ''formation snow line'' distance during the formation of the [[Solar System]], and approximately equals 5 AU.&lt;ref name="Jewitt2007"&gt;{{cite book |year=2007 |title=Protostars and Planets V |publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]] |chapter=Water in the Small Bodies of the Solar System |pages=863–878 |isbn=0-8165-2654-0 |editors=Reipurth, B.; Jewitt, D.; Keil, K. |url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~meech/a740/2006/spring/papers/PPV2006.pdf |format=PDF |author1=Jewitt, D |author2=Chizmadia, L. |author3=Grimm, R. |author4=Prialnik, D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the difference is that during the formation of the Solar System, the solar nebula was an opaque cloud where temperatures were lower close to the Sun,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the Sun itself was less energetic. After formation, the ice got buried by infalling dust and it has remained stable a few meters below the surface. If ice within 5 AU is exposed, e.g. by a crater, then it sublimates on short timescales. However, out of direct sunlight ice can remain stable on the surface of asteroids (and the Moon) if it is located in permanently shadowed craters, where temperature may remain very low over the age of the Solar System (e.g. 30–40 K on the Moon).

Observations of the [[asteroid belt]], located between Mars and Jupiter, suggest that the water snow line during formation of the Solar System was located within this region. The outer asteroids are icy C-class objects (e.g. Abe et al. 2000; Morbidelli et al. 2000) whereas the inner asteroid belt is largely devoid of water. This implies that when planetesimal formation occurred the snow line was located at around 2.7 AU from the Sun.&lt;ref name="arXiv"/&gt;
 
For example, the [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|dwarf planet Ceres]] with semi-major axis of 2.77 AU lies almost exactly on the lower estimation for water snow line during the formation of the Solar System. Ceres appears to have an icy mantle and may even have a water ocean below the surface.&lt;ref name = "McCord2005"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ceres: Evolution and current state |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |date=2005-05-21 |last=McCord |first=T.

Each volatile substance has its own snow line, e.g. carbon monoxide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1307.7439|title=Imaging of the CO Snow Line in a Solar Nebula Analog by Chunhua Qi, Karin I.

A tracer gas may be used for materials that are difficult to detect; for example [[diazenylium]] for carbon monoxide. 

The lower temperature in the nebula beyond the frost line makes many more solid grains available for [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] into [[planetesimals]] and eventually [[planets]]. The frost line therefore separates terrestrial planets from [[giant planet]]s in the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Discovering the Universe |last= Kaufmann |first= William J. |year= 1987 |publisher= [[W.H. Freeman and Company]] |isbn= 0-7167-1784-0 |page= 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, giant planets have been found inside the frost line around several other stars (so-called [[hot Jupiter]]s). They are thought to have formed outside the frost line, and later [[Planetary migration|migrated]] inwards to their current positions.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, John (2007-07-01).

Methane and ammonia are rare in the Earth's atmosphere only because of their instability in an [[oxygen]]-rich atmosphere that [[photosynthesis|results from life forms (largely green plants)]] whose biochemistry suggests plentiful methane and ammonia at one time, but of course [[ocean|liquid water]] and [[ice sheet|ice]], which are chemically stable in such an atmosphere, form much of the surface of Earth.

Researchers Rebecca Martin and [[Mario Livio]] have proposed that asteroid belts may tend to form in the vicinity of the frost line, due to nearby giant planets disrupting planet formation inside their orbit. By analysing the temperature of warm dust found around some 90 stars, they concluded that the dust (and therefore possible asteroid belts) was typically found close to the frost line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/right-sized-belts.html |title=Asteroid Belts of Just the Right Size are Friendly to Life |date= 1 November 2012|publisher= [[Nasa]]|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is borrowed from the notion of "[[frost line]]" in [[soil science]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43755">In [[mathematics]], '''fuzzy sets''' (aka '''uncertain sets''') are somewhat like [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] whose [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] have degrees of membership. Fuzzy sets were introduced independently by [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]]&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Zadeh (1965) [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/papers/Fuzzy%20Sets-Information%20and%20Control-1965.pdf "Fuzzy sets"]. ''Information and Control'' 8 (3) 338–353.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dieter Klaua&lt;ref&gt;Klaua, D. (1965) Über einen Ansatz zur mehrwertigen Mengenlehre. Monatsb. Deutsch. Akad. Wiss. Berlin 7, 859–876. A recent in-depth analysis of this paper has been provided by {{Cite journal | last1 = Gottwald | first1 = S. | title = An early approach toward graded identity and graded membership in set theory | doi = 10.1016/j.fss.2009.12.005 | journal = Fuzzy Sets and Systems | volume = 161 | issue = 18 | pages = 2369–2379 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1965 as an extension of the classical notion of set.
At the same time, {{harvtxt|Salii|1965}} defined a more general kind of structure called an [[L-relation]], which he studied in an abstract algebraic context. Fuzzy relations, which are used now in different areas, such as [[linguistics]] {{harv|De Cock|Bodenhofer|Kerre|2000}}, [[Decision making|decision-making]] {{harv|Kuzmin|1982}}, and [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] {{harv|Bezdek|1978}}, are special cases of ''L''-relations when ''L'' is the [[unit interval]] [0, 1].

In classical [[set theory]], the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a [[Principle of bivalence|bivalent condition]] &amp;mdash; an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a [[Membership function (mathematics)|membership function]] valued in the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets, since the [[indicator function]]s (aka characteristic functions) of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Dubois and H. Prade (1988) Fuzzy Sets and Systems. Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In fuzzy set theory, classical bivalent sets are usually called [[Crisp set|''crisp'' sets]]. The fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise, such as [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Lily R. Liang, Shiyong Lu, Xuena Wang, Yi Lu, Vinay Mandal, Dorrelyn Patacsil, and Deepak Kumar, "FM-test: A Fuzzy-Set-Theory-Based Approach to Differential Gene Expression Data Analysis", BMC Bioinformatics, 7 (Suppl 4): S7. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A fuzzy set is a pair &lt;math&gt;(U, m)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;m\colon U \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; a membership function. 
The reference set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) is called '''universe of discourse''', and for each &lt;math&gt;x\in U,&lt;/math&gt; the value &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''grade''' of membership of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(U,m)&lt;/math&gt;. 
The function &lt;math&gt;m = \mu(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''membership function''' of the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U, m)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a finite set &lt;math&gt;U=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\},&lt;/math&gt; the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;(U, m)&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{m(x_1)/x_1,\dots,m(x_n)/x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;x \in U.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called 
* '''not included''' in the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;(U,m)&lt;/math&gt; if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;m(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}} (no member), 
* '''fully included''' if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;m(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;}} (full member), 
* '''partially included''' if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; m(x) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (fuzzy member).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/FuzzyLogic AAAI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805071058/http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/FuzzyLogic |date=2008-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The (crisp) set of all fuzzy sets on a universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is denoted with &lt;math&gt;SF(U)&lt;/math&gt; (or sometimes just &lt;math&gt;F(U)&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Beg20019" /&gt;

===Crisp sets related to a fuzzy set===
For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U,m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; the following crisp sets are defined:
* &lt;math&gt;A^{\ge\alpha} = A_\alpha = \{x \in U \mid m(x)\ge\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''α-cut''' (aka '''α-level set''') 
* &lt;math&gt;A^{&gt;\alpha} = A'_\alpha = \{x \in U \mid m(x)&gt;\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''strong α-cut''' (aka '''strong α-level set''') 
* &lt;math&gt;S(A) = Supp(A) = A^{&gt;0} = \{x \in U \mid m(x)&gt;0\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''support''' 
* &lt;math&gt;C(A) = Core(A) = A^{=1} = \{x \in U \mid m(x)=1\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''core''' (or sometimes '''kernel''' &lt;math&gt;Kern(A)&lt;/math&gt;).

Note that some authors understand 'kernel' in a different way, see below.

===Other definitions===
* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U,m)&lt;/math&gt; is '''empty''' (&lt;math&gt;A = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;) [[iff]] (if and only if)
::[[Universal quantification#notation|&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;math&gt; x \in U: \mu_A(x) = m(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

* Two fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are '''equal''' (&lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;) iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) = \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;

* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is '''included''' in a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;) iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) \le \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;

* For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, any &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, having
::&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; 
:is called a '''crossover point'''.

* For a given fuzzy set A any &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;A^{=\alpha} = \{x \in U | \mu_A(x) = \alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is not empty, is called a '''level''' of A. 
The '''level set''' of A is the set of all levels α∈[0,1] representing distinct-cuts. It is the target set (aka codomain) of &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_A = \{\alpha \in [0,1] \mid A^{=\alpha} \ne \varnothing\} = \{\alpha \in [0, 1] \mid\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Existential quantification|&lt;math&gt;\exist&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;math&gt;x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) = \alpha\} = \mu_A(U)&lt;/math&gt;

* For a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; its '''height''' is given by
::&lt;math&gt;Hgt(A) = sup \{\mu_A(x) \mid x\in{U}\}  = sup(\mu_A(U))&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;sup&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Infimum and supremum|supremum]], which does exist because 1 is an upper bound. If U is finite, we can simply replace the supremum by the maximum.

* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''normalized''' iff
::&lt;math&gt;Hgt(A) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:In the finite case, where the supremum is a maximum, this means that at least one element of the fuzzy set has full membership. A non-empty fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; may be normalized with result &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; by dividing the membership function of the fuzzy set by its height:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\tilde{A}}(x) = \mu_A(x)/Hgt(A)&lt;/math&gt;
:Besides similarities this differs from the usual [[normalizing constant|normalization]] in that the normalizing constant is not a sum.

* For fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers (U ⊆ ℝ) having a core with [[Infimum and supremum|an upper and a lower bound]] the '''width''' is defined as
::&lt;math&gt;Width(A) = sup(Supp(A)) - inf(Supp(A))&lt;/math&gt;
:This does always exist for bounded a reference set U, especially if U is finite.
:In case that &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite or [[closed set]], the width is just
::&lt;math&gt;Width(A) = max(Supp(A)) - min(Supp(A))&lt;/math&gt;
:In the n-dimensional case (U ⊆ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) the above can be replaced by the n-dimensional volume of &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt;. 
:In general there must exist some [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] for instance by integration (e. g. [[Lebesgue integration]]) of &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

* A real fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (U ⊆ ℝ) is said to be '''convex''' (in fuzzy sense, not to be confused with a crisp [[convex set]]), iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in{U}, \forall\lambda\in[0,1]: \mu_A(\lambda{x} + (1-\lambda)y) \ge min(\mu_A(x),\mu_A(y))&lt;/math&gt;,
:or (if we assume x≤y, which is no restriction), equivalent, iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in [x,y]: \mu_A(z) \ge min(\mu_A(x),\mu_A(y))&lt;/math&gt;.
:In general, we may have to choose subsets Z of U and compare like follows:  
::&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in Z: \mu_A(z) \ge inf(\mu_A(\partial{Z}))&lt;/math&gt;,
:where &lt;math&gt;\partial{Z}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of Z and &lt;math&gt;f(X) = \{f(x)|x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Function (mathematics)#Image and preimage|image]] of a set ''X'' (here &lt;math&gt;\partial{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) under a function ''f'' (here &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt;).

===Fuzzy set operations===
{{main|Fuzzy set operations}}
In contrast to the complement of a fuzzy set, for which there is a very common definition, union and intersection do have some ambiguity.
* For a given fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; its '''complement''' &lt;math&gt;\neg{A}&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted as &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; or '''∁'''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by the following membership function:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\neg{A}}(x) = 1 - \mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

* Let t be a [[t-norm]], and s the corresponding s-norm (aka t-conorm). For given fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; their '''intersection''' &lt;math&gt;A\cap{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\cap{B}}(x) = t(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;,
:and their '''union''' &lt;math&gt;A\cup{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\cup{B}}(x) = s(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

According to the definitions of t-norms, fuzzy sets inherit laws as [[Commutativity]], [[Monotonicity]], [[Associativity]] and for null and identity element (∅ and U, respectively). However, the union of a fuzzy set and its complement may not result in the full universe U, and the intersection of them may not give the empty set ∅. Intersection and union of a finite [[Indexed family|family]] of fuzzy sets can be defined by recursion, keeping associativity law in mind.

* If the standard negator &lt;math&gt;n(\alpha) = 1 - \alpha, \alpha \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by another [[t-norm#Non-standard negators|strong negator]], the fuzzy set difference may be generalized by
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\neg{A}}(x) = n(\mu_A(x))&lt;/math&gt;. 
:The tripel of fuzzy intersection, union and complement build up a '''De Morgan Triplet''. Examples for fuzzy intersection/union pairs with standard negator can be derived from samples provided in the article about [[t-norm]]s.

:The fuzzy intersection is not idempotent in general, because the standard t-norm min is the only one which has this property. Using arithmetic multiplication a t-norm instead, this defines a specific fuzzy intersection operation not being idempotent. By this, iterating multiplication of a fuzzy set with itself is not trivial. It defines the '''m-th power''' of a fuzzy set which can be canonically generalized for non-integer exponents in the following way:

* For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in \R^+&lt;/math&gt; the ν-th power of A is defined by its membership function as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A^{\nu}}(x) = \mu_{A}(x)^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
:Special case: Exponent is 2 (quadrature): For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the '''concentration''' &lt;math&gt;CON(A) = A^2&lt;/math&gt; is defined via its membership function as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{CON(A)}(x) = \mu_{A^2}(x) = \mu_{A}(x)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:With &lt;math&gt;0^0 := 1&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;A^0 = U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A^1 = A&lt;/math&gt;.

* For given fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; the fuzzy set '''Difference''' &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted just &lt;math&gt; A - B&lt;/math&gt;) maybe defined straightforward via membership functions:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\setminus{B}}(x) = t(\mu_A(x),n(\mu_B(x)))&lt;/math&gt;,
:which means &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \cap \neg{B}&lt;/math&gt;, e. g.:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\setminus{B}}(x) = min(\mu_A(x),1 - \mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mamoni Dhar: [http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJEIC/vol4_Is1/2.pdf Cardinality of Fuzzy Sets: An Overview], International Journal of Energy, Information and Communications Vol. 4, Issue 1, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014"&gt;N.R. Vemuri, A.S. Hareesh, M.S. Srinath: [http://www.math.sk/fsta2014/presentations/VemuriHareeshSrinath.pdf Set Difference and Symmetric Difference of Fuzzy Sets], in: Fuzzy Sets Theory and Applications 2014, Liptovský Ján, Slovak Republic&lt;/ref&gt;

:Another proposal for a set difference could be: 
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A-{B}}(x) = \mu_A(x) - t(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

* Proposals for symmetric fuzzy set differences have been done by Dubois and Prade (1980), either using the absulute:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\triangle{B}}(x) = |\mu_A(x) - \mu_B(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
:or, using a combination of just max, min, and standard negation:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\triangle{B}}(x) = max(min(\mu_A(x), 1 - \mu_B(x)), \,min(\mu_B(x), 1 - \mu_A(x)))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

:Axioms for definition of generalized symmetric differences analog to those for t-norms, t-conorms, and negators have been proposed by Vemur et al. (2014) with predecessors by Alsina et. al. (2005) and Bedregal et. al. (2009).&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

* In contrast to crisp sets averaging operations can also be defined for fuzzy sets.

===Disjoint fuzzy sets===
In contrast to the general ambiguity of intersection and union operations, there is clearness for disjoint fuzzy sets:
Two fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; are '''disjoint''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) = 0 \lor \mu_B(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to
:[[Existential quantification#Negation|&lt;math&gt;\nexists&lt;/math&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) &gt; 0 \land \mu_B(x) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
and also equivalent to 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: min(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
We keep in mind that min/max is a t/s-norm pair, and any other will do the job here as well.

Fuzzy sets are disjoint, iff their supports are disjoint according to the standard definition for crisp sets.

For disjoint fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; any intersection will give ∅, and any union will give the same result, which is denoted as
:&lt;math&gt;A \dot{\cup} B = A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; 
with its membership function given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\dot{\cup}{B}}(x) = \mu_A(x) + \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that only one of both summands is greater than zero.

For disjoint fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; the following holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;Supp(A \dot{\cup} B) = Supp(A) \,\dot{\cup}\, Supp(B)&lt;/math&gt;

This can be generalized to finite families of fuzzy sets as follows:
Given a family &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; of fuzzy sets with Index set I (e.g. I = {1,2,3,...n}). This family is '''(pairwise) disjoint''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}\,\exists i\in{I}: \mu_{A_i}(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

A family of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint, iff the family of underlying supports &lt;math&gt;Supp \circ A = (Supp(A_i))_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint in the standard sense for families of crisp sets.

Independend of the t/s-norm pair, intersection of a disjoint family of fuzzy sets will give ∅ again, while the union has no ambiguity:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i = \bigcup_{i\in{I}} A_i&lt;/math&gt; 
with its membership function given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i}(x) = \sum_{i\in{I}} \mu_{A_i}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Again only one of the summands is greater than zero.

For disjoint families of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; the following holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;Supp(\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i) = \dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} Supp(A_i)&lt;/math&gt;

===Scalar Cardinality===
For a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with finite &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt; (i. e. a 'finite fuzzy set'), its '''cardinality''' (aka '''scalar cardinality''' or '''sigma-count''') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Card(A) = sc(A) = |A| = \sum_{x\in{U}} \mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
In case that U itself is a finite set, the '''relative cardinality''' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;RelCard(A) = ||A|| = sc(A)/|U| = |A|/|U|&lt;/math&gt;.
This can be generalized for the divisor to be an non-empty fuzzy set: For fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A,G&lt;/math&gt; with G ≠ ∅, we can define the '''relative cardinality''' by:
:&lt;math&gt;RelCard(A,G) = sc(A|G) = sc(A\cap{G})/sc(G)&lt;/math&gt;,
which looks very similar to the expression for [[conditional probability]]&lt;!--and because of that, sc(A|G) is used instead of sc(A/G)- this in't **set** division, isn't it? --&gt;.
Note:
* &lt;math&gt;sc(G) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; here.
* The result may depend on the specific intersection (t-norm) chosen. 
* For &lt;math&gt;G = U&lt;/math&gt; the result is unambiguous and resembles the prior definition.

===Distance and Similarity===
For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the membership function &lt;math&gt;\mu_A: U \to U&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as a family &lt;math&gt;\mu_A = (\mu_A(x))_{x\in{U}} \in [0,1]^U&lt;/math&gt;. The latter is a [[metric space]] with several metrics &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; known. A metric can be derived from a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (vector norm) &lt;math&gt;\|\,\|&lt;/math&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha,\beta) = \| \alpha - \beta \,\|&lt;/math&gt;.
For instance, if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is finite, i. e. &lt;math&gt;U = \{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, such a metric may be defined by: 
:&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha,\beta) := max \{ |\alpha(x_i) - \beta(x_i)| \bigl\vert i=1..n \}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are sequences of real numbes between 0 and 1. 
For infinite &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum can be replaced by a supremum. 
Because fuzzy sets are unambiguously defined by their membership function, this metric can be used to measure distances between fuzzy sets on the same universe:
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) := d(\mu_A,\mu_B)&lt;/math&gt;,
which becomes in the above sample:
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) = max \{ |\mu_A(x_i) - \mu_B(x_i)| \bigl\vert i=1..n \}&lt;/math&gt;
Again for infinite &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; the maximum must be replaced by a supremum. Other distances (like the canonical 2-norm) may diverge, if infinite fuzzy sets are too different, e .g &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarity measures (here denoted by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) may then be derived from the distance, e. g. after a proposal by Koczy:
:&lt;math&gt;S = 1 / (1 + d(A,B))&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else, 
or after Williams an Steele:
:&lt;math&gt;S = exp(-\alpha{d(A,B)})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is a steepness parameter and &lt;math&gt;exp(x) = e^x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Beg20019"&gt;Ismat Beg, Samina Ashraf: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228744370_Similarity_measures_for_fuzzy_sets Similarity measures for fuzzy sets], at: Applied and Computational Mathematics, March 2009, available on Research Gate since November 23rd, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition for interval valued (rather 'fuzzy') similarity measures &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is provided by Beg and Ashraf as well.&lt;ref name="Beg20019" /&gt;

===L-fuzzy sets===
Sometimes, more general variants of the notion of fuzzy set are used, with membership functions taking values in a (fixed or variable) [[algebraic structure|algebra]] or [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of a given kind; usually it is required that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be at least a [[poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. These are usually called '''''L''-fuzzy sets''', to distinguish them from those valued over the unit interval. The usual membership functions with values in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] are then called [0,&amp;nbsp;1]-valued membership functions. These kinds of generalizations were first considered in 1967 by [[Joseph Goguen]], who was a student of Zadeh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Goguen|Goguen, Joseph A.]], 196, "''L''-fuzzy sets". ''Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications'' '''18''': 145–174&lt;/ref&gt; A classical corollary may be indicating truth and membership values by {f,t} instead of {0,1}.

An extension of fuzzy sets has been provided by Atanassov and Baruah. An '''intuitionistic fuzzy set''' (IFS) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is characterized by two functions:
:1. &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; - degree of membership of x
:2. &lt;math&gt;\nu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; - degree of non-membership of x
with functions &lt;math&gt;\mu_A, \nu_A: U \mapsto [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) + \nu_A(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

This resembles a situation like some person denoted by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; voting 
* for a proposal A (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=1, \nu_A(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;), 
* against it (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=0, \nu_A(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;), 
* or abstain from voting (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=\nu_A(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;).
After all, we have a percentage of approvals, a percentage of denials, and a percentage of abstentions.

For this situation, special 'intuitive fuzzy' negators, t- and s-norms can be provided. 
With &lt;math&gt;D^* = \{(\alpha,\beta) \in [0, 1]^2 \mid \alpha + \beta = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and by combining both functions to &lt;math&gt;(\mu_A,\nu_A): U \to D^*&lt;/math&gt; this situation resembles a special kind of L-fuzzy sets.

Once more, this has been expanded by defining '''picture fuzzy sets''' (PFS) as follows: A PFS A is characterized by three functions mapping U to [0, 1]: &lt;math&gt;\mu_A, \eta_A, \nu_A&lt;/math&gt;, 'degree of positive membership', 'degree of neutral membership', and 'degree of negative membership' respectively and additional condition &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) + \eta_A(x) + \nu_A(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;
This expands the voting sample above by an additional possibility 'refusal of voting'.

With &lt;math&gt;D^* = \{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \in [0, 1]^3 \mid \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and special 'picture fuzzy' negators, t- and s-norms this resembles just another type of L-fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Bui Cong Cuong, Vladik Kreinovich, Roan Thi Ngan: [http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2050&amp;context=cs_techrep A classification of representable t-norm operators for picture fuzzy sets], in: Departmental Technical Reports (CS).

== Fuzzy logic ==
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}

As an extension of the case of [[multi-valued logic]], valuations (&lt;math&gt;\mu : \mathit{V}_o \to \mathit{W}&lt;/math&gt;) of [[propositional variable]]s (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{V}_o&lt;/math&gt;) into a set of membership degrees (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{W}&lt;/math&gt;) can be thought of as [[membership function (mathematics)|membership functions]] mapping [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] into fuzzy sets (or more formally, into an ordered set of fuzzy pairs, called a fuzzy relation).  With these valuations, many-valued logic can be extended to allow for fuzzy [[premise]]s from which graded conclusions may be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Gottwald]], 2001. ''A Treatise on Many-Valued Logics''. Baldock, Hertfordshire, England: Research Studies Press Ltd., {{ISBN|978-0-86380-262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension is sometimes called "fuzzy logic in the narrow sense" as opposed to "fuzzy logic in the wider sense," which originated in the [[engineering]] fields of [[automation|automated]] control and [[knowledge engineering]], and which encompasses many topics involving fuzzy sets and "approximated reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;"The concept of a linguistic variable and its application to approximate reasoning," ''Information Sciences'' '''8''': 199–249, 301–357; '''9''': 43–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial applications of fuzzy sets in the context of "fuzzy logic in the wider sense" can be found at [[fuzzy logic]].

== Fuzzy number and interval ==
{{main|Fuzzy number}}
A '''fuzzy number''' is a convex, normalized fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{A}}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers (U ⊆ ℝ) whose membership function is at least segmentally [[continuous function|continuous]]{{Clarify|date=September 2017}} and has the functional value &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; at at least one element.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the assumed convexity the maximum (of 1) is 
* either an interval: '''fuzzy interval''', its core is a crisp interval (mean interval) with lower bound

::&lt;math&gt;\min \,C(A) = \min(\{x \in \R \mid \mu_A(x)=1\})&lt;/math&gt; 
:and upper bound 
::&lt;math&gt;\max \,C(A) = \max(\{x \in \R \mid \mu_A(x)=1\})&lt;/math&gt;.
* or unique: '''fuzzy number''', its core is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]; the location of the maximum is 
::℩ C(A) = ℩&lt;math&gt;x \in \R : \mu_A(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; (where ℩ reads as '[[Definite description#Mathematical logic|this]]');
:which will assign a 'sharp' number to the fuzzy number, in addition to fuzzyness parameters like &lt;math&gt;Width(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Fuzzy numbers can be likened to the [[funfair]] game "guess your weight," where someone guesses the contestant's weight, with closer guesses being more correct, and where the guesser "wins" if he or she guesses near enough to the contestant's weight, with the actual weight being completely correct (mapping to 1 by the membership function).

A '''fuzzy interval''' is a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{A}}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with a core interval, i. e. a mean interval whose elements possess the membership function value &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
The latter means that fuzzy intervals are normalized fuzzy sets. As in fuzzy numbers, the membership function must be convex, normalized, at least segmentally [[continuous function|continuous]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fuzzy sets as a basis for a theory of possibility," ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'' '''1''': 3&amp;ndash;28&lt;/ref&gt; Like crisp intervals, fuzzy intervals may reach infinity. The kernel &lt;math&gt;K(A) = Kern(A)&lt;/math&gt; of a fuzzy interval &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the 'inner' part, without the 'outbound' parts where the membership value is constant ad infinitum. In other words, the smallest subset of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is constant outside of it, is defined as the kernel.

However, there are other concepts of fuzzy numbers and intervals as some authors do not insist on convexity.

==Fuzzy categories==
The use of [[Set theory|set membership]] as a key components of [[category theory]] can be generalized to fuzzy sets. This approach which initiated in 1968 shortly after the introduction of fuzzy set theory&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Goguen "Categories of fuzzy sets : applications of non-Cantorian set theory" PhD Thesis University of California, Berkeley, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; led to the development of "Goguen categories" in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Winter "Goguen Categories:A Categorical Approach to L-fuzzy Relations"  2007 [[Springer Verlag|Springer]] {{ISBN|9781402061639}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=goguencateg&gt;Michael Winter "Representation theory of Goguen categories" [[Fuzzy Sets and Systems]] Volume 138, Issue 1, 16 August 2003, Pages 85–126&lt;/ref&gt; In these categories, rather than using two valued set membership, more general intervals are used, and may be lattices as in  L-fuzzy sets.&lt;ref name=goguencateg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goguen, J.A., "L-fuzzy sets". Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 18(1):145–174, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuzzy relation equation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The [[fuzzy relation equation]] is an equation of the form {{nowrap|1=''A'' · ''R'' = ''B''}}, where ''A'' and ''B'' are fuzzy sets, ''R'' is a fuzzy relation, and {{nowrap|''A'' · ''R''}} stands for the [[Function composition|composition]] of ''A'' with&amp;nbsp;''R'' {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

==Entropy==
A measure d of fuzzyness for fuzzy sets of universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; should fulfill the following conditions for all &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;:
#&lt;math&gt;d(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a crisp set: &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \in \{0,\,1\}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(A)&lt;/math&gt; has a unique maximum iff &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(A) \ge d(B)&lt;/math&gt; iff 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(x) \le \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \le 0.5&lt;/math&gt; and 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(x) \ge \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \ge 0.5&lt;/math&gt;, 
::which means that B is 'crisper' than A.
#&lt;math&gt;d(\neg{A}) = d(A)&lt;/math&gt;   
In this case &lt;math&gt;d(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''entropy''' of the fuzzy set A.

For '''finite''' &lt;math&gt;U = \{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; the entropy of a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = H(A) + H(\neg{A})&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;H(A) = -k \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_A(x_i) \ln \mu_A(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;
or just
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = -k \sum_{i=1}^n S(\mu_A(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S(x) = H_e(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Binary entropy function|Shannon's function]] (natural entropy function)
:&lt;math&gt;S(\alpha) = -\alpha \ln \alpha - (1-\alpha) \ln (1-\alpha), \alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant depending on the measure unit and the logarithm base ([[e (mathematical constant)|here: e]]) used.
Physical interpretation of k is the [[Boltzmann constant]] k&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a fuzzy set with a '''continuous''' membership function (fuzzy variable). Then 
:&lt;math&gt;H(A) = -k \int_{- \infty}^\infty \operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace \ln \operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace \,dt&lt;/math&gt;
and its entropy is 
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = -k \int_{- \infty}^\infty S(\operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace )\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

==Extensions==
There are many mathematical constructions similar to or more general than fuzzy sets. Since fuzzy sets were introduced in 1965, a lot of new mathematical constructions and theories treating imprecision, inexactness, ambiguity, and uncertainty have been developed. Some of these constructions and theories are extensions of fuzzy set theory, while others try to mathematically model imprecision and uncertainty in a different way ({{harvnb|Burgin|Chunihin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Kerre|2001}}; Deschrijver and Kerre, 2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13731">'''Genre criticism''', a method within [[rhetorical criticism]], analyzes texts in terms of their genre: the set of generic expectations, conventions, and constraints that guide their production and interpretation. In [[rhetoric]], the theory of [[genre]] provides a means to classify and compare artifacts in terms of their formal, substantive and contextual features. By grouping artifacts with others which have similar formal features or rhetorical exigencies, rhetorical critics can shed light on how authors use or flout conventions for their own purposes. Genre criticism has thus become one of the main methodologies within rhetorical criticism. 

Literary critics have used the concepts of genres to classify speeches and works of literature since the time of [[Aristotle]], who distinguished three rhetorical genres: the [[Forensic rhetoric | legal or judicial]], the [[Deliberative rhetoric | deliberative]] or political, and the ceremonial or [[epideictic]].  Since then, rhetorical approaches to genre and understanding of the term "genre" have evolved in several ways. New genres have been studied for their rhetorical effectiveness - like sermons, letters, and (more recently) non-verbal genres like political cartoons, film, and public monuments.  Further contemporary genre criticism has revised understanding of genre in several ways. The first [[turn (disambiguation) | turn]], represented by [[Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin]] (1895-1975), among others, focused on the formal features of communication. The second turn, represented by Carolyn Miller, among others, focused on recurring socio-cultural circumstances. In the latest turn, critics have begun applying formalist and socio-cultural concepts to [[new media | new-media]] artifacts that tend to resist classification into traditional genre-categories.

== Emphasis on formal features in speech genres==
The first group of rhetorical critics, following the example of theorists like [[M. M. Bakhtin]], used formal features to analyze texts. For these critics, language is formed through a series of utterances that reflect specific conditions and goals of certain linguistic aspects. These aspects include thematic content, style, and compositional structure which form speech genres. Speech genres are diverse because of the various possibilities of human activity. In "The Problem of Speech Genres" (1986), Mikhail Bakhtin draws attention to the very significant difference between primary (simple) and secondary (complex) speech genres.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, M. M. (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LO_agE_GTcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Problem of Speech Genres"]. ''Speech genres and other late essays''. Trans. V. W. McGee. University of Texas Press. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bahktin, primary speech genres form secondary speech genres and examples of secondary speech genres include novels, dramas, all kinds of scientific research, and major genres of commentary. Since these secondary genres involve complex and comparatively highly developed and organized cultural communication that is artistic and scientific, they absorb and digest various primary genres that have taken form in mediated speech communion. Bakhtin continues to explain that there are three factors of the whole utterance which include semantic exhaustiveness of the theme, the speaker’s plan or speech will, and the typical compositional and generic forms of finalization.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, ''Speech genres and other late essays'', p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; The first factor refers to the way utterances are used within speech which is linked to the second factor of how the speaker determines to use the utterance.The third factor explains that all our utterances have definite and stable typical forms of construction, but that these forms can change when needed. As Bahktin writes, "These genres are so diverse because they differ depending on the situation, social position, and personal interrelations of the participants in the communication".&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, ''Speech genres and other late essays'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical approaches to genre==
The word “[[genre]]” is derived from the [[Latin]] term ''genus'', to mean “kind”, “class” or "sort".

[[Aristotle]] was one of the first scholars to develop a rhetorical approach to genre. He divided the art of rhetoric into three genres: [[deliberative]], [[forensic]], and [[epideictic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, F.I (1995). "The Rhetoric of Aristotle". ''A Synoptic History of Classical Rhetoric'' (2nd rev. ed.), Davis, CA. Hermagoras Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberative genre of rhetoric involves speeches or writing meant to persuade an audience to take action. Deliberative rhetoric thus includes rhetoric that is used for political persuasion, discusses matters of public policy in order to determine what is advantageous or disadvantageous, and is usually concerned with the future. Rhetoric of the [[forensic]] genre questions guilt or innocence, is concerned with legalities, and concentrates on events that occurred in the past. The [[epideictic]] genre of rhetoric encompasses all rhetoric used for ceremonial and commemorative purposes. Epideictic rhetoric praises and blames, acknowledging that which is noble or shameful, honorable or dishonorable. 

The [[rhetorical situation]] is a concept important for understanding rhetorical approaches to genre and the creation of new genres.&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L.F. (1968). "The rhetorical situation". ''Philosophy and Rhetoric'', vol. 1, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign speeches are an example of how rhetorical situations recur, producing sedimented genres. As a result of the institutions that execute the [[U.S. Constitution]], every four years at the time of presidential elections, candidates deliver campaign speeches. Campaign speeches have become a distinct genre because they respond to highly similar situations that recur because of a structural or institutional basis.

U.S. rhetoricians [[Karlyn Kohrs Campbell]] and [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]] refer to genre as a “constellation of elements."&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"&gt;Karlyn Kohrs Campbell and Kathleen Hall Jamieson (1978), ''Form and Genre: Shaping Rhetorical Action''. The Speech Communication Association. Falls Church, VA. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; They say, “A genre is a group of acts unified by a constellation of forms that recurs in each of its members.” Genres are formed when examined constituents are similar. The metaphors of genres as “constellations” serves to explain how genres, like constellations of stars, are constructed of individual members, but are under the influence of each other and outside elements. As a result they move together and remain in a similar relation to each other despite their ever-changing positions.&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"/&gt; According to Campbell and Jamieson, “when a generic claim is made, the critical situation alters significantly because the critic is now arguing that a group of discourses has a synthetic core in which certain significant rhetorical elements, e.g., a system of belief, lines of argument, stylistic choices, and the perception of the situation, are fused into an indivisible whole".&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"/&gt;

Many contemporary scholars refer to the fusion of traits from different genres in speeches and texts as a "generic [[Hybrid genre|hybrid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, K.M.; Campbell, K.K. (1982). "Rhetorical hybrids: "'Fusion of generic elements'". ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (68), pp. 146-157.&lt;/ref&gt; These generic hybrids can be formed from a blend of the three rhetorical genres.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', (Trans. W.R. Roberts, 1954), New York: Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept can be explained through an example of a generic hybrid of deliberative and epideictic elements, in which a newly elected President delivers an inaugural address. The President is speaking at a formal ceremony recognizing the current state of the nation (characteristic of the epideictic genre), while simultaneously announcing his policy plans for the upcoming four years. 

U.S. rhetorician Carolyn R. Miller is the author of the article "Genre as Social Action" (1984). She argues, “Rhetorical criticism has not provided firm guidance on what constitutes a genre” and a “rhetorically sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish.” &lt;ref name="Miller 1984"&gt; Miller, C. R. (1984). "Genre as social action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (70), pp. 151-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also argues that new media genres may develop and formalize more quickly than traditional, written genres. She is among other rhetoricians who have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of traditional genre theory for new media communication. They argue that because genre theory originally was developed for describing written texts, the theory should be modified to account for nonlinguistic communication. Miller and colleague Dawn Shepherd illustrate an example of applying socio-cultural theories to genre studies in "Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog". They explain how the weblog may be establishing a new genre because of its integration of current social and cultural trends.&lt;ref name ="blogging"&gt;Miller, C. R.; Shepherd, D.(2004). [http://blog.lib.umn.edu/blogosphere/blogging_as_social_action.html "Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog"], Into the Blogosphere. Retrieved 10 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-cultural approach to genre studies==
In the 1980s, scholarship in genre theory and criticism has turned towards a socio-cultural approach to the study of genre by actively interrogating the rhetorical situation of a given communication artifact in light of its particular generic form. In this mode of inquiry, the rhetorical artifact is examined as a social response to a set of recurrent rhetorical exigencies rather than a collection of formal, generic elements. In the rhetorical tradition of genre criticism, Carolyn R. Miller's work on the socio-cultural approach to genre theory has been influential. Again in her 1984 journal article, Miller argues that “rhetorical criticism has not provided firm guidance on what constitutes a genre” and that a “rhetorically sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish”.&lt;ref name="Miller 1984"/&gt; Later, when Miller and Shepherd engaged the socio-cultural approach to genre criticism in “Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog” (2004), they exposed some of the difficulties of applying genre theory to new media. In their analysis, Miller and Shepherd examine the extent to which the weblog might constitute a genre in light of its interaction with current social and cultural trends.

==Genres studies in new media==
Recently scholars and researchers in [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], and [[information sciences]] have begun to explore the relationships between new media and socio-contextual genre theories (like those of Carolyn Miller, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Charles Bazerman). These researchers have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of traditional genre theory for new media communication. Some scholars have argued that since genre theory was originally developed to describe written texts, the theory needs to be modified to account for nonlinguistic communication. Linguist and semiotician Gunter Kress suggested that much of the vocabulary of generic analysis is ill-equipped to address non-written communication, arguing that “there are no genre terms for describing what [a] drawing is or does…” &lt;ref&gt;Kress, G. &amp; Van Leeuwen, T (1996). ''Multimodal Discourse''. London: Routledge. p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, rhetoricians Miller and Shepherd have argued that traditional written genre theory does not appropriately address the visual features of a genre’s format.&lt;ref name="blogging"/&gt;

Rhetoricians and [[Information science|information scientists]] have also pointed out that new media genres may develop and formalize more quickly than traditional written genres. The authors of the article "Genres and the web" argue that the personal home page is functioning as a new and discrete genre, and they explore the entirely digital nature of home pages, suggesting that home pages “have no obvious paper equivalent”.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Andrew; Gushrowski, Barbara A. (2000). "Genres and the web: Is the personal home page the first uniquely digital genre?" ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science]]'', 51(2), pp. 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally recent work in new media genre theory has explored how new communication technologies allows for forms of “genre [[hybridity]].” Spinuzzi, for example, explores what can happen when multiple related genres are [[Remediation (Marxist theory)|remediated]] into a single new media artifact.&lt;ref name="Clay Spinuzzi 2003"&gt;Spinuzzi, C. (2003). ''Tracing genres through organizations: A sociocultural approach to information design''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3182">'''Haber's rule''' or '''Haber's law''' is a [[mathematical]] statement of the relationship between the [[concentration]] of a [[poisonous]] [[gas]] and how long the gas must be breathed to produce death, or other [[toxic]] effect. The rule was formulated by [[Germany|German]] [[chemist]] [[Fritz Haber]] in the early 1900s.

Haber's rule states that, for a given poisonous gas, &lt;math&gt;C\times t = k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of the gas (mass per unit volume), &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of time necessary to breathe the gas, in order to produce a given toxic effect, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, depending on both the gas and the effect. Thus, the rule states that doubling the concentration will halve the time, for example.

It makes [[Equivalent (chemistry)|equivalent]] any two groupings of [[dose concentration]] and [[exposure time]] that have equivalent [[mathematical product]]s.  For instance, if we assign [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] [[concentration]] the [[symbol]] C, and [[time]] the classic t, then for any two dose [[Conceptual model|schema]], if C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then under Haber's rule the two dose schema are equivalent.

Haber's rule is an approximation, useful with certain inhaled poisons under certain conditions, and Haber himself acknowledged that it was not always applicable. If a substance is efficiently eliminated in the host, for example, then Haber's Law breaks down in the limit of t approaching the [[Order of reaction|order]] of the [[half-life]] of the [[drug]], rewriting the equation as the integral ∫Cdt = constant for arbitrary varying C and elapsed time T.  It is very convenient, however, because its relationship between &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; appears as a straight line in a [[log-log plot]].

In 1940, [[statistician]] C. I. Bliss published a study of [[toxicity]] in [[insecticide]]s in which he proposed more complex [[mathematical model|models]], for example, expressing the relationship between &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as two straight line segments in a [[log-log plot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. I. Bliss | title= The relationship between exposure, time, concentration and toxicity in experiments on insecticides | journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America | year=1940 | volume=33 | pages=721–766}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of its simplicity, Haber's rule continued to be widely used. Recently, some researchers have argued that it is time to move beyond the simple relationship expressed by Haber's rule and to make regular use of more sophisticated models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F.

== History ==
Hazelwood House first appears on maps in 1890. 

The house was designed by James Milne Monro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200122|title=Dictionary of Scottish Architects - DSA Architect Biography Report (September 10, 2018, 1:31 pm)|last=Goold|first=David|website=www.scottisharchitects.org.uk|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later improved by Robert Cumming in 1913. 

It is known as the main building in the four street area known as "Glasgow's Electric Suburb"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/15363632.Residents_living_in_Glasgow_s__lost_village__express_fury_at_council_who__haven_t_kept_their_promises_/|title=Residents living in Glasgow's 'lost village' express fury at council who 'haven't kept their promises'|website=Evening Times|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the houses were the first in Glasgow to be built with internal electrical wiring – including electric lights and electric cookers.

In the late 20th century it was used as a nursing home, before it was purchased in 2003 for religious activities and retreats.

Hazelwood House is within the Hazelwood Conservation Area, created on 8 March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=8692|title=Hazelwood Conservation Area Appraisal Executive Summary|language=en|website=www.glasgow.gov.uk|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house serves as a religious retreat and conference centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hazelwoodhouse.org.uk/|title=Hazelwood House {{!}} Conference Centre in Glasgow|website=Hazelwood House {{!}} Conference Centre in Glasgow|language=es|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosts annual public events such as Christmas carol concerts and family days.

== Architecture and features ==
Its notable architectural features include symmetrical front bay windows, a Tudor arch over the front door and a slate roof.

A lodge is adjacent. 

Substantial private gardens host a brick-walled, earthenware coping and mature trees.

== Access ==
The public can access the house on walking tours that take place during Doors Open Days each September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.festivalofarchitecture.scot/|title=Festival of Architecture 2018|website=www.festivalofarchitecture.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18562">A '''high-voltage cable''' ('''HV cable''') is a cable used for [[electric power transmission]] at [[high voltage]]. A cable includes a conductor and insulation, and is suitable for being run underground or underwater. This is in contrast to an [[Overhead power line|overhead line]], which does not have insulation. High-voltage cables of differing types have a variety of applications in instruments, ignition systems, and AC and [[Direct current|DC]] power transmission. In all applications, the insulation of the cable must not deteriorate due to the high-voltage stress, ozone produced by electric discharges in air, or tracking. The cable system must prevent contact of the high-voltage conductor with other objects or persons, and must contain and control leakage current. Cable joints and terminals must be designed to control the high-voltage stress to prevent breakdown of the insulation. Often a high-voltage cable will have a metallic shield layer over the insulation, connected to the ground and designed to equalize the dielectric stress on the insulation layer. 
[[File:Hochspannungskabel 110kV 400kV.JPG|thumb|right|Segments of high-voltage cables]]

High-voltage cables may be any length, with relatively short cables used in apparatus, longer cables run within buildings or as buried cables in an industrial plant or for power distribution, and the longest cables often run as [[Submarine power cable|submarine cables]] under the ocean for power transmission.

==Construction==
[[File:Hochspannungskabel 400kV Querschnitt.JPG|thumb|right|A cross-section through a 400&amp;nbsp;kV cable, showing the stranded segmented copper conductor in the center, semiconducting and insulating layers, copper shield conductors, aluminum sheath and plastic outer jacket]]
 
Like other [[power cable]]s, high-voltage cables have the structural elements of one or more conductors, insulation, and a protective jacket. High-voltage cables differ from lower-voltage cables in that they have additional internal layers in the insulation jacket to control the electric field around the conductor.

For circuits operating at or above 2,000 volts between conductors, a conductive shield may surround each insulated conductor. This equalizes electrical stress on the cable insulation. This technique was patented by Martin Hochstadter in 1916;&lt;ref name="underground systems reference book" /&gt; the shield is sometimes called a Hochstadter shield. The individual conductor shields of a cable are connected to the ground at the ends of the shield, and at splices. Stress relief cones are applied at the shield ends.

Cables for power distribution of 10&amp;nbsp;kV or higher may be insulated with oil and paper, and are run in a rigid steel pipe, semi-rigid aluminum or lead sheath.  For higher voltages the oil may be kept under pressure to prevent formation of voids that would allow [[partial discharge]]s within the cable insulation.

[[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]] was the first to demonstrate in 1887 that carefully dried and prepared paper could form satisfactory cable insulation at 11,000 volts. Previously paper-insulated cable had only been applied for low-voltage telegraph and telephone circuits. An extruded lead sheath over the paper cable was required to ensure that the paper remained absolutely dry.

[[Vulcanized rubber]] was patented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in 1844, but it was not applied to cable insulation until the 1880s, when it was used for lighting circuits.&lt;ref name="underground systems reference book"/&gt; Rubber-insulated cable was used for 11,000 volt circuits in 1897 installed for the [[Niagara Falls|Niagara Falls Power Generation]] project.

Mass-impregnated paper-insulated medium voltage cables were commercially practical by 1895. During [[World War II]] several varieties of [[synthetic rubber]] and [[polyethylene]] insulation were applied to cables.&lt;ref name=black /&gt; Modern high-voltage cables use polymers or polyethylene, including (XLPE) for insulation.

==AC power cable==

[[High voltage]] is defined as any voltage over 1000 volts. Cables for 3000 and 6000 volts exist, but the majority of cables are used from 10&amp;nbsp;kV and upward.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_1|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1]], pp.  133-137&lt;/ref&gt; Those of 10 to 33&amp;nbsp;kV are usually called ''medium voltage'' cables, those over 50&amp;nbsp;kV ''high voltage'' cables.
[[File:HV Cable.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1, cross section of a high-voltage cable, (1) conductor (3) insulation (2) and (4) semiconducting layers (5) outer conductor and outer coat.]]

Modern HV cables have a simple design consisting of few parts. A conductor of [[Copper wire and cable|copper]] or [[aluminum]] wires transports the current, see (1) in figure 1. (''For a detailed discussion on [[Copper wire and cable|copper cables]], see main article: [[Copper wire and cable]].'')

Conductor sections up to 2000&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; may transport currents up to 2000 amperes. The individual strands are often preshaped to provide a smoother overall circumference.  The [[dielectric|insulation]] (3) may consist of [[cross-linked polyethylene]], also called XLPE. It is reasonably flexible and tolerates operating temperatures up to 120&amp;nbsp;°C.

At the inner (2) and outer (4) sides of this insulation, semi-conducting layers are fused to the insulation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kuffel|Kuffel 2000]] and [[#Kreuger_2|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 2]], p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The function of these layers is to prevent air-filled cavities between the metal conductors and the dielectric so that little [[electric discharge]]s cannot arise and endanger the insulation material.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kuffel|Kuffel 2000]], sec. ''Discharges''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt; The outer conductor or sheath (5) serves as an earthed layer and will conduct leakage currents if needed.

Most high-voltage cables for power transmission that are currently sold on the market are insulated by a sheath of XLPE. Some cables may have a lead or aluminium jacket in conjunction with XLPE insulation to allow for fiber optics.  Before 1960, underground power cables were insulated with oil and paper and ran in a rigid steel pipe, or a semi-rigid aluminium or lead jacket or sheath. The oil was kept under pressure to prevent formation of voids that would allow [[partial discharge]]s within the cable insulation. There are still many of these oil-and-paper insulated cables in use worldwide. Between 1960 and 1990, polymers became more widely used at distribution voltages, mostly [[EPDM]] (ethylene propylene diene M-class); however, their relative unreliability, particularly early XLPE, resulted in a slow uptake at transmission voltages.  While cables of 330&amp;nbsp;kV are commonly constructed using XLPE, this has occurred only in recent decades.

===Quality===

During the development of HV insulation, which has taken about half a century, two characteristics proved to be paramount.
First, the introduction of the semiconducting layers. These layers must be absolutely smooth, without even protrusions as small as a few [[µm]]. Further the fusion between the insulation and these layers must be absolute;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_2|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 2]], picture 8.1e&lt;/ref&gt; any fission, air-pocket or other defect—again, even of a few µm—is detrimental to the cable.

Secondly, the insulation must be free of inclusions, cavities or other defects of the same sort of size. Any defect of these types shortens the voltage life of the cable which is supposed to be in the order of 30 years or more.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_2|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 2]], pp.  87-91&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperation between cable-makers and manufacturers of materials has resulted in grades of XLPE with tight specifications. Most producers of XLPE-compound specify an "extra clean" grade where the number and size of foreign particles are guaranteed.  Packing the raw material and unloading it within a [[cleanroom]] environment in the cable-making machines is required. The development of [[extruder]]s for [[plastics extrusion]] and [[cross-link]]ing has resulted in cable-making installations for making defect-free and pure insulations. The final quality control test is an  elevated voltage 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz partial discharge test with very high sensitivity (in the range of 5 to 10 picoCoulombs) This test is performed on every reel of cable before it is shipped.
[[File:Extruder section.jpg|thumb|right|An extruder machine for making insulated cable]]

==HVDC cable==
A high-voltage cable for [[HVDC]] transmission has the same construction as the AC cable shown in figure 1. The physics and the test-requirements are different.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_2|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 2]], pp. 15-19&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the smoothness of the semiconducting layers (2) and (4) is of utmost importance. Cleanliness of the insulation remains imperative.

Many HVDC cables are used for DC [[submarine power cable|submarine connection]]s, because at distances over 30&amp;nbsp;km AC can no longer be used. The longest submarine cable today is the [[NorNed]] cable between Norway and the Netherlands, which is almost 600&amp;nbsp;km long and transports 700 megawatts, a capacity equal to a large power station.
&lt;br&gt;Most of these long deep-sea cables are made in an older construction, using oil-impregnated paper as an insulator.

==Cable terminals==

[[File:Field concentration.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Figure 2, the earth shield of a cable (0%) is cut off, the equipotential lines (from 20% to 80%) concentrate at the edge of the earth electrode, causing danger of breakdown.]]
Terminals of high-voltage cables must manage the [[electric field]]s at the ends.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_1|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1]], pp.  53,147,153&lt;/ref&gt; Without such a construction the electric field will concentrate at the end of the earth-conductor as shown in figure 2.
&lt;br&gt;[[Contour line|Equipotential lines]] are shown here which can be compared with the [[contour line]]s on a map of a mountainous region: the nearer these lines are to each other, the steeper the slope and the greater the danger, in this case the danger of an [[electric breakdown]]. The equipotential lines can also be compared with the [[isobar (meteorology)|isobars]] on a weather map: the denser the lines, the more wind and the greater the danger of damage.

[[File:HV Terminal.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 3, a rubber or elastomer body '''R''' is pushed over the insulation (blue) of the cable. The equipotential lines between '''HV''' (high voltage) and '''earth''' are evenly spread out by the shape of the earth electrode. Field concentrations are prevented in this way.]] 
In order to control the equipotential lines (that is to control the electric field) a device is used that is called a '''stress-cone''', see figure 3.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_1|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1]], pp.  147-153&lt;/ref&gt; The crux of stress relief is to flare the shield end along a logarithmic curve.  Before 1960, the stress cones were handmade using tape—after the cable was installed.  These were protected by [[pothead]]s, so named because a potting compound/dielectric was poured around the tape inside a metal/ porcelain body insulators.  About 1960, preformed terminations were developed consisting of a [[rubber]] or [[elastomer]] body that is stretched over the cable end.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_1|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1]], fig. 10.7&lt;/ref&gt; On this rubber-like body '''R''' a shield electrode is applied that spreads the equipotential lines to guarantee a low electric field.

The crux of this device, invented by NKF in [[Delft]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Patent 123795, Netherlands Cable Works '''NKF''', submitted 21-4-1964, granted 27-3-1968&lt;/ref&gt; is that the [[boring (manufacturing)|bore]] of the elastic body is narrower than the diameter of the cable. In this way the (blue) interface between cable and stress-cone is brought under mechanical pressure, so that no cavities or air-pockets can be formed between cable and cone. Electric breakdown in this region is prevented in this way.

This construction can further be surrounded by a [[porcelain]] or silicone insulator for outdoor use,&lt;ref&gt;see a similar case in [[#Kreuger_1|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; or by contraptions to enter the cable into a [[power transformer]] under oil, or [[switchgear]] under gas-pressure.&lt;ref&gt;see a similar case in [[#Kreuger_1|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1]], p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cable joints==

Connecting two high-voltage cables with one another poses two main problems. First, the outer conducting layers in both cables shall be terminated without causing a field concentration,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_1|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1]], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; as with the making of a cable terminal. Secondly, a field free space shall be created where the cut-down cable insulation and the connector of the two conductors safely can be accommodated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_1|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1]], p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; These problems have been solved by NKF in [[Delft]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Patent 149955 of Netherlands Cable Works '''NKF''', submitted 4-11-1965, granted  17-11-1976&lt;/ref&gt; by introducing a device called '''bi-manchet'''.

[[File:HV Joint.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Photograph of a section of a high-voltage joint, '''bi-manchet''', with a high-voltage cable mounted at the right hand side of the device.]]
Figure 4 shows a photograph of the cross-section of such a device. At one side of this photograph the contours of a high-voltage cable are drawn. Here '''red''' represents the conductor of that cable and '''blue''' the insulation of the cable. The black parts in this picture are semi-conducting rubber parts. The outer one is at earth potential and spreads the electric field in a similar way as in a cable terminal. The inner one is at high-voltage and shields the connector of the conductors from the electric field.
&lt;br&gt; The field itself is diverted as shown in figure 5, where the equipotential lines are smoothly directed from the inside of the cable to the outer part of the bi-manchet (and vice versa at the other side of the device).
[[File:Field in joint.jpg|thumb|left|Field distribution in a '''bi-manchet''' or HV joint.]]

The crux of the matter is here, like in the cable terminal, that the inner bore of this bi-manchet is chosen smaller than the diameter over the cable-insulation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_1|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1]], p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In this way a permanent pressure is created between the bi-manchet and the cable surface and cavities or electrical weak points are avoided.

Installing a terminal or bi-manchet is  skilled work. Removing the outer semiconducting layer at the end of the cables, placing the field-controlling bodies, connecting the conductors, etc., require skill, cleanness and precision.

==X-ray cable==
X-ray cables&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreuger_1|Kreuger 1991 Vol. 1]], pp.  65, 133&lt;/ref&gt; are used in lengths of several meters to connect the HV source with an [[X-ray tube]] or any other HV device in scientific equipment. They transmit small currents, in the order of [[milliampere]]s at [[Direct current|DC]] voltages of 30 to 200&amp;nbsp;kV, or sometimes higher. The cables are flexible, with rubber or other [[elastomer]] insulation, stranded conductors, and an outer sheath of braided copper-wire. The construction has the same elements as other HV power cables.

==Testing of high-voltage cables==
There are different causes for faulty cable insulation when considering solid dielectric or paper insulation. Hence, there are various test and measurement methods to prove fully functional cables or to detect faulty ones.  While paper cables are primarily tested with DC insulation resistance tests the most common test for solid dielectric cable system is the partial discharge test.
One needs to distinguish between '''cable testing''' and '''cable diagnosis'''.
While cable testing methods result in a go/no go statement cable diagnosis methods allow judgement of the cable's current condition.
With some tests it is even possible to locate the position of the defect in the insulation before failure.
 
In some cases, [[Electrical treeing|Water trees]] can be detected by [[tan delta measurement]]. Interpretation of measurement results can in some cases yield the possibility to distinguish between new, strongly water treed cable. Unfortunately there are many other issues that can erroneously present themselves as high tangent delta and the vast majority of solid dielectric defects can not be detected with this method. 
Damages to the insulation and [[electrical treeing]] may be detected and located by [[partial discharge measurement]]. Data collected during the measurement procedure is compared to measurement values of the same cable gathered during the acceptance-test. This allows simple and quick classification of the dielectric condition of the tested cable.  Just like with tangent delta, this method has many caveats but with good adherence to factory test standards, field results can be very reliable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35542">[[File:Hott book cover.png|thumb|Cover of ''Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics''.]]
In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], '''homotopy type theory''' ('''HoTT''' {{IPAc-en|h|ɒ|t}}) is the [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]] turning the judgement that two terms of a given type are equal in [[intensional type theory]] into an actual identity type. More broadly, homotopy type theory refers to various lines of development of [[intensional type theory]], based on the interpretation of types as objects to which the intuition of (abstract) [[homotopy theory]] applies.
		 	
This includes, among other lines of work, the construction of homotopical and [[Higher category theory|higher-categorical]] [[Model (mathematical logic)|models]] for such type theories; the use of type theory as a logic (or [[internal language]]) for abstract homotopy theory and [[higher category theory]]; the development of mathematics within a type-theoretic [[foundation of mathematics|foundation]] (including both previously existing mathematics and new mathematics that homotopical types make possible); and the [[Formal proof|formalization]] of each of these in computer [[proof assistant]]s.

There is a large overlap between the work referred to as homotopy type theory, and as the [[univalent foundations]] project.  Although neither is precisely delineated, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the choice of usage also sometimes corresponds to differences in viewpoint and emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Shulman|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Shulman (mathematician) |eprint=1601.05035v3|title=Homotopy Type Theory: A synthetic approach to higher equalities |date=2016-01-27}}, footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, this article may not represent the views of all researchers in the fields equally. This kind of variability is unavoidable when a field is in rapid flux.

== History ==

===Prehistory: the groupoid model===
At one time the idea that types in [[Intuitionistic type theory#Extensional versus intensional|intensional type theory]] with their identity types could be regarded as groupoids was [[mathematical folklore]]. It was first made precise semantically in the 1998 paper of Martin Hofmann and [[Thomas Streicher]] called "The groupoid interpretation of type theory", in which they showed that intensional type theory had a model in the category of [[groupoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Martin |last1=Hofmann |last2=Streicher |first2=Thomas |author2-link=Thomas Streicher| chapter=The groupoid interpretation of type theory |mr=1686862 |editor1-first=Giovanni |editor1-last=Sambin |editor2-first=Jan M. |editor2-last=Smith |title=Twenty Five Years of Constructive Type Theory |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLnKggT_In4C&amp;pg=PA83 |date=1998 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-158903-4 |pages=83–111 |series=Oxford Logic Guides |volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first truly "[[Homotopical algebra|homotopical]]" model of type theory, albeit only "1-[[dimension]]al" (the traditional models in the [[category of sets]] being homotopically 0-dimensional).

Their paper also foreshadowed several later developments in homotopy type theory. For instance, they noted that the groupoid model satisfies a rule they called "universe extensionality", which is none other than the restriction to 1-types of the ''univalence axiom'' that [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] proposed ten years later. (The axiom for 1-types is notably simpler to formulate, however, since a [[Coherence condition|coherence]] notion of "equivalence" is not required.)  They also defined "categories with isomorphism as equality" and conjectured that in a model using higher-dimensional groupoids, for such categories one would have "equivalence is equality"; this was later proven by Benedikt Ahrens, Krzysztof Kapulkin, and [[Michael Shulman (mathematician)|Michael Shulman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Benedikt |last=Ahrens |first2=Krzysztof |last2=Kapulkin |first3=Michael |last3=Shulman |author3-link=Michael Shulman (mathematician)|title=Univalent categories and the Rezk completion |journal=Mathematical Structures in Computer Science |volume=25 |year=2015|issue= 5|pages= 1010–1039|arxiv=1303.0584 |doi=10.1017/S0960129514000486|mr=3340533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history: model categories and higher groupoids===
The first higher-dimensional models of intensional type theory were constructed by Steve Awodey and his student Michael Warren in 2005 using [[Model category|Quillen model categories]]. These results were first presented in public at the conference FMCS 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/FMCS/FMCS_06/FMCS06.html Foundational Methods in Computer Science, University of Calgary, June 7th - 9th, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; at which Warren gave a talk titled "Homotopy models of intensional type theory", which also served as his thesis prospectus (the dissertation committee present were Awodey, Nicola Gambino and Alex Simpson). A summary is contained in Warren's thesis prospectus abstract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mawarren.net/papers/prospectus.pdf Michael Warren, "Homotopy Models of Intensional Type Theory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a subsequent workshop about identity types at [[Uppsala University]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.math.uu.se/~palmgren/itt/ Identity Types - Topological and Categorical Structure, Workshop, Uppsala, November 13-14, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  there were two talks about the relation between intensional type theory and factorization systems: one by Richard Garner, "Factorisation systems for type theory",&lt;ref&gt;[http://comp.mq.edu.au/~rgarner/Papers/Uppsala.pdf Richard Garner, Factorisation axioms for type theory]&lt;/ref&gt; and one by Michael Warren, "Model categories and intensional identity types". Related ideas were discussed in the talks by [[Steve Awodey]], "Type theory of higher-dimensional categories", and [[Thomas Streicher]], "Identity types vs. weak omega-groupoids: some ideas, some problems". At the same conference Benno van den Berg gave a talk titled "Types as weak omega-categories" where he outlined the ideas that later became the subject of a joint paper with Richard Garner.

All early constructions of higher dimensional models had to deal with the problem of coherence typical of models of dependent type theory, and various solutions were developed. One such was given in 2009 by Voevodsky, another in 2010 by van den Berg and Garner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |first=Benno van den |last=Berg |first2=Richard |last2=Garner |title=Topological and simplicial models of identity types |date=27 July 2010 |arxiv=1007.4638}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general solution, building on Voevodsky's construction, was eventually given by Lumsdaine and Warren in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter LeFanu |last=Lumsdaine |first2=Michael A. |last2=Warren |title=The local universes model: an overlooked coherence construction for dependent type theories |date=6 November 2014 |arxiv=1411.1736 |doi=10.1145/2754931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the PSSL86 in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeEN.html 86th edition of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic, Henri Poincaré University, September 8-9 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Awodey gave a talk titled "Homotopy type theory" (this was the first public usage of that term, which was coined by Awodey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/listPart.html Preliminary list of PSSL86 participants]&lt;/ref&gt;). Awodey and Warren summarized their results in the paper "Homotopy theoretic models of identity types", which was posted on the [[ArXiv]] preprint server in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steve |last=Awodey |first2=Michael A. |last2=Warren |title=Homotopy theoretic models of identity types |date=3 September 2007 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=0709.0248 |doi=10.1017/S0305004108001783 |volume=146 |journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |page=45|bibcode=2008MPCPS.146...45A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 2009; a more detailed version appeared in Warren's thesis "Homotopy theoretic aspects of constructive type theory" in 2008.

At about the same time, Vladimir Voevodsky was independently investigating type theory in the context of the search of a language for practical formalization of mathematics. In September 2006 he posted to the Types mailing list  "A very short note on homotopy [[lambda calculus]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Voevodsky_note.ps ''A very short note on homotopy λ-calculus'', by Vladimir Voevodsky, September 27, 2006] PDF&lt;/ref&gt; which sketched the outlines of a type theory with dependent products, sums and universes and of a model of this type theory in Kan [[simplicial set]]s. It began by saying "The homotopy λ-calculus is a hypothetical (at the moment) type system" and ended with "At the moment much of what I said above is at the level of conjectures. Even the definition of the model of TS in the homotopy category is non-trivial" referring to the complex coherence issues that were not resolved until 2009. This note included a syntactic definition of "equality types" that were claimed to be interpreted in the model by path-spaces, but did not consider [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s rules for identity types. It also stratified the universes by homotopy dimension in addition to size, an idea that later was mostly discarded.

On the syntactic side, Benno van den Berg conjectured in 2006 that the tower of identity types of a type in intensional type theory should have the structure of an ω-category, and indeed a ω-groupoid, in the "globular, algebraic" sense of Michael Batanin. This was later proven independently by van den Berg and Garner in the paper "Types are weak omega-groupoids" (published 2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Benno |last=van den Berg |first2=Richard |last2=Garner |title=Types are weak omega-groupoids |date=1 December 2007 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=0812.0298 |doi=10.1112/plms/pdq026}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Peter Lumsdaine in the paper "Weak ω-Categories from Intensional Type Theory" (published 2009) and as part of his 2010 Ph.D. thesis "Higher Categories from Type Theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Lumsdaine |title=Higher Categories from Type Theories |date=2010 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |url=http://lib.rett.org.uk/~peterlefanulumsdaine/research/Lumsdaine-2010-Thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The univalence axiom, synthetic homotopy theory, and higher inductive types===
The concept of a univalent fibration was introduced by Voevodsky in early 2006&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/vladimirias/2006_Mar_Homotopy_lambda_calculus Notes on homotopy lambda calculus, March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, because of the insistence of all presentations of the Martin-Löf type theory on the property that the identity types, in the empty context, may contain only reflexivity, Voevodsky did not recognize until 2009 that these identity types can be used in combination with the univalent universes. In particular, the idea that univalence can be introduced simply by adding an axiom to the existing Martin-Löf type theory appeared only in 2009.

Also in 2009, Voevodsky worked out more of the details of a model of type theory in [[Kan complex]]es, and observed that the existence of a universal [[Kan fibration]] could be used to resolve the coherence problems for categorical models of type theory. He also proved, using an idea of A. K. Bousfield,  that this universal fibration was univalent: the associated fibration of pairwise homotopy equivalences between the fibers is equivalent to the paths-space fibration of the base.

To formulate univalence as an axiom Voevodsky found a way  to define "equivalences" syntactically that had the important property that the type representing the statement "f is an equivalence" was (under the assumption of function extensionality) (-1)-truncated (i.e. contractible if inhabited). This enabled him to give a ''syntactic'' statement of univalence, generalizing Hofmann and Streicher's "universe extensionality" to higher dimensions. He was also able to use these definitions of equivalences and contractibility to start developing significant amounts of "synthetic homotopy theory" in the proof assistant [[Coq]]; this formed the basis of the library later called "Foundations" and eventually "UniMath".&lt;ref name=UniMath&gt;[https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath GitHub repository, Univalent Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unification of the various threads began in February 2010 with an informal meeting at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where Voevodsky presented his model in Kan complexes and his Coq code to a group including Awodey, Warren, Lumsdaine, and [[Robert Harper (computer scientist)|Robert Harper]], Dan Licata, [[Michael Shulman (mathematician)|Michael Shulman]], and others. This meeting produced the outlines of a proof (by Warren, Lumsdaine, Licata, and Shulman) that every homotopy equivalence is an equivalence (in Voevodsky's good coherent sense), based on the idea from category theory of improving equivalences to adjoint equivalences. Soon afterwards, Voevodsky proved that the univalence axiom implies function extensionality.

The next pivotal event was a mini-workshop at the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach]] in March 2011 organized by Steve Awodey, Richard Garner, Per Martin-Löf, and Vladimir Voevodsky, titled "The homotopy interpretation of constructive type theory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hottheory.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/report-11_2011.pdf Mini-Workshop: ''The Homotopy Interpretation of Constructive Type Theory'', Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, February 27th – March 5th, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Coq tutorial for this workshop, Andrej Bauer wrote a small Coq library.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/andrejbauer/Homotopy GitHub repository, Andrej Bauer, Homotopy theory in Coq]&lt;/ref&gt; based on Voevodsky's ideas (but not actually using any of his code); this eventually became the kernel of the first version of the "HoTT" Coq library&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/commit/1fb4ed9e5cdc5494f26ae6d13c4ebc851b81e1ba GitHub Basic homotopy type theory, Andrej Bauer &amp; Vladimir Voevodsky, Apr 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; (the first commit of the latter&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT GitHub repository, Homotopy type theory]&lt;/ref&gt; by Michael Shulman notes "Development based on Andrej Bauer's files, with many ideas taken from Vladimir Voevodsky's files"). One of the most important things to come out of the Oberwolfach meeting was the basic idea of higher inductive types, due to Lumsdaine, Shulman, Bauer, and Warren. The participants also formulated a list of important open questions, such as whether the univalence axiom satisfies canonicity (still open, although some special cases have been resolved positively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Shulman |title=Univalence for inverse diagrams and homotopy canonicity |date=15 March 2012 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=1203.3253 |doi=10.1017/S0960129514000565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~drl/pubs/lh112tt/lh112tt.pdf ''Canonicity for 2-Dimensional Type Theory'', by Daniel R. Licata and Robert Harper, Carnegie Mellon University, July 21, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;), whether the univalence axiom has nonstandard models (since answered positively by Shulman), and how to define (semi)simplicial types (still open in MLTT, although it can be done in Voevodsky's Homotopy Type System (HTS), a type theory with two equality types).

Soon after the Oberwolfach workshop, the ''Homotopy Type Theory website and blog''&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; was established, and the subject began to be popularized under that name. An idea of some of the important progress during this period can be obtained from the blog history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/blog Homotopy Type Theory blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Univalent foundations==
The phrase "univalent foundations" is agreed by all to be closely related to homotopy type theory, but not everyone uses it in the same way.  It was originally used by Vladimir Voevodsky to refer to his vision of a foundational system for mathematics in which the basic objects are homotopy types, based on a type theory satisfying the univalence axiom, and formalized in a computer proof assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/ Type Theory and Univalent Foundations]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Voevodsky's work became integrated with the community of other researchers working on homotopy type theory, "univalent foundations" was sometimes used interchangeably with "homotopy type theory",&lt;ref name=hott/&gt;  and other times to refer only to its use as a foundational system (excluding, for example, the study of model-categorical semantics or computational metatheory).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncatlab.org/homotopytypetheory/show/References Homotopy Type Theory: References]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the subject of the IAS special year was officially given as "univalent foundations", although a lot of the work done there focused on semantics and metatheory in addition to foundations.  The book produced by participants in the IAS program was titled "Homotopy type theory: Univalent foundations of mathematics"; although this could refer to either usage, since the book only discusses HoTT as a mathematical foundation.&lt;ref name=hott/&gt;

[[File:The making of HoTT book.webm|thumb|An animation showing development of the HoTT Book on the GitHub repository by the participants in the Univalent Foundations Special Year project.]]
In 2012–13 researchers at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] held "A Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ias.edu/sp/univalent IAS school of mathematics:  Special Year on The Univalent Foundations of Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;  The special year brought together researchers in [[topology]], [[computer science]], [[category theory]], and [[mathematical logic]]. The program was organized by [[Steve Awodey]],  [[Thierry Coquand]] and [[Vladimir Voevodsky]].

During the program  [[Peter Aczel]], who was one of the participants, initiated a working group which investigated how to do type theory informally but rigorously, in a style that is analogous to ordinary mathematicians doing set theory. After initial experiments it became clear that this was not only possible but highly beneficial, and that a book (the so-called '''HoTT Book''')&lt;ref name=hott&gt;{{cite book|author=Univalent Foundations Program|title=Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics|year=2013|publisher=Institute for Advanced Study|url=http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/ Official announcement of The HoTT Book, by Steve Awodey, 20 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; could and should be written. Many other participants of the project then joined the effort with technical support, writing, proof reading, and offering ideas. Unusually for a mathematics text, it was developed collaboratively and in the open on [[GitHub]], is released under a [[Creative Commons license]] that allows people to [[fork (software development)|fork]] their own version of the book, and is both purchasable in print and downloadable free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D |last=Monroe |title=A New Type of Mathematics? |journal=Comm ACM |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=13–15 |year=2014 |doi=10.1145/2557446 |url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/2/171675-a-new-type-of-mathematics/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/06/the_hott_book.html Announcement of The HoTT Book, by Mike Shulman at The n-Category Café, June 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.andrej.com/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/ Announcement of The HoTT Book, by Andrej Bauer, June 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the special year was a catalyst for the development of the entire subject; the HoTT Book was only one, albeit the most visible, result.

=== "Propositions as types" ===
HoTT uses a modified version of the "[[Propositions as types principle|propositions as types]]" interpretation of type theory, according to which types can also represent propositions and terms can then represent proofs.  In HoTT, however, unlike in standard "propositions as types", a special role is played by 'mere propositions' which, roughly speaking, are those types having at most one term, up to [[propositional equality]].  These are more like conventional logical propositions than are general types, in that they are proof-irrelevant.

=== Equality ===
The fundamental concept of homotopy type theory is the [[path (topology)|path]]. In HoTT, the type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; is the type of all paths from the point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. (Therefore, a proof that a point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; equals a point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the same thing as a path from the point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.) For any point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a path of type &lt;math&gt;a = a&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the reflexive property of equality. A path of type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; can be inverted, forming a path of type &lt;math&gt;b = a&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the symmetric property of equality. Two paths of type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; resp. &lt;math&gt;b = c&lt;/math&gt; can be concatenated, forming a path of type &lt;math&gt;a = c&lt;/math&gt;; this corresponds to the transitive property of equality.

Most importantly, given a path &lt;math&gt;p:a=b&lt;/math&gt;, and a proof of some property &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt;, the proof can be "transported" along the path &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to yield a proof of the property &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt;. (Equivalently stated, an object of type &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt; can be turned into an object of type &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt;.) This corresponds to the substitution property of equality. Here, an important difference between HoTT and classical mathematics comes in. In classical mathematics, once the equality of two values &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; has been established, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; may be used interchangeably thereafter, with no regard to any distinction between them. In homotopy type theory, however, there may be multiple different paths &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;, and transporting an object along two different paths will yield two different results. Therefore, in homotopy type theory, when applying the substitution property, it is necessary to state which path is being used.

In general, a "proposition" can have multiple different proofs. (For example, the type of all natural numbers, when considered as a proposition, has every natural number as a proof.) Even if a proposition has only one proof &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, the space of paths &lt;math&gt;a = a&lt;/math&gt; may be non-trivial in some way. A "mere proposition" is any type which either is empty, or contains only one point with a trivial [[Path space (algebraic topology)|path space]].

Note that people write &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;Id_A(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, 
thereby leaving the type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; implicit. 
Do not confuse it with &lt;math&gt;id_A : A\to A&lt;/math&gt;, denoting the identity function on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Type equivalence ===
Two types &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; belonging to some universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; are defined as being ''equivalent'' if there exists an ''equivalence'' between them. An equivalence is a function 
:&lt;math&gt;f:A \to B&lt;/math&gt;
which has both a left inverse and a right inverse, in the sense that for suitably chosen &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, the following types are both inhabited:
:&lt;math&gt;Id_{B\rightarrow B}(f \circ g, id_B),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Id_{A \rarr A}(h \circ f, id_A).&lt;/math&gt; 
i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;f \circ g =_{B\rightarrow B} id_B,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h \circ f =_{A\rightarrow A} id_A.&lt;/math&gt; 
This expresses a general notion of "f has both a left inverse and right inverse", using equality types. Note that the invertibility conditions above are equality types in the function types &lt;math&gt;A\rarr A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\rarr B&lt;/math&gt;.  One generally assumes the function extensionality axiom, which ensures that these are equivalent to the following types that express invertibility using the equality on the domain and codomain &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{y:B}.\ Id_B((f \circ g)(y), id_B(y)),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{x:A}.\ Id_A((h \circ f)(x), id_A(x)).&lt;/math&gt; 
i.e. for all &lt;math&gt;x:A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y:B&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(g(y)) =_B y,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h(f(x)) =_A x.&lt;/math&gt;

The functions of type
:&lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;
together with a proof that they are equivalences are denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;A \simeq B&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The univalence axiom ===
Having defined functions that are equivalences as above, one can show that there is a canonical way to turn paths to equivalences.
In other words, there is a function of the type
:&lt;math&gt;(A = B) \to (A \simeq B),&lt;/math&gt;
which expresses that types &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; that are equal are, in particular, also equivalent.

The '''univalence axiom''' states that this function is itself an equivalence.&lt;ref name=hott /&gt;{{rp|115}}  Therefore, we have

: &lt;math&gt;(A = B) \simeq (A \simeq B)&lt;/math&gt;

"In other words, identity is equivalent to equivalence. In particular, one may say that 'equivalent
types are identical'."&lt;ref name=hott /&gt;{{rp|4}}

== Applications ==

=== Theorem proving ===
HoTT allows mathematical proofs to be translated into a [[computer programming language]] for computer [[proof assistant]]s much more easily than before. This approach offers the potential for computers to check difficult proofs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/new-foundation-mathematics?et_cid=4133336&amp;et_rid=677699018&amp;location=top|title = A new foundation for mathematics|date = 3 September 2014|accessdate = 6 September 2014|website = |publisher = R&amp;D Magazine|last = Meyer|first = Florian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One goal of mathematics is to formulate axioms from which virtually all mathematical theorems can be derived and proven unambiguously. Correct proofs in mathematics must follow the rules of logic. They must be derivable without error from [[axiom]]s and already-proven statements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

HoTT adds the univalence axiom, which relates the equality of logical-mathematical propositions to homotopy theory. An equation such as “a=b” is a mathematical proposition in which two different symbols have the same value. In homotopy type theory, this is taken to mean that the two shapes which represent the values of the symbols are topologically equivalent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These topological equivalence relationships, [[ETH Zürich]] Institute for Theoretical Studies director [[Giovanni Felder]] argues, can be better formulated in homotopy theory because it is more comprehensive: Homotopy theory explains not only why “a equals b” but also how to derive this. In set theory, this information would have to be defined additionally, which makes the translation of mathematical propositions into programming languages more difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Computer programming ===
{{section expand|date=December 2014}}
As of 2015, intense research work was underway to model and formally analyse the computational behavior of the univalence axiom in homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2676983|title = Higher Inductive Types as Homotopy-Initial Algebras|last = Sojakova|first = Kristina|date = 2015|conference = POPL 2015|doi = 10.1145/2676726.2676983|access-date = |arxiv = 1402.0761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cubical type theory'' is one attempt to give computational content to homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Cubical Type Theory: a constructive interpretation of the univalence axiom|url=https://hal-iogs.archives-ouvertes.fr/INRIA/hal-01378906v2|last1=Cohen|first1=Cyril|last2=Coquand|first2=Thierry|last3=Huber|first3=Simon|last4=Mörtberg |first4=Anders|conference=TYPES 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is believed that certain objects, such as semi-simplicial types, cannot be constructed without reference to some notion of exact equality. Therefore, various ''two-level type theories'' have been developed which partition their types into fibrant types, which respect paths, and non-fibrant types, which do not. Cartesian Cubical Computational Type Theory is the first two-level type theory which gives a full computational interpretation to homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Cartesian Cubical Computational Type Theory: Constructive Reasoning with Paths and Equalities| last1=Anguili|first1=Carlo|last2=Favonia|last3=Harper|first3=Robert|conference=Computer Science Logic 2018|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/cartesian/paper.pdf|year=2018|accessdate=26 Aug 2018}} (to appear)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian Institute of Chemical Technology''' is a national-level research center located in [[Hyderabad, Telangana, India]] under the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR). IICT conducts research in basic and applied chemistry, biochemistry, bioinformatics, chemical engineering and provides science and technology inputs to the industrial and economic development of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-economy/iict-licenses-cancer-patents-to-us-co/article1742096.ece IICT licenses cancer patents to US co | Business Line&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; IICT has filed one of the maximum [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]] patents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/money/1998/nov/09paten1.htm Rediff On The NeT Business News: Hyderabad's IICT ties up with Cytomed Inc for 3 US patents, more JVs planned&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iictindia.org/(S(vmeeaw45tjsapb55rkteikf4))/BiennialReports/2007-2009/02_R&amp;D%20Outputs%20Overview.pdf 01_Master_pages-a4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iictindia.org/(S(vmeeaw45tjsapb55rkteikf4))/Staff/0915/PatentList.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The [[research and development]] programmes of IICT relate to the development of technologies for [[pesticides]], [[drug]]s, organic intermediates, [[fine chemical]]s, [[catalyst]]s, [[polymer]]s, organic coatings, use of low-grade coals, and value-added products from vegetable oils. Process design and mechanical engineering design form an integral part of technology development and transfer. IICT is also actively engaged in basic research in organic synthesis and catalyses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/iict-seeks-patent-for-anti-ulcer-molecule-106080501049_1.html IICT seeks patent for anti-ulcer molecule | Business Standard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the institute's work is development of technology for accurate identification, of principal [[mosquito]] vector in rural endemic areas for designing suitable control measures of vector-borne diseases like [[malaria]], [[filaria]], Japanese encephalitis, [[dengue]] fever, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/iict-hyderabad-developed-software-tool-to-curb-dengue-and-malaria-1374843454-1 IICT Hyderabad developed Software tool to curb Dengue and Malaria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing countries like [[India]], classification and identification of the mosquito species from rural endemic areas are of paramount importance. The [[World Health Organization]] monograph which describes the taxonomic data in the form of a pictorial key is generally difficult to understand by a non-taxonomist. Keeping this difficulty in view, a novel software has been developed which is user-friendly and menu-driven. The package can be successfully used in [[mosquito control]] programs in rural areas. Rapid identification and greater accuracy are the salient features of the technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.niperhyd.ac.in/PDF/Brochure-NIPER.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iictenvis.nic.in/Database/More_About_Malaria_825.aspx Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad Envis Center, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Govt. of India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Data Visualization}}
'''Information design''' is the practice of presenting information in a way that fosters efficient and effective understanding of it. The term has come to be used specifically for [[graphic design]] for displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression. Information design is closely related to the field of [[data visualization]] and is often taught as part of graphic design courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.design.ccsu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Information design is explanation design. It explains facts of the universe and leads to knowledge and informed action.&lt;ref&gt;Per Mollerup,  Data Design: Visualising quantities, locations, connections, Bloomsbury Academic, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term 'information design' emerged as a [[interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] area of study in the 1970s. Some [[graphic designer]]s started to use the term, and it was consolidated with the publication of the ''Information Design Journal'' in 1979, and later with the setting up of the related International Institute for Information Design (IIID) in 1987 and  [[Information Design Association]] (IDA) in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robwaller.org/IDA_origins_RW.pdf |title=The Origins of the Information Design Association |publisher=University of Reading |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, [[Edward Tufte]] produced a book on information design called ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''.
The term [[information graphics]] tends to be used by those primarily concerned with diagramming and display of quantitative information.

In [[technical communication]], information design refers to creating an information structure for a set of information aimed at specified audiences. It can be practiced on different scales.
* On a large scale, it implies choosing relevant content and dividing it into separate manuals by audience and purpose.
* On a medium scale, it means organizing the content in each manual and making sure that overviews, concepts, examples, references, and definitions are included and that topics follow an organizing principle.
* On a fine scale, it includes logical development of topics, emphasis on what's important, clear writing, navigational clues, and even page design, choice of font, and use of white space.
Similar skills for organization and structure are brought to bear in designing [[web site]]s, with additional constraints and functions that earn a designer the title information architect.
In [[computer science]] and [[information technology]], 'information design' is sometimes a rough synonym for (but is not necessarily the same discipline as) [[information architecture]], the design of [[information system]]s, [[database]]s, or [[data structure]]s.  This sense includes [[data modeling]] and [[process analysis]].
{{Citation needed span|text=In the United States, the title of information designer is sometimes used by graphic designers who specialize in creating websites.|date=April 2018|reason=}} The skill set of the information designer, as the title is applied more globally, is closer to that of the [[information architecture|information architect]] in the U.S.

==Early examples==
[[Image:Minard.png|thumb|350px|[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s 1861 diagram of [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's March]] - an early example of an information graphic.]]
Information design is associated with the age of technology but it does have historical roots. Early instances of modern information design include these effective examples:
* [[William Playfair]]'s [[line chart|line]], [[bar chart|bar]], [[pie chart|pie]], and [[area chart]]s illustrating England's trade (1786 and 1801)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anychart.com/blog/2015/12/23/first-area-charts-history/ |title=First Ever Area Charts Created 200+ Years Ago |publisher=AnyChart|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tufte&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufte|first=Edward|author-link=Edward Tufte|title=The Visual Display of Quantitative Information|year=1983|publisher=Graphics Press|location=Cheshire, Connecticut|ISBN=0961392142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s spot maps, which pinpointed the source of a deadly cholera outbreak in 1850s London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crosier|first1=Scott|title=John Snow: The London Cholera Epidemic of 1854|url=http://webprojects.oit.ncsu.edu/project/bio183de/Black/science/science_reading/8.html|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s 1861 diagram depicting Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Charles Joseph Minard: Mapping Napoleon's March, 1861|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/58|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[Isotype (pictograms)|International Picture Language]] of the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Popova|first=Maria|title=The Invention of ISOTYPE: How a Vintage Visual Language Paved the Way for the Infographics Age|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/03/08/the-transformer-isotype/|publisher=Brain Pickings|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Florence Nightingale]]'s information graphic depicting army mortality rates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Small|first1=Hugh|title=Florence Nightingale's statistical diagrams|url=http://www.florence-nightingale-avenging-angel.co.uk/GraphicsPaper/Graphics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the 1812-1813 period. Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility.  [[Edward Tufte]] wrote in 1983 that: "It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn."&lt;ref name=Tufte /&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:DALY disability affected life year infographic.svg|thumb|A visual definition of [[Disability Adjusted Life Year]]]]
[[File:Bangalore Outbound Trains Frequency Chart.png|thumb|350px|Visualization of the frequency of outbound trains from [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. Based on the work of [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]]]
Information design can be used for broad audiences (such as signs in airports) or specific audiences (such as personalized telephone bills).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Design FAQ|url=http://www.bogieland.com/infodesign_faq.htm|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting work often seeks to improve a user's trust of a product (such as medicine packaging inserts, operational instructions for industrial machinery and information for emergencies).

Governments and regulatory authorities have legislated about a number of information design issues, such as the minimum size of type in financial small print, the labeling of ingredients in processed food, and the testing of medicine labeling. Examples of this are the [[Truth in Lending Act]] in the USA, which introduced the [[Schumer box]] (a concise summary of charges for people applying for a credit card), and the Guideline on the Readability of the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use (European Commission, Revision 1, 12 January 2009).

Professor [[Edward Tufte]] explained that users of information displays are executing particular ''analytical tasks''  such as making comparisons or determining causality. The ''design principle'' of the information graphic should support the analytical task, showing the comparison or causality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Y4SxgfGCg Edward Tufte-Presentation-August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simplicity ==
Simplicity is a major concern in information design. The aim is clarity. Simplification of messages may imply quantitative reduction but is not restricted to that. Sometimes more
information means more clarity. Also, simplicity is a highly subjective matter and should always be evaluated with the information user in mind. Simplicity can be easy when following five simple steps when it comes to information design: 1. Tell the truth, 2. Get to the point, 3. Pick the right tool for the job, 4. Highlight what is important, 5. Of course, keep it simple. These steps will help an information designer narrow down results, as well as keeping their audience engaged. &lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Nancy.

==Plot==
A remote village named Pali in [[Andhra Pradesh]] is struck by an unknown disease, with several villagers dying each month. The village Tantrik ([[Rao Ramesh]]) predicts a powerful man will come to their rescue as God. He assigns his assistant Siddhappa ([[Shafi (actor)|Shafi]]) with the duty to find a man with such supernatural power and bring him to their village.

Meanwhile, Alluri Seetarama Raju ([[Mahesh Babu]]) is a [[Taxicab|cab]] driver who lives in [[Hyderabad]] with his grandfather ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]), a teacher. He is currently in [[Rajasthan]] in search of the family of a man named Bilavar Singh. In his journey, he meets a [[Gemini TV]] reporter Baabji ([[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]]), who comes to Rajasthan to shoot a travel documentary. Raju introduces himself to Baabji and tells him the reason for him being in Rajasthan. He describes a woman named Subhashini ([[Anushka Shetty]]), whom he considers brings bad luck to him. Previously, he encountered her in various occasions in which she damages his taxi due to her reckless driving. Raju lands in the hospital one day when Subhashini mixes an [[epsom salt]] [[laxative]] in Raju's [[coffee]], thinking it meets her at a [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] to collect the compensation for his taxi's damages from her, though this was meant for someone else. One day, he drives two men, [[geology]] scientist Dr. Paranji and his assistant Bilavar to their destination the [[Geological Survey of India]]. But he sees them getting gunned down by some henchmen, and Bilavar falls out of a window and lands on Raju's taxi, destroying it. Since Bilavar has insurance, Raju's boss tells him to deliver the insurance check of Rs. 5,00,000 to Bilavar's family in Girdwala, Rajasthan and get Rs. 1,00,000 in return to pay for his car damages.

Meanwhile, Subhashini's father, [[business magnate]] Durga Prasad ([[Tanikella Bharani]]), brings her a match, another business magnate GK's ([[Prakash Raj]]) son ([[Amit Tiwari]]). The main reason for the proposal is to establish a strong business partnership. GK's son takes her to Rajasthan for a date. Subhashini runs away after she sees a [[condom]] drop from his pocket. GK finds out about it, informs Prasad, and promises to bring Subhashini back. He sends his henchman Govardhan ([[Subbaraju]]) to Rajasthan in search of Subhashini. Subhashini finds Raju and Baabji and learns she is in Rajasthan. Subhashini, Baabji, Raju, and a [[botanist]] Tom Cruise ([[Ali (actor)|Ali]]) find Girdwala and hand the check to Bilavar's family, but Raju refuses to ask for the Rs. 1,00,000 when he sees the family's poverty. Tom remains in the village as the villagers want to punish him for cutting a sentimental plant. Baabji goes away with his shooting team but does not offer them a ride.

As Raju and Subhashini return, Govardhan's men stab Raju and take Subhashini after knocking her unconscious. Raju survives, fights, and kills almost all of Govardhan's men. Just as Raju goes unconscious, Sidhappa finds him and believes he is the God after seeing the omens. Sidhappa and Subhashini take Raju to Pali, where the villagers treat his wounds. After waking up, he finds all of the villagers praising him as their God. He finds out from Subhashini that they are in Pali, and that the villagers see him as the supernatural godsend who will rescue the village. Initially reluctant to help them out, he escapes to Hyderabad, where he hands over Subhashini to her father. After realizing Tom and Siddappa followed him to Hyderabad, Raju puts fate to the test and when he understands the concept of deityhood and god, he makes it a goal to solve the mystical series of deaths in the village. After tracking down a doctor, the dean of the medical college run by GK, Govardhan, and GK's lawyer Miriyam ([[Brahmanandam]]), Raju discovers the [[plastic]] factory in Pali deposits its wastes in the drinking water source nearby, thus contaminating and killing the villagers. GK actually wants the villagers in Pali to die, which was why he had the Government's medical camp removed periodically. He finds GK's assistant ([[Veda Sastry|Archana]]) and suspects she has something to do with GK's plan as she did not get into his taxi along with Paranji, indicating she knew beforehand that he was going to be killed. Raju inquires her about GK's intentions, who reveals that Paranji discovered earlier that there is a large [[iridium]] deposit under Pali, which is worth billions, and informed GK about it.

Despite GK's warning to Paranji of not revealing it to anybody else, he tries to inform the Geological Survey of India about the deposits, which was why he and Bilavar, who was with him, were killed that day. GK suspects that Raju might also know about the iridium deposit because he was with Paranji when he was killed which was why GK sent Govardhan to kill him. Raju was lured to Girdwala under the cover of delivering the insurance check to Bilavar's family and was attacked by Govardhan. GK needs the strong plastic glass from the plastic factory to pack the iridium. He wanted the Pali villagers to vacate on their own to avoid suspicion, which was why he poisoned Pali's environment using the plastic factory's waste.

GK kills his assistant and Govardhan for their failures. He then heads to Pali to kill all the villagers. The village head warns GK that Raju is their God, that he would bring death to GK, and keep Pali's population at 534, not letting any more die in the process. Raju arrives at Pali with Sidhappa. GK shoots Sidhappa and kills him, reducing the population to 533. Before dying, Siddhappa looks into Raju's eyes, dying after. Raju kills GK's goons and severs GK's palm. A terrified GK starts escaping with Raju in pursuit. Raju catches up to him, and GK dies when a religious knife hanging from a nearby tree falls and stabs him in the neck after Raju curses him to die. The village head reveals Raju fulfilled his mission as God to save the village, because although Sidhappa was killed, another baby was born to keep the village's population at 534. The film ends with a new flag being put up in honor of the new birth.

==Critical reception==
[[Sify]] rated 3 out of 5 explained "No doubt, Mahesh is the cynosure of the movie, shouldering the entire responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/mahesh-khaleja-review-review-telugu-14958111.html |title=Movie Review:Mahesh Khaleja- Review |publisher=Sify.com |accessdate=4 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723072603/http://www.sify.com/movies/mahesh-khaleja-review-review-telugu-14958111.html|archivedate=23 July 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MSN]] rated 2.5 out of 5 and described the film as "just an above average venture", commenting, "''Mahesh Khaleja'' is worth a watch for Mahesh's strong screen presence and charisma. Mahesh carries off his role with elan and looks superb too. Anushka looks pretty but doesn't share a good on-screen chemistry with Mahesh. The first half of the film is dull. It does pick up pace in the second half but the narration is inconsistent and tedious. The climax is little better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.in.msn.com/southcinema/reviews/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4450135&amp;page=2 |title=Watch 'Mahesh Khaleja' for Mahesh Babu's charisma – 2 – Reviews &amp;#124; South Cinema &amp;#124; MSN India Entertainment |publisher=Entertainment.in.msn.com |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019173456/http://entertainment.in.msn.com/southcinema/reviews/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4450135&amp;page=2|archivedate=19 October 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rediff]] gave a 2.5 out of 5 rating and noted "The duo of Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is watchable, entertaining with good humour, couple of well-orchestrated action sequences and songs and with a bit to take home as well. It's Mahesh's show all the way, much to the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the soul of the movie, be it his dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or emotions, he is effortless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.rediff.com/report/2010/oct/07/south-mahesh-khaleja-review.htm |title=Mahesh Khaleja: Mahesh Babu's show all the way – Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Movies.rediff.com |date=7 October 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNN-IBN]] gave a negative review stating "The movie is all about Mahesh Babu and he occupies almost every frame in the movie. Back after a gap of 4 years, Mahesh looks great with stylish costumes. The movie deals with a serious theme but director Trivikram Srinivas mixes it with a lot of unnecessary situational comedy which dilutes the intensity of the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/telugu-review-khaleja-fails-to-pack-a-punch/132981-47-79.html |title=Telugu Review: Khaleja fails to pack a punch – Reviews – Telugu reviews – ibnlive |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miles Glacier Bridge, damage and kludge, 1984.jpg|240px|thumbnail|Part of the [[Miles Glacier Bridge]], with a "kludge" (temporary fix) to make the bridge usable after [[1964 Alaska earthquake|earthquake]] damage.]]

A '''kludge''' or '''kluge''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ʌ|dʒ|,_|k|l|uː|dʒ}}) is a [[workaround]] or quick-and-dirty solution that is clumsy, inelegant, inefficient, difficult to extend and hard to maintain. This term is used in diverse fields such as [[computer science]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[Internet slang]], [[evolutionary neuroscience]], and government. A software kludge (often called "spaghetti code") is frequently the result of hacking. See photo of "A network kludge" at right. 

== Pronunciation and etymology ==
The word has alternate spellings (''[[Wikt:kludge|kludge]]'' and ''[[Wikt:kluge|kluge]]''), pronunciations ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ʌ|dʒ}} and {{IPAc-en|k|l|uː|dʒ}}, rhyming with ''judge'' and ''stooge'' respectively) and several proposed [[etymologies]].

=== Jackson W. Granholm ===
In the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed., 1989), the ''kludge'' entry cites one source for this word's earliest recorded usage, definition and [[etymology]]: Jackson W. Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article, which appeared in the American [[computer magazine]] ''[[Datamation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''kludge''' {{IPA|/kluːdʒ/}} Also '''kluge'''. [J. W. Granholm's jocular invention: see first quot.; cf. also ''bodge'' v., ''fudge'' v.]&lt;ref&gt;This ''OED2'' defines these two ''kludge'' [[Cognate (etymology)|cognates]] as ''bodge'' "to patch or mend clumsily" and ''fudge'' "to fit together or adjust in a clumsy, makeshift, or dishonest manner".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;'An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole' (Granholm); esp. in ''Computing'', a machine, system, or program that has been improvised or 'bodged' together; a hastily improvised and poorly thought-out solution to a fault or 'bug'. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although ''OED'' accepts Granholm's definition and credits him with the invention, examples of its use before the 1960s exist.

A source of some confusion has been Granholm's jocular citation of the wholly fictitious lexicographer, Phineas Burling, of the firm "Fink and Wiggles" (for [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]]) as confirming the Germanic origin of the word.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing. Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company, Inc. Fink and Wiggles are, of course, the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY. According to Burling, the word "kludge" first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds. It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between King's Lynn (then Bishop's Lynn) and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields.

The word "kludge" is, according to Burling, derived from the same root as the German "klug" (Dutch ''kloog'', Swedish ''Klag'', Danish ''Klog'', Gothic ''Klaugen'', Lettish ''Kladnis'' and Sanskrit ''Veklaunn''), originally meaning "smart" or "witty". In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth, the word "Kludge" eventually came to mean "not so smart" or "pretty ridiculous". Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is, "An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole."

It is in this latter sense that "Kludge" is used by computer hardware men. Today "kludge" forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology, and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the 220 VAC source. The building of a Kludge, however, is not work for amateurs. There is a certain, indefinable, masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building. The professional can spot it instantly. The amateur may readily presume that "that's the way computers are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Claims about derivation from the German adjective ''{{lang|de|klug}}'' ("clever") are unlikely for the following reasons:
* There is no equivalent usage in German
* Both pronunciations of the word contain the [[soft G|soft "g"]] ({{ipa|[[dʒ]]}}), which is not present in German
* The word emerges in English only in the 20th century

=== Yiddish ===
American [[Yiddish]] speakers use ''{{transl|yi|klug}}'' ({{lang|yi|{{linktext|קלוג}}}}) to mean "too smart by half", the reflected meaning of German ''{{lang|de|klug}}'' ("clever").  This may explain the idea of clever but clumsy and temporary, as well as the  pronunciation variation from German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/|title=Yiddish Dictionary Online ייִדיש װערטערבוך אַפֿן װעב|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European surname ===
It may instead derive from the mispronunciation of European surname Kluge (be that German, Dutch or Scandinavian). Even if Burling's etymology were true, it is doubtful that the American military or computer engineers, who began using the term in the 20th century, could have been aware of a term that had fallen from use in East Anglia sometime in the preceding 400 years.

This ''OED2'' entry also includes the verb ''kludge'' ("to improvise with a kludge or kludges") and ''kludgemanship'' ("skill in designing or applying kludges").

=== Military jargon ===
The [[Jargon File]] (a.k.a. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary''), which is a [[glossary]] of computer programmer slang maintained by [[Eric S. Raymond]], differentiates ''kludge'' from ''kluge'' and cites usage examples predating 1962.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''kludge'''
# /kluhj/ n. Incorrect (though regrettably common) spelling of ''kluge'' (US). These two words have been confused in American usage since the early 1960s, and widely confounded in Great Britain since the end of World War II.
# [TMRC] A ''crock'' that works. (A long-ago ''Datamation'' article by Jackson Granholme {{sic}} similarly said: "An ill-assorted collection of poorly matching parts, forming a distressing whole.")
# v. To use a kludge to get around a problem. "I've kludged around it for now, but I'll fix it up properly later."&lt;ref name="jargon"&gt;{{cite web
|title=The Jargon File
|author=Eric S. Raymond
|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/K/kludge.html
|accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This Jargon File entry notes ''kludge'' apparently derives via British military slang from [[Scots language|Scots]] ''cludge'' or ''cludgie''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=cludgie&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=both SND Cludgie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=4749&amp;startset=1107921&amp;query=CLUDGIE&amp;fhit=cludgie&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=sndn#fhit SND Cludie]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "a common toilet", and became confused with U.S. ''kluge'' during or after World War II.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''kluge''': /klooj/ [from the German 'klug', clever; poss. related to Polish &amp; Russian 'klucz' (a key, a hint, a main point)]
# n. A [[Rube Goldberg]] (or [[Heath Robinson]]) device, whether in hardware or software.
# n. A clever programming trick intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient, if not clear, manner. Often used to repair bugs. Often involves ad-hockery and verges on being a crock.
# n. Something that works for the wrong reason.
# vt. To insert a kluge into a program. "I've kluged this routine to get around that weird bug, but there's probably a better way."
# &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Worcester Polytechnic Institute|WPI]]] n. A feature that is implemented in a rude manner.&lt;ref name="jargon"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This entry notes ''kluge'', which is now often spelled ''kludge'', "was the original spelling, reported around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used exclusively of hardware kluges". The Jargon File gives possible etymologies from [[navy|naval]] slang (cf. [[jury rig]]) or printing equipment.

''Kluge'' "was common Navy slang in the [[World War II]] era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea". A 1947 article in the ''New York Folklore Quarterly'' recorded the classic [[shaggy dog story]] "'Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces, in which a 'kluge' was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function."&lt;ref name="folklore"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Folklore from G. I. Joe, New York Folklore Quarterly
|volume=III, No. 4
|pages=285–297
|author=Agnes Nolan Underwood
|date=Winter 1947
|publisher=New York Folklore Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''kluge'' as an overcomplicated or obscure contraption dates back at least to 1947, as evidenced by the article in the ''New York Folklore Quarterly'',&lt;ref name="folklore"/&gt; but the term must have been in use long before that for the story to have any sense. The following purports to be a summary of the original article that is somewhat more complete than the one quoted above:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On being drafted into the navy, Murgatroyd gave his profession as "kluge maker". Not wanting to seem ignorant, the clerk simply wrote this down. Whenever Murgatroyd was asked what he was doing, he said he was making a kluge, and actually he was one of the world's best kluge makers. Not wanting to seem ignorant, his superiors kept giving him commendations and promotions, until he reached the dizzy heights of commodore.

One day the admiral came to inspect the ship. When Murgatroyd explained he was a kluge maker, the admiral asked him what a kluge was&amp;nbsp;– the first person ever to do so. Murgatroyd said it was hard to explain, but he would make one so the admiral could see what it was. After a couple of days, he returned with a complex object.

"Interesting," said the admiral, "but what does it do?" In reply, Murgatroyd dropped it over the side of the ship. As the thing sank, it went "kluge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://our-local.co.uk/index.php?topic=23170.5;wap2|title=Obsolete Occupations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Jargon File further includes ''kluge around'' "to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge", ''kluge up'' "to lash together a quick hack to perform a task". After Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article popularized the ''kluge'' variant ''kludge'', both were interchangeably used and confused. The Jargon File concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as 'kludge'. ... British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's meaning. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Paper feeder ===

Another hypothesis dates to 1907, "when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from [[Oslo, Norway]] named Abel and Eneval Kluge to service and install presses for his fledgling printing equipment firm". In 1919, the brothers invented an automatic feeder for printing presses which, by 1929, allowed Brandtjen and Kluge to move into a 3-story building in St. Paul, MN. While the automatic feeder was a success, unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being "temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair&amp;nbsp;— but oh, so clever!" The Kluge brothers continued to innovate, and the company remained active as of 2017. Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name, it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions. The Free Online Dictionary of Computing (FOLDOC) claims that the term kluge "was used in connection with computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, was used exclusively for ''hardware'' kluges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/kluge|title=FOLDOC – Computing Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin. FOLDOC goes on to say, "[[TMRC]] and the MIT hacker culture of the early 1960s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military slang (see also [[foobar]]). It seems likely that 'kluge' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects run in Cambridge during the war (many in MIT's venerable [[Building 20]], which housed TMRC until the building was demolished in 1999)." This would explain the term's introduction to the software community.

This explanation points to a Norwegian surname as the source, with no connection to German.

=== Acronym ===

Other suggested [[folk etymologies]] or [[backronyms]] for ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' is from '''k'''lumsy, '''l'''ame, '''u'''gly, '''d'''umb, but '''g'''ood '''e'''nough, or '''k'''lutzy '''l'''ashup, '''u'''nder-'''g'''oing '''e'''ngineering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The term ''kludge'' would then seem to have independent origins, possibly in Britain. The terms tended to merge because of their similar pronunciations and meanings. However, ''kluge'' seems to have the sense of overcomplicated, while ''kludge'' has only the sense of poorly done.

Cf. German {{lang|de|{{linktext|Kloß}}}} ("clod", diminutive {{lang|de|Klößchen}}), [[Low German|Low Saxon]] ''klut'', ''klute'', Dutch {{lang|nl|kluit}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi-bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=Adelung&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;hitlist=&amp;patternlist=&amp;lemid=DK01431|title=Wörterbuchnetz – Grammatisch-Kritisches Wörterbuch der Hochdeutschen Mundart|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps related to Low German diminutive ''klütje'' ("dumpling, clod"), Danish [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutland dial.]] ''klyt'' ("piece of bad workmanship, kludge"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Aage|title=Et par etymologier|journal=Danske Studier|year=1926|pages=90|url=http://danskestudier.dk/materiale/1926.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2011|editor1-first=Gunnar|editor1-last=Knudsen|editor2-first=Marius|editor2-last=Kristensen|publisher=Nordisk Forlag|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Standard [[Danish language|Danish]] {{lang|da|kludder}} ("mess, disorder").

== Industries ==

=== Aerospace engineering ===
In [[aerospace]], a kludge was a temporary design using separate commonly available components that were not flightworthy in order to proof the design and enable concurrent software development while the integrated components were developed and manufactured. The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', a 1969 film. Dialog between space crew and Ted approximately 30 minutes into the movie, following capsule power down. Ted says, "I'm in Huntsville kludging up a simulator of the XRV." The film was based on the [[Marooned (novel)|1964 novel]] of the same name.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the ultimate kludge was the first [[United States|US]] [[space station]], [[Skylab]]. Its two major components, the Saturn Workshop and the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], began development as separate projects (the SWS was kludged from the [[S-IVB]] stage of the [[Saturn 1B]] and [[Saturn V]] launch vehicles, the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]). Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the [[Apollo Applications Program]], but the components were to have been launched separately, then docked in orbit. In the final design, the SWS and ATM were launched together, but for the single-launch concept to work, the ATM had to pivot 90 degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation, clearing the way for the crew to dock its [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter.

The Airlock Module's manufacturer, [[McDonnell Douglas]], even recycled the hatch design from its [[Project Gemini|Gemini spacecraft]] and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module. The Skylab project, managed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later [[Johnson Space Center]]) as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight.  Thus, MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project, calling it "the kludge".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Computer science ===
In modern [[computer science|computing]] terminology, a "kludge" (or often a "'''hack'''") is a solution to a problem, doing a task, or fixing a system that is inefficient, inelegant ("hacky") or even unfathomable, but which nevertheless (more or less) works. To "kludge around something" is to avoid a [[Computer bug|bug]] or some difficult condition by building a kludge, perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation. It is somewhat similar in spirit to a [[workaround]], only without the grace. A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished, without having to make fundamental changes. Sometimes the kludge is introduced in order to keep backwards compatibility, but often it is simply introduced because the kludge is an easier alternative. Note that a hack might be a kludge, but that ''hack'' could be, at least in computing, ironic praise, for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Kidder
|first=Tracey
|title=[[The Soul of a New Machine]]
|publisher=Avon
|year=1982
|isbn=978-0-380-59931-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge; this is essentially a kind of [[cruft]].

Something might be a kludge if it fails in [[corner case]]s, but this is a less common sense, as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage. More commonly, a kludge is a poorly working [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] which was expected to work adequately. An intimate knowledge of the context (i.e., problem domain and/or the kludge's execution environment) is typically required to build a corner case kludge. As a consequence, they are sometimes ironically praised.

An anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1960s. The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work. Rather than setting up a timing system, the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long, increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination.{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}}

A variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a [[computer program]]. Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it, the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates. For example, if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area, add code which divides by two when it is used, after the original code has been executed.

In computer networking, use of [[Network address translation|NAT]] (Network Address Translation) (RFC 1918) or [[Port address translation|PAT]] (Port Address Translation) to cope with the  shortage of [[Internet Protocol|IPv4]] addresses is an example of a kludge.

In [[FidoNet]] terminology, ''kludge'' refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message.

=== Evolutionary neuroscience ===
{{see also|Evolutionary baggage}}
The ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' metaphor has been adapted in fields such as [[evolutionary neuroscience]], particularly in reference to the [[human brain]].

The neuroscientist [[David Linden]] discusses how [[intelligent design]] proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The transcendent aspects of our human experience, the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core, were not given to us by a Great Engineer. These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain. Rather, at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche. The things we hold highest in our human experience (love, memory, dreams, and a predisposition for religious thought) result from a particular agglomeration of ad hoc solutions that have been piled on through millions of years of evolution history. It's not that we have fundamentally human thoughts and feelings ''despite'' the kludgy design of the brain as molded by the twists and turns of evolutionary history. Rather, we have them precisely ''because'' of that history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-674-02478-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The research psychologist [[Gary Marcus]]'s book ''Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind'' compares evolutionary kluges with engineering ones like [[manifold vacuum]]-powered [[windshield wipers]]&amp;nbsp;– when you accelerated or drove uphill, "Your wipers slowed to a crawl, or even stopped working altogether."

&lt;blockquote&gt;For instance, the vertebrate eye's [[retina]] that is installed backward, facing the back of the head rather than the front. As a result, all kinds of stuff gets in its way, including a bunch of wiring that passes through the eye and leaves us with a pair of [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]s, one in each eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Other uses ==
In the science fiction television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'', genetically engineered human beings called [[Nietzschean (Andromeda)|Nietzschean]]s use the term disparagingly to refer to genetically unmodified humans.

In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s 1985 short story "Press Enter_", the antagonist, a reclusive hacker with unprecedented access to many databases, adopts the identity Charles Kluge.

In a 2012 article, the political scientist Steven Teles used the term "kludgeocracy" to criticize the complexity of social welfare policy in the United States. In the paper, Teles argues that institutional and political obstacles to passing legislation often drives policy makers to accept temporary, imperfect, fixes rather than carefully thought out reforms. &lt;ref name="teles_2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teles|first1=Steven M.|title=Kludgeocracy in America|url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/kludgeocracy-in-america|journal=[[National Affairs]] |date=Fall 2017|issue=33|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawler_2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawler|first1=Joseph|title=Steven Teles Explains "Kludgeocracy"|url=http://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2012/12/14/steven_teles_explains_kludgeocracy_378.html|accessdate=19 November 2017|agency=Real Clear Policy|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mariela Castro Espín''' (born 27 July 1962) is the director of the [[Cuban National Center for Sex Education]] in Havana and an activist for [[LGBT rights in Cuba]]. She is the daughter of former Cuban president [[Raúl Castro]] and feminist and revolutionary [[Vilma Espín]], and the niece of former president [[Fidel Castro]].

==Early life==
[[File:Mariela Castro 2010 Hamburg.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Mariela Castro at the 2010 [[Pride parade]] in [[Hamburg]]]]
Mariela Castro is the daughter of former Cuban president [[Raúl Castro]] and feminist and revolutionary [[Vilma Espín]], and the niece of former president [[Fidel Castro]]. She has a brother, [[Alejandro Castro Espín]].{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==Career==
Her group campaigns for effective [[AIDS]] prevention as well as recognition and acceptance of [[LGBT rights|LGBT human rights]]. In 2005, she proposed a project to allow [[transgender]] people to receive [[sex reassignment surgery]] and change their legal gender. The measure became law in June 2008 which allows sex change surgery for Cubans without charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7441448.stm BBC NEWS | Americas | Cuba to provide free sex-change&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariela Castro is president of the Cuban Multidisciplinary Centre for the Study of Sexuality, president of the National Commission for Treatment of Disturbances of Gender Identity, member of the Direct Action Group for Preventing, Confronting, and Combatting AIDS, and an executive member of the [[World Association for Sexual Health]] (WAS). She is also the director of the journal ''[[Sexología y Sociedad]]'', a magazine of Sexology edited by her own National Center for Sex Education (CENESEX).

Castro has published 13 scholarly articles and nine books.&lt;ref&gt;Official programme of the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro is a sitting member of the [[National Assembly of People's Power]].&lt;ref name=no&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/mariela-castro-raul-no-vote-discrimination "Raúl Castro's daughter first lawmaker to vote 'no' in Cuban parliament"]. ''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; When the assembly voted in 2014 to ban [[discrimination]] on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, Castro opposed the legislation because it did not also include protection on the basis of [[gender identity]],&lt;ref name=no/&gt; and became possibly the first legislator in the body's history ever to vote against a piece of legislation.&lt;ref name=no/&gt;

==Personal life==
Castro is married to Italian Paolo Titolo, General Manager of Amorim Negócios Internacionais, S.A. in Cuba,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/paolo-titolo/41/9b2/130 Paolo Titolo] on [[LinkedIn]]&lt;/ref&gt; and has two children with him, and a daughter from her previous marriage with the Chilean former [[FPMR]] member Juan Gutiérrez Fischmann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/fidel/castro-family.htm Castro's Family Miami Herald Oct 8 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research''' ({{lang-it|Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri}}) is a nonprofit research institute dedicated to clinical and [[biomedical research]]. It was made possible by a special bequest of Milan philanthropist [[:it:Mario Negri|Mario Negri]] (1891 – 1960). It was founded in 1961 although it started working in [[Milan]] from 1st Feb 1963. There are branches of the institute in Bergamo, Ranica (BG), and at Santa Maria Imbaro, near Chieti.

Founder and director from 1961 is prof. [[:it:Silvio Garattini|Silvio Garattini]].

In neuroscience, the '''mass action principle''' suggests that the proportion of the brain that is injured is directly proportional to the decreased ability of memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rutherford|first1=Raymond E. Fancher, Alexandra|title=Pioneers of psychology : a history|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393935301|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, memory cannot be localized to a single cortical area, but is instead distributed throughout the cortex. This theory is contrasted by [[functional specialization (brain)|functional specialization]]. This is one of two principles that [[Karl Lashley]] published in 1950, alongside the [[equipotentiality]] principle.

==Early theories==

In the 19th century, animal researchers and scientists were divided into two main groups in terms of how they believe the brain compensated for induced brain damage. The redundancy theorists hypothesized that any lesioned section of cerebral mass had an almost duplicate section, usually on the opposing hemisphere. This "back-up" area was considered to be what takes over the functions of the lesioned area. On the other hand, vicariation theorists believed that different areas of the brain with different functions could assume responsibility for the affected area. Both ideas were highly debated and led to increased research on [[neuroplasticity]] and lesion research, eventually affecting the lesion research of [[Jean Pierre Flourens|Flourens]] and Lashley.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Contributors==

Localization theories can be dated as far back as Aristotle, but the man credited with the beginning concepts of field theory was [[Jean Pierre Flourens]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Field theory is the concept that the brain acts as a single functional unit.  He devised the first principle of mass action, stating,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"As long as not too much of the lobes is removed, they may in due time regain the exercise of their functions. Passing certain limits, however, the animal regains them only imperfectly, and passing these new limits it does not regain them at all. Finally, if one sensation comes back, all come back. If one faculty reappears, they all reappear.... This shows that each of these organs is only a single organ."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also developed the theory of [[equipotentiality]], stating, "All sensations, all perceptions, and all volition occupy concurrently the same seat in these organs. The faculty of sensation, perception, and volition is then essentially one faculty."&lt;ref name=tizard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=TIZARD|first1=B|title=Theories of brain localization from Flourens to Lashley.|journal=Medical History|date=April 1959|volume=3|issue=2|pages=132–45|pmid=13643147|doi=10.1017/s0025727300024418|pmc=1034464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Lashley]]'s most famous research was an attempt to find the parts of the brain that were responsible for learning and memory traces, a hypothetical structure he called the [[engram (neuropsychology)|engram]]. He trained rats to perform specific tasks (seeking a food reward), then lesioned varying portions of the rats' cortexes, either before or after the animals received the training depending upon the experiment. The amount of cortical tissue removed had specific effects on acquisition and retention of knowledge, but the location of the removed cortex had no effect on the rats' performance in the maze. This led Lashley to conclude that memories are not localized but widely distributed across the cortex.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Mass action principle versus functional specialization==
There is evidence supporting both the mass action principle and functional specialization within the brain. Functional specialization is the idea that functions are localized within the brain and can only be carried out by particular area(s) of the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Some tasks appear to work on the mass action principle, with lesions causing less drastic effects than would be expected if the tasks were localized within the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} This was shown in Lashley's rat maze experiments, in which the amount of tissue removed was more important to the rat's performance than where the tissue was removed from within the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} There are, however, examples of highly specialized areas of the brain in which even small amounts of damage can cause dramatic effects on people's abilities to perform certain tasks. Two such areas effect the comprehension of speech and the ability to produce coherent speech, Wernicke's area and Broca's area, respectively.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Criticisms==
It is now believed that Flourens may have removed more than just the parts of the hemispheres that he claimed because his experiments can be replicated without his same drastic results.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} At the time, extraction methods were very crude and little was understood about the stages of recovery. These things contributed to the increased likelihood of symptoms occurring right after extraction to be attributed directly to the site of the lesion.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
Flourens' doctrine was widely accepted even though there were anatomists and physiologists disproving his ideas:

* [[Thomas Willis]] showed that there are nerves that connect the heart, lungs, and stomach to the cerebellum.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[François Pourfour du Petit]] demonstrated that localization of motor movements on one side of the body was contained in the hemisphere on the opposite side. In the 1860s, [[Hughlings Jackson]] also came to these conclusions after connecting convulsions on one side of the body to the disease of the opposite side of the brain{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[Alexander Bain]] explained the nervous system as a sort of interconnected system with the brain that transmits impulses{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* New experiments on [[electrical excitability]] in 1870 from [[Gustav Theodor Fritsch]], [[Eduard Hitzig]], and [[David Ferrier]] contributed to new findings regarding localization of function. And although their methods were still producing results that are considered off the mark today, they were important in building a foundation of support for a localization theory{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* Then Lashley came along with his publication of ''Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence'' in 1929. His findings were under the umbrella of field theory, but he didn't completely agree with Flourens. He determined that only the more elementary functions are localized, with the more complex ones not being bound to certain structures. [[Shepherd Ivory Franz]] contributed to this field greatly by using better methods to study live animals. Lashley used these methods in combination with a large sample of animals to get results that can be statistically analyzed, and therefore came up with his equipotentiality and mass action theories. However, many others came up with different conclusions based on his results that again cast doubt upon Lashley's determinations of what was observed.&lt;ref name=tizard/&gt;

==Conclusion==
Currently mass action principle is accepted as a mechanism for some functions within the brain. However, there have been some functions that are believed to be contained within specific areas of the brain (many related to speech, which was impossible to determine when the mass action principle was theorized, as experiments historically only used animals). It does not appear that this difference is determined by difficulty of the function, as some highly specialized tasks are localized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19537">'''Mathematical finance''', also known as '''quantitative finance''', is a field of [[applied mathematics]], concerned with mathematical modeling of [[financial market]]s. Generally, mathematical finance will derive and extend the [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] or [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory, taking observed market prices as input. Mathematical consistency is required, not compatibility with economic theory. Thus, for example, while a [[financial economist]] might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain [[share price]], a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given, and attempt to use [[stochastic calculus]] to obtain the corresponding value of [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s of the [[stock]] (''see: [[Valuation of options]]; [[Financial modeling#Quantitative finance|Financial modeling]]; [[Asset pricing]]''). The [[fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing]] is one of the key theorems in mathematical finance, while the [[Black–Scholes]] equation and formula are amongst the key results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Tim|title=What is financial mathematics?|url=http://plus.maths.org/content/what-financial-mathematics|publisher=+Plus Magazine|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the fields of [[computational finance]] and [[financial engineering]]. The latter focuses on applications and modeling, often by help of [[stochastic asset model]]s (''see: [[Quantitative analyst]]''), while the former focuses, in addition to analysis, on building tools of implementation for the models. In general, there exist two separate branches of finance that require advanced quantitative techniques: derivatives pricing on the one hand, and [[risk management|risk-]] and [[Investment management#Investment managers and portfolio structures|portfolio management]] on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantitative Finance|url=http://finance.laws.com/quantitative-finance|publisher=About.com|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French mathematician [[Louis Bachelier]] is considered the author of the first scholarly work on mathematical finance, published in 1900. But mathematical finance emerged as a discipline in the 1970s, following the work of [[Fischer Black]], [[Myron Scholes]] and [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]] on option pricing theory.

Today many universities offer degree and research programs in mathematical finance.

==History: Q versus P==
There are two separate branches of finance that require advanced quantitative techniques: derivatives pricing, and risk and portfolio management. One of the main differences is that they use different probabilities, namely the risk-neutral probability (or arbitrage-pricing probability), denoted by "Q", and the actual (or actuarial) probability, denoted by "P".

The goal of derivatives pricing is to determine the fair price of a given security in terms of more [[market liquidity|liquid securities]] whose price is determined by the law of [[supply and demand]]. The meaning of "fair" depends, of course, on whether one considers buying or selling the security. Examples of securities being priced are [[option (finance)|plain vanilla]] and [[exotic options]], [[convertible bonds]], etc.

Once a fair price has been determined, the sell-side trader can make a market on the security. Therefore, derivatives pricing is a complex "extrapolation" exercise to define the current market value of a security, which is then used by the sell-side community. 
Quantitative derivatives pricing was initiated by [[Louis Bachelier]] in ''The Theory of Speculation'' ("Théorie de la spéculation", published 1900), with the introduction of the most basic and most influential of processes, the [[Brownian motion]], and its applications to the pricing of options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53289874|title=Stochastic calculus for finance|last=E.|first=Shreve, Steven|date=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780387401003|location=New York|oclc=53289874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868286679|title=Introduction to Quantitative Finance.|last=Stephen.|first=Blyth,|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=|isbn=9780199666591|location=|pages=157|oclc=868286679}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brownian motion is derived using the [[Langevin equation]] and the discrete [[random walk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57743436|title=Quantitative finance for physicists : an introduction|last=B.|first=Schmidt, Anatoly|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|isbn=9780080492209|location=San Diego, Calif.|oclc=57743436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelier modeled the [[time series]] of changes in the [[logarithm]] of stock prices as a [[random walk]] in which the short-term changes had a finite [[variance]]. This causes longer-term changes to follow a [[Gaussian distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bachelir|first=Louis|title=The Theory of Speculation|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5LLDy7-d3SKNGI0M2E0NGItYzFlMS00NGU2LWE2ZDAtODc3MDY3MzdiNmY0/edit?hl=en_GB&amp;pli=1|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory remained dormant until [[Fischer Black]] and [[Myron Scholes]], along with fundamental contributions by [[Robert C. Merton]], applied the second most influential process, the [[geometric Brownian motion]], to [[option pricing]]. For this M. Scholes and R. Merton were awarded the 1997 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. Black was ineligible for the prize because of his death in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindbeck|first=Assar|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1969-2007|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/economic-sciences/lindbeck/index.html|publisher=Nobel Prize|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next important step was the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]] by Harrison and Pliska (1981), according to which the suitably normalized current price ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a security is arbitrage-free, and thus truly fair, only if there exists a [[stochastic process]] ''P&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' with constant [[expected value]] which describes its future evolution:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Angus|title=A risky business: How to price derivatives|url=http://plus.maths.org/content/risky-business-how-price-derivatives|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=Price+ Magazine|date=1 Dec 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_{0} = \mathbf{E}_{0} (P_{t}) &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}} }}
A process satisfying ({{EquationNote|1}}) is called a "martingale". A martingale does not reward risk. Thus the probability of the normalized security price process is called "risk-neutral" and is typically denoted by the [[Blackboard bold|blackboard font]] letter "&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;".

The relationship ({{EquationNote|1}}) must hold for all times t: therefore the processes used for derivatives pricing are naturally set in continuous time.

The [[Quantitative analyst|quants]] who operate in the Q world of derivatives pricing are specialists with deep knowledge of the specific products they model.

Securities are priced individually, and thus the problems in the Q world are low-dimensional in nature.
Calibration is one of the main challenges of the Q world: once a continuous-time parametric process has been calibrated to a set of traded securities through a relationship such as (1), a similar relationship is used to define the price of new derivatives.

The main quantitative tools necessary to handle continuous-time Q-processes are [[Itō calculus|Itō’s stochastic calculus]], [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|simulation]] and [[partial differential equations]] (PDE’s).

Risk and portfolio management aims at modeling the statistically derived probability distribution of the market prices of all the securities at a given future investment horizon. &lt;br /&gt;
This "real" probability distribution of the market prices is typically denoted by the blackboard font letter "&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt;", as opposed to the "risk-neutral" probability "&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;" used in derivatives pricing. Based on the P distribution, the buy-side community takes decisions on which securities to purchase in order to improve the prospective profit-and-loss profile of their positions considered as a portfolio.

For their pioneering work, Markowitz and Sharpe, along with Merton Miller, shared the 1990 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], for the first time ever awarded for a work in finance.

The portfolio-selection work of Markowitz and Sharpe introduced mathematics to [[investment management]]. With time, the mathematics has become more sophisticated. Thanks to Robert Merton and Paul Samuelson, one-period models were replaced by continuous time, [[Brownian Model of Financial Markets|Brownian-motion models]], and the quadratic utility function implicit in mean–variance optimization was replaced by more general increasing, concave utility functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karatzas|first1=Ioannis|last2=Shreve|first2=Steve|title=Methods of Mathematical Finance|location=Secaucus, NJ, USA|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, Incorporated|year=1998|isbn=9780387948393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in more recent years the focus shifted toward estimation risk, i.e., the dangers of incorrectly assuming that advanced time series analysis alone can provide completely accurate estimates of the market parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meucci|first1=Attilio|title=Risk and Asset Allocation|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9783642009648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much effort has gone into the study of financial markets and how prices vary with time. [[Charles Dow]], one of the founders of [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] and [[The Wall Street Journal]], enunciated a set of ideas on the subject which are now called [[Dow Theory]]. This is the basis of the so-called [[technical analysis]] method of attempting to predict future changes. One of the tenets of "technical analysis" is that [[market trends]] give an indication of the future, at least in the short term. The claims of the technical analysts are disputed by many academics.

== Criticism ==
{{See also| Financial economics#Challenges and criticism| Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering|Financial engineering#Criticisms}}
Over the years, increasingly sophisticated mathematical models and derivative pricing strategies have been developed, but their credibility was damaged by the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]].
Contemporary practice of mathematical finance has been subjected to criticism from figures within the field notably by [[Paul Wilmott]], and by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], in his book [[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|''The Black Swan'']].&lt;ref name="Black Swan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taleb|first1=Nassim Nicholas|authorlink=Nassim Nicholas Taleb|year=2007|title=The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable|publisher=Random House Trade|isbn=978-1-4000-6351-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb claims that the prices of financial assets cannot be characterized by the simple models currently in use, rendering much of current practice at best irrelevant, and, at worst, dangerously misleading. Wilmott and [[Emanuel Derman]] published the ''[[Financial Modelers' Manifesto]]'' in January 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2009/1/8/Financial-Modelers-Manifesto|publisher=Paul Wilmott's Blog|title=Financial Modelers' Manifesto|date=January 8, 2009|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses some of the most serious concerns.
Bodies such as the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]] are now attempting to develop new theories and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cfb9c43a-48b7-11df-8af4-00144feab49a.html |title=Mathematicians must get out of their ivory towers |author=Gillian Tett |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, modeling the changes by distributions with finite variance is, increasingly, said to be inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Svetlozar T. Rachev|author2=[[Frank J. Fabozzi]]|author3=Christian Menn|year=2005|title=Fat-Tailed and Skewed Asset Return Distributions: Implications for Risk Management, Portfolio Selection, and Option Pricing |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |isbn=978-0471718864 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s it was discovered by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] that changes in prices do not follow a [[Gaussian distribution]], but are rather modeled better by Lévy alpha-[[stable distribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benoit Mandelbrot|B. Mandelbrot]], [http://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/341Fa09/econ/Mandelbroit_VariationCertainSpeculativePrices.pdf "The variation of certain Speculative Prices"], ''The Journal of Business'' 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of change, or volatility, depends on the length of the time interval to a [[power law|power]] a bit more than 1/2. Large changes up or down are more likely than what one would calculate using a Gaussian distribution with an estimated [[standard deviation]]. But the problem is that it does not solve the problem as it makes parametrization much harder and risk control less reliable.&lt;ref name="Black Swan" /&gt; See also [[Variance gamma process #Option pricing]].

The '''Max Planck Institute for Physics''' (MPP) is a [[physics]] institute in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] that specializes in [[high energy physics]] and [[astroparticle physics]]. It is part of the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft]] and is also known as the [[Werner Heisenberg]] Institute, after its first director in its current location.

The founding of the institute traces back to 1914, as an idea from [[Fritz Haber]], [[Walther Nernst]], [[Max Planck]], [[Emil Warburg]], [[Heinrich Rubens]]. On October 1, 1917, the institute was officially founded in Berlin as ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics|Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik]]'' (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) with [[Albert Einstein]] as the first head director.&lt;ref name=MPIP-history&gt;"[https://www.mpp.mpg.de/institut/Geschichte/01_Ubersicht/index.html Geschichte]" (in German). Max Planck Institute for Physics. Abbreviated version in English: "[https://www.mpp.mpg.de/english/institute/instGeschichte/Overview/index.html History]." Retrieved  2015-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1922, [[Max von Laue]] succeeded Einstein as managing director. Einstein gave up his position as a director of the institute in April 1933.&lt;ref name=MPIP-history/&gt; The Institute took part in the [[German nuclear weapon project]] from 1939-1942.&lt;ref name=MPIP-history/&gt; 

A year after the end of fighting in Europe in World War II, the institute was moved to [[Göttingen]] and renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics, with Heisenberg continuing as managing director. In 1946, [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] and [[Karl Wirtz]] joined the faculty as the directors for theoretical and experimental physics, respectively.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In June 1942, [[Werner Heisenberg]] took over as managing director.&lt;ref name=MPIP-history/&gt; In 1955 the institute made the decision to move to Munich, and soon after began construction of its current building, designed by [[Sep Ruf]]. The institute moved into its current location on September 1, 1958 and took on the new name the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics, still with Heisenberg as the managing director. In 1991, the institute was split into the Max Planck Institute for Physics, the [[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]] and the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]].

The '''National Botanical Research Institute''' ('''NBRI''') is a research institute of [[CSIR India|CSIR]] in [[Lucknow]]. It is engaged in the field of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and modern [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.nbri-lko.org/ | title=NBRI Webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally conceptualised and set up as the National Botanic Gardens (NBG) by Professor [[Kailas Nath Kaul]] on behalf of the State Government of [[Uttar Pradesh]], it was taken over by the CSIR in 1953. Dr [[Triloki Nath Khoshoo]] joined in 1964 as the Assistant Director, shortly afterwards becoming the Director. Initially engaged in research work in the classical botanical disciplines, the NBG went on laying an increasing emphasis in keeping with the national needs and priorities in the field of plant sciences, on its applied and developmental research activities. Due to the untiring efforts of Dr [[Triloki Nath Khoshoo|Khoshoo]], the institute rose to the stature of being the National Botanical Research Institute in 1978, reflecting the correct nature and extent of its aims and objectives, functions and R &amp; D activities. [[Sikandar Bagh]] is a famous and historic pleasure garden, located in the grounds of the Institute.

==Achievements==
* NBRI developed a new variety of [[bougainvillea]], named Los Banos Variegata-Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=92149910-6ba1-4841-ae84-8bd718b72699&amp;&amp;Headline=Scientists+develop+new+variety+of+bougainvillea&amp;strParent=strParentID | title = Scientists develop new variety of bougainvillea | accessdate = 2008-08-11 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080916151019/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=92149910-6ba1-4841-ae84-8bd718b72699&amp;&amp;Headline=Scientists+develop+new+variety+of+bougainvillea&amp;strParent=strParentID | archivedate = 2008-09-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">'''Neo-Fauvism''' was a poetic style of painting from the mid-1920s proposed as a challenge to [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref name=grant&gt;Grant, Kim. ''Surrealism and the Visual Arts: Theory and Reception'', [http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521836555&amp;ss=exc Introduction]. Cambridge University Press 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-521-83655-5}}, {{ISBN|0-521-83655-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The magazine ''Cahiers d'Art'' was launched in 1926 and its writers mounted a challenge to the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] practice of [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] by seeing it not in terms of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] expression, but as another development of traditional artistry. They identified a group of artists as the exponents of this and termed them Neo-Fauves.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;

Although these artists were later mostly forgotten, the movement had an effect of disillusioning the Surrealist group with the technique of graphic automatism as a revolutionary means of by-passing conventional aesthetics, ideology and commercialism.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; 

Neo-Fauvism has been seen as the last trend within painting that could be marketed as a coherent style.&lt;ref name=GoetheInsitut&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm Goethe-Institut], retrieved 10 June 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822212258/http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm |date=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''one-electron universe''' postulate, proposed by [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] in a telephone call to [[Richard Feynman]] in the spring of 1940, hypothesises that all [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s are actually manifestations of a single entity moving backwards and forwards in time. According to Feynman:

{{cquote|I received a telephone call one day at the graduate college at Princeton from Professor Wheeler, in which he said, "Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass" "Why?" "Because, they are all the same electron!"&lt;ref name=Feynman1965&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html | title= Nobel Lecture |date= 11 December 1965 | publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|author=Richard Feynman}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Overview==
The idea is based on the [[world line]]s traced out across [[spacetime]] by every electron. Rather than have myriad such lines, Wheeler suggested that they could all be parts of one single line like a huge tangled knot, traced out by the one electron. Any given moment in time is represented by a slice across spacetime, and would meet the knotted line a great many times. Each such meeting point represents a real electron at that moment.

At those points, half the lines will be directed forward in time and half will have looped round and be directed backwards. Wheeler suggested that these backwards sections appeared as the [[antiparticle]] to the electron, the positron.

Many more electrons have been observed than positrons, and electrons are thought to comfortably outnumber them. According to Feynman he raised this issue with Wheeler, who speculated that the missing positrons might be hidden within [[proton]]s.&lt;ref name=Feynman1965/&gt;

Feynman was struck by Wheeler's insight that antiparticles could be represented by reversed world lines, and credits this to Wheeler, saying in his Nobel speech:

{{cquote|I did not take the idea that all the electrons were the same one from [Wheeler] as seriously as I took the observation that positrons could simply be represented as electrons going from the future to the past in a back section of their world lines. That, I stole!&lt;ref name=Feynman1965/&gt;}}

Feynman later proposed this interpretation of the [[positron]] as an electron moving backward in time in his 1949 paper "The Theory of Positrons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feynman |first=Richard |title=The Theory of Positrons |journal=Physical Review |issue=6 |date=1949 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749 |volume=76 |pages=749–759|bibcode = 1949PhRv...76..749F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yoichiro Nambu]] later applied it to all production and [[annihilation]] of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that "the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nambu |first=Yoichiro |title=The Use of the Proper Time in Quantum Electrodynamics I |journal=Progress in Theoretical Physics |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=82–94 |date=1950|bibcode=1950PThPh...5...82N |doi=10.1143/PTP.5.82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27055">The '''Oort constants''' (discovered by [[Jan Oort]]) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are empirically derived parameters that characterize the local rotational properties of our galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; A=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right) \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; are the rotational velocity and distance to the [[Galactic Center|Galactic center]], respectively, measured at the position of the [[Sun]], and {{var|v}} and {{var|r}} are the velocities and distances at other positions in our part of the galaxy. As derived below, {{var|A}} and {{var|B}} depend only on the motions and positions of stars in the solar neighborhood.  As of 2018, the most accurate values of these constants are '''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = 15.3 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = -11.9 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'''.&lt;ref name="Bovy17"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bovy|first=J.|title=Galactic rotation in Gaia DR1|journal=MNRAS|date=June 2017|volume=468|pages=L63–L67|arxiv=1610.07610|bibcode = 2017MNRAS.468L..63B|doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slx027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the Oort constants, it is possible to determine the [[Astrodynamics|orbital properties]] of the Sun, such as the orbital velocity and [[Orbital period|period]], and infer local properties of the Galactic disk, such as the [[Density|mass density]] and how the rotational velocity changes as a function of radius from the Galactic center.

==Historical significance and background==

By the 1920s, a large fraction of the astronomical community had recognized that some of the diffuse, cloud-like objects, or [[nebulae]], seen in the night sky were collections of [[star]]s located beyond our own, local collection of star clusters. These ''[[Galaxy|galaxies]]'' had diverse morphologies, ranging from ellipsoids to disks. The concentrated band of starlight that is the visible signature of the Milky Way was indicative of a disk structure for our galaxy; however, our location within our galaxy made structural determinations from observations difficult.

[[Classical mechanics]] predicted that a collection of stars could be supported against gravitational collapse by either [[Velocity dispersion|random velocities]] of the stars or their rotation about its center of mass.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 312-321, &amp;sect;4.4, ''Galactic dynamics (2nd edition)'', James Binney, Scott Tremaine, Princeton University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-691-13027-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a disk-shaped collection, the support should be mainly rotational.  Depending on the mass density, or distribution of the mass in the disk, the rotation velocity may be different at each radius from the center of the disk to the outer edge. A plot of these rotational velocities against the radii at which they are measured is called a [[rotation curve]]. For external disk galaxies, one can measure the rotation curve by observing the [[Doppler shift]]s of spectral features measured along different galactic radii, since one side of the galaxy will be moving towards our line of sight and one side away.  However, our position in the Galactic midplane of the Milky Way, where dust in molecular clouds [[Extinction (astronomy)|obscures]] most optical light in many directions, made obtaining our own rotation curve technically difficult until the discovery of the [[21 cm line|21 cm hydrogen line]] in the 1930s.

To confirm the rotation of our galaxy prior to this, in 1927 [[Jan Oort]] derived a way to measure the Galactic rotation from just a small fraction of stars in the local neighborhood.&lt;ref name="oort1927"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = J. H. Oort | journal = Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands | date = 1927-04-14 | volume = 3 | issue = 120 | title = Observational evidence confirming Lindblad's hypothesis of a rotation of the galactic system | pages = 275–282 | postscript = .|bibcode = 1927BAN.....3..275O }}&lt;/ref&gt; As described below, the values he found for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; proved not only that the Galaxy was rotating but also that it rotates [[Differential rotation|differentially]], or as a fluid rather than a solid body.

==Derivation==
[[File:Oort constants derivation diagram.jpg|frame|right|Figure 1: Geometry of the Oort constants derivation, with a field star close to the Sun in the midplane of the Galaxy.]]

Consider a star in the midplane of the Galactic disk with [[Galactic longitude]] &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; at a distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; from the Sun.  Assume that both the star and the Sun have [[circular orbit]]s around the center of the Galaxy at radii of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt; from the [[galactic center]] and rotational velocities of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  The motion of the star along our line of sight, or ''[[radial velocity]]'', and motion of the star across the plane of the sky, or ''[[Proper motion|transverse velocity]]'', as observed from the position of the Sun are then:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=V_{\text{star, r}}-V_{\text{sun, r}}=V\cos\left(\alpha\right)-V_{0}\sin\left(l\right) \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=V_{\text{star, t}}-V_{\text{sun, t}}=V\sin\left(\alpha\right)-V_{0}\cos\left(l\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

With the assumption of circular motion, the rotational velocity is related to the [[angular velocity]] by &lt;math&gt;v=\Omega r&lt;/math&gt; and we can substitute this into the velocity expressions:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=\Omega R\cos\left(\alpha\right)-\Omega_{0}R_{0}\sin\left(l\right) \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=\Omega R\sin\left(\alpha\right)-\Omega_{0}R_{0}\cos\left(l\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From the geometry in Figure 1, one can see that the triangles formed between the galactic center, the Sun, and the star share a side or portions of sides, so the following relationships hold and substitutions can be made:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; R\cos\left(\alpha\right)=R_{0}\sin\left(l\right)   \\
&amp; R\sin\left(\alpha\right)=R_{0}\cos\left(l\right)-d \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and with these we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=\left(\Omega-\Omega_{0}\right)R_{0}\sin\left(l\right)          \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=\left(\Omega-\Omega_{0}\right)R_{0}\cos\left(l\right)-\Omega d \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

To put these expressions only in terms of the known quantities &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, we take a [[Taylor expansion]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega-\Omega_{0}&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;\left(\Omega-\Omega_{0}\right)=\left(R-R_{0}\right)\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}+...&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, we take advantage of the assumption that the stars used for this analysis are ''local'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;R-R_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is small, and the distance d to the star is smaller than &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, and we take:
::&lt;math&gt;R-R_{0}=-d \cdot \cos\left(l\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binney |first=J. |author2=Merrifield, M. |title=Galactic Astronomy |year=1998 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-02565-0 |oclc=39108765}}&lt;/ref&gt;
So:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=-R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}d \cdot \cos\left(l\right)\sin\left(l\right) \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=-R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}d \cdot \cos^{2}\left(l\right)-\Omega d \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the sine and cosine [[List of trigonometric identities#Double-.2C triple-.2C and half-angle formulae|half angle formulae]], these velocities may be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=-R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}d\frac{\sin\left(2l\right)}{2} \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=-R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}d\frac{\left(\cos\left(2l\right)+1\right)}{2}-\Omega d=-R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}d\frac{\cos\left(2l\right)}{2}+\left(-\frac{1}{2}R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}-\Omega\right)d \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Writing the velocities in terms of our known quantities and two coefficients &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=Ad\sin\left(2l\right) \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=Ad\cos\left(2l\right)+Bd \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; A=-\frac{1}{2}R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}} \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}-\Omega \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

At this stage, the observable velocities are related to these coefficients and the position of the star. It is now possible to relate these coefficients to the rotation properties of the galaxy. For a star in a circular orbit, we can express the derivative of the angular velocity with respect to radius in terms of the rotation velocity and radius and evaluate this at the location of the Sun:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; \Omega=\frac{v}{r} \\
&amp; \frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}=\frac{d(v/r)}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}=-\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}^{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{0}}\frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
so
[[File:OortConstant'sLeiden2017.jpg|thumb|Oort constants on a wall in Leiden]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; A=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right) \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the Oort constant describing the shearing motion and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the Oort constant describing the rotation of the Galaxy.  As described below, one can measure &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; from plotting these velocities, measured for many stars, against the galactic longitudes of these stars.

==Measurements==
[[File:Oortmeasure.jpg|frame|right|Figure 2: Measuring the Oort constants by fitting to large data sets. Note that this graph erroneously shows B as positive. A negative B value contributes a westerly component to the transverse velocities.]]

As mentioned in an intermediate step in the derivation above:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=A\,d\,\sin\left(2l\right) \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=A\,d\,\cos\left(2l\right)+B\,d \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we can write the Oort constants &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; A=\frac{V_{\text{obs, r}}}{d\,\sin\left(2l\right)} \\
&amp; B=\frac{V_{\text{obs, t}}}{d}-A\,\cos\left(2l\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the Oort constants can be expressed in terms of the radial and transverse velocities, distances, and galactic longitudes of objects in our Galaxy - all of which are, in principle, observable quantities.

However, there are a number of complications. The simple derivation above assumed that both the Sun and the object in question are traveling on circular orbits about the Galactic center. This is not true for the Sun (the Sun's velocity relative to the [[local standard of rest]] is approximately 13.4&amp;nbsp;km/s),&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; and not necessarily true for other objects in the Milky Way either. The derivation also implicitly assumes that the gravitational potential of the Milky Way is [[axisymmetric]] and always directed towards the center. This ignores the effects of [[Spiral galaxy|spiral arms]] and the Galaxy's [[Barred spiral galaxy|bar]]. Finally, both [[Proper motion|transverse velocity]] and [[Cosmic distance ladder|distance]] are notoriously difficult to measure for objects which are not relatively nearby.

Since the non-circular component of the Sun's velocity is known, it can be subtracted out from our observations to compensate. We do not know, however, the non-circular components of the velocity of each individual star we observe, so they cannot be compensated for in this way. But, if we plot transverse velocity divided by distance against galactic longitude for a large sample of stars, we know from the equations above that they will follow a sine function. The non-circular velocities will introduce scatter around this line, but with a large enough sample the true function can be fit for and the values of the Oort constants measured, as shown in figure 2. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is simply the amplitude of the sinusoid and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the vertical offset from zero.  Measuring transverse velocities and distances accurately and without biases remains challenging, though, and sets of derived values for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; frequently disagree.

Most methods of measuring &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are fundamentally similar, following the above patterns. The major differences usually lie in what sorts of objects are used and details of how distance or proper motion are measured. Oort, in his original 1927 paper deriving the constants, obtained &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = 31.0 ± 3.7&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. He did not explicitly obtain a value for &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, but from his conclusion that the Galaxy was nearly in Keplerian rotation (as in example 2 below), we can presume he would have gotten a value of around -10&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=oort1927 /&gt; These differ significantly from modern values, which is indicative of the difficulty of measuring these constants. Measurements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; since that time have varied widely; in 1964 the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] adopted &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = 15&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = -10&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as standard values.&lt;ref name="kerr86" /&gt; Although more recent measurements continue to vary, they tend to lie near these values.&lt;ref name="Branham10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Branham|first=Richard|title=Kinematics and velocity ellipsoid of the F giants|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=409|issue=3|pages=1269–1280|date=September 2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17389.x|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17389.x|accessdate=2010-11-22|bibcode=2010MNRAS.409.1269B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="olling03"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olling|first=Rob|author2=Dehnen, Walter|title=The Oort constants measured from proper motions|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=10 December 2003|volume=599|issue=1|pages=275–296|doi=10.1086/379278|bibcode=2003ApJ...599..275O|arxiv = astro-ph/0301486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bobylev10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bobylev|first=Vadim|author2=Bajkova, Anisa|title=Galactic parameters from masers with trigonometric parallaxes|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=November 2010|volume=408|issue=3|pages=1788–1795|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17244.x|bibcode=2010MNRAS.408.1788B|arxiv = 1006.5152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hipparcos]] satellite, launched in 1989, was the first space-based [[Astrometry|astrometric]] mission, and its precise measurements of parallax and [[proper motion]] have enabled much better measurements of the Oort constants. In 1997 Hipparcos data were used to derive the values &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = 14.82 ± 0.84&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = -12.37 ± 0.64&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Feast97" /&gt; The [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]] spacecraft, launched in 2013, is an updated successor to Hipparcos; which allowed new levels of accuracy in measuring four Oort constants &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = 15.3 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = -11.9 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; = -3.2 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = -3.3 ± 0.6&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bovy17" /&gt;

With the Gaia values, we find
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}=-A-B=-3.4\text{ km/s/kpc} \\
&amp; \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}=\Omega=A-B=27.2\text{ km/s/kpc} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
This value of Ω corresponds to a period of 226 million years for the sun's present neighborhood to go around the Milky Way. However, the time it takes for the sun to go around the Milky Way (a [[galactic year]]) may be longer because (in a simple model) it is circulating around a point further from the centre of the galaxy where Ω is smaller (see [[Sun#Orbit in Milky Way]]).

The values in km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; can be converted into [[milliarcsecond]]s per year by dividing by 4.740. This gives the following values for the average [[proper motion]] of stars in our neighborhood at different galactic longitudes, after correction for the effect due to the sun's velocity with respect to the local standard of rest:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Galactic longitude!!Constellation !!average proper motion!! [[milliarcsecond|mas]]/year!!approximate direction
|-
| 0°|| [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] || B+A  || 0.7 ||north-east
|-
| 45°|| [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]]  || B || 2.5 ||south-west
|-

|}
The motion of the sun towards the [[solar apex]] in Hercules adds a generally westward component to the observed proper motions of stars around Vela or Centaurus and a generally eastward component for stars around Cygnus or Cassiopeia. This effect falls off with distance, so the values in the table are more representative for stars that are further away. On the other hand, more distant stars or objects will not follow the table, which is for objects in our neighborhood. For example, [[Sagittarius A*]], the radio source at the centre of the galaxy, will have a proper motion of approximately Ω or 5.7 mas/y southwestward (with a small adjustment due to the sun's motion toward the solar apex) even though it is in Sagittarius. Note that these proper motions cannot be measured against "background stars" (because the background stars will have similar proper motions), but must be measured against more stationary references such as [[quasar]]s.

== Meaning ==
[[File:Rotation curve eqs.jpg|frame|right|Figure 3: Diagram of the various [[rotation curve]]s in a galaxy]]
The Oort constants can greatly enlighten one as to how the Galaxy rotates. As one can see &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are both functions of the Sun's orbital velocity as well as the first derivative of the Sun's velocity. As a result, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; describes the shearing motion in the disk surrounding the Sun, while &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; describes the angular momentum gradient in the solar neighborhood, also referred to as [[vorticity]].

To illuminate this point, one can look at three examples that describe how stars and gas orbit within the Galaxy giving intuition as to the meaning of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. These three examples are solid body rotation, Keplerian rotation and constant rotation over different annuli. These three types of rotation are plotted as a function of radius (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;), and are shown in Figure 3 as the green, blue and red curves respectively. The grey curve is approximately the [[rotation curve]] of the [[Milky Way]].

===Solid body rotation===
To begin, let one assume that the rotation of the [[Milky Way]] can be described by solid body rotation, as shown by the green curve in Figure 3. Solid body rotation assumes that the entire system is moving as a rigid body with no [[differential rotation]]. This results in a constant [[angular velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, which is independent of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Following this we can see that velocity scales linearly with &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; v \propto r&lt;/math&gt;, thus
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\frac{d v}{dr}  =\frac{v}{r}= \Omega \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Using the two Oort constant identities, one then can determine what the &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; constants would be,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; A= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega_{0} R_{0}}{R_{0}}-{\Omega}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)=0 \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega_{0}R_{0}}{R_{0}}+{\Omega}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)=-\Omega_{0} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This demonstrates that in solid body rotation, there is no shear motion, i.e. &lt;math&gt;A=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the vorticity is just the angular rotation, &lt;math&gt;B=-\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. This is what one would expect because there is no difference in orbital velocity as radius increases, thus no stress between the annuli. Also, in solid body rotation, the only rotation is about the center, so it is reasonable that the resulting vorticity in the system is described by the only rotation in the system. One can actually measure and find that is non-zero (&lt;math&gt;A=14&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Feast97"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feast|first=M.|author2=Whitelock, P.|title=Galactic Kinematics of Cepheids from HIPPARCOS Proper Motions|journal=MNRAS|date=November 1997|volume=291|pages=683–693|arxiv=astro-ph/9706293|bibcode = 1997MNRAS.291..683F|doi=10.1093/mnras/291.4.683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kerr86"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerr|first=F. J|author2=Lynden-Bell, D.|title=Review of Galactic Constants|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=15 August 1986|volume=221|pages=1023–1038|bibcode = 1986MNRAS.221.1023K|doi=10.1093/mnras/221.4.1023}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus the galaxy does not rotate as a solid body in our local neighborhood, but may in the inner regions of the Galaxy.

===Keplerian rotation===
The second illuminating example is to assume that the orbits in the local neighborhood follow a [[Keplerian orbit]], as shown by the blue line in Figure 3. The orbital motion in a Keplerian orbit is described by,
:&lt;math&gt; v=\sqrt{ \frac{G M}{r} } &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gravitational Constant]], and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass enclosed within radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. The derivative of the velocity with respect to the radius is,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d v}{dr}  = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R^3} }=-\frac{1}{2} \frac{v}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

The Oort constants can then be written as follows,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; A= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\frac{v}{2r}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)= \frac{3V_{0}}{4R_{0}} \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\frac{v}{2r}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)=-\frac{1V_{0}}{4R_{0}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For values of Solar velocity, &lt;math&gt;V_{0}=218&lt;/math&gt; km/s, and radius to the [[Galactic center]], &lt;math&gt;R_{0}=8&lt;/math&gt; kpc,&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; the Oort's constants are &lt;math&gt;A= 20&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B=-7&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the observed values are &lt;math&gt;A=14&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = -12&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Feast97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kerr86" /&gt; Thus, Keplerian rotation is not the best description the [[Milky Way]] rotation.  Furthermore, although this example does not describe the local rotation, it can be thought of as the limiting case that describes the minimum velocity an object can have in a stable orbit.

===Flat rotation curve===
The final example is to assume that the rotation curve of the Galaxy is flat, i.e. &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is constant and independent of radius, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. The rotation velocity is in between that of a solid body and of Keplerian rotation, and is the red dottedline in Figure 3. With a constant velocity, it follows that the radial derivative of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is 0, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dr}=0&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore the Oort constants are,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; A=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-0\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\right) \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+0\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the local velocity and radius given in the last example, one finds &lt;math&gt;A= 13.6&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B=-13.6&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is close to the actual measured Oort constants and tells us that the constant-speed model is the closest of these three to reality in the solar neighborhood. But in fact, as mentioned above, &lt;math&gt;-A-B&lt;/math&gt; is negative, meaning that at our distance, speed decreases with distance from the centre of the galaxy.

What one should take away from these three examples, is that with a remarkably simple model, the rotation of the [[Milky Way]] can be described by these two constants. The first two examples are used as constraints to the Galactic rotation, for they show the fastest and slowest the Galaxy can rotate at a given radius. The flat rotation curve serves as an intermediate step between the two rotation curves, and in fact gives the most reasonable Oort constants as compared to current measurements.

== Uses ==
One of the major uses of the Oort constants is to calibrate the galactic rotation curve. A relative curve can be derived from studying the motions of gas clouds in the Milky Way, but to calibrate the actual absolute speeds involved requires knowledge of V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; We know that:

:&lt;math&gt;V_0 = R_0(A-B)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Since R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be determined by other means (such as by carefully tracking the motions of stars near the Milky Way's [[Sagittarius A*|central supermassive black hole]]),&lt;ref name="Eisenhauer03"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenhauer|first=F.|display-authors=etal |title=A Geometric Determination of the Distance to the Galactic Center|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=November 2003|volume=597|issue=2|pages=121–124|doi=10.1086/380188|bibcode=2003ApJ...597L.121E | arxiv=astro-ph/0306220}}&lt;/ref&gt; knowing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; allows us to determine V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

It can also be shown that the mass density &lt;math&gt;\rho_R&lt;/math&gt; can be given by:&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_R = \frac{B^2 - A^2}{2 \pi G}&lt;/math&gt;

So the Oort constants can tell us something about the mass density at a given radius in the disk. They are also useful to constrain mass distribution models for the Galaxy.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; As well, in the epicyclic approximation for nearly circular stellar orbits in a disk, the [[epicyclic frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2 = -4B\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galaxies in the Universe|year=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-67186-6|author=Sparke, L|author2=Gallagher, J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Oort constants can tell us a great deal about motions in the galaxy.

The '''Petrified Forest''' is a [[petrified forest]] located in [[Sonoma County, California]], in the [[United States]].

==History==

===Geological history===

Approximately 3.4 million years&lt;ref name=Villano/&gt; ago a [[volcano]] eruption at [[Mount St. Helena]] caused the trees to become petrified.&lt;ref name=Diablo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Petrified Forest|url=http://www.napasonomamagazine.com/See-Listings/index.php/name/The-Petrified-Forest/listing/103132/|website=Napa Sonoma Magazine|publisher=Diablo Publications|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process took thousands of years to complete.&lt;ref name=Villano/&gt; Diane Erwin, from the University of California, Berkeley, stated in 2012, that the petrified forest shows that redwood trees were once located more inland, unlike their contemporary descendants that are primarily coastal. The Palynological Society calls the forest "one of the finest examples in the world of an ancient forest."&lt;ref name=Ernst/&gt;

===19th century===
The forest was discovered in 1870 by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. Marsh determined that the petrified trees were ''[[Sequoia langsdorfii]]'' from the [[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]] genus.&lt;ref name=Ernst/&gt; There is also one petrified [[pine tree]] in the forest.&lt;ref name=Villano/&gt; [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] mentioned the forest in his book ''[[The Silverado Squatters]]'' (1883).&lt;ref name=Villano/&gt;

===Today===

Since the early 20th century, the same Calistoga based family has maintained and operated the forest. The forest was bought by Ollie Orre Bockee, from M.C. Meeker, around 1912. The total purchase cost was $14,000. Bockee continued to purchase surrounding land and acquired a total of 845 acres.&lt;ref name=Ernst/&gt; Bockee opened the property to tourists around 1914 and charged 50 cents per person.&lt;ref name=Villano/&gt; Bockee died in 1950. Her sister became the owner of the property. Bockee's direct descendants maintain it today.&lt;ref name=Ernst/&gt; It was listed on the [[California Historical Landmarks]] list on January 31, 1978.&lt;ref name=CHL/&gt; In 2012, the family started to send fossilized [[pollen]] samples to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] for research.&lt;ref name=Ernst/&gt;

Many of the petrified trees in the forest have nicknames, including The Queen, which is 8 feet wide and 65 feet long. The Queen was 2,000 years old when the volcano erupted. Additional trees include The Pit Tree and the Giant. There are a cluster of trees named after Ollie Orre Bockee and a tree named after Robert Louis Stevenson.&lt;ref name=Villano/&gt;

The Petrified Forest is within the boundaries of the Tubbs fire of October 2017, and the location shows as a hot spot on October 13&lt;ref&gt;[http://calfire-forestry.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=58dc77306bf448c6ac5f756af51f3ae5]&lt;/ref&gt;.

An important field of research today is trying to improve, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the capacity to measure phenomes. This includes developing high-throughput measurement systems.

For example, the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility, an initiative of the Australian government, has developed a number of new instruments for comprehensive and fast measurements of phenotypes in both the lab and the field.

'''''Practical Ethics''''' (1979; second edition 1993; third edition 2011) is an introduction to [[applied ethics]] by [[bioethics|bioethical]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]. The book, which has been translated into a number of languages, caused outrage in German-speaking countries.

==Summary==

Singer analyzes, in detail, why and how beings' interests should be weighed. In his view, a being's interests should always be weighed according to that being's concrete properties, and not according to its belonging to some abstract group. Singer studies a number of ethical issues including: [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], ability, species, [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], [[infanticide]], [[Embryonic stem cell|embryo experimentation]], the moral [[Animal rights|status of animals]], political violence, [[overseas aid]], and whether we have an obligation to assist others. The 1993 second edition adds chapters on [[refugees]], the environment, [[Equal opportunity|equality]] and [[disability]], embryo experimentation, and the treatment of academics in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophyblog.com.au/review-of-practical-ethics-by-peter-singer |title=Review of Practical Ethics by Peter Singer | date = 2006-09-20 |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521439718 |title=''Practical Ethics'' 2nd edition |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third edition published in 2011 omits the chapter on refugees, and contains a new chapter on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item5759355/Practical%20Ethics/?site_locale=en_US |title=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Practical Ethics'' is widely read and was described as "an excellent text for an introductory ethics course" by the philosopher [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2184936| title=''Practical Ethics'' by Peter Singer | author=Fischer, John Martin | journal=The Philosophical Review | year=1983 | volume=92 | issue=2 | pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[James Rachels]] recommended the book "as an introduction centered on such practical issues as abortion, racism, and so forth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=James Rachels | title=The Elements of Moral Philosophy, Fourth Edition | year=2003 | page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Mylan Engel]] called ''Practical Ethics'' "must reading for anyone interested in living an ethical life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15265161.2011.626728 | title=Review of ''Practical Ethics, 3rd Edition'' by Peter Singer | author=Engel Jr., Mylan | journal=The American Journal of Bioethics | year=2011 | volume=11 | issue=12 | pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book caused outrage in Germany, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~pillow/gradforum/materials/DangerousPhilosopher.pdf |title=The Dangerous Philosopher |accessdate=2009-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921135030/http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~pillow/gradforum/materials/DangerousPhilosopher.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=052143971X | title=Practical Ethics | accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1325">A '''preorder economy''' is a type of proposed future economy where the exact demand for goods is known ahead of time, before any material production takes place. It has been discussed within the framework of [[ecological economics]].

==Just-in-time manufacturing==

Creating a preorder economy has recently been proposed{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} as an [[economic efficiency]] solution to the environmental problems facing modern society. These environmental challenges are believed {{by whom|date=December 2011}} to be caused in part by unsustainable levels of production, consumption and advertising related to the imperfect exchange of information in market economies. Therefore, preorder economy theory advocates using the [[Internet]] as the means to coordinate all production with existing consumer desires, so that almost nothing is made which does not have someone ready to buy it. This is the idea of [[Just In Time (business)|just in time]] manufacturing taken to its logical end.

'''Sandra Metts''' (Ph.D) is a prominent interpersonal communication scholar and Professor Emeritus in the School of Communication at [[Illinois State University]].

Metts has dedicated her academic career to the study of interpersonal and social communication. Her research areas include [[deception]] in close relationships, [[politeness]], [[sexual communication]], relationship engagement, and [[facework]]—face is a social identity that people construct during social interactions. A prolific scholar, Metts has published numerous articles, edited several top journals in her field, and co-authored multiple books. Her research and scholarship in interpersonal communication offers her “the opportunity to move beyond describing how meaning is created." She states, "I can actually offer an explanation of how communication functions in relationships and suggest ways that it can be improved.”

In an interview, she says that her research aims “to contribute to our growing knowledge of what makes relationships succeed or fail. Since we all have friendships, romances, and family ties, the relevance of my work is broad and, I hope, useful.” In addition Metts states all her responsibilities as a teacher are of importance, even the tasks that she may grumble through such a grading exams or putting together effective course packets. She finds her work as a teacher very rewarding. “I guess the most meaningful to me is providing students with the opportunity to have better lives, personally and professionally, to be in control of their communication rather than a victim of it, and to be able to appreciate and facilitate the communication efforts of other people.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cas.illinoisstate.edu/sites/casnews/2005/07/18/faculty-profile-sandra-metts/ |title=Faculty Profile: Sandra Metts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Metts completed both of her Bachelor of Arts degrees (in English Education and Sociology) from [[Western Washington University]]. She has a total of three master's degrees: one in American Literature from the [[University of Washington]], another in Art History from [[Bowling Green University]] and a third in Performance Studies from the [[University of Northern Iowa]]. She earned her Ph.D. in Communication Research from the [[University of Iowa]]. In 1983 Metts joined the faculty at Illinois State University, where she remained until her retirement in 2014. Metts still teaches courses in [[interpersonal communication]] as an emerita professor.

==Awards and honors==
In 2013, Dr. Metts was inducted into the [[Central States Communication Association]]'s (CSCA) Hall of Fame - the highest honor bestowed by the organization - for her commitment to scholarship, mentoring, and service in the field of Communication. In 2013, Metts was also awarded the CSCA Outstanding Mentor Award for her commitment to mentoring students and faculty in the discipline.

Metts served as the CSCA Vice President from 1997-1998 and president from 1998-1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediarelations.illinoisstate.edu/news_releases/1213/feb/mettsrelease.shtml |title=Metts to be Inducted into CSCA Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, she received the College of Arts and Sciences Lecturer Award.

She has also garnered numerous teaching awards throughout her career including [[Illinois State University]]'s Outstanding Teacher Award in 2002-03, the College’s Outstanding Teacher Award in 1989, the International Society for the Study of Personal Relationships Outstanding Teacher Award in 2000, and the Central States Communication Association Outstanding New Teacher Award in 1985.

'''Sense of community''' (or '''psychological sense of community''') is a concept in [[community psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], and [[Community practice|community social work]], as well as in several other research disciplines, such as [[urban sociology]], which focuses on the ''experience'' of community rather than its structure, formation, setting, or other features. The latter is the province of [[public administration]] or community services administration which needs to understand how structures influence this feeling and psychological sense of community. [[Sociologist]]s, [[social psychologist]]s, [[anthropologist]]s, and others have theorized about and carried out [[empirical research]] on community, but the [[psychological]] approach asks questions about the individual's [[perception]], [[understanding]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[emotion|feelings]], etc. about community and his or her relationship to it and to others' participation—indeed to the complete, multifaceted community experience.

In his seminal 1974 book, psychologist [[Seymour B. Sarason]] proposed that psychological sense of community become the conceptual center for the psychology of [[community]], asserting that it "is one of the major bases for self-definition." By 1986 it was regarded as a central overarching concept for [[community psychology]] (Sarason, 1986; Chavis &amp; Pretty, 1999).In addition, the theoretical concept entered the other applied academic disciplines as part of "communities for all" initiatives in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Magrab, P. (1999). The meaning of community. (pp. 3-30). In: R.N. Roberts &amp; P. R. Magrab, ''Where Children Live: Solutions for Serving Young Children and their Families''. Stamford, Ct: Ablex Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among theories of sense of community proposed by [[psychologist]]s, McMillan &amp; Chavis's (1986) is by far the most influential, and is the starting point for most of the recent research in the field. It is discussed in detail below.

== Definitions ==

For Sarason, psychological sense of community is "the [[perception]] of similarity to others, an acknowledged [[interdependence]] with others, a willingness to maintain this interdependence by giving to or doing for others what one expects from them, and the feeling that one is part of a larger dependable and stable structure" (1974, p.&amp;nbsp;157).

McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) define sense of community as "a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met through their [[personal commitment|commitment]] to be together."

Gusfield (1975) identified two dimensions of community: territorial and relational. The relational dimension of community has to do with the nature and quality of relationships in that community, and some communities may even have no discernible territorial demarcation, as in the case of a community of scholars working in a particular specialty, who have some kind of contact and quality of relationship, but may live and work in disparate locations, perhaps even throughout the world. Other communities may seem to be defined primarily according to territory, as in the case of [[neighborhood]]s, but even in such cases, proximity or shared territory cannot by itself constitute a community; the relational dimension is also essential.

[[Factor analysis]] of their urban neighborhoods [[questionnaire]] yielded two distinct factors which Riger and Lavrakas (1981) characterized as "social bonding" and "physical rootedness", very similar to the two dimensions proposed by Gusfield.
Early work on psychological sense of community was based on neighborhoods as the referent, and found a relationship between psychological sense of community and '''greater participation''' (Hunter, 1975; Wandersman &amp; Giamartino, 1980), '''perceived safety''' (Doolittle &amp; McDonald, 1978), '''ability to function competently in the community''' (Glynn, 1981), '''social bonding''' (Riger &amp; Lavrakas, 1981), '''social fabric''' (strengths of [[interpersonal relationship]]) (Ahlbrandt &amp; Cunningham, 1979), '''greater sense of purpose and perceived control''' (Bachrach &amp; Zautra, 1985), and '''greater civic contributions''' ([[Donation|charitable contributions]] and civic involvement) (Davidson &amp; Cotter, 1986). These initial studies lacked a clearly articulated [[conceptual framework]], however, and none of the measures developed were based on a [[theoretical definition]] of psychological sense of community.

== Primary theoretical foundation: McMillan and Chavis ==

McMillan &amp; Chavis's (1986) theory (and instrument) are the most broadly validated and widely utilized in this area in the psychological literature. They prefer the abbreviated label "sense of community", and propose that sense of community is composed of four elements.

===Four elements of sense of community===
There are four elements of "sense of community" according to the McMillan &amp; Chavis theory:

====Membership====
Membership includes five attributes:
* boundaries
* emotional safety
* a sense of belonging and identification
* personal investment
* a common symbol system

====Influence====
Influence works both ways: members need to feel that they have some influence in the group, and some influence by the group on its members is needed for group cohesion. Current researches (e.g. Chigbu, 2013) on rural and urban communities have found that sense of community is a major factor.

====Integration and fulfillment of needs====
Members feel rewarded in some way for their participation in the community.

====Shared emotional connection====
The "definitive element for true community" (1986, p.&amp;nbsp;14), it includes shared history and shared participation (or at least identification with the history).

===Dynamics within and between the elements===
McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) give the following example to illustrate the dynamics within and between these four elements (p.&amp;nbsp;16):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team. People attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of needs). The team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis). They play a game and win (successful shared valent event). While playing, members exert energy on behalf of the team (personal investment in the group). As the team continues to win, team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members). Someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and they do so (influence).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Current research====
In their 2002 study of a [[community of interest]], specifically the science fiction fandom community, Obst, Zinkiewicz, and Smith suggest Conscious Identification as the fifth dimension (Obst, 2002).

== Empirical assessment ==

Chavis et al.'s '''Sense of Community Index''' ('''SCI''') (see Chipuer &amp; Pretty, 1999; Long &amp; Perkins, 2003), originally designed primarily in reference to neighborhoods, can be adapted to study other communities as well, including the [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], [[school]]s, [[religious communities]], communities of interest, etc.

The '''Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research''' is an academic honour awarded by the [[International Science Council]] (ISC), the [[University of Bergen]] and the [[European Consortium for Political Research]] (ECPR), in memory of the [[Political science|political scientist]] and [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Stein Rokkan]] (prior to the 2018 formation of the International Science Council from the merger of the [[International Social Science Council]] (ISSC) and the [[International Council for Science]], the prize was awarded by the International Social Science Council).&lt;ref name="ISC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call for nominations: Stein Rokkan prize for comparative social science research|url=https://council.science/current/news/call-for-nominations-stein-rokkan-prize-for-comparative-social-science-research|website=International Science Council|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISSC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stein Rokkan|url=http://www.worldsocialscience.org/activities/scientific-prizes/stein-rokkan/|website=International Social Science Council|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is awarded to scholars making "a very substantial and original contribution in comparative social science research".&lt;ref name="ISC" /&gt; These contributions can be in the form of book-length, unpublished manuscripts, published books, or collections of works published no more than two years prior to the award year. The prize is awarded annually and is worth $5000.&lt;ref name="ISC" /&gt;

According to a reputation survey conducted in 2013 and 2014, the Stein Rokkan Prize is the second most prestigious international academic award in political science, after the [[Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|title=IREG List of International Academic Awards|publisher=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|location=Brussels|url=http://ireg-observatory.org/en/pdfy/IREG-list-academic-awards-EN.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Juntao|last2=Liu|first2=Niancai|title=Mapping of important international academic awards|journal=Scientometrics|date=2015|volume=104|pages=763-791|doi=10.1007/s11192-015-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reputation survey conducted in 2018 found the Stein Rokkan Prize to be the most prestigious interdisciplinary award in the social sciences (jointly with the [[Holberg Prize]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Fan|last2=Liu|first2=Niancai|title=The hierarchical status of international academic awards in social sciences|journal=Scientometrics|date=2018|doi=10.1007/s11192-018-2928-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''transparency report''' is a statement issued on a regular basis by a [[company]], disclosing a variety of [[statistics]] related to requests for user [[data]], records, or content. Transparency reports generally disclose how frequently and under what authority [[government]]s have requested or demanded data or records over a certain period of time. This form of [[corporate transparency]] allows the public to discern what private information governments have gained access to through [[search warrant]]s and court [[subpoena]]s, among other methods. Some transparency reports describe how often, as a result of government action or under [[copyright]] provisions, content was removed. Disclosing a transparency report also helps people to know about the appropriate scope and authority of content regulation for online discussions.&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|title=transparency report introduction|url=https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Google]] first launched a transparency report in 2010, with Twitter following in 2012. Additional companies began releasing transparency reports as during the aftermath of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures beginning in 2013]], and the number of companies issuing them has increased rapidly ever since. Transparency reports are issued today by a variety of technology and communications companies, including [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Verizon]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Twitter]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Facebook]], [[Yahoo]] and [[CloudFlare]]. Several companies and advocacy groups have lobbied the [[U.S. government]] to allow the number of secret data requests (requests which include a [[gag order]]s - including [[National Security Letter]]s) to be described within ranges in the report. 

==Government demand increases in years==

===Google===
[[Google Search|Google's]] latest ''(10th)'' transparency report indicates that the government demands for data are increasing in recent years.This report shows demands from government in the first six months of 2014, and the firm said that it includes demands made under the US Foreign Intelligence, Surveillance Act (FISA) and through National Security Letters (NSLs).
"FISA and NSL demands have increased by 15 percent during the six months, according to the firm, and by 150 percent over the 10 reports and the five year reporting period. That's globally. In the US the figures for the same period are 19 percent and 250 percent."
[[Google]] legal director ''Richard Salgado'' accepted that the government has to fight crime and deal with threats, but the opposition of data demands need to be considered as well.
''"This increase in government demands comes against a backdrop of ongoing revelations about government surveillance programs. Despite these revelations, we have seen some countries expand their surveillance authorities in an attempt to reach service providers outside their borders,"'' he said.
''"Governments have a legitimate and important role in fighting crime and investigating national security threats. To maintain public confidence in both government and technology, we need legislative reform that ensures surveillance powers are transparent, reasonably scoped by law, and subject to independent oversight."''
The report shows that the US makes the most demands for Google users' data, and Google said that it made 12,539 requests that affected some 22,000 accounts. It added that it provided data in 84 percent of cases.

In the UK it said there were 1,535 requests covering 1,991 users or accounts, and [[Google]] provided data for 72 percent of the requests.&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dave|first1=Neal|title=Google’s 10th transparency report shows government requests are rising|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2369323/google-s-10th-transparency-report-shows-government-requests-are-rising|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yahoo===
The latest Yahoo transparency report was released on 25 September 2014. The report states that 30,511 users were affected by 18,594 government data requests.,whereas 57,324 accounts were affected by 29,470 government requests.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Government data request|url=https://transparency.yahoo.com/government-data-requests/index.htm|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both of these figures do not include those secret requests sent by the FISA court. During the last six month from ''July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013'', it received between 0 and 1998 FISA requests for user data, affecting up to 54,997 users (including national security letters). Comparing to the first sixth month from ''January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013'', 32,997 accounts was affected. As we can see from the figures, although the total number of data request drop, the number of data request approved from the FISA court have increased significantly.
Overall, 41 percent of accounts affected by government data requests came from requests made by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Data requests drop, but FISA stats are worrying|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/25/yahoo-transparency-report-over-30k-government-data-requests-nearly-half-from-the-u-s/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Transparency reports may be published for a variety of purposes. One purpose could be to clarify how much information governments ask for, how such requests are evaluated, and how the receiving entity chose to respond. This information may lead consumers to the conclusion that the report's publisher is more trustworthy.&lt;ref name=argument&gt;{{cite web|title=Transparency reports useful, but more info needed on 'digital searches'|url=http://www.scmagazine.com/transparency-reports-useful-but-more-info-needed-on-digital-searches/article/376751/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is some debate about what transparency reports really reveal. Some critics argue that mere quantities of requests may mislead consumers, since most entities have little control over the number of requests they receive, the breadth of the requests they receive, or even the number of requests they ultimately comply with.&lt;ref name="transparency report"&gt;{{cite web|title=what transparency report don't tell us?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-transparency-reports-dont-tell-us/282529/#disqus_thread|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] all release transparency reports, all of which list the type and number of government data requests each company receives. these reports include exact numbers and shed a bright light on government activity. The U.S. government will not, however, permit companies to report exact numbers for national security requests or the number of requests that came under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Section 702, Patriot Act Section 215, or national security letters.
Instead, they have to aggregate the numbers or provide a range. And that’s even if the government permits a company to publish that data. Google may publish national security letter information, but not FISA information. Facebook may publish FISA information, but it must lump such data in with NSL information. As a result, consumers cannot see the true figure for total government data requests.
Critics of this policy, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], argue that there is no clear national security justification for blocking entities from releasing this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the transparency report is necessary in the fight for privacy|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/09/12/transparency-reports/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts between government and company==

In June 2013, [[Google]] asked the Department of Justice for permission to disclose details about the number of FISA requests it receives. As a result, [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], and [[Facebook]] followed suit immediately. However, the Department of Justice refused those requests, and they only provide the companies with a heavily redacted version of their arguments.
Here's what Google legal director Richard Salgado had to say about FISA requests:
''"We want to go even further. We believe it’s your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies. However, the U.S. Department of Justice contends that U.S. law does not allow us to share information about some national security requests that we might receive. Specifically, the U.S. government argues that we cannot share information about the requests we receive (if any) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But you deserve to know."''&lt;ref name=conflicts&gt;{{cite news|title=Google slams U.S. government in latest transparency report|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2063386/google-slams-u-s-government-in-latest-transparency-report.html|accessdate=22 October 2014|agency=PC WORLD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''“Our ability to speak has been restricted by laws that prohibit and even criminalize a service provider like us from disclosing the exact number of national security letters ('NSLs') and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ('FISA') court orders received - even if that number is zero.”''avian network's veep for legal Ben Lee has blogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter sues US government for right to disclose NOTHING|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/08/twitter_sues_us_government_for_right_to_disclose_nothing/|publisher=The register|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2014, [[Twitter]] announce that there will be a lawsuit against the United States government for violating its First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Transparency Report which would reveal how many national security letters (NSLs) and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders [[Twitter]] receives. They provided a draft of the transparency report to the Department of Justice and discussed it for months. [[Twitter]] was still unable to get the permission for allowing them to publish even a redacted version of the report from the government.
The response form FBI for its stance is that the information Twitter wants to publish "is classified and cannot be publicly released", they also said according to the framework provided on 27 January 2014, Twitter is only permitted to qualify its description of the total number of accounts affected by all national security legal process it has received but it cannot quantify that description with specific detail that goes well beyond what is allowed under the 27th Jan 2014 framework and that discloses properly classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI response|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/07/National-Security/Graphics/Exhibit%205%20-%2020140909%20FBI%20Letter%20to%20Twitter.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

===About the government===
The United States government announced on 30 August 2013 that a transparency report which is in its own form will be released. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper announced the change on his office's [[Tumblr]] blog. He said that the decision will come naturally after President Barack Obama ordered the declassification of as much intelligence information as possible. Total numbers for national security letters, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) business records requests, FISA one register/trap and trace requests will be stated in the transparency report. Beside that, the report will also include the number of targets being investigated in each of these requests. The number will reflect the 12 months prior to the date published.
The inspiration of the report comes from the recent surveillance program leaks from former NSA-contractor Edward Snowden, according to an anonymous source speaking with the ''Washington Post''.
[[Google]], [[Twitter]],and [[Facebook]] all release their own forms of transparency report, however they are not allowed to release this sort of information in their report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Meghan Kelly|title=U.S. to release transparency report with FISA and national security requests|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/08/30/us-transparency-report/|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terminal 3''', also known by the trademarked name '''Worldport''', was an [[airport terminal]] built by [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) in 1960 at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]. It opened on May 24, 1960 and ceased operations on May 24, 2013; it was demolished in late 2013.

==History==
===Original use===
[[Image:Pan Am Worldport overview.jpg|thumb|left|The distinctive "flying saucer" roof design of the Worldport]]
The terminal was originally known as the "Pan Am Terminal" or Pan Am "Unit Terminal Building (UTB)." It was designed by Ives, Turano &amp; Gardner Associated Architects and Walther Prokosch of Tippets-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton as a showcase for international jet travel and is particularly famous for its {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} "flying saucer" roof suspended far from the outside columns of the terminal by 32 sets of pre-stressed steel posts and cables. The terminal was designed to allow for aircraft to be parked under the partial overhang; marketing brochures promoted it as the jet-age terminal that brought the plane to the passenger. The overhang sheltered passengers as they boarded the aircraft by stairs or by uncovered bridges. The [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) ''Guide to New York City'' called the terminal a "genuine architectural attempt to answer the problem of all-weather connections to the planes" but derided the overall concept as "compromised by an overabundance of distracting detail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=AIA Guide to New York City |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0gj61QSgk8C&amp;pg=PA811&amp;lpg=PA811 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |author=White, Norval |author2=Willensky, Elliot |author3=Leadon, Fran |page=811 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's facade originally featured [[zodiac]] figures made by sculptor [[Milton Hebald]],&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Sanka. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0812F73E5916738DDDAA0894DE405B808AF1D3 "IDLEWILD SKYLINE GETS AN ADDITION; New Pan Am Terminal Looks Like Parasol to Motorists Approaching Airport"], [[New York Times]], June 3, 1960. Accessed October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; although these were later removed by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68708702.html "Outrage.(Pan American airport terminal in disrepair)"], ''[[Architectural Review]]'', December 2000. Accessed October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The terminal featured the Panorama Room, a dining room with a view of the entire concourse, and the Clipper Hall museum of Pan Am history.

In 1971, the terminal was expanded to accommodate the large [[Boeing 747]] and renamed the "Pan Am Worldport". The Worldport was the world's largest airline terminal and held the title for several years.

{{Multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|width=250

|image2=JFK Terminal 3 2012.jpg|caption2=In 2012}}

Operation of the Worldport changed hands when Pan Am declared bankruptcy in 1991. [[Delta Air Lines]] acquired many of Pan Am's assets, including the lease on the Worldport, which became known simply as "Terminal 3", and operated most of its long-haul flights out of JFK to Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America from the building.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In March 2006, Delta COO Jim Whitehurst announced that Delta would spend US$10 million before the end of that year to renovate Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, including its public spaces, BusinessElite lounge, and Crown Room Clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Delta Air Lines To Surpass American In JFK Departures |first=Jay |last=Boehmer |url=http://www.businesstravelnews.com/More-News/Articles/Delta-Air-Lines-To-Surpass-American-In-JFK-Departures/ |work=Business Travel News |date=March 20, 2006 |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the July 2007 issue of Delta's ''Sky Magazine'', Delta Senior Vice President Joanne Smith remarked on the "distinctive" saucer roof in an article on new flooring, lighting, and signage at this "historic airport".

===Redevelopment and preservation campaign===
On August 4, 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Delta was planning to move its international flights to Terminal 4 following the construction of nine additional gates in Concourse B of that terminal. Delta's domestic flights would continue to be operated out of Terminal 2. Terminal 3 would subsequently be demolished to create additional [[hardstand|aircraft parking]] between Terminals 2 and 4. Construction of the Terminal 4 expansion began in November 2010 and was completed in May 2013.

On May 23, 2013, the final departure from Terminal 3, [[Delta Air Lines]] Flight 268, a [[Boeing 747-400]] to [[Tel Aviv]] [[Ben Gurion Airport]], departed from Gate 6 at 11:25pm local time. The terminal ceased operations on the next day, 53 years to the day from when it opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Frischling |first=Steven |title=Photographer |url=http://boardingarea.com/blogs/flyingwithfish/2013/05/17/a-historic-chapter-in-aviation-closes-it-wont-be-documented/ |accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historic Preservation|Preservation]] groups campaigned to save the building and have it nominated by the New York [[State Historic Preservation Office]] as a [[National Register of Historic Places|historic place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Save The Pan Am Worldport |url=http://www.facebook.com/PanAmWorldport |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 19, 2013, the Worldport was placed on the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]'s [[America's Most Endangered Places|list of 11 Most Endangered Places in America]] for 2013,&lt;ref name="historic sites lost" /&gt; but by June 25, 2013, demolition of the elevated roadway leading to the terminal had already begun, although preservationists continued to protest against the demolition of the building itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Preservationists fight to save Pan Am terminal 'Worldport' at JFK airport |author=Clare Trapasso |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/preservationists-cry-save-worldport-article-1.1382281 |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York State Historic Preservation Office, which had revoked the building's eligibility for the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001,&lt;ref name="2012 FOIL Request"&gt;{{cite web |last=Worldport |first=Save the |title=2012 SHPO FOIL |url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.491185194238416.114871.131386373551635&amp;type=3 |work=Remembering the Pan Am Worldport |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; upheld this decision in May 2013, claiming the building had lost significant historic integrity due to excessive modifications.

The preservation campaign was ultimately unsuccessful and demolition of the flying saucer section was completed on November 22, 2013. Demolition work on the remainder of the terminal completed in summer 2014. The National Trust for Historic Preservation cited the Worldport as one of ten historic sites lost in 2013.&lt;ref name="historic sites lost"&gt;{{cite news |last=staff |title=A look at 10 historic sites save, 10 lost in 2013 |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] as reported by the [[Post Crescent]] |date=January 5, 2014 |page=F3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was subsequently large media outcry, particularly in other countries, concerning the demolition of the Worldport.

An '''X-ray astronomy satellite''' studies [[X-ray]] emissions from celestial objects, as part of a branch of [[space science]] known as [[X-ray astronomy]]. Satellites are needed because X-radiation is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites.

A detector is placed on a [[satellite]] which is then put into [[orbit]] well above the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Unlike balloons, instruments on satellites are able to observe the full range of the [[Dispersion (optics)|X-ray spectrum]]. Unlike sounding rockets, they can collect data for as long as the instruments continue to operate. For example, the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] has been operational for more than fifteen years.

==Active X-ray observatory satellites==
Satellites in use today include the [[XMM-Newton|XMM-Newton observatory]] (low to mid energy X-rays 0.1-15 keV) and the [[INTEGRAL]] satellite (high energy X-rays 15-60 keV). Both were launched by the [[European Space Agency]]. [[NASA]] has launched the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]] and [[Chandra observatory|Chandra]] observatories. One of the instruments on Swift is the [http://www.swift.psu.edu/xrt/ Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT)].

[[Image:Goes14 firstimage.png|thumb|300px|This SXI image of the Sun was a first test of the imager taken on August 13, 2009, at 14:04:58 UTC.]]
The [[GOES 14]] spacecraft carries on board a Solar X-ray Imager to monitor the Sun's X-rays for the early detection of solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and other phenomena that impact the geospace environment.&lt;ref name=NOAAGOES&gt;{{cite web |title=GOES Solar X-ray Imager |url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/sxi/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched into orbit on June 27, 2009, at 22:51 GMT from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37|Space Launch Complex 37B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].

On January 30, 2009, the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] successfully launched the [[Koronas-Foton]] which carries several experiments to detect X-rays, including the TESIS telescope/spectrometer FIAN with SphinX soft X-ray spectrophotometer.

[[ISRO]] launched the multi-wavelength space observatory [[Astrosat]] in 2015. One of the unique features of ASTROSAT mission is that it enables the simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of various astronomical objects with a single satellite. ASTROSAT observes universe in the optical, Ultraviolet, low and high energy X-ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, whereas most other scientific satellites are capable of observing a narrow range of wavelength band.

The [[Italian Space Agency]] (ASI) gamma-ray observatory satellite Astro-rivelatore Gamma ad Imagini Leggero ([[AGILE (spacecraft)|AGILE]]) has on board the Super-AGILE 15-45 keV hard X-ray detector. It was launched on April 23, 2007, by the Indian [[PSLV]]-C8.&lt;ref name=ItalianWade&gt;{{cite web|author=Wade M |title=Chronology - Quarter 2 2007 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/20072.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118143515/http://astronautix.com/chrono/20072.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A soft X-ray solar imaging telescope is on board the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES-13]] weather satellite launched using a [[Delta IV]] from [[Cape Canaveral]] LC37B on May 24, 2006.&lt;ref name=WadeGOES&gt;{{cite web |author=Wade M |title=Chronology - Quarter 2 2006 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/20062.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been no GOES 13 SXI images since December 2006.

Although the [[ASTRO-E|Suzaku]] X-ray spectrometer (the first micro-calorimeter in space) failed on August 8, 2005, after launch on July 10, 2005, the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) and Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) are still functioning.

==Past X-ray observatory satellites==

Past observatories include [[SMART-1]], which contained an X-ray telescope for mapping lunar [[X-ray fluorescence]], [[ROSAT]], the [[Einstein Observatory]] (the first fully imaging X-ray telescope), the [[Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics|ASCA observatory]], [[EXOSAT]], and [[BeppoSAX]]. [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] was the first satellite launched specifically for the purpose of X-ray astronomy. [[Copernicus - Orbiting Astronomical Observatory-3|Copernicus]] which carried an X-ray detector built by [[University College London]]'s Mullard Space Science Laboratory made extensive X-ray observations. [[Astronomical Netherlands Satellite|ANS]] could measure X-ray photons in the energy range 2 to 30 keV. [[Ariel 5]] was dedicated to observing the sky in the X-ray band. [[High Energy Astronomy Observatory 1|HEAO-1]] scanned the X-ray sky over 0.2 keV - 10 MeV. [[Hakucho]] was Japan's first X-ray astronomy satellite. [[ISRO]]'s [[IRS-P3]] launched in 1996 with the Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment (IXAE) on board which  aimed to study the time variability and spectral characteristics of cosmic X-ray sources and for detection of transient X-ray sources. IXAE instruments consisted of three identical pointed mode proportional counters (PPCs) operated in the energy range 2-20 keV, FOV of 2° x 2° and effective area of 1200 cm2, and an X-ray sky monitor (XSM) operating in the energy range 2-10 keV.

===Array of low-energy X-ray imaging sensors===
The [[Array of Low Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors]] (ALEXIS) featured curved mirrors whose multilayer coatings reflect and focus low-energy X-rays or extreme ultraviolet light the way optical telescopes focus visible light. The launch of ALEXIS was provided by the [[United States Air Force]] Space Test Program on a [[Pegasus rocket|Pegasus]] Booster on April 25, 1993. The spacing of the [[molybdenum]] (Mo) and [[silicon]] (Si) layers on each telescope's mirror is the primary determinant of the telescope's photon energy response function. ALEXIS operated for 12 yr.

===OSO-3===
[[Image:Oso3 small.gif|300px|thumb|The [[Third Orbiting Solar Observatory]], OSO 3, carried a hard X-ray experiment (7.7 to 210 keV) and an MIT gamma-ray instrument (&gt;50 MeV), besides a complement of solar physics instruments.]]
The third Orbiting Solar Observatory ([[OSO 3]]) was launched on March 8, 1967, into a nearly circular orbit of mean altitude 550&amp;nbsp;km, inclined at 33° to the equatorial plane, deactivated on June 28, 1968, followed by reentry on April 4, 1982. Its XRT consisted of a continuously spinning wheel (1.7 s period) in which the hard X-ray experiment was mounted with a radial view. The XRT assembly was a single thin NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal plus phototube enclosed in a howitzer-shaped CsI(Tl) anti-coincidence shield. The energy resolution was 45% at 30 keV. The instrument operated from 7.7 to 210 keV with 6 channels. OSO-3 obtained extensive observations of solar flares, the diffuse component of cosmic X-rays, and the observation of a single flare episode from [[Scorpius X-1]], the first observation of an extrasolar X-ray source by an observatory satellite. Among the extrasolar X-ray sources OSO 3 observed were [[Luyten 726-8|UV Ceti]], [[YZ Canis Minoris]], [[EV Lacertae]] and [[AD Leonis]], yielding upper soft X-ray detection limits on flares from these sources.&lt;ref name=Tsikoudi&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tsikoudi V |author2=Hudson H |title=Upper limits on stellar flare X-ray emission from OSO-3 |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=1975 |volume=44|page=273|bibcode=1975A&amp;A....44..273T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ESRO 2B (Iris)===
[[Image:Esro-2b small.gif|300px|thumb|Iris was mainly intended to study X-ray and particle emissions from the Sun, however, it is credited with some extra-solar observations.]]

[[ESRO 2B]] (Iris) was the first successful [[ESRO]] satellite launch. Iris was launched on May 17, 1968, had an elliptical orbit with (initially) apogee 1086&amp;nbsp;km, perigee 326&amp;nbsp;km, and inclination 97.2°, with an orbital period of 98.9 minutes. The satellite carried seven instruments to detect high energy cosmic rays, determine the total flux of solar X-rays, and measure trapped radiation, Van Allen belt protons and cosmic ray protons. Of special significance for X-ray astronomy were two X-ray instruments: one designed to detect wavelengths 1-20 Å (0.1-2&amp;nbsp;nm) (consisting of proportional counters with varying window thickness) and one designed to detect wavelengths 44-60 Å (4.4-6.0&amp;nbsp;nm) (consisting of proportional counters with thin [[Mylar]] windows).&lt;ref name=heasarc2B&gt;{{cite web |title=The European Space Research Organization satellite 2B |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/esro2b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (WDS) is a method used to count the number of X-rays of a specific wavelength [[Diffraction|diffracted]] by a crystal. WDS only counts X-rays of a single wavelength or wavelength band. In order to interpret the data, the expected elemental wavelength peak locations need to be known. For the ESRO-2B WDS X-ray instruments, calculations of the expected solar spectrum had to be performed and were compared to peaks detected by rocket measurements.&lt;ref name=Mewe&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mewe R |title=Calculations on the Solar Spectrum from 1 TO 60 Å |journal=Space Sci Rev|date=1972|page=666 |issue=4-6|doi=10.1007/BF00213502 |volume=13|bibcode = 1972SSRv...13..666M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early X-ray detecting satellites==
[[Image:Polar line drawing.jpg|thumb|100px|The Polar satellite (line drawing) is the sister ship of the [[WIND (spacecraft)|WIND satellite]].]] 
The Global Geospace Science (GGS) [[Polar (satellite)|Polar Satellite]] was a [[NASA]] science [[spacecraft]] launched at 06:23:59.997 EST on February 24, 1996, aboard a [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[Delta II]] 7925-10 rocket from launch pad 2W at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[Lompoc]], [[California]], to observe the [[Earth]]'s polar [[magnetosphere]]. Polar is in a highly elliptical orbit, at an 86° [[inclination]] with an [[orbital period]] of ~18 hrs.  It gathers multi-wavelength imaging (including X-ray) of the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], and measures the entry of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] into the polar magnetosphere and the geomagnetic tail, the flow of plasma to and from the [[ionosphere]], and the deposition of particle energy in the ionosphere and upper [[atmosphere]].

Bhaskara was the second [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO) satellite. It was launched on June 7, 1979, with a modified [[SS-5 Skean]] IRBM plus upper stage from [[Kapustin Yar]] in the Soviet Union. A secondary objective was to conduct X-ray astronomy investigations. Bhaskara 2 was launched on November 20, 1981, from Kapustin Yar like its predecessor also in size, mass and design may have conducted X-ray astronomy investigations.

Orbiting Solar Observatory ([[OSO 8]]) was launched on June 21, 1975. While OSO 8's primary objective was to observe the Sun, four instruments were dedicated to observations of other celestial X-ray sources brighter than a few milliCrab. A sensitivity of 0.001 of the Crab nebula source (= 1 "mCrab"). [[OSO 8]] ceased operations on October 1, 1978.
[[Image:Signe3.gif|thumb|200px|The Signe 3 spacecraft is operated by the Centre D'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements, Toulouse, France.]]
[[Signe 3]] (launched on June 17, 1977) was part of the [[Soviet Union]]'s Intercosmos program.

Almost from the beginning of satellite X-ray studies the Soviet Union began placing a large number of solar X-ray satellites into orbit, including those of the [[Intercosmos]] series.

The third US [[Third Small Astronomy Satellite|Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-3)]] was launched on May 7, 1975, with 3 major scientific objectives: 1) determine bright X-ray source locations to an accuracy of 15 arcseconds; 2) study selected sources over the energy range 0.1-55 keV; and 3) continuously search the sky for X-ray novae, flares, and other transient phenomena. It was a spinning satellite with pointing capability. SAS 3 was the first to discover X-rays from a highly magnetic WD binary system, AM Her, discovered X-rays from Algol and HZ 43, and surveyed the [[Diffuse X-ray background#Soft diffuse X-ray background|soft X-ray background]] (0.1-0.28 keV).

To conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy and solar physics among others the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO) built [[Aryabhata (satellite)|Aryabhata]]. It was launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1975, from [[Kapustin Yar]]. A power failure halted experiments after 4 days in orbit.

Following on the success of [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] (SAS 1), NASA launched the [[Second Small Astronomy Satellite]] SAS 2. It was launched from the San Marco platform off the coast of Kenya, Africa, into a nearly equatorial orbit.
[[Image:Thor Delta-1A small.gif|thumb|200px|The satellites launched with the Thor-Delta rocket system became known as the TD satellites. TD-1A was successfully launched on March 11, 1972, from Vandenberg Air Force Base (March 12 in Europe).]]
[[TD-1A]] was put in a nearly circular polar sun-synchronous orbit, with apogee 545&amp;nbsp;km, perigee 533&amp;nbsp;km, and inclination 97.6°. It was ESRO's first 3-axis stabilized satellite, with one axis pointing to the Sun to within ±5°. The optical axis was maintained perpendicular to the solar pointing axis and to the orbital plane. It scanned the entire celestial sphere every 6 months, with a great circle being scanned every satellite revolution. After about 2 months of operation, both of the satellite's tape recorders failed. A network of ground stations was put together so that real-time telemetry from the satellite was recorded for about 60% of the time. After 6 months in orbit, the satellite entered a period of regular eclipses as the satellite passed behind the Earth—cutting off sunlight to the solar panels. The satellite was put into hibernation for 4 months, until the eclipse period passed, after which systems were turned back on and another 6 months of observations were made. [[TD-1A]] was primarily a UV mission however it carried both a cosmic X-ray and a gamma-ray detector. TD-1A reentered on January 9, 1980.

To continue the intensive X-ray investigation of the Sun and the [[Diffuse X-ray background|cosmic X-ray background]], [[OSO 7]] was launched on September 29, 1971. [[OSO 7]] made the first observation of solar gamma-ray line emission, due to electron/positron annihilation at 511 keV, from a solar flare in April 1972.

[[Cosmos 428]] was launched by the USSR into Earth orbit on June 24, 1971, and recovered July 6, 1971. The orbit characteristics: apogee/perigee/inclination 208&amp;nbsp;km, 271&amp;nbsp;km, and 51.8°, respectively. It was a military satellite on which X-ray astronomy experiments had been added. There was a scintillation spectrometer sensitive to X-rays &gt;30 keV, with a 2° × 17° field of view. In addition, there was an X-ray telescope which operated in the range 2-30 keV. Cosmos 428 detected several X-ray sources which were correlated to already identified [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] point sources.

Like the previous Vela 5 satellites, the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela 6]] nuclear test detection satellites were part of a program run jointly by the Advanced Research Projects of the U. S. Department of Defense and the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, managed by the U. S. Air Force. The twin spacecraft, [[Vela (satellite)#Vela 6A and 6B|Vela 6A and 6B]], were launched on April 8, 1970. Data from the Vela 6 satellites were used to look for correlations between gamma-ray bursts and X-ray events. At least 2 good candidates were found, GB720514 and GB740723. The X-ray detectors failed on Vela 6A on March 12, 1972, and on Vela 6B on January 27, 1972.

[[OSO 6]] was launched on August 9, 1969.&lt;ref name=Hoff&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hoff HA |title=Exosat - the new extrasolar X-ray observatory |journal=J Brit Interplan Soc |date=Aug 1983 |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=363–7 |bibcode=1983JBIS...36..363H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its orbital period was ~95 min.&lt;ref name=LochnerGibb&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sixth Orbit Solar Observatory (OSO-6) |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/sats_n_data/missions/oso6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft had a spin rate of 0.5 rps. On board was a hard X-ray detector (27-189 keV) with a 5.1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; NaI(Tl) scintillator, collimated to 17° × 23° FWHM. The system had 4 energy channels (separated 27-49-75-118-189 keV). The detector spun with the spacecraft on a plane containing the Sun direction within ± 3.5°. Data were read with alternate 70 ms and 30 ms integrations for 5 intervals every 320 ms.&lt;ref name=LochnerGibb/&gt;

The Vela satellites 5A and 5B, launched on May 23, 1969, are responsible for significant discoveries of [[gamma-ray burst]]s and [[astronomical X-ray sources]] including [[V 0332+53]].

[[OSO 5]] was launched on January 22, 1969, and lasted until July 1975. It was the 5th satellite put into orbit as part of the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] program. This program was intended to launch a series of nearly identical satellites to cover an entire 11-year solar cycle. The circular orbit had an altitude of 555&amp;nbsp;km and an inclination of 33°. The spin rate of the satellite was 1.8 s. The data produced a spectrum of the diffuse background over the energy range 14-200 keV.

[[Cosmos 215]] was launched April 19, 1968 and contained an X-ray experiment. Orbit characteristics: 261 × 426&amp;nbsp;km, at an inclination of 48.5°. The orbital period was ~ 91 minutes. It was intended primarily to perform solar studies, but did detect some non-solar X-ray events. It reentered the atmosphere on June 30, 1968.

OGO 5 was launched on March 4, 1968. The satellite, primarily devoted to Earth observation, was in a highly elliptical initial orbit with a 272&amp;nbsp;km perigee and a 148,228&amp;nbsp;km apogee. The orbital inclination was 31.1°. The satellite took 3796 minutes to complete one orbit. The Energetic Radiations from Solar Flares experiment was operational from March 1968 - June 1971. Primarily devoted to solar observations, it detected at least 11 cosmic X-ray bursts in time coincidence with gamma-ray bursts seen by other instruments. The detector was a 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm thick NaI(Tl) crystal with a 9.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area. Data were accumulated into energy ranges of: 9.6-19.2, 19.2-32, 32-48, 48-64, 64-80, 80-104, 104-128, and &gt; 128 keV. The data were sampled for 1.15 seconds once every 2.3 seconds.

The fourth successful [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]], [[OSO 4]], was launched on October 18, 1967. The objectives of the OSO 4 satellite were to perform solar physics experiments above the atmosphere and to measure the direction and intensity over the entire celestial sphere in UV, X, and gamma radiation. The OSO 4 platform consisted of a sail section (which pointed 2 instruments continuously toward the Sun) and a wheel section which spun about an axis perpendicular to the pointing direction of the sail (which contained 7 experiments). The spacecraft performed normally until a second tape recorder failed in May 1968. OSO 4 was put into a "standby" mode in November 1969. It could be turned on only for recording special events in real-time. One such event occurred on March 7, 1970, during a solar eclipse. The spacecraft became totally inoperable on December 7, 1971.

The first USA satellite which detected cosmic X-rays was the Third Orbiting Solar Observatory, or [[OSO-3]], launched on March 8, 1967. It was intended primarily to observe the Sun, which it did very well during its 2-year lifetime, but it also detected a flaring episode from the source Sco X-1 and measured the [[Diffuse X-ray background|diffuse cosmic X-ray background]].

Solar X-ray bursts were observed by [[OSO 2]] and an effort was made to map the entire celestial sphere for direction and intensity of X-radiation.

OGO 1, the first of the [[Orbiting Geophysical Observatory|Orbiting Geophysical Observatories]] (OGOs), was successfully launched from Cape Kennedy on September 5, 1964, and placed into an initial orbit of 281 × 149,385&amp;nbsp;km at 31° inclination. A secondary objective was to detect gamma-ray bursts from the Sun in the energy range 80 keV - 1 MeV. The experiment consisted of 3 CsI crystals surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence shield. Once every 18.5 seconds, integral intensity measurements were made in each of 16 energy channels which were equally spaced over the 0.08-1 MeV range. OGO 1 was completely terminated on November 1, 1971. Although the satellite did not achieve its goals due to electrical interference and secular degradation, searching back through the data after the discovery of cosmic gamma-ray bursts by the Vela satellites revealed the detection of one or more such events in the OGO 1 data.

The first in a series of 8 successfully launched [[Orbiting Solar Observatory|Orbiting Solar Observatories]] ([[OSO 1]], launched on March 7, 1963) had as its primary mission to measure solar electromagnetic radiation in the UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regions.

The SOLar RADiation satellite program (SOLRAD) was conceived in the late 1950s to study the Sun's effects on Earth, particularly during periods of heightened solar activity.&lt;ref name=Calderwood&gt;{{cite web |author=Calderwood TD |title=Highlights of NRL's First 75 Years |url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/NewsRoom/images/75highlights.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solrad 1]] is launched on June 22, 1960, aboard a [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor Able]] from [[Cape Canaveral]] at 1:54&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT.&lt;ref name=Dick&gt;{{cite web |author=Dick SJ |title=June 2005 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/chronologies/jun%202005.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the world's first orbiting astronomical observatory, [[Solrad 1]] determined that radio fade-outs were caused by solar X-ray emissions.&lt;ref name=Calderwood/&gt;

[[Hitomi (satellite)|Hitomi]], formerly known as Astro-H, was a Japanese satellite which attempted to re-fly the microcalorimeter that failed on the Suzaku mission, along with hard-X-ray and soft-gamma instruments. It launched successfully on February 17, 2016.  However, spacecraft controllers lost communications with Hitomi on March 26, and declared the spacecraft lost April 28.

==Proposed (future) X-ray observatory satellites==

===eROSITA and ART-XC===
Among the contracts negotiated in August 2009 at the MAKS International Aviation and Space Salon there was an agreement signed by the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The contract details the creation of the Orbital Astrophysics Observatory [[Spectrum-X-Gamma]] (SXG) initially planned to be launched in 2012.&lt;ref name="russianspaceweb.com"&gt;[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/spektr_rg.html Spektr-RG to expand horizons of X-ray astronomy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302085013/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/spektr_rg.html |date=March 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015 plans call for a 2016 launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA eROSITA], 26.05.2015&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|February 2016}} it is planned to launch in Sept 2017.&lt;ref name="russianspaceweb.com"/&gt;

According to Mikhail Pavlinsky, deputy head of the Space Research Institute (SPI), the total project cost nears €50 million. Under the agreement, Germany will provide the main of the two X-ray telescopes (eROSITA), while Russia will install it on its platform, prepare the spacecraft, and take care of all related issues. Russia will also install an additional telescope (ART-XC) on this platform.

The new observatory will help scientists perform an all-sky scan survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/science/tech/16-09-2009/109313-telescope-0 New X-Ray Telescopes Search for Galaxy Clusters and Massive Black Holes], 16.09.2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===ATHENA===
[[Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics]] was selected in 2013 as a second large mission of the [[Cosmic Vision]] programme.&lt;ref name="l2mission"&gt;{{Cite web | title = ESA's new vision to study the invisible universe| publisher = ESA | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ESA_s_new_vision_to_study_the_invisible_Universe |accessdate = 8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be one hundred times more sensitive than the best of existing X-ray telescopes.&lt;ref name="BBCAthenaBuild"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28053831|title=Athena: Europe plans huge X-ray space telescope|first1=Jonathan|last1=Amos|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Orbiter===
The [[Solar Orbiter]] (SOLO) will approach to 62 solar radii to view the solar atmosphere with high spatial resolution in visible, XUV, and X-rays. The nominally 6 yr mission will be from an elliptical orbit around the Sun with perihelion as low as 0.28 AU and with increasing inclination (using gravity assists from Venus) up to more than 30° with respect to the solar equator. The Orbiter will deliver images and data from the polar regions and the side of the Sun not visible from Earth.&lt;ref name=solarorbiter&gt;{{cite web |title=ESA Science &amp; Technology: Solar Orbiter |url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch date, if selected, could be Jan 2017.

===Astro-H2===
In July 2016 there were discussions between JAXA and NASA on launching a satellite to replace the Hitomi telescope lost in 2016.  The launch goal is 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foust|first1=Jeff|title=NASA may build replacement instrument for Japanese astronomy mission|url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-may-build-replacement-instrument-for-japanese-astronomy-mission/|website=SpaceNews|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kruesi|first1=Liz|title=JAXA may remake its X-ray observatory Hitomi for a 2020 launch|url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2016/07/jaxa-may-remake-its-x-ray-observatory-hitomi-for-a-2020-launch|website=Astronomy.com|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International X-ray Observatory===
[[International X-ray Observatory]] (IXO) was a cancelled observatory. a result of the merging of NASA's [[Constellation-X]] and ESA/JAXA's [[XEUS]] mission concepts. It was planned to feature a single large X-ray mirror with a 3 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; collecting area and 5" angular resolution, and a suite of instrumentation, including a wide field imaging detector, a hard X-ray imaging detector, a high-spectral-resolution imaging spectrometer (calorimeter), a grating spectrometer, a high timing resolution spectrometer, and a polarimeter.

===Constellation-X===
[[Constellation-X]] was early proposal that was superseded by IXO. It was to provide high resolution X-ray spectroscopy to probe matter as it falls into a black hole, as well as probe the nature of dark matter and dark energy by observing the formation of clusters of galaxies.
