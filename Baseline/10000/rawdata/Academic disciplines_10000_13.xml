[[File:15 bars multirest.png|thumb|Fifteen bar [[multirest]]]]

In [[musical notation]], a '''bar''' (or '''measure''') is a segment of time corresponding to a specific number of [[beat (music)|beats]] in which each beat is represented by a particular note value and the boundaries of the bar are indicated by vertical '''bar lines'''. Dividing music into bars provides regular reference points to pinpoint locations within a musical composition. It also makes written music easier to follow, since each bar of staff symbols can be read and played as a batch.&lt;ref name=ChordWizard&gt;{{cite web|last=ChordWizard Software|title=www.howmusicworks.org|url=http://www.howmusicworks.org/504/Meter-and-Rhythm/BarMeasure-Divisions|accessdate=11 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709024021/http://www.howmusicworks.org/504/Meter-and-Rhythm/BarMeasure-Divisions|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a piece consists of several bars of the same length, and in [[modern musical symbols|modern musical notation]] the number of beats in each bar is specified at the beginning of the score by the  [[time signature]].  In [[time signature#Simple vs. compound|simple time]], (such as {{music|time|3|4}}), the top figure indicates the number of beats per bar, while the bottom number indicates the note value of the beat (the beat has a [[quarter note]] value in the {{music|time|3|4}} example).

The word ''bar'' is more common in [[British English]], and the word ''measure'' is more common in [[Comparison of American and British English|American English]], although musicians generally understand both usages. In American English, although the words ''bar'' and ''measure'' are often used interchangeably, the correct use of the word 'bar' refers only to the vertical line itself, while the word 'measure' refers to the beats ''contained between bars''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Read|Read, Gardner]]. (1979) ''Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice'', 2nd ed., New York: Taplinger Publishing Company, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; In international usage, it is equally correct to speak of ''bar numbers'' and ''measure numbers'', e.g. ‘bars 9–16’ or ‘mm. 9–16’. Along the same lines, it is wise{{cn|date=January 2018}} to reserve the abbreviated form ‘bb. 3–4’ etc. for beats only; ''bars'' should be referred to by name in full.

The first metrically complete bar within a piece of music is called ‘bar 1’ or ‘m. 1’. When the piece begins with an [[anacrusis]] (an incomplete bar at the head of a piece of music), ‘bar 1’ or ‘m. 1’ is the following bar.

==Bar==
Originally, the word ''bar'' came from the vertical lines drawn through the staff to mark off metrical units and not the bar-like (i.e., rectangular) dimensions of a typical measure of music. In British English, these vertical lines  are called ''bar'', too, but often the term ''bar line'' is used in order to make the distinction clear. A ''double bar line'' (or ''double bar'') can consist of two single bar lines drawn close together, separating two [[Musical form|sections]] within a piece, or a bar line followed by a thicker bar line, indicating the end of a piece or movement. Note that ''double bar'' refers not to a type of ''bar'' (i.e., measure), but to a type of ''bar line''. Another term for the bar line denoting the end of a piece of music is ''music end''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dolmetsch.com/musicalsymbols.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208020519/http://dolmetsch.com/musicalsymbols.htm |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }} − Chart of Musical Symbols&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[repeat sign]]'' (or, ''repeat bar line''&lt;ref&gt;Nickol, Peter (2008). ''Learning to Read Music'', p.105. {{ISBN|1-84528-278-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) looks like the music end, but it has two dots, one above the other, indicating that the section of music that is before is to be repeated. The beginning of the repeated passage can be marked by a ''begin-repeat sign''; if this is absent the repeat is understood to be from the beginning of the piece or movement. This begin-repeat sign, if appearing at the beginning of a staff, does not act as a bar line because no bar is before it; its only function is to indicate the beginning of the passage to be repeated.

In music with a regular [[Metre (music)|meter]], bars function to indicate a periodic [[accent (music)|accent]] in the music, regardless of its duration. In music employing [[Time signature|mixed meters]], bar lines are instead used to indicate the beginning of rhythmic note groups, but this is subject to wide variation: some composers use dashed bar lines, others (including [[Hugo Distler]]) have placed bar lines at different places in the different parts to indicate varied groupings from part to part.

[[Igor Stravinsky]] said of bar lines:

{{Quote|The bar line is much, much more than a mere accent, and I don't believe that it can be simulated by an accent, at least not in my music.&lt;ref&gt;Winold, Allen (1975). "Rhythm in Twentieth-Century Music", ''Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music''. Wittlich, Gary (ed.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice–Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-049346-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bars and bar lines also indicate grouping: [[rhythm]]ically of beats within and between bars, within and between [[phrase (music)|phrases]], and on higher levels such as meter.

==History==

The earliest barlines, used in keyboard and [[vihuela]] music in the 15th and 16th centuries, didn't reflect a regular [[meter (music)|meter]] at all but were only section divisions, or in some cases marked off every beat.

Barlines began to be introduced into ensemble music in the late 16th century but continued to be used irregularly for a time. Not until the mid-17th century were barlines used in the modern style with every measure being the same length, and they began to be associated with time signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Dictionary of Music, Second ed. (1972), "Barline"&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern editions of early music that was originally notated without barlines sometimes use a [[mensurstrich]] as a compromise.

== Hypermeasure ==
&lt;!--[[Hypermeasure]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
&lt;!--this image displayed wider than 400px for clarity--&gt;
[[Image:Hypermeter.png|thumb|center|450px|Hypermeter: 4 beat measure, 4 measure hypermeasure, and 4 hypermeasure verses. Hyperbeats in red.]]

A '''hypermeasure''', large-scale or high-level measure, or measure-group is a [[meter (music)|metric unit]] in which, generally, each regular measure is one beat (actually [[Beat (music)#Hyperbeat|hyperbeat]]) of a larger meter. Thus a beat is to a measure as a measure/hyperbeat is to a hypermeasure. Hypermeasures must be larger than a notated bar, perceived as a unit, consist of a pattern of strong and weak beats, and along with adjacent hypermeasures, which must be of the same length, create a sense of [[hypermeter]]. The term was coined by [[Edward T. Cone]] in ''Musical Form and Musical Performance'' (New York: Norton, 1968),&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Deborah (2005). ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', p.18-19 and "Glossary", p.329. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is similar to the less formal notion of a [[Phrase (music)|phrase]].

'''Barry Bozeman''' is a professor at [[Arizona State University]] where he is Director, Center for Organization Research and Design, and Arizona Centennial Professor of Technology Policy and Public Management.  He specializes in two disparate fields, [[organizational theory|organization theory]] and [[technology policy|science and technology policy]].

== Early life and education ==
Bozeman was born in Birmingham, Alabama on January 18, 1947 to Glenn Bozeman and Audrey J. Bozeman (née Martin).  His mother was a full-time homemaker and this father a construction worker. His early life was characterized by much family relocation, resulting in his attending 21 different schools before the 7th grade.  In 1960, the family settled down in West Palm Beach Florida and Bozeman graduated from Palm Beach High School in 1964.  He attended [[Palm Beach State College|Palm Beach High Junior College]], in Lake Worth Florida, (now Palm Beach State College), graduating in 1966.  Bozeman played on the varsity baseball team at Palm Beach Junior College where he had the distinction of scoring the first run in the new team’s history.

== Career ==
In 1970, Bozeman entered the doctoral program in political science at [[Ohio State University]], focusing on public policy studies.  He graduated in 1973 and, that same year, began as an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gatech.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, he began specializing in Science and Technology Policy and in 1974, as part of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, took a position as an analyst in the [https://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=CISE National Science Foundation’s Division of Information Science and Technology].  After returning briefly to Georgia Tech, Bozeman took a job at the [[University of Missouri|University of Missouri-Columbia]], where he was appointed in the Department of Political Science, as well as the new Department of Public Administration.  In 1977, Bozeman began a long stay (1977-1993) at [https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/ Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs].  While at Syracuse, Bozeman was the Director of the Doctoral Program (1979-1986) and was the founding director of the Center for Technology and Information Policy. He moved in 1993 to be the first full-time director of the new School of Public Policy at Georgia Tech and was later appointed as Regent’s Professor, the first social scientist to become a Regent’s Professor at Georgia Tech. In 2006, Bozeman moved to [http://www.uga.edu/ University of Georgia] where he became the first holder of the [https://spa.asu.edu/about_us/directory/faculty-profiles/barry-bozeman Department of Public Administration and Policy’s Ander Crenshaw Chair in Public Policy].&lt;ref&gt;https://spa.asu.edu/about_us/directory/faculty-profiles/barry-bozeman&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Bozeman moved to Arizona State University where he is Arizona Centennial Professor of Technology Policy and Public Management and Director of the Center for Organization Research and Design.&lt;ref&gt;https://spa.asu.edu/about_us/directory/faculty-profiles/barry-bozeman&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly contributions ==
Bozeman’s chief contributions to organization theory and public administration include:

*The theory of “dimensional publicness,” showing all organizations are affected by the constraints and endowment of political authority and of market authority and that behavior can be predicted from the mix of these forces.
*The normative “public value theory,” set as an alternative to market failure theory and suggesting that public values can be attained by a variety of institutions, public and private, acting separately or together. 
*Theory and empirical research on organizational red tape and bureaucratic pathologies.

Bozeman’s chief contributions to science and technology policy include:
*Research and theory on technology transfer, suggesting that a wide variety of outcome measures should be embraced (“contingent theory of effectiveness”) rather than solely short-term market impacts.
*Research and theory on scientific collaboration, both at the level of the individual researcher and the scientific organization or research center.

== Personal life ==
Barry Bozeman and his wife Monica Gaughan live in Tempe, Arizona.  Dr. Gaughan, a sociologist, is a faculty member at Arizona State University. Bozeman has two children from an earlier marriage, a son John and a daughter Brandyn.

Canisius' mascot is the Golden Griffin. The use of a griffin arose from the fact that Robert de La Salle who explored Lake Erie in a ship named Le Griffon had received a Jesuit education. The college adopted the griffin in 1932, after Charles A. Brady ('33) wrote a story in a Canisius publication honoring Buffalo's centennial year as a city. Brady wrote about Rene-Robert LaSalle's [[Le Griffon]], which was built in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. The griffin was first used on the La Salle medal in 1932 and from there spread to the college newspaper and sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;"THE NAME GAME; NICKNAMES FOR LOCAL TEAMS PASS THE TEST."

It represents values such as courage, boldness, intelligence, and strength befitting students and athletes alike.

The College was also the first home field of the [[Buffalo All-Americans]] of the early [[National Football League]]. Around 1917 Buffalo manager [[Barney Lepper]] signed a lease for the team to play their home games at Canisius College. The All-Americans played games at Canisius before relocating to [[Offermann Stadium|Bison Stadium]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | url=http://www.buffalonian.com/history/industry/sports/buffforgotchampI.html | title=Buffalo's Forgotten Champions | first=Jeffery | last=Miller | isbn= 978-1413450057 | publisher=Xlibris Corp  | year=2002}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Legacy of Leadership: The Campaign for Canisius College was the largest fund-raising initiative in the college's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2007/09/24/daily10.html | title=Canisius campaign seeks $90M | website=Bizjournals.com|date=2007-09-24|accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the $90 million goal, $47 million was designated to fund the creation of an interdisciplinary science center at the college.  The undertaking created a vital physical and visual connection between various parts of the campus. Included in this program was the full acquisition of a 1,500 space parking garage which provided room for additional commuter students. The college announced on November 20, 2008 the acquisition of the building from The Uniland Partnership of Delaware LP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2008/11/17/daily41.html | title=Canisius buys Main Street site for $18.45M| website=Bizjournals.com|accessdate=2016-02-25|date=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Legacy of Leadership: The Campaign for Canisius concluded on May 31, 2012 and surpassed its goal by $5.5 million.  Phase I of the college's interdisciplinary science center (Science Hall) opened in August 2012.

'''Carving''' is the act of using [[tool]]s to shape something from a material by scraping away portions of that material. The technique can be applied to any material that is solid enough to hold a form even when pieces have been removed from it, and yet soft enough for portions to be scraped away with available tools. Carving, as a means for making [[sculpture]], is distinct from methods using soft and malleable materials like [[clay]], [[fruit]], and melted [[glass]], which may be shaped into the desired forms while soft and then harden into that form. Carving tends to require much more work than methods using malleable materials.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Marcus Mendelowitz, ''Children Are Artists: An Introduction to Children's Art for Teachers and Parents'' (1953), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinds of carving include:
* [[Bone carving]]
* [[Chip carving]]
* [[Fruit carving]]
* Gourd carving or [[gourd art]]
* Ice carving or [[ice sculpture]]
* [[Ivory carving]]
* [[Stone carving]]
** [[Petroglyph]]
* [[Vegetable carving]]
**[[Thaeng yuak]] (Banana stalk carving)
* [[Wood carving]]
* [[Hobo nickel]]
* Tree carving
** [[Arborglyph]]

There have been a variety of '''Christian views on poverty and wealth'''. At one end of the spectrum is a view which casts wealth and materialism as an evil to be avoided and even combatted.  At the other end is a view which casts prosperity and well-being as a blessing from God. 

Many taking the former position address the topic in relation to the modern [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal capitalism]] that shapes the Western world. [[Americans|American]] [[theologian]] [[John B. Cobb]] has argued that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern View of Economics |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |first=John B. |last=Cobb, Jr. |accessdate=2011-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906075839/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish people|Scottish]] theologian Jack Mahoney has characterized the saying of Jesus in {{bibleref|Mark|10:23–27}} as having "imprinted themselves so deeply on the Christian community through the centuries that those who are well off, or even comfortably off, often feel uneasy and troubled in conscience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Companion encyclopedia of theology |first=Jack |last=Mahoney |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1995 |page=759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians argue that a proper understanding of Christian teachings on wealth and poverty needs to take a larger view where the accumulation of wealth is not the central focus of one's life but rather a resource to foster the "good life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Church and Society: Orthodox Christian Perspectives, Past Experiences, and Modern Challenges |first=George P. |last=Liacopulos |publisher=Somerset Hall Press |year=2007 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xxY3gfmzdwwC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Christianity+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780977461059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[David W. Miller]] has constructed a three-part rubric which presents three prevalent attitudes among Protestants towards wealth.  According to this rubric, Protestants have variously viewed wealth as: (1) an offense to the Christian faith (2) an obstacle to faith and (3) the outcome of faith.&lt;ref name="Miller2007"&gt;Miller, David W. "Wealth Creation as Integrated with Faith: A Protestant Reflection" Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Views on the Creation of Wealth April 23–24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth and faith==

===Wealth as an offense to faith===

According to historian Alan S. Kahan, there is a strand of Christianity that views the wealthy man as "especially sinful". In this strand of Christianity, Kahan asserts, the day of judgment is viewed as a time when "the social order will be turned upside down and ... the poor will turn out to be the ones truly blessed."&lt;ref name=Kahan43&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S. |last=Kahan |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote "Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things."

David Miller suggests that this view is similar to that of the third century [[Manichaeanism|Manicheans]] who saw the spiritual world as being good and the material world as evil with the two being in irreconcilable conflict with each other.&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt;  Thus, this strand of Christianity exhorts Christians to renounce material and worldly pleasures in order to follow Jesus.  As an example, Miller cites Jesus' injunction to his disciples to "take nothing for the journey."{{bibleref2|Mark|6:8–9}}

The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] advocate [[voluntary poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/daytext.cfm?TextID=150 |title=More About Holy Poverty. Which Is Voluntary Poverty. |author=[[Dorothy Day]] |date=February 1945 |work= |publisher=[[The Catholic Worker]] |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=A Penny a Copy: Readings from the Catholic Worker |first=Tom | last=Cornell |authorlink=Tom Cornell |first2=Robert | last2=Ellsberg|authorlink2=Robert Ellsberg |year=1995 |page=198 |publisher=Orbis Books |quote=At its deepest level voluntary poverty is a way of seeing the world and the things of the world.… The Gospels are quite clear: the rich man is told to sell all he has and give to the poor, for it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven. And we are clearly instructed that 'you can not serve God and Mammon'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians, such as [[New Monasticism|New Monastics]], may choose to reject personal wealth and follow an [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle, in part as a protest against "a church and public that embraces wealth, luxury and ostentatious power."&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin|title=The Encyclopedia Of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5V7oyy69zgC&amp;pg=PA307|accessdate=18 June 2012|year=2005|publisher=Wm.

According to David Miller, [[Martin Luther]] viewed Mammon (or the desire for wealth) as "the most common idol on earth".  Miller cites Jesus' encounter with the rich ruler {{bibleverse|Mark|10:17–31}} as an example of wealth being an obstacle to faith.  According to Miller, it is not the rich man's wealth per se that is the obstacle but rather the man's reluctance to give up that wealth in order to follow Jesus.  Miller cites [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s observation in [[First Epistle to Timothy|1st Timothy]] that, “people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction." {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:9}}.  Paul continues on with the observation that "the love of money is the root of all evil."
{{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:10}}  Miller emphasizes that "it is the love of money that is the obstacle to faith, not the money itself."&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!" The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is[a] to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the [[Eye of a needle#Christianity|eye of a needle]] than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kahan cites Jesus' injunction against amassing material wealth as an example that the "good [Christian] life was one of poverty and charity, storing up treasures in heaven instead of earth.&lt;ref name=Kahan43 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. {{bibleverse|Matthew|6|19:21}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jesus counsels his followers to remove from their lives those things which cause them to sin, saying "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to go with two hands into hell, where the fire never goes out." {{bibleref2|Mark|9:42–49}}.  In order to remove the desire for wealth and material possessions as an obstacle to faith, some Christians have taken vows of poverty.  Christianity has a long tradition of voluntary poverty which is manifested in the form of asceticism, charity and almsgiving.&lt;ref name=WellsQuash&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Christian Ethics |first1=Samuel |last1=Wells |first2=Ben |last2=Quash|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=244 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ezy6wZJHFCoC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Christian+land+wealth+usury#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20land%20wealth%20usury&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405152778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kahan argues that Christianity is unique because it sparked the beginning of a phenomenon which he calls the "Great Renunciation" in which "millions of people would renounce sex and money in God's name."&lt;ref name=Kahan43/&gt;

In [[Roman Catholicism]], poverty is one of the [[evangelical counsels]].  Pope [[Benedict XVI]] distinguishes "poverty ''chosen''" (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and "poverty ''to be fought''" (unjust and imposed poverty). He considers that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20090101_world-day-peace_en.htmlWorldPeaceDayAddress2009 Homily of His Holiness Benedict XVI]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[religious institute]]s also take a [[vow]] of extreme poverty. For example, the [[Franciscan]] orders have traditionally foregone all individual and corporate forms of ownership.

===Wealth as an outcome of faith===
One line of Protestant thinking views the pursuit of wealth as not only acceptable but as a religious calling or duty.  This perspective is generally ascribed to [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and [[Puritan]] theologies, which view hard work and frugal lifestyles as spiritual acts in themselves.  [[John Wesley]] was a strong proponent of gaining wealth, according to his famous "Sermon 50," in which he said, "gain all you can, save all you can and give all you can."&lt;ref name=Miller2007 /&gt; It is impossible to give to charity if one is poor; John Wesley and his Methodists were noted for their consistently large contributions to charity in the form of churches, hospitals and schools.  

Included among those who view wealth as an outcome of faith are modern-day preachers and authors who propound [[prosperity theology]], teaching that God promises wealth and abundance to those who will believe in him and follow his laws. Prosperity theology (also known as the "health and wealth gospel") is a [[Christianity|Christian]] religious belief whose proponents claim the [[Bible]] teaches that financial blessing is the will of [[God in Christianity|God]] for Christians. Most teachers of prosperity theology maintain that a combination of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], positive speech, and donations to specific Christian ministries will always cause an increase in material wealth for those who practice these actions. Prosperity theology is almost always taught in conjunction with [[continuationism]].

Prosperity theology first came to prominence in the [[United States]] during the [[Healing Revival]]s in the 1950s. Some commentators have linked the genesis of prosperity theology with the influence of the [[New Thought]] movement. It later figured prominently in the [[Word of Faith]] movement and 1980s [[televangelism]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, it became accepted by many influential leaders in the [[charismatic movement]] and has been promoted by Christian [[missionaries]] throughout the world. It has been harshly criticized by leaders of mainstream [[evangelicalism]] as a non-scriptural doctrine or as an outright [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]].

==Precursors to Christianity==

Professor [[Cosimo Perrotta]] describes the early Christian period as one which saw "the meeting and clash of three great cultures: the Classical, the Hebrew (of the Old Testament) and the Christian." Perrotta describes the cultures as having radically different views of money and wealth.  Whereas the Hebrew culture prized material wealth, the Classical and [[Christian culture]]s either held them in contempt or preached indifference to them.  However, Perrotta points out that the motivation of the Classical and Christian cultures for their attitudes were very different and thus the logical implications of the attitudes resulted in different outcomes.&lt;ref name=Perrotta43&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo |last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004  |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203694572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish attitudes in the Old Testament===
{{further|Jewish views of poverty, wealth and charity}}

Perrotta characterizes the attitude of the Jews as expressed in the Old Testament scriptures as being "completely different from the classical view."  He points out that servile and hired work was not scorned by the Jews of the Old Testament as it was by Greco-Roman thinkers.  Instead, such work was protected by biblical commandments to pay workers on time and not to cheat them.  The poor were protected from being exploited when in debt.  Perrotta asserts that the goal of these commandments was "not only to protect the poor but also to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands."  In essence, the poor man is "protected by God".  However, Perrotta points out that poverty is not admired nor is it considered a positive value by the writers of the Old Testament.  The poor are protected because the weak should be protected from exploitation.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44&gt;{{cite book |title=Consumption as an Investment: The fear of goods from Hesiod to Adam Smith|first=Cosimo |last=Perrotta |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004  |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2ogMXO-ZxbEC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20wealth%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203694572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perrotta points out that material wealth is highly valued in the Old Testament; the Hebrews seek it and God promises to bless them with it if they will follow his commandments.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt;  Joseph Francis Kelly writes that biblical writers leave no doubt that God enabled men such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Solomon to achieve wealth and that this wealth was a sign of divine favor.  However, Kelly also points out that the Old Testament insisted that the rich aid the poor.  Prophets such as Amos castigated the rich for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy.  In summary, Kelly writes that, "the Old Testament saw wealth as something good but warned the wealthy not to use their position to harm those with less.  The rich had an obligation to alleviate the sufferings of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World of the early Christians |first=Joseph Francis |last=Kelly |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=1997 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3Pw-n3puQwsC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22Old+Testament%22+attitudes+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Old%20Testament%22%20attitudes%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9780814653135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
{{quote|''Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.''|[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#6:20|Luke 6:20]]}}

===The Gospels===
Jesus explicitly condemns excessive love of wealth as an intrinsic evil in various passages in the Gospels, especially in Luke (Luke 16:14–15 being an especially clear example).  He also consistently warns of the danger of riches as a hindrance to favor with God; as in the [[Parable of the Sower]], where it is said:

:"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in; it chokes the Word, which becomes unfruitful"  – Mark 4:19.

Jesus makes [[Mammon]] a personification of riches, one in opposition to God, and which claims a person's service and loyalty as God does. But Jesus rejects the possibility of dual service on our part: for, he says, no one can serve both God and Mammon.

In the story of [[Jesus and the rich young man]] the young ruler's wealth inhibits him from following Jesus and thereby attaining the Kingdom. Jesus comments on the young man's discouragement thus:

:"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the [[eye of a needle]] than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."  Those who heard this were astonished, "Who then can be saved?", they asked.  Jesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God."   – Luke 19:23–27

In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Jesus exhorts his hearers to sell their earthly goods and give to the poor, and so provide themselves with "a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys" (Lk 12.33); and he adds "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Lk 12.34).

In [[The Parable of the Rich Fool]] Jesus tells the story of a rich man who decides to rest from all his labors, saying to himself:

:"And I will say to myself 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.' But God spoke to him, saying 'You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will get all that you have prepared for yourself?'" – Luke 12:16–20.

And Jesus adds, "This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God" (Lk 12.21).

[[Jesus and Zacchaeus]] (Lk 19.1–10) is an example of storing up heavenly treasure, and being rich toward God. The repentant tax collector Zacchaeus not only welcomes Jesus into his house but joyfully promises to give half of his possessions to the poor, and to rebate overpayments four times over if he defrauded anyone (Lk 19.8).

Luke strongly ties the right use of riches to discipleship; and securing heavenly treasure is linked with caring for the poor, the naked and the hungry, for God is supposed to have a special interest in the poor. This theme is consistent with God's protection and care of the poor in the Old Testament.

Thus, Jesus cites the words of the prophet Isaiah (Is:61.1–2) in proclaiming his mission:

:"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."  – Luke 4:18–19

Luke, as is well known, had a particular concern for the poor as the subjects of Jesus' compassion and ministry. In his version of the [[Beatitudes]], the poor are blessed as the inheritors of God's kingdom (Lk 6.20–23), even as the corresponding curses are pronounced to the rich (Lk 6.24–26).

God's special interest in the poor is also expressed in the theme of the eschatological "great reversal" of fortunes between the rich and the poor in [[The Magnificat]] (Lk 1.46–55):

:He has shown the might of his arm:
:and has scattered the proud, in the conceit of their hearts.
:He has pulled down the mighty from their thrones,
:and exalted the lowly.
:He has filled the hungry with good things;
:and the rich has sent empty away.
:—Luke 1:51–53

and in Jesus repeated use of the tag "many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first" (Mt 19.30, Mt 20.16, Mk 10.31 &amp; Lk 13.30) and similar figures (Mt 23.12, Lk 14.11 &amp; Lk 18.14).

In the [[Parable of the Wedding Feast]], it is "the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame" who become God’s honored guests, while others reject the invitation because of their earthly cares and possessions (Lk 14.7–14).

===Acts of the Apostles===

Luke’s concern for the rich and the poor continues in the Acts with a greater focus on the unity of the nascent Christian communities. The two famous passages (2.43–45; 4.32–37), which have been appealed to throughout history as the “normative ideal” of the [[common ownership|community of goods]] for Christians, rather describe the extent of fellowship (koinōnia) in Jerusalem community as a part of distinctive Christian identity. Acts also portrays both positive and negative uses of wealth: those who practiced almsgiving and generosity to the poor (9.36; 10.2, 4) and those who gave priority to money over the needs of others (5.1–11; 8.14–24).

===Epistles===
For Paul, riches mainly denotes the character and activity of God and Christ – spiritual blessings and/of salvation – (e.g., Rom. 2.4; 9.23; 2 Cor. 8.9; Eph. 1.7, 18; 2.4, 7) although he occasionally refers to typical Jewish piety and Greco-Roman moral teachings of the time, such as generosity (Rom. 12.8, 13; 2 Cor. 8.2; Eph. 4.28; 1 Tim. 6.17 ) and hospitality (1 Tim. 5.10) with warnings against pride (1 Tim. 6.17) and greed (1 Cor. 5.11; 1 Tim. 3.8). 1 Tim. 6.10 seems to reflect a popular Cynic-Stoic moral teaching of
the period: “the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” Paul’s focus of generosity is devoted to the collection for the church in Jerusalem (Gal. 2.10; 1 Cor. 16.1–4; 2 Cor 8.1 – 9.15; Rom. 15.25–31) as an important symbol of unity between Jewish and gentile believers with an appeal to material and spiritual reciprocity. It is also noteworthy that Paul's teaching in 1 Tim 6:17 implies there were rich believers in the Early Church.

A concept related to the accumlation of wealth is [[World (theology)#Christianity|Worldliness]], which is denounced by the Epistles of James and John:  "Don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God" (Ja 4.4). The first letter of John says, in a similar vein: "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 Jn 2:15).

The Epistle of James also stands out for its vehement condemnation of the oppressive rich, who were presumably outsiders to the Christian community, which mainly consisted of the poor. Adopting the [[Psalter]]'s convention of the “wicked rich” and the “pious poor” and adopting its voice, James indicts the rich with the sins of hoarding wealth, fraudulently withholding wages, corruption,  pride, luxury, covetousness and murder; and denounces the folly of their actions in the face of the imminent [[Day of Judgement]].

===Revelation===
Finally, the Revelation treats earthly riches and commercial activities with great ambivalence. While Jesus exposes the true poverty of the Laodicean church’s boast of wealth (3.17–18), he presents himself as the true source and dispenser of wealth (cf. 2 Cor. 8.13–15). Later, earthly riches and businesses activities are associated with the sins of Babylon, the earthly power of evil with self-accorded glory and luxury, whose fall is imminent (18.1–24). However, the Revelations also portrays the New Jerusalem with a lavish materialistic description, made of pure gold decorated with “every kind of precious stone” (21.18–19).

==Early Christianity==
[[File:Vespiolla Apostoli 3.jpg|thumb|240px|15th-century fresco of the Apostles, [[Turin]], Italy]]
Early Christianity appears to have adopted many of the ethical themes found in the Hebrew Bible.  However, the teachings of Jesus and his apostles as presented in the New Testament exhibit an "acute sensitivity to the needs of the disadvantaged" that Frederick sees as "adding a critical edge to Christian teaching where wealth and the pursuit of economic gain are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to business ethics |first=Robert |last=Frederick |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2002 |pages=292–93 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PDXVnfyKHBIC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+business#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20business&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405101028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Kahan points to the fact that Jesus was a poor man as emblematic of "a revolution in the way poverty and wealth were viewed."&lt;ref name=Kahan44&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S. |last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=44|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not to say that Christian attitudes borrowed nothing from its Greco-Roman and Jewish precursors.  Kahan acknowledges that, "Christian theology absorbed those Greco-Roman attitudes towards money that complemented its own."  However, as Kahan puts it, "Never before had any god been conceived of as poor."&lt;ref name=Kahan44 /&gt;  He characterizes Christian charity as being "different in kind from the generosity praised in the classical tradition."&lt;ref name=Kahan42&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S.|last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false|isbn=9781412828772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahan contrasts the attitudes of early Christians with those of classical thinkers such as Seneca.  The New Testament urges Christians to sell material possessions and give the money to the poor.  According to Kahan, the goal of Christian charity is equality, a notion which is absent in the Greco-Roman attitudes toward the poor.&lt;ref name=Kahan42/&gt;

Cosimo Perrotta characterizes the Christian attitude vis-a-vis poverty and work as being "much closer to the tradition of the Old Testament than to classical culture."&lt;ref name=Perrotta43 /&gt;  However, [[Irving Kristol]] suggests that Christianity's attitude towards wealth is markedly different from that of the Hebrews in the Old Testament.  Kristol asserts that traditional Judaism has no precepts that parallel the Christian assertion that it is difficult for a rich man to get into heaven.&lt;ref name=Kristol437&gt;{{cite book |title=Neoconservatism: the autobiography of an idea |first=Irving |last=Kristol |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |page=437 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S2nUuTagIw8C&amp;pg=PA437&amp;dq=Christian+attitudes+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20attitudes%20poverty&amp;f=false|isbn=9780028740218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perrotta characterizes Christianity as not disdaining material wealth as did classical thinkers such as [[Socrates]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|the Cynics]] and Seneca and yet not desiring it as the Old Testament writers did.&lt;ref name=Perrotta44 /&gt;

==Patristic era==

Many of the [[Church Fathers]] condemned private property and advocated the communal ownership of property as an ideal for Christians to follow.  However, they recognized early on that this was an ideal which was not practical in everyday life and viewed private property as a "necessary evil resulting from the fall of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of economics |first1=Richard Theodore |last1=Ely |first2=Thomas Sewall |last2=Adams |first3=Max Otto |last3=Lorenz |first4=Allyn Abbott |last4=Young |publisher=Macmillan |year=1920 |page=743 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TiYuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA743&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
American theologian [[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert Grant]] noted that, while almost all of the Church Fathers condemn the "love of money for its own sake and insist upon the positive duty of almsgiving", none of them seems to have advocated the general application of Jesus' counsel to the rich young man viz. to give away all of his worldly possessions in order to follow him.&lt;ref name=Grant49&gt;{{cite book |title=Augustus to Constantine: the rise and triumph of Christianity in the Roman world |first=Robert McQueen |last=Grant |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2004 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=d_vxEB7nT_QC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20fathers%20attitudes%20money%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9780664227722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] urged Christians to turn away from the desire for material wealth and success.  He argued that the accumulation of wealth was not a worthy goal for Christians.

[[Clement of Alexandria]] counselled that property be used for the good of the community, he sanctioned private ownership of property and the accumulation of wealth.&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;{{cite book |title=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |year=2006 |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MCcWhLmRo-cC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Christian+fathers+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781610164771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lactantius]] wrote that "the ownership of property contains the material of both vices and virtues but communism [communitas] contains nothing but license for vice."&lt;ref name=Grant49 /&gt;

==Medieval Europe==
{{further|Apostolic poverty}}
By the beginning of the medieval era, the Christian paternalist ethic was "thoroughly entrenched in the culture of Western Europe."  Individualist and materialist pursuits such as greed, avarice, and the accumulation of wealth were condemned as un-Christian.&lt;ref name=Hunt10&gt;{{cite book |title=Property and Prophets: The Evolution of Economic Institutions and Ideologies  |first=E.

Madeleine Gray describes the medieval system of social welfare as one that was "organized through the church and underpinned by ideas on the spiritual value of poverty.&lt;ref name=Gray119&gt;{{cite book |title=The Protestant Reformation: belief, practice, and tradition |first=Madeleine |last=Gray |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |year=2003 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z1qRnlLwWsgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Protestant+Reformation+money+wealth+poverty#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781903900116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kahan, Christian theologians regularly condemned merchants.  For example, he cites [[Honorius of Autun]] who wrote that merchants had little chance of going to heaven whereas farmers were likely to be saved.  He further cites [[Gratian]] who wrote that "the man who buys something in order that he may gain by selling it again unchanged and as he bought it, that man is of the buyers and sellers who are cast forth from God's temple."&lt;ref name=Kahan46&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism |first=Alan S.|last=Kahan|publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2009 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-o6gs82MLQC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Christianity+money+wealth+attitudes#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20money%20wealth%20attitudes&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the medieval era saw a change in the attitudes of Christians towards the accumulation of wealth.  [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined avarice not simply as a desire for wealth but as an ''immoderate'' desire for wealth.  Aquinas wrote that it was acceptable to have "external riches" to the extent that they were necessary for him to maintain his "condition of life".  This argued that the nobility had a right to more wealth than the peasantry.  What was unacceptable was for a person to seek to more wealth than was appropriate to one's station or aspire to a higher station in life.&lt;ref name=Kahan44 /&gt; The period saw fierce debates on [[Absolute Poverty of Christ|whether Christ owned property]].

The church evolved into the single most powerful institution in medieval Europe, more powerful than any single potentate.  The Church was so wealthy that, at one time, it owned as much as 20–30% of the land in Western Europe in an era when land was the primary form of wealth.  Over time, this wealth and power led to abuses and corruption.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Monasticism===
As early as the 6th and 7th centuries, the issue of property and move of wealth in the event of outside aggression had been addressed in monastic communities via agreements such as the [[Consensoria Monachorum]].&lt;ref name=Bishko &gt;Charles J. Bishko, "The Date and Nature of the Spanish Consensoria Monachorum", ''The American Journal of Philology'' Vol. 69, No. 4, 1948 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/290910] also at [http://libro.uca.edu/monastic/monastic2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= power &gt;''Topographies of power in the early Middle Ages'' by Frans Theuws, Mayke De Jong, Carine van Rhijn 2001 {{ISBN|90-04-11734-2}} p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; By the eleventh century, [[Benedictine]] monasteries had become wealthy, owing to the generous donations of monarchs and nobility.  Abbots of the larger monasteries achieved international prominence.  In reaction to this wealth and power, a reform movement arose which sought a simpler, more austere monastic life in which monks worked with their hands rather than acting as landlords over serfs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval panorama |first=Robert |last=Bartlett |publisher=Getty Publications |year=2001 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DjI5t3DE00wC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=monastic+communities+Christian+medieval#v=onepage&amp;q=monastic%20communities%20Christian%20medieval&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 13th century, [[mendicant orders]] such as the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Franciscans]] departed from the practice of existing religious orders by taking vows of extreme poverty and maintaining an active presence preaching and serving the community rather than withdrawing into monasteries. [[Francis of Assisi]] viewed poverty as a key element of the [[imitation of Christ]] who was "poor at birth in the manger, poor as he lived in the world, and naked as he died on the cross".&lt;ref name= Miles160 &gt;''The Word made flesh: a history of Christian thought'' by Margaret Ruth Miles 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0846-1}} pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt;

The visible public commitment of the Franciscans to poverty provided to the laity a sharp contrast to the wealth and power of the Church, provoking "awkward questions".&lt;ref name="Placher1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Carl Placher|author-link=William Placher |title=Readings in the History of Christian Theology: From its beginnings to the eve of the Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rya0v9bgwT8C&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=11 October 2011|date=15 April 1988|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-24057-8|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early attempts at reform===

Widespread corruption led to calls for reform which called into question the interdependent relationship of church and state power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=

===Usury===
{{main|Usury}}

[[File:UsuryDurer.jpg|right |thumb |Of Usury, from [[Sebastian Brant|Brant's]] ''Stultifera Navis'' ([[Narrenschiff|the Ship of Fools]]); [[woodcut]] attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]

[[Usury]] originally was the charging of [[interest]] on [[loan]]s; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as at a [[bureau de change]]. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law.  Today, usury commonly is the charging of unreasonable or relatively high rates of interest.

The first of the scholastics, [[Saint Anselm of Canterbury]], led the shift in thought that labeled charging interest the same as theft. Previously usury had been seen as a lack of charity.

St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the leading theologian of the Catholic Church, argued charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to "double charging", charging for both the thing and the use of the thing.

This did not, as some think, prevent investment. What it stipulated was that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all. This is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that "to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural". St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Reformation==

The rising capitalistic middle class resented the drain of their wealth to the church; in northern Europe, they supported local reformers against the corruption, rapacity and venality which they viewed as originating in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of commerce and industry |first=Cheesman Abiah|last=Herrick |publisher=Macmillan Co. |year=1917 |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BHVMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=medieval+Europe+Christian+church+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20Europe%20Christian%20church%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calvinism===

One school of thought attributes [[Calvinism]] with setting the stage for the later development of [[capitalism]] in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of [[usury]] and, implicitly, of profit in general.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Such a connection was advanced in influential works by [[R. H. Tawney]](1880–1962) and by [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920).

Calvin criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of [[Aristotle]]) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin's position is expressed in a letter to a friend quoted in {{cite book |last = Le Van Baumer | first = Franklin, editor | title = Main Currents of Western Thought: Readings in Western Europe Intellectual History from the Middle Ages to the Present | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven |year = 1978 | isbn = 0-300-02233-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puritanism==

For [[Puritan]]s, work was not simply arduous drudgery required to sustain life.  Joseph Conforti describes the Puritan attitude toward work as taking on "the character of a vocation — a calling through which one improved the world, redeemed time, glorified God, and followed life's pilgrimage toward salvation."&lt;ref name=Conforti42&gt;{{cite book |title=Saints and strangers: New England in British North America |first=Joseph A. |last=Conforti |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zsO6_qJ0s9UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Puritan+%22Stewardship+of+wealth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Puritan%20%22Stewardship%20of%20wealth%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9780801882531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gayraud Wilmore characterizes the Puritan social ethic as focused on the "acquisition and proper stewardship of wealth as outward symbols of God's favor and the consequent salvation of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=African American religious studies: an interdisciplinary anthology |first=Gayraud S. |last=Wilmore |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1989  |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-9vTPu5Z6QC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Puritan+%22Stewardship+of+wealth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Puritan%20%22Stewardship%20of%20wealth%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0822309262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Puritans were urged to be producers rather than consumers and to invest their profits to create more jobs for industrious workers who would thus be enabled to "contribute to a productive society and a vital, expansive church."  Puritans were counseled to seek sufficient comfort and economic self-sufficiency but to avoid the pursuit of luxuries or the accumulation of material wealth for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Conforti42 /&gt;

==The rise of capitalism==

In two journal articles published in 1904–05, German sociologist [[Max Weber]] propounded a thesis that Reformed (i.e., Calvinist) Protestantism had engendered the character traits and values that under-girded modern capitalism. The English translation of these articles were published in book form in 1930 as ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. Weber argued that [[capitalism]] in northern Europe evolved because the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) [[Protestant work ethic|ethic]] influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprises]] and engaging in [[trade]] and the accumulation of [[wealth]] for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]] that influenced the development of [[capitalism]].

Weber's work focused scholars on the question of the uniqueness of Western civilization and the nature of its economic and social development.  Scholars have sought to explain the fact that economic growth has been much more rapid in Northern and Western Europe and its overseas offshoots than in other parts of the world including those that where the Catholic and Orthodox churches have been dominant over Protestantism.  Some have observed that explosive economic growth occurred at roughly the same time, or soon after, these areas experienced the rise of Protestant religions.  Stanley Engerman asserts that, although some scholars may argue that the two phenomena are unrelated, many would find it difficult to accept such a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism |url=http://eh.net/node/2724 |first=Stanley L. |last=Engerman |date=2000-02-29 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Chamberlain wrote that "Christianity tends to lead to a capitalistic mode of life whenever siege conditions do not prevail... [capitalism] is not Christian in and by itself; it is merely to say that capitalism is a material by-product of the Mosaic Law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roots of Capitalism |first=John |last=Chamberlain |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rodney Stark]] propounds the theory that Christian rationality is the primary driver behind the success of capitalism and the Rise of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success|first=Rodney|last=Stark|location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2005 |isbn=1-4000-6228-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q9j6OoeWqK4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Christianity+capitalism#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John B. Cobb]] argues that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"/&gt;

==Social justice==
{{main|Social justice}}

[[File:Thomas Aquinas in Stained Glass crop.jpg|thumb|right|Much of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s theology dealt with issues of social justice.]]
[[Social justice]] generally refers to the idea of creating a society or institution that is based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and solidarity, that understands and values [[human rights]], and that recognizes the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="EducationSocialJustice"&gt;{{cite book |title=Education and Social Justice |first1=Joseph I. |last1=Zajda |first2=S. |last2=Majhanovich |first3=V. |last3=Rust |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |isbn=1-4020-4721-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCZH-x9FTWoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=education+and+social+justice+zajda#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NursingEthics"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nursing ethics: across the curriculum and into practice |first1=Janie B. |last1=Butts |first2=Karen |last2=Rich |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7637-4735-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DmUBBCVjW_gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Nursing+ethics%22+Butts+Rich+Jones#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nursing%20ethics%22%20Butts%20Rich%20Jones&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term and modern concept of "social justice" was coined by the [[Jesuit]] [[Luigi Taparelli]] in 1840 based on the teachings of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] and given further exposure in 1848 by [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]].&lt;ref name="EducationSocialJustice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NursingEthics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Battleground criminal justice by Gregg Barak, Greenwood publishing group 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engineering and Social Justice By Donna Riley, Morgan and Claypool Publishers 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-59829-626-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spirituality, social justice, and language learning By David I.

Ryan]], who initiated the concept of a [[living wage]]. [[Father Coughlin]] also used the term in his publications in the 1930s and the 1940s. It is a part of [[Catholic social teaching]], [[Social Gospel]] from Episcopalians and is one of the [[Four Pillars of the Green Party]] upheld by [[Global Greens|green parties worldwide]]. Social justice as a secular concept, distinct from religious teachings, emerged mainly in the late twentieth century, influenced primarily by philosopher [[John Rawls]]. Some tenets of social justice have been adopted by those on the [[leftist|left]] of the [[political spectrum]].

According to Kent Van Til, the view that wealth has been taken from the poor by the rich implies that the redistribution of that wealth is more a matter of restitution than of theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Poverty and Morality: Religious and Secular Perspectives |first1=William A. |last1=Galston |first2=Peter H. |last2=Hoffenberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010  |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VyzuGet8080C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Christianity+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianity%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false|isbn=9781139491068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic social teaching===
{{main|Catholic social teaching}}

[[Catholic social teaching]] is a body of doctrine developed by the [[Catholic Church]] on matters of [[poverty]] and [[wealth]], [[economics]], [[social organization]] and the role of the [[state (polity)|state]].  Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 [[encyclical|encyclical letter]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', which advocated economic [[distributism]] and condemned [[socialism]].

According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], its purpose "is simply to help purify reason and to contribute, here and now, to the acknowledgment and attainment of what is just…. [The Church] has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice…cannot prevail and prosper",&lt;ref&gt;(Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est, 28).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pope John Paul II]], its foundation "rests on the threefold cornerstones of human dignity, solidarity and subsidiarity".&lt;ref&gt;(John Paul II, 1999 Apostolic Exhortation, Ecclesia in America, 55).&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns echo elements of [[Jewish law]] and the prophetic books of the [[Old Testament]], and recall the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] recorded in the [[New Testament]], such as his declaration that "whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of Mine, you have done for Me."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic social teaching is distinctive in its consistent critiques of [[modernity|modern]] social and political ideologies both of the left and of the right: [[liberalism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', § 99 ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fascism]], and [[Nazism]] have all been condemned, at least in their pure forms, by several popes since the late nineteenth century.

===Marxism===

Irving Kristol posits that one reason that those who are "experiencing a Christian impulse, an impulse toward the ''imitatio Christi'', would lean toward socialism ... is the attitude of Christianity toward the poor. "&lt;ref name=Kristol437 /&gt;

[[Arnold Toynbee]] characterized Communist ideology as a "Christian heresy" in the sense that it focused on a few elements of the faith to the exclusion of the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Study of History|first=Arnold |last=Toynbee |year=1961 |page=545 |quote=The Communist ideology was a Christian heresy in the sense that it had singled out several elements in Christianity and had concentrated on these to the exclusion of the rest.

Although King criticized the Soviet Marxist–Leninist Communist regime sharply, he nonetheless commented that Marx's devotion to a classless society made him almost Christian. Tragically, said King, Communist regimes created "new classes and a new lexicon of injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=From civil rights to human rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the struggle for economic justice |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2007 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8k6btUYR68C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Martin+Luther+King+poverty+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q=Martin%20Luther%20King%20poverty%20wealth&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian socialism===
{{main|Christian socialism}}

[[Christian socialism]] generally refers to those on the [[Christian left]] whose politics are both [[Christian]] and [[socialist]] and who see these two philosophies as being interrelated. This category can include [[Liberation theology]] and the doctrine of the [[social gospel]].

The ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' [[encyclical]] of [[Leo XIII]] (1891) was the starting point of a [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic doctrine]] on social questions that has been expanded and updated over the course of the 20th century. Despite the introduction of social thought as an object of religious thought, ''Rerum novarum'' explicitly rejects what it calls "the main tenet of socialism":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Hence, it is clear that the main tenet of socialism, community of goods, must be utterly rejected, since it only injures those whom it would seem meant to benefit, is directly contrary to the natural rights of mankind, and would introduce confusion and disorder into the commonwealth. The first and most fundamental principle, therefore, if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses, must be the inviolability of private property." ''Rerum novarum'', paragraph 16.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The encyclical promotes a kind of [[corporatism]] based on [[social solidarity]] among the classes with respects for the needs and rights of all.

In the November 1914 issue of ''The Christian Socialist'', Episcopal bishop [[Franklin Spencer Spalding]] of Utah, U.S.A. stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Christian Church exists for the sole purpose of saving the human race. So far she has failed, but I think that Socialism shows her how she may succeed. It insists that men cannot be made right until the material conditions be made right. Although man cannot live by bread alone, he must have bread. Therefore the Church must destroy a system of society which inevitably creates and perpetuates unequal and unfair conditions of life. These unequal and unfair conditions have been created by competition. Therefore competition must cease and cooperation take its place."&lt;ref name="D.Berman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=David|title=Radicalism in the Mountain West 1890–1920|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Colorado|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the explicit rejection of Socialism, in the more Catholic countries of [[Europe]] the encyclical's teaching was the inspiration that led to the formation of new [[Christian democracy|Christian-inspired Socialist parties]].  A number of Christian socialist movements and political parties throughout the world group themselves into the [[International League of Religious Socialists]]. It has member organizations in 21 countries representing 200,000 members.

Christian socialists draw parallels between what some have characterized as the [[egalitarian]] and anti-establishment message of [[Jesus]], who–according to the [[Gospel]]–spoke against the religious authorities of his time, and the egalitarian, anti-establishment, and sometimes [[anti-clerical]] message of most contemporary socialisms. Some Christian Socialists have become active [[Communism|Communists]]. This phenomenon was most common among [[missionary|missionaries]] in [[China]], the most notable being [[James Gareth Endicott]], who became supportive of the struggle of the [[Communist Party of China]] in the 1930s and 1940s.

[[Michael Moore]]'s film [[Capitalism: A Love Story]] also features a religious component where Moore examines whether or not capitalism is a [[sin]] and whether [[Jesus]] would be a capitalist,&lt;ref name="ChurchMoore"&gt;{{cite news| last=Moore|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Moore|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/for-those-of-you-on-your_b_308948.html|title=For Those of You on Your Way to Church This Morning ...|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=October 4, 2009| accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to shine light on the ideological contradictions among [[Christian right#History|evangelical conservatives]] who support free market ideals.

===Liberation theology===
{{main|Liberation theology}}

[[Liberation theology]]&lt;ref&gt;In the mass media, 'Liberation Theology' can sometimes be used loosely, to refer to a wide variety of activist Christian thought. In this article the term will be used in the narrow sense outlined here.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Christian movement]] in [[political theology]] which interprets the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as "an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor",&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Berryman|Berryman, Phillip]], ''Liberation Theology: essential facts about the revolutionary movement in Latin America and beyond''(1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and by detractors as Christianized [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[David] Horowitz first describes liberation theology as 'a form of Marxised Christianity,' which has validity despite the awkward phrasing, but then he calls it a form of 'Marxist–Leninist ideology,' which is simply not true for most liberation theology..." Robert Shaffer, "[http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html Acceptable Bounds of Academic Discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904165644/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html |date=2013-09-04 }}," Organization of American Historians Newsletter 35, November, 2007. URL retrieved 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the [[Roman Catholic]] church in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. Liberation theology arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by [[social injustice]] in that region. The term was coined in 1971 by the [[Peruvian]] priest [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, ''A Theology of Liberation''. Other noted exponents are [[Leonardo Boff]] of Brazil, [[Jon Sobrino]] of El Salvador, and [[Juan Luis Segundo]] of Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien,''Catholicism''(Harper Collins, 1994), chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Gutierrez,''A Theology of Liberation'', First (Spanish) edition published in Lima, Peru, 1971; first English edition published by Orbis Books (Maryknoll, New York), 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of liberation theology within the Catholic Church diminished after proponents using Marxist concepts were admonished by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF) in 1984 and 1986. The Vatican criticized certain strains of liberation theology – without actually identifying any particular strain – for focusing on institutional dimensions of sin to the exclusion of the individual; and for allegedly misidentifying the church hierarchy as members of the privileged class.&lt;ref name="Wojda, Paul J. 1995"&gt;Wojda, Paul J., "Liberation theology", in R.P. McBrien, ed., ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Harper Collins, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11734">The '''classical limit''' or '''correspondence limit''' is the ability of a [[theoretical physics|physical theory]] to approximate or "recover" [[classical mechanics]] when considered over special values of its parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bohm |first=D. |author-link=David Bohm |year=1989 |title=Quantum Theory |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-65969-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical limit is used with physical theories that predict non-classical behavior.

==Quantum theory==
A [[heuristic]] postulate called the [[correspondence principle]] was introduced to [[Bohr model|quantum theory]] by [[Niels Bohr]]: in effect it states that some kind of continuity argument should apply to the classical limit of quantum systems as the value of [[Planck's constant]] normalized by the action of these systems becomes very small. Often, this is approached through "quasi-classical" techniques (cf. [[WKB approximation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landau |first1=L. D. |author1-link=Lev Landau |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E. M. |author2-link=Evgeny Lifshitz |year=1977 |title=Quantum Mechanics: Non-Relativistic Theory |edition=3rd |volume=Vol. 3 |publisher=[[Pergamon Press]] |isbn=978-0-08-020940-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More rigorously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hepp |first=K. |author1-link=Klaus Hepp |year=1974 |title=The classical limit for quantum mechanical correlation functions |url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.cmp/1103859623 |journal=[[Communications in Mathematical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue= 4|pages=265–277 |bibcode=1974CMaPh..35..265H |doi=10.1007/BF01646348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the mathematical operation involved in classical limits is a [[group contraction]], approximating physical systems where the relevant action is much larger than Planck's constant {{mvar|ħ}}, so the "deformation parameter" {{mvar|ħ}}/{{mvar|S}} can be effectively taken to be zero (cf. [[Weyl quantization]].) Thus typically, quantum commutators (equivalently, [[Moyal bracket]]s) reduce to [[Poisson bracket]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Curtright |first1=T. L. |last2=Zachos |first2=C. K. |year=2012 |title=Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space |journal=[[Asia Pacific Physics Newsletter]] |volume=1 |issue= |pages=37 |doi=10.1142/S2251158X12000069|arxiv=1104.5269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[group contraction]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], due to [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[uncertainty principle]], an [[electron]] can never be at rest; it must always have a non-zero [[kinetic energy]], a result not found in classical mechanics. For example, if we consider something very large relative to an electron, like a baseball, the uncertainty principle predicts that it cannot really have zero kinetic energy, but the uncertainty in kinetic energy is so small that the baseball can effectively appear to be at rest, and hence it appears to obey classical mechanics. In general, if large energies and large objects (relative to the size and energy levels of an electron) are considered in quantum mechanics, the result will appear to obey classical mechanics. The typical [[occupation number]]s involved are huge: a macroscopic harmonic oscillator with {{mvar|ω}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;Hz, {{mvar|m}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;g, and maximum [[amplitude]] {{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;cm, has {{math|''S''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''E''/''ω''&amp;nbsp;≈ ''mωx''{{su|b=0|p=2}}/2&amp;nbsp;≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|ħn}}, so that {{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;≃&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;. Further see [[Coherent states#The wavefunction of a coherent state|coherent states]]. It is less clear, however, how the classical limit applies to chaotic systems, a field known as [[quantum chaos]].

Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are usually treated with entirely different formalisms: quantum theory using [[Hilbert space]], and classical mechanics using a representation in [[phase space]]. One can bring the two into a common mathematical framework in various ways. In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics, which is statistical in nature, logical connections between quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics are made, enabling natural comparisons between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bracken |first1=A. |last2=Wood |first2=J. |year=2006 |title=Semiquantum versus semiclassical mechanics for simple nonlinear systems |journal=[[Physical Review A]] |volume=73 |pages=012104 |arxiv=quant-ph/0511227 |bibcode=2006PhRvA..73a2104B |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Conversely, in the lesser-known [[Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics|approach presented in 1932 by Koopman and von Neumann]], the dynamics of classical mechanics have been formulated in terms of an [[operator (physics)|operational]] formalism in [[Hilbert space]], a formalism used conventionally for quantum mechanics.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In a crucial paper (1933), [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=P.A.M. |author-link=Paul Dirac |year=1933 |title=The Lagrangian in quantum mechanics |url=http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~cabrera/teaching/aula%2015%202010s1.pdf |journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift der Sowjetunion]] |volume=3 |issue= |pages=64–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained how classical mechanics is an [[Emergence#Non-living, physical systems|emergent phenomenon]] of quantum mechanics: [[Destructive interference#Quantum interference|destructive interference]] among paths with non-[[extremal]] macroscopic actions {{mvar|S}}&amp;nbsp;»&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|ħ}} obliterate amplitude contributions in the [[path integral formulation|path integral]] he introduced, leaving the extremal action {{mvar|S}}&lt;sub&gt;class&lt;/sub&gt;, thus the classical action path as the dominant contribution, an observation further elaborated by [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] in his 1942 PhD dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Feynman |first=R. P. |author-link=Richard Feynman |year=1942 |title=The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics |type=Ph.D. Dissertation |publisher=[[Princeton University]]}}

==Time-evolution of expectation values==
{{main|Ehrenfest theorem}}
One simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the ''expected'' position and ''expected'' momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, the Ehrenfest theorem says&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 3.7.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m\frac{d}{dt}\langle x\rangle = \langle p\rangle;\quad \frac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle =  -\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle .&lt;/math&gt;
Although the first of these equations is consistent with the classical mechanics, the second is not: If the pair &lt;math&gt;(\langle X\rangle,\langle P\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have read
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle =-V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
But in most cases,
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle\neq V'(\left\langle X\right\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.
If for example, the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is cubic, then &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is quadratic, in which case, we are talking about the distinction between &lt;math&gt;\langle X^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle X\rangle^2&lt;/math&gt;, which differ by &lt;math&gt;(\Delta X)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

An exception occurs in case when the classical equations of motion are linear, that is, when &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is quadratic and &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is linear. In that special case, &lt;math&gt;V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; do agree. In particular, for a free particle or a quantum harmonic oscillator, the expected position and expected momentum exactly follows solutions of Newton's equations.

For general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will ''approximately'' follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; will be ''almost'' the same, since both will be approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;V'(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least ''for as long as'' the wave function remains highly localized in position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; 

Now, if the initial state is very localized in position, it will be very spread out in momentum, and thus we expect that the wave function will rapidly spread out, and the connection with the classical trajectories will be lost. When Planck's constant is small, however, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in ''both'' position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle ''remains'' well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories for a long time.

==Relativity and other deformations==
Other familiar deformations in physics involve:

*The deformation of classical Newtonian into relativistic mechanics ([[special relativity]]), with deformation parameter ''v/c''; the classical limit involves small speeds, so ''v/c''→0, and the systems appear to obey Newtonian mechanics.
*Similarly for the deformation of Newtonian gravity into [[general relativity]], with deformation parameter Schwarzschild-radius/characteristic-dimension, we find that objects once again appear to obey classical mechanics (flat space), when the mass of an object times the square of the [[Planck length]] is much smaller than its size and the sizes of the problem addressed.
*Wave optics might also be regarded as a deformation of [[geometrical optics|ray optics]] for deformation parameter ''λ/a''.
*Likewise, [[thermodynamics]] deforms to [[statistical mechanics]] with deformation parameter 1/''N''.

The ancient city of Pompeii is famously known for its demise in A.D. 79 after the fatal eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] wiped out the population and buried the city beneath layers of compact lava material.&lt;ref name=:1&gt;Moormann, E.

The excavation of the [[House of the Vettii]] from 1894-1895 by Giuseppe Fiorelli led to the policy of completely restoring and reconstructing (select) houses and leaving all finds ''in situ'' as far as possible.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; The House of the Vettii, located in Regio VI of Pompeii, suffered significant damage and loss of its fourth style artwork during bombings in [[WWII]].&lt;ref name=:6&gt;AD 79 Destruction and Re-discovery.

=== Praedia of Julia Felix ===
The [[House of Julia Felix|Praedia of Julia Felix]], located in Regio II of Pompeii, was one of the first houses to be thoroughly explored and is the site where the first complete [[mural]] of the tablinum was detached in 1755, led by sculptor Joseph Canart.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt;

== Composition and materials ==

=== Pigments ===
The pigments that were primarily used in the frescoes at Pompeii were mostly naturally occurring earth pigments such as:
* Red and yellow [[ochre]]s 
* [[Green earth]]
* [[Calcium carbonate]] (chalk) 
* Black produced from soot or charcoal 
* Egyptian blue (artificial pigment consisting of ground blue glass [[frit]])  
* Bright red [[cinnabar]] (toxic mercuric sulfide)&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

=== Application ===
Pompeian frescoes were executed in the [[buon fresco]] (true fresco) technique, in which the pigments were painted onto a freshly applied, damp/wet plaster ground. The plaster contains liquid lime ([[calcium hydroxide]]). In the process of drying, the liquid lime in the plaster combines with the paints and turns into carbonate of lime, which is chemically equivalent to limestone or marble. Upon drying and setting, the pigments permanently fuse to the plaster to form a solid, durable painting.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

== Examination and analysis of frescoes ==
After the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake|Irpinia earthquake in 1980]] caused further weakening of Pompeii’s crumbling walls, systematic initiatives were put into place to evaluate the damage. The excavation team took documentary photographs, conducted a systematic survey, and recorded the qualitative data through a computer processing system.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt; From these findings, Mariette de Vos calculated that the number of existing paintings made up only ten percent of what was originally found in earlier excavations, while another ten percent was only known through drawings and photos.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; For the first time, the team was able to show that Pompeii had indeed been over-excavated, and provide a comprehensive view of how, where, and to what extent conservation and restoration was needed.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt;

With innovative advances in technology, conservationists and archaeologists have now been able to reconstruct navigable [[3-D modeling|3-D models]] of the ancient Pompeian buildings and the rooms that held the frescoes. Through virtual models, and the introduction of digital architectural line drawings, missing parts of the frescoes have been virtually filled in.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; The use of archival photographs of the frescoes from past excavations and reconstructions have also aided in the digital reconstruction of the paintings, and have allowed for their digital preservation for the future.&lt;ref name=:7&gt;Watts-Plumpkin, E. (7 January, 2012). What’s new in Pompei. World Archaeology. Retrieved from https://www.world-archaeology.com/issues/pompeii/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laser]]s, [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasound]] and [[Thermography|thermal imagery]] have been used to analyze the frescoes and their level of deterioration.&lt;ref name=:4/&gt; Non-invasive measurements have been used to research and measure the level of fading, discoloration, and changes in chemical composition that have taken place in the original pigments of the frescoes, such as: VIS (Visible Light) [[spectroscopy]] with CIE L*a*b* measurements and EDXRF (Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence) analyses; OM ([[Optical Microscopy]]) of cross sections and paint layers; [[Polarized light microscopy|PLM (Polarized Light Microscopy)]] of powder samples; FTIR/ATR ([[Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy]]/Attenuated Total Reflectance); and SEM-EDS (Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive Spectrometry).&lt;ref name=:8&gt;EVTEK.

Extensive visitor observations and movement mapping have also been conducted in order to analyze how tourism impacts the safety of the frescoes.&lt;ref name=:9&gt;Wallace, A. (2012).

== Agents of deterioration ==

=== Physical ===
During the beginning of the excavation of Pompeii, inexperienced and untrained excavators cut out pieces of fresco they found without the use of linen and other facing materials to protect the plaster, resulting in many frescoes being broken into multiple fragments. Wall painting scenes that were considered worthy of detachment were brought to the Palazzo degli Studi in Naples, today known as the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, after 1827.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;
[[File:Roman fresco Villa dei Misteri Pompeii 006.jpg|thumb|Roman fresco Villa dei Misteri Pompeii]]

The frescoes have been affected by rain and groundwater, which have caused water damage and [[Rising damp (structural)|rising damp]], resulting in deteriorating and collapsing walls.&lt;ref name=:10&gt;Ministero dei Beni e delle Attivita Culturali e del Turismo. (2016). Rapport de l'Etat partie sur l'état de conservation. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Retrieved from http://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/155410&lt;/ref&gt; Frescoes are part of an open physical system in which they are in contact with contiguous structures—such as walls, roofs, and the ground—that are dynamically involved in series of chemical and physical events, such as the capillary movement and rise of moisture.&lt;ref name=:11&gt;Matteini, M. (1987). In review: An assessment of florentine methods of wall painting conservation based on the use of mineral treatments. In S. Cather (Ed.), The Conservation Of Wall Paintings (137-149). Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/wall_paintings.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic physical forces such as earthquakes—which have been causing structural damage to the buildings and cracks in the walls since A.D. 62&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; —and the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, have contributed to the deterioration of the frescoes. The frescoes of Pompeii were both damaged by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from heat and falling debris, which scratched and loosened the plaster and paint,&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; and simultaneously preserved by the volcanic ash until their discovery. In addition, the frost of 1816 entirely destroyed murals in the [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii|Amphitheatre]] in the Villa of Cicero at the Praedia of Julia Felix.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

Restoration efforts in the late eighteenth century resulted in poorly supported walls and masonry that have proven insufficient for the protection of the wall paintings and have contributed to their rapid degradation.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt; Plaster was fixed with heavy metal clamps, which have gradually come away and left holes and other damage, and the edges of the paintings were smeared with ordinary [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] that has yet to be replaced.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

Mass tourism that has taken place at Pompeii is another contributing factor to the deterioration of the frescoes. Wear and breakage have occurred due to people leaning on and touching the frescoes, as well as abrasions from bags and other objects rubbing against the frescoes in crowded areas.&lt;ref name=:9/&gt; Vandals have also defaced the frescoes with graffiti. In addition, the frescoes at Pompeii have deteriorated due to poor management, decreased internal maintenance, and a lack of sustainable methods for restoration and conservation.&lt;ref name=:12&gt;Wollner, J.L. (2013). Planning preservation in pompeii: Revising wall painting conservation method and management. Studies in Mediterranean Antiquity and Classics, 3:1. Retrieved from http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&amp;context=classicsjournal&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical ===
The constituent materials of wall paintings have a high and open [[porosity]]. Because of this, they are easily accessible to liquids and gases including: salt solutions, atmospheric pollutants, water vapor, solutions of materials used for conservation, etc.&lt;ref name=:11/&gt; Build-up from pollutants and contaminants such as waxes and gasoline—which were used in previous restoration attempts as cleaning agents—varnishes, and dust have caused the pigments in the frescoes to darken and discolor, and the figures to blur over time.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt;

Many of the frescoes were covered with varnish to protect them at their creation, in which the fragments were first washed with water and then covered with [[gum arabic]] thinned with [[aqua regia]]. However, this practice was later stopped once it was discovered that it bleached and damaged the pigments, though most of the fragments at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale are still covered in the gluey film.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

Experiments with hot wax were conducted by the ancient Pompeian painters. Painters either prepared the surfaces with melted wax or painted with pigments combined with wax that would then be burned into the plaster, which made them sturdy and durable.&lt;ref name=:1 /&gt; This same technique was tried in order to restore the frescoes in the late eighteenth century. While at first this made the paintings more lustrous and clear, years of heat and humidity and the restriction of normal evaporation for the paintings ''in situ'' turned the wax white and deteriorated the painted surfaces.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; In the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, though they didn’t suffer from the same climatological effects, they still became white/crusty.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

The pigments used in the frescoes are of a very fragile nature and have faded as a result of exposure to [[UV]] rays, oxygen, and the environment/elements—especially those left ''in situ''.&lt;ref name=:9/&gt; Disintegration of plaster, and lifting and detachment of the paint has also been caused by the crystallization of soluble salts, such as sodium nitrate, in the surface layers of the frescoes as a result of fluctuating temperatures and humidity, and exposure to atmospheric pollutants.&lt;ref name=:11/&gt;
 
=== Biological ===
Invasive vegetation such as roots, moss, weeds, and grass have sprouted from the cracks in the eroded floors and walls of the rooms where the frescoes are located.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt;

== Preventive conservation ==
Conservators and leadership are working to better understand the current situation of the Pompeian frescoes and avoid further damage and deterioration. The Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompei is working on a major reorganization and implementation of new policies and maintenance plans for the entire site of Pompeii.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt;

Attention has been given to non-intrusive and reversible reinforcement of the walls, structures and roofs of the buildings that house the frescoes. Recommendations have been made for the reconstruction of the building infrastructures using safe and sturdy materials, and light, modern supports, unlike the previous heavy materials placed in the walls, which caused significant damage.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt; Recommendations have also been made for roof reinforcement structures and other conservation interventions that block ventilation and rain infiltration,&lt;ref name=:10/&gt; and allow for humidity regulation to prevent the plaster of the frescoes from peeling off the walls.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt; Plans for engineering new drainage and sewer systems are also being made.&lt;ref name=:10/&gt;

Excavations of Pompeii have been significantly reduced, and barricades, fences, and locked doors have been placed to keep visitors out of vulnerable areas and buildings.&lt;ref name=:9/&gt; Select ''insulae'' are also being considered for re-burial in order to protect them from further vegetal growth, weather conditions, earthquake damage, and volcanic eruptions.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt;

As an open, reactive system, frescoes require more surveillance after conservation&lt;ref name=:11/&gt; The use of high-tech monitoring tools is also being put into place. An agreement was made with Italian technology and defense company, [[Finmeccanica]], for their donation of services concerning: protection of the artistic heritage from deterioration, pollution, hydrogeological and seismic risks; efficiency, sustainability and safety of the spaces dedicated to culture; and accessibility and fruition of the artistic heritage.&lt;ref name=:10/&gt;

The project includes an [[interferometric]] monitoring service that provides data on the shifts/movements of the grounds and buildings in Pompeii, and comes equipped with radar sensors that shoot daytime and nighttime pictures. Finmeccanica has also provided a ground-based remote sensing service that employs hyper-spectral imaging devices for the acquisition of images and the spectral signatures of the various materials and chemical components present in areas identified as critical.&lt;ref name=:10/&gt;

== Current conservation treatment techniques and methods ==
Efforts are being made to stabilize the frescoes' chemical and biological degradation and perform long-lasting restoration. In a holistic approach to conservation, the causes of decay are being addressed while increasing the site’s ability to prevent or slow future decay. Routine cleaning of all previously restored works and constant upkeep practices are being put into place.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt;

Conservators and restorers are meticulously stripping away layers of [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], dirt, and varnish with cotton swabs that restorers applied between the 1930s and 1970s to prevent the paints from cracking and flaking.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt; Laser tools are being used to melt away wax and gasoline buildup while leaving the paint untouched.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt; Other conservation treatments include the consolidation of brittle plaster and paint layers, the removal of inadequate [[inpainting]] of losses, and improving old fills that were used with cement.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

== The Great Pompeii Project (Grande Progetto Pompei) ==
The Great Pompeii Project (GPP) is a €105 million project funded by the EU and Italian Government that began in 2012. The project proposes plans for emergency work to begin for the conservation, maintenance and restoration of Pompeii.&lt;ref name=:13&gt;Parco Archeologico di Pompei. (n.d.). Pompeii projects. Retrieved from http://www.pompeiisites.org/Sezione.jsp?titolo=Pompeii+Projects&amp;idSezione=985&lt;/ref&gt; The project's areas of intervention include: 
* Surveying, investigating, and diagnosing critical structural and restoration problems for all ''insulae''
* Investigations related to interventions for hydro-geological risk mitigation
* Safety and security measures, architectural restoration and decorative restoration
* Use and improvement of services and communication
* Technological reinforcement and capacity building&lt;ref name=:14&gt;Parco Archeologico di Pompei. (n.d.). The EU pompei project. Retrieved from http://www.pompeiisites.org/Sezione.jsp?titolo=The+EU+Pompei+project&amp;idSezione=1385&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">The '''Dead Media Project''' was initially proposed by science fiction writer [[Bruce Sterling]] in 1995 as a compilation of obsolete and forgotten communication technologies.&lt;ref name="proposal"&gt;[http://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/deadMedia/dM_Manifesto.html Dead Media Project: A Modest Proposal and a Public Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sterling's original motivation for compiling the collection was to present a wider historical perspective on communication technologies that went beyond contemporary excitement for the [[internet]], [[CD-ROM]]s and [[virtual reality|VR]] systems.  Sterling proposed that this collection take form as "The Dead Media Handbook" — a somber, thoughtful, thorough, hype-free, book about the failures, collapses and hideous mistakes of media. In raising this challenge he offers a "crisp $50 dollar bill" to the first person to publish the book, which he envisions as a "rich, witty, insightful, profusely illustrated, perfectbound, acid-free-paper [[coffee-table book]]".

After articulated in the manifesto "The Dead Media Project — A Modest Proposal and a Public Appeal,"&lt;ref name="proposal" /&gt; The Dead Media Project began as a number of persons collecting their notes and the spreading of the archive through a mailing list, moderated by [[Tom Jennings]]. This resulted in a large collective of "field notes" about obsolete communication technologies, about 600 in total [https://web.archive.org/web/20071019055700/http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/index.html archived online]. The project lost momentum in 2001 and the mailing list died.

The project archive includes a wide variety of notes from [[Inca]]n [[quipu]]s, through Victorian [[phenakistoscope]]s, to the departed [[video game]]s and home computers of the 1980s. Dead still-image display technologies include the [[stereopticon]], the [[Protean View]], the [[Zogroscope]], the [[Polyorama Panoptique]], Frith's [[Cosmoscope]], Knight's [[Cosmorama]], Ponti's [[Megalethoscope]] (1862), Rousell's [[Graphoscope]] (1864), [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone's]] [[stereoscope]] (1832), and dead [[Viewmaster]] knockoffs.

In 2009, artist [[Garnet Hertz]] published a bookwork project titled "A Collection of Many Problems (In Memory of the Dead Media Handbook)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceptlab.com/problems/ A Collection of Many Problems (In Memory of the Dead Media Handbook)]&lt;/ref&gt; which strived to fulfill some of [[Bruce Sterling]]'s vision for a handbook of obsolete media technologies.  In the book, Hertz presents images of many of the media technologies compiled through the Dead Media mailing list and invites readers to submit their sketches and ideas of a Dead Media Handbook.

[[File:Wiki-dthroat.png|thumb|Illustration of a woman deep-throating a man]]

'''Deep-throating''' is a [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]] in which a person takes a partner's entire erect [[Human penis|penis]] deep into the [[Human mouth|mouth]] and throat. The practice is a type of [[fellatio]] where the receptive partner (the one whose mouth receives the penis) is in control, while deep throat penetration by an actively thrusting partner is called [[irrumatio]]; both are a form of [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name="Grandma's Sex Handbook 161"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZxVCHdCqOKYC&amp;pg=PA161 | title=Grandma's Sex Handbook | publisher=Intimate Press, USA | accessdate=January 7, 2012 | author=Wright, Anne | year=2009 | pages=161 | isbn=978-0-578-02075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3QJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA39 | title=Leonardo da Vinci: A PSYCHOSEXUAL STUDY OF AN INFANTILE REMINISCENCE | publisher=MOFFAT YARD &amp; COMPANY | author=Freud, Sigmund | year=1916 | location=New York | pages=39 | quote=The situation contained in the phantasy, that a vulture opened the mouth of the child and forcefully belabored it with its tail, corresponds to the idea of fellatio, a sexual act in which the member is placed into the mouth of the woman. | accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For deep-throating, the penis has to be long enough so that it can reach the back of the recipient's throat.&lt;ref name="Grandma's Sex Handbook 161"/&gt;

The technique and term were popularized by the 1972 [[pornographic]] film [[Deep Throat (film)|''Deep Throat'']].

Deep-throating can be difficult, due to the natural [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] triggered when the [[soft palate]] is touched.&lt;ref name="urlMedical Neurosciences"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/09NA.html|title=Medical Neurosciences|last=McDougal|first=David|last2=Van Lieshout|first2=Dave|date=|website=|publisher=UW-Madison Medical school.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024508/http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/09NA.html|archive-date=March 6, 2012|dead-url=yes|last3=Harting|first3=John|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ | title=About WordNet - WordNet - About WordNet | publisher=Princeton University. | date=2010 | accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, and with practice, some people learn to suppress it. Deep-throating leads to an entirely different kind of oral stimulation in comparison to regular [[fellatio]]: the tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and sucking becomes impossible;&lt;ref name="Gentry"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=q8qtd61hoB8C&amp;pg=PA260 | title=The Bedside Orgasm Book: 365 Days of Sexual Ecstasy | publisher=Fair Winds Press | accessdate=January 7, 2012 | author=Gentry, Cynthia W. | year=2005 | location=Gloucester, Massachusetts USA | pages=260 | isbn=1-59233-101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[glans penis]] can be intensely stimulated by the tightness of the [[pharynx]].

== Sex positions ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
There are several [[Sex positions|positions]] that are well suited for performing deep throat. Relaxation of the throat muscles is the most important aspect of positioning. 

One common position is to align the mouth and throat into a straight line (like a [[sword swallower]]), but many different positions are possible. 

"Over-the-edge" is a common position for deep-throating. In this position, the receptive partner lies back and hangs his or her head off the edge of a bed or similar piece of furniture, and the insertive partner stands or kneels in front of the face, lining up his penis at mouth level. 

Another common position used for deep-throating involves the insertive partner sitting on the receptive partner's chest, with his penis in front of the face.

'''Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC)''' is a research centre for [[library and information science]] and allied disciplines at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], [[Bangalore]]. The Centre was established in April 1962, under the auspices of Prof. [[S. R. Ranganathan]] (considered to be the father of modern library and information science in India) with the encouragement of Prof. [[P. C. Mahalanobis]] at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]].

DRTC runs a graduate program leading to the award of a 'Master of Science in Library and Information Science' (MS-LIS) from the [[Indian Statistical Institute]]  as well as serving as an academic and research center for Research Fellows registered for a PhD in [[Information Science]]. DRTC is perhaps India's only "proper" [[ischool]] with a very strong research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drtc.isibang.ac.in/MSLIS|title=Documentation Research and Training Centre (DRTC)|last=|first=|date=|website=drtc.isibang.ac.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research at DRTC generally focuses on the application of [[information technology]] to [[library and information science]].

DRTC has a PhD collaboration with the [[University of Trento]], Italy.

2012 marked the Golden Jubilee of DRTC, which was celebrated with the 'International Conference on Trends in Knowledge and Information Dynamics' (ICTK-2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218185328/http://drtc.isibang.ac.in/ictk/|title=ICTK - 2012 {{!}} International Conference on Trends in Knowledge and Information Dynamics. 10–13 July 2012|last=|first=|date=2012-02-18|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender mainstreaming in mine action''' is the application of [[gender mainstreaming]] to [[mine action]]. It is increasingly being adopted by international and state mine action organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?lang=en&amp;id=117659|title=Resources|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==

Gender mainstreaming in [[mine action]] is derived from the fact that women and men often have different roles and responsibilities within their communities or families and consequently different decision-making power, mobility patterns, information and control over resources.&lt;ref&gt;A guide to Mine Action. GICHD, 2014. Chapter 4, p.110: http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/GICHD-resources/rec-documents/Guide-to-mine-action-2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The different positions of men and women have an influence on their exposure to [[Land mine|landmines]] and [[Unexploded ordnance|explosive remnants of war (ERW)]], their ability to access medical and psychological services once they have been injured by [[Land mine|mines]], their chances of long term reintegration in society, and the likelihood of them to be included in risk education.&lt;ref&gt;Livelihoods Analysis of Landmine/ERW Affected Communities. Third Survey: Badakhshan Province, Afghanistan. Qudous Ziaee, Samim Hashimi and Shapur Qayyumi, 2013: p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, organizations employ gender mainstreaming in mine action by assessing the implications for women and men in all aspects of the mine action activities.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action – a Critical Background Analysis. Hilde Wallacher, Assistance to Mine-Affected Communities (AMAC), 2007, p.2: http://file.prio.no/Publication_files/Prio/Gender_mainstreaming_in_mine_action_nov_07_background_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming in mine action attempts to ensure women and men benefit equally from mine action and that gender inequality is not perpetuated which might impede the overall effectiveness of mine action programmes.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;UNMAS and Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action. Aaron J. Buckley and Akiko Ikeda, The Journal of ERW and Mine Action. Issue 13.3, Winter 2009: http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/13.3/notes/buckley_ikeda/buckley.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Women's advancement instruments in national bureaucracies started in the mid-1970s. While the concept of gender mainstreaming appeared in the mid-1980s, it was formalised in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Gender mainstreaming in mine action was first mentioned in 1995 at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Platform for Action]] in the section on armed conflict, by stating that "women and children are particularly affected by the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel land-mines".&lt;ref&gt;Beijing Platform for Action, 1995. Strategic objective E.2. Reduce excessive military expenditures and control the availability of armaments. Actions to be taken: 143.e.: http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/armed.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Gender mainstreaming in mine action was part of a larger movement to end discrimination and [[Gender and security sector reform|mainstream gender in security sector reform]]. Before guidelines on how to integrate gender into mine action were standardised, several documents were published to highlight the importance of gender mainstreaming in that domain.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;A Guide to Mine Action. GICHD, 2013: p.113 to 115: http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/GICHD-resources/rec-documents/Guide-to-mine-action-2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It later gained more support thanks to the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000)]] on "Women, Peace and Security" which emphasised "the need for all parties to ensure that mine clearance and mine awareness programmes take into account the special needs of women and girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undocs.org/S/RES/1325(2000) |title=Resolution 1325 (2000) |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the UN Gender Guidelines for Mine Action Programmes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/437354a14.html%7Ctitle=Refworld%20-%20Gender%20Guidelines%20for%20Mine%20Action%20Programmes%7Cauthor=United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees%7Cwork=Refworld|title=Refworld - Gender Guidelines for Mine Action Programmes|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided the first comprehensive description of how to mainstream gender in mine action, afterwards revised in 2010.&lt;ref name="mineaction.org"&gt;http://www.mineaction.org/sites/default/files/publications/MA-Guidelines-WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This guide is a manual destined to be used by the UN mine action field-based personnel and headquarters' staff and other actors involved in the sector.&lt;ref name="mineaction.org" /&gt;

=== '''Convention and Normative Documents on Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action''' ===
[[Convention on Cluster Munitions|The Convention on Cluster Munition]] (2008) underlines that "Each State Party with respect to cluster munition victims (…) shall (…) adequately provide age- and gender-sensitive assistance".&lt;ref&gt;Convention on Cluster Munitions. Article 5, Victim assistance, p.9: http://www.clusterconvention.org/files/2011/01/Convention-ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Vientiane Action Plan 2010-2015 (2010),&lt;ref name="clusterconvention.org"&gt;http://www.clusterconvention.org/files/2011/01/VIENTIANE-ACTION-PLAN-Final2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; adopted at the First Meeting of States Parties to  the Convention on Cluster Munition in Lao PDR also includes gender issues in several action points, such as on Clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants and risk reduction activities. For instance, Action 14 writes that there should be "gender-sensitive participation of the community to the development of national clearance plans, planning and prioritisation of clearance activities and land release". Action 17 states that "mine risk education should be tailored to the needs of affected communities, gender sensitive and age appropriate". In addition to the previous two, Action 22 requires states to collect sex and age disaggregated data on victims, and Action 30 that victims should be fully included in the work of the convention in a gender and age sensitive way.&lt;ref name="clusterconvention.org" /&gt;

The Strategy of the United Nation on Mine Action 2013-2018 (2013) encourages "further efforts (…)  dedicated to strengthening and mainstreaming gender perspectives in mine action planning, implementation and evaluation".&lt;ref&gt;The Strategy of the United Nation on Mine Action 2013-2018, 2013, p.10: http://www.mineaction.org/sites/default/files/publications/mine_action_strategy_mar15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maputo Action Plan 2014-2019 (2014)&lt;ref name="maputoreviewconference.org"&gt;http://www.maputoreviewconference.org/fileadmin/APMBC-RC3/3RC-Maputo-action-plan-adopted-27Jun2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted during the Third Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction (APMBC 1997). In its introduction, it stresses that States Parties will implement the Maputo Action Plan in a cooperative, inclusive, age-appropriate and gender-sensitive manner. In the section on mine clearance, gender-sensitive mine risk education (paragraph 10), opportunities and social protection measures for all mine victims, regardless of their gender and age (paragraph 10) and gender sensitive awareness raising (paragraph 17) are mentioned. The section on International cooperation and assistance encourages State parties to articulate age- and gender-sensitive time-bound objectives and targets (paragraph 21) and to support programmes that provide  accurate gender sensitive information and that promote gender mainstreaming (paragraph 22).&lt;ref name="maputoreviewconference.org" /&gt;

===Examples of Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action===

Since 2006 the [[United Nations Mine Action Service]] (UNMAS) has been conducting workshops on gender mainstreaming in mine action both in the field and in Geneva at the presence of representatives of mine action organisation, focused on explaining what gender mainstreaming is and helping countries implementing the UN guidelines.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The [[Swiss Campaign to Ban Landmines]] created the Gender and Mine Action Programme in 2006 to specifically focus on the implementation of gender mainstreaming in mine action.&lt;ref name="gmap.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmap.ch/|title=Gender &amp; Mine Action Programme – Gmap.ch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)]] in 2013 reviewed the work of the [[Danish demining group|Danish Demining Group]] (DDG) in Afghanistan, assessing positively the progress made in gender mainstreaming, in terms of the collection of disaggregated qualitative and quantitative data, in spite of some cultural limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Review of the DDG Humanitarian Mine Action Support to the National Strategy through Clearance and Enhanced Quality Project in Afghanistan (October 2010 – September 2013). Final Report. SIDA, p.8: http://www.oecd.org/derec/sweden/SIDAReviewDDG%20HumanitarianMineActionSupportNationalStrategyAfghanistan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The Mine Action Programme of Afghanistan (MAPA) has developed a Gender Mainstreaming Strategy for the period 2014-2016 with the assistance of the [[#Gender and Mine Action Programme|Gender and Mine Action Programme (GMAP)]]. In order to share the strategy, the Mine Action Coordination Centre of Afghanistan (MACCA) organised two gender mainstreaming workshops at the end of 2014 attended by 17 partner organisations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmap.ch/fileadmin/GMAP_Articles_and_Papers/2014_Outcomes_of_Gender_Mainstreaming_in_the_Mine_Action_Programmes_of_Afghanistan_and_South_Sudan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of a grant provided by [[Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining|the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD)]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macca.org.af/macca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MAPA-2014-Newsletter-English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mines Advisory Group|The Mine Advisory Group (MAG)]] – Lao PDR, through a funding from MAG and Irish Aid, conducted an assessment as part of gender mainstreaming on the priority actions to be carried out in integrating gender in mine action.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Issue: An Example from Lao PDR.

===[[Mine action#Clearance of Mines and Explosive Remnants of War|Mine clearance]]===

The UN Gender Guidelines state that men, women, boys and girls differ in their exposure to and knowledge of the mine contamination. The Guidelines write that [[Mine clearance agency|mine-action operators]] should obtain information about the mine situation from both sexes in all age groups in order for information to be complete and accurate before [[demining]]. Having more accurate information before can reduce costs because less time and money are spent on [[demining]] uncontaminated areas. Its concrete recommendations are:

* Gather data at the best times and locations for all individuals.
* Gather data from both men and women about the location of explosive devices and the projected use of cleared land.
* Also include women into the survey and clearance teams.&lt;ref name="mineaction.org"/&gt;

===[[Mine action#Mine Risk Education .28MRE.29|Mine-risk education (MRE)]]===

The UN Gender Guidelines say that men, women, boys and girls differ in their behaviours and their response to mine-risk education. Its recommendations are: 
* Gather data that illustrate the behaviours that put at risk people of both genders.
* Gather data that indicates how people of both genders would react to potential mine and [[Unexploded ordnance|UXO]] threats.
* Determine the best instructor for both genders. 
* Hold MRE meetings at the most convenient times and places for recipients.
* Ensure that both genders understand properly MRE messages.
* Have women as instructors.&lt;ref name="mineaction.org"/&gt;

===[[Mine action#Mine Victim Assistance|Victim assistance]]===

For victim assistance, the guidelines explains that women and men have often different access to victim assistance due to cultural barriers and other obstacles. It states that mine action organisations should consider these barriers and their vulnerability to the economic, psychological and social implications of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://victim-assistance.org/advocacy/gender-and-victim-assistance|title=Gender &amp; Victim Assistance|date=8 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guidelines' recommendations are: 
 
* Collect age- and sex-disaggregated data about victims, their needs and the level of access to services.
* Support survivor advocacy and awareness.
* Include women into victim assistance teams to ensure access to female victims in conservative contexts.&lt;ref name="mineaction.org"/&gt;

===Advocacy===

In terms of advocacy, the guidelines state that women and men have different sensibilities to messages and access to communication channels. Mine action organisations have to consider these peculiarities in planning advocacy activities. Its recommendations are:

* Tailor advocacy initiatives to women, girls, boys and men
* Convey information on the benefits of compliance with international legal norms addressing the mine/ERW problem and victim assistance
* Encourage advocacy activities among women, girls, boys and men in mine/ERW-affected communities &lt;ref name="mineaction.org"/&gt;

==Gender and Mine Action Programme==

The Gender and Mine Action Programme (GMAP) was created in December 2006 by the [[Swiss Campaign to Ban Landmines]]. Its purpose is to promote [[gender mainstreaming]] in [[mine action]] by trying to make mine action include the needs, priorities, and knowledge of everyone (including women, children, and other marginalized groups) in the community at risk of landmines or other [[Unexploded ordnance|UXO]]. The goal of gender mainstreaming is to make mine action more inclusive, efficient and effective.&lt;ref name="gmap.ch"/&gt; The goal of the Programme is to research, provide training and consultation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/en-gb/about-us/what-we-do/2015-campaign-action-plan.aspx|title=404 -  CMC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; create guidelines and strategies,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macca.org.af/macca/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MAPA-gender-mainstreaming-strategy-FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/documents/femm/dv/gbv_toolkit_book_01_20_2015_/gbv_toolkit_book_01_20_2015_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; create awareness,&lt;ref&gt;http://2013.pressclub.ch/fr/conference/convention-dottawa-des-principes-dun-traite-aux-actions-sur-le-terrain&lt;/ref&gt; and publish material related to gender and diversity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineaction.org/issues/genderandmineaction|title=UN Mine Action Gateway - Gender &amp; Mine Action|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/13.2/focus/nilsson/nilsson.shtml|title=Gender and Land Release: The Responsibility of the Mine-action Community, by Marie Nilsson, Virginie RozÃ¨s and Juliane Garcia (13.2)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in mine action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmap.ch/index.php?id=49|title=Gender &amp; Mine Action Programme – Gmap.ch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbnews.ch/english/filling-a-niche-gender-and-mine-action-programme|title=Filling a niche: Gender and Mine Action Programme|date=4 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also support hiring more women in mine action including mine clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/12/141212-women-land-mines-war-mozambique-africa-culture/|title=Clearing Land Mines Becomes Women's Work in Mozambique and Beyond|date=13 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hosted in the offices of the [[Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining#Partners|Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD)]] in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gichd.org/mine-action-topics/gender-and-diversity/#.VZFZUdKqpBc|title=Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining: Gender and diversity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are part of a [[Gender and security sector reform|Gender and Diversity in Security]] Hub with other security organizations at the [[Maison de la paix|Maison de la Paix]] in Geneva: [[Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces|Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)]], [[Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining|Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD)]], [[Geneva Centre for Security Policy|Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP)]], and [[Small Arms Survey|Small Arms Survey (SAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GenderDiversityHUB|title=MdP Gender &amp; Diversity Hub - Facebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Like many [[Gender mainstreaming#Criticism|criticisms of the gender mainstreaming movement]] in general, gender mainstreaming in mine action has faced similar problems such as ineffective results, poor implementation, those using it to hinder progress, and being primarily western dominated.  Asa Massleberg, for the [[#Gender and Mine Action Programme|Gender and Mine Action Programme]], wrote that the common measurements of success in mine action, such as meters squared of land cleared of mines and number of people who received a service, are insufficient because they do not take into account the overall and long term impact of a community. She argues it can only be done by assessing all the processes and procedures in a project cycle which are adapted to the needs of women, girls, boy and men in a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/14.2/focus/massleberg/massleberg.shtml|title=Redefining Success: Whose Reality Counts?|author=Åsa Massleberg|volume=14|issue=2|publisher=|journal=The Journal of ERW &amp; Mine Action }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[#Gender and Mine Action Programme|Gender and Mine Action Programme]], the effects of gender mainstreaming are still largely undocumented, not understood by those implementing it, and require further research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/18.1/focus/calza.shtml|title=Effects of Mixed Teams on Land Release|author1=Arianna Calza Bini|author2=Nyske Janssen|author3=Abigail Jones|volume=18|issue=1|publisher=|journal=The Journal of ERW &amp; Mine Action }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to deal with other biases not included in gender mainstreaming, the [[#Gender and Mine Action Programme|Gender and Mine Action Programme]] has also expanded gender mainstreaming to include the term [[Cultural diversity|diversity]]. Gender and diversity mainstreaming includes other factors in the demographics of a community that may hinder or help the long term impact of mine action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmap.ch/index.php?id=325|title=Gender &amp; Mine Action Programme – Gmap.ch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Grome''''' is an environmental modeling package developed by Quad Software dedicated for procedural and manual generation of large virtual outdoor worlds suitable for games and other 3D real-time simulation applications.

== History ==
After more than two years of internal developing, the program was first launched on {{#dateformat:March 28, 2007}} as version 1.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamershell.com/companies/garage_games/400947.html Joint announcement of collaboration with GarageGames]&lt;/ref&gt; It immediately started to be used by various professional game studios and independent developers. Version 1.1 was launched on {{#dateformat:August 22, 2007}} adding various optimizations, pen tablet support and more flexibility by introducing user defined data sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15219 Grome 1.1 Launch Announcement (Gamasutra)]&lt;/ref&gt; Following this was version 1.2 on {{#dateformat:March 12, 2008}} which optimized existing fractal tools and added new ones, extended import and export with new data formats and introduced the Grome scripting language for automated tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17833 Grome 1.2 Launch Announcement (Gamasutra)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major release, 2.0, was introduced on {{#dateformat:June 18, 2009}} with many new additions. With this new version, Grome becomes a more complete outdoor editing platform by introducing editing of water surfaces, vegetation and other decoration layers. 64bit processing was introduced to take advantage of large amounts of RAM and 64bit CPUs. With this version, Quad Software announced the availability for customization work for professional studios that need a specific Grome version for their projects.

The Grome 3.0 version was launched on {{#dateformat:April 4, 2011}} bringing road networks editing, support for per-pixel materials, optimization tools for mobiles and low-end hardware and other new tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengl.org/news/comments/grome-3.0-the-opengl-based-scene-editor-launched/ Grome 3.0 Launch Announcement on OpenGL official site]&lt;/ref&gt; A new updated, version 3.1, was launched on October 12, 2011 with focus on optimization. A further update, version 3.11, was made on September 12, 2012, fixing various issues and improving the SDK.

'''Halotolerance''' is the [[osmoregulation|adaptation]] of living [[organism]]s to conditions of high [[salinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Larcher, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Halotolerant species tend to live in areas such as [[hypersaline lake]]s, [[dune|coastal dunes]], saline [[desert]]s, [[salt marsh]]es, and inland salt [[sea]]s and [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s. [[Halophile]]s are organisms that live in highly saline environments, and require the [[salinity]] to survive, while halotolerant organisms (belonging to different [[Domain (biology)|domains]] of life) can grow under saline conditions, but do not require elevated concentrations of salt for growth. [[Halophyte]]s are salt-tolerant higher plants. Halotolerant microorganisms are of considerable biotechnological interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s007920100184 | last1 = Margesin | first1 = R. | last2 = Schinner | first2 = F. | title = Potential of halotolerant and halophilic microorganisms for biotechnology | journal = Extremophiles : Life Under Extreme Conditions | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–83 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11354458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Fields of scientific research relevant to halotolerance include [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[cell biology]], [[physiology]], [[ecology]], and [[genetics]].

An understanding of halotolerance can be applicable to areas such as [[arid-zone agriculture]], [[xeriscaping]], [[aquaculture]] (of fish or algae), bioproduction of desirable compounds (such as [[phycobiliprotein]]s or [[carotenoid]]s) using seawater to support growth, or [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of salt-affected soils. In addition, many environmental stressors involve or induce osmotic changes, so knowledge gained about halotolerance can also be relevant to understanding tolerance to extremes in moisture or temperature.

Goals of studying halotolerance include increasing the agricultural productivity of lands affected by [[soil salination]] or where only saline water is available. Conventional agricultural species could be made more halotolerant by gene transfer from naturally halotolerant species (by conventional [[Artificial selection|breeding]] or [[genetic engineering]]) or by applying treatments developed from an understanding of the mechanisms of halotolerance. In addition, naturally halotolerant plants or microorganisms could be developed into useful [[agriculture|agricultural]] crops or [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] organisms.

==Cellular functions in halophytes==
Tolerance of high salt conditions can be obtained through several routes. High levels of salt entering the plant can trigger ionic imbalances which cause complications in respiration and photosynthesis, leading to reduced rates of growth, injury and death in severe cases. To be considered tolerant of saline conditions, the [[protoplast]] must show methods of balancing the toxic and [[osmotic]] effects of the increased salt concentrations. Halophytic vascular plants can survive on soils with salt concentrations around 6%, or up to 20% in extreme cases. Tolerance of such conditions is reached through the use of [[stress proteins]] and compatible cytoplasm osmotic solutes.&lt;ref name=Gupta-2014&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijg/2014/701596/| title=Mechanism of Salinity Tolerance in Plants: Physiological, Biochemical, and Molecular Characterization| first1=Bhaskar| last1=Gupta| first2=Bingru| last2=Huang| journal=[[International Journal of Genomics]]| volume=2014| pages=1–18| doi=10.1155/2014/701596| pmid=24804192| pmc=3996477| date=3 April 2014| accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To exist in such conditions, halophytes tend to be subject to the uptake of high levels of salt into their cells, and this is often required to maintain an osmotic potential lower than that of the soil to ensure water uptake. High salt concentrations within the cell can be damaging to sensitive organelles such as the chloroplast, so sequestration of salt is seen. Under this action, salt is stored within the [[vacuole]] to protect such delicate areas. If high salt concentrations are seen within the vacuole, a high concentration gradient will be established between the vacuole and the cytoplasm, leading to high levels of energy investment to maintain this state. Therefore, the accumulation of compatible cytoplasmic osmotic solutes can be seen to prevent this situation from occurring. [[Amino acid]]s such as proline accumulate in halophytic [[Brassica]] species, quaternary ammonium bases such as Glycine Betaine and sugars have been shown to act in this role within halophytic members of [[Chenopodiaceae]] and members of [[Asteraceae]] show the buildup of cyclites and soluble sugars. The buildup of these compounds allow for the balancing of the osmotic effect while preventing the establishment of toxic concentrations of salt or requiring the maintenance of high concentration gradients

==Bacterial halotolerance==
The extent of halotolerance varies widely amongst different species of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Häussinger and Helmut Sies, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[cyanobacteria]] are halotolerant; an example location of occurrence for such cyanobacteria is in the [[Makgadikgadi Pans]], a large [[hypersaline lake]] in [[Botswana]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fungal halotolerance==
[[Fungi]] from habitats with high concentration of salt are mostly halotolerant (i.e. they do not require salt for growth) and not halophilic. Halophilic fungi are a rare exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Institute for Tropical Biology and Conservation''' (ITBC), in [[Bahasa Malaysia]]: Institut Biologi Tropika dan Pemuliharaan (IBTP) is a research institute of [[Universiti Malaysia Sabah]] in [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]. Founded in 1996, its objectives have been to promote and carry out research on the [[biodiversity]] of tropical flora and fauna, especially of the Malaysian state of Sabah, and to build resources that facilitate this, such as technical laboratories for DNA analysis, organic chemistry, and microscopy, and the "Borneensis" natural history collection focusing on native flora and fauna.
The institute has had three directors: the founding director, entomologist Prof. Dr. Maryati Mohamed (1996–2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sajise|editor1-first=Percy E.|editor2-last=Ticsay|editor2-first=Mariliza V.|editor3-last=Saguiguit|editor3-first=Gil C.|title=Moving forward : Southeast Asian perspectives on climate change and biodiversity|date=2010|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|location=Singapore|isbn=978-9812309785}}&lt;/ref&gt; zoologist Prof. Dr. Abdul Hamid Ahmad (2008–2012), and the current director, organic chemist Prof. Dr. Charles S. Vairappan.
ITBC publishes the open-access, online ''Journal of Tropical Biology and Conservation''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13194">'''Interior design psychology''' is a field within [[environmental psychology]], which concerns the environmental conditions of the interior. It is a direct study of the relationship between an environment and how that environment affects the behaviour of its inhabitants, with the aim of maximising the positive affects of this relationship.
Through [[interior design]] psychology the performance and efficiency of the space and the wellbeing of the individual are improved. Figures like [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[John B. Calhoun]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]] have shown that by incorporating this psychology into design one can control an environment and to an extent, the relationship and behaviour of its inhabitants. An example of this is seen through the rat experiments conducted by Calhoun in which he noted the aggression, killing and changed sexual tendencies amongst rats. This experiment created a stark behavioural analogy between the rat’s behaviour and inhabitation in high-rise building projects in the US after WWII, an example of which is the Pruitt-Igoe development in St Louis demolished in 1972 only 21 years after being erected.

==Proxemics==

Proxemics study the amount of space people feel necessary to have between themselves and others. 
Crowding and Personal Space
In this field of study the phenomenon of territoriality is demonstrated continuously through unwritten indices and behaviours, which communicate, the conscious or subconscious notions of personal space and territoriality. This phenomenon is seen, for example, through the use of public seating and the empty seats on a crowded bus or train. 
“ Crowding occurs when the regulation of social interaction is unsuccessful and our desires for social interaction are exceeded by the actual amount of social interaction experienced.”&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=G.W.|author2=R.E. Wener|title=Crowding and personal space invasion on the train: Please don’t make me sit in the middle|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2007|volume=27|pages=90–94|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2006.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Studies observing social behaviours and psychology have indicated, such as in the case for commuters that people will seek to maximise personal space whether standing or sitting.

In a study conducted by Gary W. Evans and Richard E. Wene, (who work within the field of environmental design and human development) of 139 adult commuters, commuting between New Jersey and Manhattan, (54% male) saliva samples were taken to measure cortisol levels, a hormonal marker of stress. Their research accounts statistically for other possible stressors such as income and general life stress. 
“We find that a more proximal index of density is correlated with multiple indices of stress wherein a more distal index of density is not.”&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; 
Concerns arising from the results of this study suggest that small deviations in increased seat density, controlled against income stress, would elevate the log of cortisol (i.e. stress levels) and diminish task performance and mood.

=== Relationships between People ===
Closely related to the proxemics of space, in the area of privacy. In “Perspectives on Privacy” P. Brierley Newell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brierley Newell|first=P.|title=Perspectives on Privacy|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=1995|volume=15|pages=87–104|doi=10.1016/0272-4944(95)90018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  from the department of psychology at the University of Warwick, Coventry defines privacy as ‘a voluntary and temporary condition of separation from the public domain.’ The desire for privacy is often identified as a link between stress and distress. The ability to obtain privacy within an environment allows the individual to separate themselves physically and mentally from others and relax. This notion is of key importance in determining the behaviour and wellbeing of the individual. As above in the scenario of crowding and density on public transport, privacy dictates perception of comfort, in relation to crowding and personal space. Dissatisfaction with one’s environment can be related to the close proximity with others, leading to stress and as a result diminish mood and performance behaviours..

=== Defensible Space ===
This theory began development in 1962 when John B. Calhoun conducted a series of experiments on rats to study population density and social pathology. From these experiments a breeding utopia was established for the rats in which they only lacked space.  
“Unwanted social contact occurred with increasing frequency, leading to increased stress and aggression. Following the work of the physiologist, Hans Selye, it seemed that the adrenal system offered the standard binary solution: fight or flight. But in the sealed enclosure, flight was impossible. Violence quickly spiralled out of control. Cannibalism and infanticide followed. Males became hypersexual, pansexual and, an increasing proportion, homosexual. Calhoun called this vortex “a behavioural sink”. Their numbers fell into terminal decline and the population tailed off to extinction”&lt;ref name="Ramsden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramsden|first=E.|title=The Urban Animal: population density and social pathology in rodents and humans|journal=World Health Organisation Bulletin|year=2009|volume=87|pages=82|doi=10.2471/blt.09.062836|pmc=2636191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This study linked population growth, environmental degradation and urban violence.&lt;ref name="Ramsden"/&gt;  Similar behavioural tendencies became apparent within the poor housing conditions at the Pruitt-Igoe development in St Louis. This development is now used as a key study of inhabitation by architects and urban planners, Oscar Newman one of the main developers of this field, references the observations of inhabitation at this establishment in his book ''Creating Defensible Space''.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=O|title=Creating Defensible Space|year=1996|publisher=US Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes the stark difference between private space, which is clearly defined personal territory, and the public space in this development. He notes that public spaces shared by relatively few families compared to those shared by many were much more hygienic and well-looked after, whereas those shared by larger numbers were often vandalized and unhygienic. He comments that the anonymity created by these largely shared public corridors and spaces “evoked no feelings of identity or control”&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt;  This indicates our relationship with space affects our behaviour and use of space. In this example lack of feelings of ownership of the space led to negative behaviour within space and furthermore created a feedback with negative effects on the wellbeing of the inhabitants.

== The Perception of Space ==
This perception can otherwise be termed as awareness between our bodies and the awareness of other bodies, organisms and bodies around us. Perceived beauty and personal involvement within an environment are key factors, which determine our perception of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osgood|first=C.E. |author2=G.J. Suci |author3=P.H. Tannebaum|title=The Measurement of Meaning|year=1957|publisher=The Board of Trustees at the University of Illinois|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As defined in the ''Measurement of Meaning'' by Osgood, Suci and Tannebaum  the factors influencing the perception of space are these 3 things:
1.	Evaluation- including the aesthetic, affective and symbolic meaning of space
2.	Power- the energy requirements to adapt to a space
3.	Activity- links to the noise within a space and the worker’s relationship and satisfaction with job and task
In “Effects of the self-schema on perception of space at work” by Gustave Nicolas Fischer, Cyril Tarquinio, Jacqueline C. Vischer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=G.N.|author2=C.Tarquino, J.C. Vischer|title=Effects of the self-schema on perception of space at work|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=24|pages=131–140|doi=10.1016/s0272-4944(03)00052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study conducted linking design and psychology in the workplace. In this study they proposed a theoretical model linking environmental perception, work satisfaction and sense of self in a feedback loop. This is shown below in Fig. 1,  to illustrate their findings on the direct relationship the environment has with the inhabitant and how through psychology this affects behaviour.

== The System of Objects ==
Developed by [[Jean Baudrillard]] as part of his sociology doctorate thesis Le Système des objets ([[The System of Objects]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=J.|title=The System of Objects (Verso English Edition)|year=1996|publisher=Bookmarque|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this he proposed the 4 object valuing criteria, these being:
# Function – a pen is used to write
# Exchange or economic value- a piano being worth three chairs
# Symbolic- an amethyst symbolising a birth in February
# Sign- the branding or prestige of an object, with no added function being valued over another, it may be used to suggest social values such as class.

In this way the objects and human relationship with objects in the interior environment has significant psychological meaning and impact. In “Social Attributions Based on Domestic Interiors” by M.A. Wilson and N.E. Mackenzie it is proposed that:
“people’s interactions with the environment are determined by the meanings they attribute to it, and both stress the impact of expectations on behaviour within a particular environment.”&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackenzie|first=N.E.|author2=M.A. Wilson|title=Social Attributions Based on Domestic Interiors|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2000|volume=20|pages=343–354|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0181}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The study they discuss further developed the theme, that objects and the way in which we classify them, in turn, allows us to classify the social attributes of the owner of the objects, in relation to age and social class according to the object valuing system. This system suggests that our relationship with objects affects both our behaviour as we use objects according to their function, but also how we are perceived in the eyes of other. This makes our relationship with objects and space pivotal to our psychology.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt;

== Space-Time Relationships ==
Charles Rice references the thinking of Walter Benjamin, in ''The Emergence of the Interior'',&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Charles|title=The Emergence of the Interior|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the study of interiorization and experience. He proposes that in our faster-paced modern society experiences are instantaneous and through this we are missing long experiences such as a connection with tradition and the accumulation of wisdom over time. To reforge a sense of this relationship and address the current lack he demonstrates that we might materially create such a relationship through inanimate objects in our environment. Giving the example: 
“that the hearth and the mantelpiece might materially encode the mythical fireside and the situation it provided for the telling of stories.”
In this way one’s relationship with objects can embody a sense of experience, and fulfil the desire for a connection with tradition.

== Brief Background ==

A greater awareness into this field has emerged since the 20th century, when the function and performance of the interior became of chief importance in designing habitations, the start of user-centred design, for example [[La Maison de Verre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=M.J.|author2=W.G. Gjertson|title=La Maison de Verre: Negotiating a Modern Domesticity|journal=Journal of Interior Design|date=September 2008|volume=34|issue=1|pages=15–37|doi=10.1111/j.1939-1668.2008.00004.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This modern idea of the interior- designing for the user from the inside to the outside has coincided with psychological analysis on the and effects on inhabitations.

In ''The Emergence of the Interior'', Charles Rice rationalized the implications of the interior:&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt;
•	Under context of modernity 
•	Status of the experience
•	Presence of history and
•	Knowledge about subjectivity

The Importance of the development of this field is evident through the above areas of study

Understanding and implementation of interior design psychology has the ability to impact and improve the performance, efficiency and wellbeing of the individual inhabitant. As illustrated through the above categories this is an important and relevant developing field within design and planning.

==Background==

===World War II Ireland===
During World War II, Ireland remained mostly uninvolved in the war that swept through most the rest of Europe, known only as "the Emergency" in Ireland.&lt;ref name=ThatIsOnlyWar&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Caleb|title=That is only war: Irish writers and the emergency|journal=UMI Dissertations Publishing|year=2006|pages=2–4|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304978789}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking a "neutral" stance in the war, Ireland did not engage directly in the war on either side and declined to make any kind of established allegiance to the Axis or Allied powers.  As a result, Ireland experienced a period of isolation from the rest of the Western world, with few Irishmen travelling abroad and few foreigners travelling to Ireland.  This period of isolation set in motion a period of criticism and questioning of the fledgling country's national identity and ideals, with various factions unhappy with the status quo in the island nation.   Some of the primary concerns for those unsatisfied with the state of the Ireland at the time included a government unconcerned with the republican ideals the nation was created with, widespread poverty in Ireland, and a general inability for the nation to be a major player on the world stage capable of defending itself.  With these concerns and isolation, the Irish people sought to question the direction Ireland was headed in.  And in this war period and the time that immediately followed, Ireland and its artists also sought to question what constituted "Irish art" and how that would impact Irish identity.&lt;ref name=ThatIsOnlyWar /&gt;

===Art In Ireland===
Art in Ireland during the 1930s and 1940s still primarily consisted of traditional representational art.  Championed by the Royal Hibernian Academy and the National College of Art, this traditionalist art remained the favored style of visual artistic creation following the Emergency period.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the this sentence and the previous one|date=April 2015}} Many Irish artists rejected the established institutions and sought philosophical inspiration from other fields, particularly that of literature.&lt;ref name=TheEmergency /&gt; Although it was not until the late 1930s that the character of Irish art was to be seriously challenged as Irish artists began seeking an Irish artistic identity.  With artists like Mainie Jellett leading the way, artists of Ireland, who more frequently received no formal education due to some of the institutions more restrictive policies, found an outlet to challenge the traditionalist movements in Ireland through organizations like the IELA.&lt;ref name=TheEmergency&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Roisin|title=The emergency: a turning point for Irish art?|journal=Circa|year=2000|pages=1–2|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1320756901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the opening of the IELA, only one major exhibition took place each year in Dublin, which was the Annual Exhibition of the Royal Hibernian Academy.  The RHA, and other major art institutions in Ireland at this time, supported art that accurately portrayed reality.&lt;ref name=LivingArt&gt;{{cite news|last=Coleman|first=John|title=A Painter of Living Art: Jack P. Hanlon 1913-1968|journal=|year=1988|pages=222|doi=10.2307/20492069}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And while the established art forums favored traditional representational art, there was some push back from groups of artists in favor of modernist art.  One of the most well-known of these prior to the IELA was known as the [[White Stag Group]] which was formed in the late 1930s.  The White Stag Group, formed by Kenneth Hall and Basil Rakoczi, had middle-class English roots that eventually took hold in Dublin and the rest of Ireland. It wasn't until organizations like the IELA and White Stag Group came about that non-traditional Irish art had a means of being displayed in a way that was accessible and popular.&lt;ref name=Stag&gt;{{cite book|last=Keown, Edwina|first=and Carol Taaffe|title=Irish Modernism|publisher=Peter Lang AG, International Publishers|pages=181–182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iu5qMGrr3QcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the IELA==
The IELA was formed in 1943 after a group of middle-class artists in Ireland sought to oppose the traditional hegemony created by the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA) and the National College of Art in Ireland.  Artists in this group included [[Norah McGuinness]], [[Mainie Jellett]], [[Evie Hone]], Fr. [[Jack Hanlon (Priest and Painter)|Jack Hanlon]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]], among others.&lt;ref name=IELAbio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/irish-exhibition-living-art|title=Irish Exhibition of Living Art|work=British and Irish Artists of the 20th Century|publisher=Artist Biographies|accessdate=19 Feb 2014|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not all of them subscribed completely to the modernism of the rest of western Europe and the United States, these artists did seek to stray off the path established by Irish art institutions.  Many artists that founded the IELA were influenced by the dissenting Impressionist art circles in Paris who broke away from the French Academy.  Even though they understood this may cause friction with established institutions in Ireland, many of the founders saw the French as an example to be followed.  However, many artists managed to form a delicate balance, seeing as artists who displayed their work in the IELA also displayed pieces through the other traditional institutions such as the RHA.  Nonetheless, the IELA's main goal was to provide a forum for artists who sought to reshape the Irish artistic landscape and provided them the means through which to do that.&lt;ref name=LivingArt /&gt;

The beginnings of the IELA can be traced to an open criticism of the RHA by Jellett which ultimately led to other modernist artists like le Brocquy having their works rejected for exhibitions hosted annually by the RHA.  In response to this, Jellett and other modernist artists established the IELA to create a forum to display the work of artists regardless of what school or style they subscribed to.  Reviews of the IELA's first show in 1943 indicated the division in the art world over artistic identity and creativity.&lt;ref name=IELAhist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/irish-exhibition-of-living-art.htm|title=Irish Exhibition of Living Art (IELA) (1943-1980s)|work=Irish Exhibition of Living Art|publisher=History and Foundation of the IELA|accessdate=19 Feb 2014|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some instances, this division was deeply entrenched, especially in the National College of Art, which was opposed to modernist movements for some time.  However, this opposition was not felt as strongly in every established institution in the country.  Even though steadfastness for traditional art was common, much of the art world in Ireland remained fairly well connected and eased their opposition to the tide of modernism coming from continent-inspired artists.  Both the modernist and traditionalist camps had their work displayed by the same institutions in some instances.  Ultimately, this coexistence allowed for institutions like IELA to be friendly with organizations such as the RHA, without which the IELA would have no traction in the Dublin art world.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;

Not only did the IELA seek to break from the traditional norms of Irish art, it was displayed some progressive trends for its time, whether intentionally or otherwise.  For example, women artists played a critical role in the formation and establishment of the IELA.  The first two presidents of the Exhibition, Mainie Jellett and Norah McGuinness, were women who held the position during the formative years of the Exhibition.  Jellett, who served as the president before her death in 1944, played a key role in its formation, and McGuinness, who served for over 20 years after its foundation, played a critical role in maintaining the direction that the IELA stood for.&lt;ref name=WomenArtists&gt;{{cite news|last=Mayes, Elizabeth, Jeni Rogers, Wanda Ryan-Smolin|title=Irish Women Artists: From the 18th Century to the Present Day|journal=|year=1990|pages=45–49|jstor=1358389}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades following its conception, the IELA became a fixture in the Irish art world.  However, while they did become established, they did not allow themselves to lose sight of the founding principles of the institution.  True to the spirit of the IELA, the original management stepped down and handed off the Exhibition to a younger generation of artists in 1972.  The IELA continued to influence young artists well into the future.&lt;ref name=HistofIreland&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=J. R.|title=A New History of Ireland, Volume VII: Medieval Ireland 1921-1984|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=606–607|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfFXarIhGqEC&amp;pg=PT84&amp;lpg=PT84&amp;dq=A+New+History+of+Ireland,+Volume+VII&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=86rx_eRc1m&amp;sig=6b7_13lLlYMHNVISv3W-mEt_Ows&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Os0qVcq4AoewggTgvYG4BQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Irish%20Exhibition%20of%20Living%20Art%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day, the IELA remains a showcase for contemporary art and has since expanded to include other art forms such as performance, video, and installation art.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;  The IELA has played an enormous role in developing the Irish art scene and providing an outlet through which the artists of Ireland can display their works while also challenging the norm in Irish art, even being called a part of the "birth of Modernism in the visual arts in Ireland."&lt;ref name=IrishTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Lilliput|first=Dorothy|title=Knowing the difference Brian Kennedy welcomes a 'splendid' history of Irish modern art|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=142626&amp;sr=HLEAD(Knowing%20the%20difference%20Brian%20Kennedy%20welcomes%20a%20%60splendid%20history%20of%20Irish%20modern%20art)%20and%20date%20is%201998|accessdate=19 Feb 2015|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=10 Jan 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Exhibition even expanded to include postmodernist art to expose both the public and artists alike to new developing styles.&lt;ref name=IELAhist /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4292">The theory of the '''least objectionable program''' ('''LOP''') is a [[Mediology|mediological]] theory explaining television audience behavior. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1979/03/06/nbcees-paul-klein-to-the-door/998c31db-7e66-4bc0-bbd3-b3090f0b97d1/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5d4109eb41b1 NBCees Paul Klein To the Door-The Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in the 1960s by then executive of audience measurement at [[NBC]], [[Paul L. Klein]], &lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/1998/scene/people-news/paul-l-klein-1117882432/ Paul L. Klein-Variety]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/13/business/paul-l-klein-69-a-developer-of-pay-per-view-tv-channels.html Paul Klein obituary], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; who was greatly influenced by the media theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man|Understanding Media]]''.

== "Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch" ==

In an article "Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch" (published in ''[[TV Guide]]'' in 1971&lt;ref&gt;Klein, P. (July 24, 1971). Why you watch what you watch when you watch. TV Guide, 6-9.&lt;/ref&gt;), Klein explained that viewers consume the medium of [[television]] rather than [[Television program|television shows]], treating the medium as the end of their consumption itself rather than using the set as a means to access specific programs they like the way they might choose a book from a shelf to access the story within. Since the introduction of television, the same percentage of sets are in use on, say, a Thursday evening at a certain hour, year after year, regardless of what content is broadcast. This is because unlike the way people use books, museums, or the cinema as means of consuming desired content, audiences consume television, the medium, as the desired object. TV viewers turn the set on, deciding to "watch television", and then seek out something to watch from what is available, flipping around, not until they find "something they like" - because television programming is in fact very rarely satisfying, and viewers rarely watch anything they actually like - but until they find something that doesn't offend them enough to make them flip to the next channel. (Viewers almost never turn off the set as a result of finding nothing tolerable and judging every program available boring or otherwise objectionable. Viewers commonly watch programs they describe later as unbearable, everything else on being even more intolerable. A more common response to a whole spectrum of equally unendurable choices than choosing to abandon the medium is to continue to flip frequently until new choices become available.) Thus, for programmers of television channels, Klein recommended understanding that audience attraction was a matter not of pleasing the greatest number of viewers but of offending the fewest (driving the fewest away to the competitors who may repulse them less). The television audience is in a kind of partial trance. A network will do better worrying less about not giving an audience enough to like, to be surprised and delighted by, and to engage their attention, than about avoiding, as Klein said, "disturbing their reverie" with something that causes them to change the channel. Thus, even as channel choices proliferate alongside numerous easily accessed out-of-schedule viewing options, successful television programs remain, as they have always been, formulaic, cliché, "instantly familiar," predictable, and monotonous in tone.

== Obsolescence of the theory ==
It has been widely suggested that the theory itself is obsolete thanks to high [[quality television|quality shows]], top-rated options and viewers' choice of shows whether live or time-shifted alongside the advancements of [[DVD]]s and [[Netflix]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tvguide.com/news/too-much-tv-1060072/ As More Networks Develop Series, Is There Too Much TV?-TV Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Les Annales du Théâtre et de la Musique 1876 title page - Internet Archive.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page (''Année'' 1875)]]

'''''Les Annales du Théâtre et de la Musique''''' ("The Annals of Theatre and Music") was an annual French periodical which covered French dramatic and lyric theatre for 42&amp;nbsp;years, from 1875 to 1916. The volumes also covered concert series and necrology. It was co-edited by Édouard Noël (1848–1926) and Edmond Stoullig (1845–1918) and was published in Paris by Charpentier from 1876 to 1895 and Berger-Levrault in 1896. Beginning in 1897 it was published annually by Paul Ollendorff (with Stoullig as the sole editor) up to 1914 with the penultimate volume published in 1916 (covering the years 1914–1915) and the final volume in 1918 (covering the year 1916). A total of 41 volumes were published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000678582 Holdings] at [[HathiTrust]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=Stoullig%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts "Stoullig"] at the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32694497t/date.r=.langEN Holdings] at [[Gallica]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/annales-du-theatre-et-de-la-musique/oclc/1772186/editions?sd=desc&amp;referer=br&amp;se=yr&amp;editionsView=true&amp;fq= Listings] at [[WorldCat]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial prefaces were contributed by, among others, [[Émile Zola]] (1878), [[Victorin de Joncières]] (1880), [[Émile Perrin]] (1882), [[Charles Garnier (architect)| Charles Garnier]] (1883), [[Charles Gounod]] (1885), [[Jules Barbier]] (1886), [[Henri Meilhac]] (1889), [[Ludovic Halévy]] (1890), [[Émile Faguet]] (1897), [[Albert Carré]] (1899), [[Catulle Mendès]] (1902), [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] (1904), [[Jean Richepin]] (1905), [[Maurice Donnay]] (1908), [[Robert de Flers]] (1911), and [[Léon Blum]] (1912).

'''Marylhurst University''' was a private, nonprofit applied liberal arts and business university located in [[Marylhurst, Oregon|Marylhurst]], [[Oregon]] United States. It was among the oldest collegiate degree-granting institutions in Oregon, having awarded its first degree in 1897. Marylhurst was founded as '''St. Mary's College''' and run for many years by the [[Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary]]. The former campus is located about nine miles south of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] on the [[Willamette River]]. Although Marylhurst University was a [[Roman Catholic]] school, it served students of all faiths and backgrounds. 

The university offered bachelor's degree completion programs in diverse liberal arts and business fields, and [[graduate degree]]s in such fields as business administration, food systems and society, teaching, art therapy counseling, divinity and applied theology, and interdisciplinary studies. After its establishment in 1893, Marylhurst became the first [[women's college|women]]'s [[liberal arts college]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]].

The university closed at the end of the Summer of 2018,&lt;ref name=closure&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marylhurst.edu/closure/ |title=Marylhurst Board of Trustees Votes to Close University by End of 2018 |author=Marylhurst University |date=May 2018 |accessdate=May 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="oreg-2018may18"&gt;{{cite news|last=Manning|first=Jeff|title=Marylhurst, citing declining enrollment, to close&lt;!--(print-edition headline)--&gt;|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=May 18, 2018|page=A1|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2018/05/marylhurst_university_to_close.html|accessdate=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declining enrollment was given as the main reason, with enrollment having dropped from 1,409 to 743 in just four years, from fall 2013 to fall 2017.  In recent years, the university's student population had peaked around 2,000 during the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]] of 2007–2009.&lt;ref name="oreg-2018may18"/&gt;

==History==
The Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, a Roman Catholic religious teaching congregation, arrived in Oregon in 1859.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; The Sisters came to Oregon from [[Montreal]] at the request of the people and [[clergy]] of the state to serve their educational needs, and established [[St. Mary's Academy]] in Portland that year.&lt;ref name=american&gt;{{cite book|last=Songe|first=Alice H.|title=American Universities and Colleges: A Dictionary of Name Changes|date=1978|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Mary's College===
In 1893, the group started St. Mary's Academy and College &lt;ref name=american/&gt; as the first [[liberal arts]] college to serve the educational needs of Pacific Northwest women. The school began in downtown Portland, where St. Mary's Academy is still located.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;  The Sisters purchased {{convert|63|acre|m2}} between [[Lake Oswego, Oregon|Lake Oswego]] and [[West Linn, Oregon|West Linn]] in 1908. The Sisters named the pastoral land Marylhurst, which means "Mary's Woods". The college was moved to the new property in 1930, and St. Mary's was renamed Marylhurst College.&lt;ref name=american/&gt;  The following year, the school received its first accreditation from the [[Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwccu.org/Directory%20of%20Inst/State%20Map/Oregon/Oregon.htm NWCCU Institutions of Oregon ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marylhurst College===
[[File:Marylhurst college bell tower P2584.jpeg|thumb|The [[B.P. John Administrative Building]] at the effective center of campus]]
In 1959, Marylhurst College became an independent institution and formed a Board of Trustees, separate from the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. In 1974, the college transitioned to a co-educational institution and it became the first liberal arts college in the United States to be designated as a college for [[lifelong learning]].

The [[American Art Therapy Association]] reviewed the program positively numerous times including 1991, 1996 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arttherapy.org/|title=American Art Therapy Association|date=2013-10-31|publisher=Arttherapy.org|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1996, ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'''s Guide to America's Best Colleges recognized Marylhurst as the best value in higher education among [[West Coast of the United States|Western]] regional colleges and universities. The University remained in the top tier for the Western Region in the US News &amp; World Report college rankings since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/items/3199 |title=Best Colleges &amp;#124; College Rankings &amp;#124; US News Education |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marylhurst University===
In 1998, Marylhurst College became Marylhurst University, [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas County]]'s first university.

==The Art Gym==
{{main article|The Art Gym}}
The Art Gym was a contemporary arts exhibition space located on campus. It was the brainchild of Kay Slusarenko, who was the art department chair for 20 years, from 1978 to 1998. With contemporaries Terri Hopkins and Paul Sutinen, she rallied the student body and community support to turn the unused gym into the cultural center that it is now. Each spring the gym displays the year's thesis projects. Since 1980, over 300 artists have shown their work at the gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Phinney/Bischoff Design House |url=http://www.marylhurst.edu/theartgym/index.php |title=The Art Gym • Marylhurst University |publisher=Marylhurst.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marylhurst University announced it would cease operations in 2018, prompting concern about the Art Gym's future. In July 2018, the Art Gym announced that it would be moving to the [[Oregon College of Art and Craft]] effective August 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marylhurst University's Art Gym Finds New Home |first=April |last=Baer |work=OPB |date=July 18, 2018 | url=https://www.opb.org/news/article/marylhurst-university-art-gym-gallery-oregon-college-art-craft/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30872">'''Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers''' ('''MRSECs''') are university based research centers supported by the MRSEC Program of the Division of Materials Research at the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF). The  centers support interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research of fundamental and technological importance and integrate research with education.  MRSECs require outstanding research quality, intellectual breadth, support for research infrastructure, and education outreach. MRSECs facilitate active collaborations between academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry, as well international collaborations.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;[http://www.mrsec.org/mrsec-program-overview "MRSEC Program Overview"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
MRSECs form a significant component of NSF's center-based research portfolio, but are also of historical importance. MRSECs were established by NSF in 1994&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but have their roots in the NSF Materials Research Laboratories (MRLs) started in 1972, which in turn evolved from the Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDLs) initiated by the Department of Defense in 1960.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;R.L. Sproull, "Materials Research Laboratories: The Early Years" in ''Advancing Materials Research''  (P.A. Psaras and H. D. Lanford, eds., National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. 1987), pps. 25-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;L.H. Schwartz, "Materials Research Laboratories: Reviewing the First Twenty-Five Years" in ''Advancing Materials Research''  (P.A. Psaras and H. D. Lanford, eds., National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. 1987), pps. 35-48.&lt;/ref&gt; These cross-disciplinary, center-based activities required significant changes in how materials research and education were carried out at academic institutions and the IDLs/MRLs are credited with contributing to the accelerating growth of  [[Materials Science and Engineering]] Departments in the U.S.  in the 1960s to 1980s.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They also made significant contributions to the National Materials Program that emerged from the early post [[Sputnik]] era, leading to a vigorous growth in science and engineering graduate education and the development of university based experimental facilities.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since much of the information regarding current MRSECs is available from websites&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; only a brief overview of the current program is provided. The main purpose of this article is to review the historical aspects of MRSECs and the significance of their impact on materials research and education in the U.S.

== Current MRSEC Status ==

===Program Summary ===

The research carried out in MRSECs is carried out in interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs), teams of six to a dozen or more researchers working on a current research topic of national significance. MRSECs range in size from two to four IRGs. The topics of the IRGs within a center may be focused on closely related scientific or technological topics or can cover distinctly different areas of research.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding levels for a given MRSEC currently range approximately from $1.5 to $3.5 million annually, depending of the overall scope of the research program. Each center has considerable flexibility to distribute its funds consistent with its proposed and approved research and education proposal.  In addition, the centers are strongly encouraged to apply a modest fraction of their funds for support of "seed projects," allowing them to respond quickly to promising new research opportunities.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

MRSECs feature partnerships with other academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry as well as international collaborations. The centers also feature extensive experimental and computational facilities, which are generally accessible to outside users.  A recently established facility network coordinates access to a broad range of experimental tools across the nationwide network of MRSECs.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A key mandate for these centers is the training and education of a future highly skilled workforce. The largest component of the center's funding is directed toward support of students (undergraduate and graduate), and postdoctoral researchers.  In addition, MRSECS carry out a broad range of education and outreach activities involving K - 12 students and public education through collaborations with museums and other public institutions.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=garcia&gt;U. Strom, "Garcia Center Leads Students from the Laboratory to the Real World", MRS Bulletin 32, 728-730 (2007).

===  Recent Competition Results ===

Generally, MRSEC awards are for six years with competitions held every three years.  Competitions are open to all US academic institutions and normally only one award is made per institution.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nine awards were made based on the competition held in 2010/2011&lt;ref name=nsfpress2010&gt;NSF Announces Results of the Materials Research Center and Teams Competition: [https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=121536 "National Science Foundation Press Release 11-186 (Sept. 8, 2011)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and twelve awards were made based on the 2013/2014 competition,&lt;ref name=nsfpress2015&gt; Funding cutting-edge, collaborative research.

== Historical Background ==

=== State of Materials Research Prior to 1960 ===

The modern study of materials intersects many of the traditional scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, engineering, and increasingly the biosciences and mathematics.  Until the middle of the 20th century the various disciplines approached the study of materials with their own distinctive methodologies. Interdisciplinary collaborations, especially at academic institutions, were not the norm.  Past exceptions were the successful collaborative approaches leading to the intense technological developments during the Second World War, including the military and peaceful applications of nuclear energy production.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;W.O. Baker, "Advances in Materials Research and Development" in Advancing Materials Research  (P.A. Psaras and H. D. Lanford, eds., National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. 1987), pps. 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The late 1950s saw important developments in how the federal government could play  an increasing role in supporting interdisciplinary, collaborative research at academic institutions. The successful launch of the Russian space satellite [[Sputnik]] on October 4, 1957 had a profound impact on how scientific and technological research was carried out in the United States.  Within a year of this date the federal government established two new agencies: The [[National  Aeronautic and Space Administration]] (NASA), which was to define US supported space exploration for the remainder of the century and beyond, and the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA, later [[DARPA]]) within the Department of Defense.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  ARPA was tasked with expanding the frontiers of technology and science, often with potential military applications. In addition, the [[National Defense Education Act of 1958]] had the main purpose to greatly increase the number of trained engineers, scientists, and mathematicians, and included provisions for financial assistance.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The post Sputnik enthusiasm for more investment in science research led to a broader recommendation in March 1958 for coordinating materials research in the United States by President Eisenhower's Science and Advisory Committee (PSAC). A subsequent report entitled "Strengthening American Science", was submitted to President Eisenhower in December 1958.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This report led, by Executive Order of President Eisenhower on March 13, 1959, to the formation of the Federal Council for Science and Technology.  One of the early actions of this council was the establishment of a "Coordinating Committee on Materials Research and Development" (CCMRD), which was chaired by John W. Williams, Director of Research of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The ultimate outcome was the establishment of three university based Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDLs) in mid 1960 under the supervision of ARPA.,&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea of an interdisciplinary laboratory in the solid state and materials sciences had already proved extremely successful in industrial laboratory settings (such as the Bell Laboratories and others) leading, for example,  to the development of the transistor and the laser. The establishment of such laboratories in an academic environment arose naturally from the demands of the post-Sputnik era for a large, highly trained, scientific workforce. American universities were ideally positioned to provide the opportunity to combine their educational mission with the planned development of larger, modern state-of-the-art experimental facilities.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDLs) 1960-1972 ===

The creation of three Interdisciplinary laboratories, at Cornell University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Northwestern University, was officially announced by ARPA on July 11, 1960.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The contracts required that these universities "shall establish an interdisciplinary materials research program and shall furnish the necessary personnel and facilities for the conduct of research in the science of materials..."&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following year (1961) eight additional IDLs were created:&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brown University, University of Chicago, Harvard, University of Maryland, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of North Carolina, Purdue University, and Stanford University.
  
A 12th IDL was added at the University of Illinois in 1962, which was administered by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).  Subsequently, there were three more AEC contracts and two contracts through NASA.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the AEC in establishing a strong materials research community was well known since the advent of nuclear reactors and the importance of materials in reactor cost, efficiency, and safety.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1955 [[John von Neumann]], renowned mathematician and contributor to the Manhattan Project, in his role as commissioner of the AEC and member of the AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC), strongly endorsed a materials-focused institute in an academic setting.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The impact of the IDLs on the training of students was significant.  By 1969 over 360 new doctorate degrees were awarded. A report by the National Academy of Sciences&lt;ref name=coscmat&gt;National Academy of Sciences, Committee on the Survey of Materials Science and Engineering (COSCMAT), Materials and Man's Needs: Materials Science and Engineering, Vol.III (National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., 1975), pp.&amp;nbsp;7–209 - 7-210&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that these center based programs were instrumental in defining "materials science and engineering" as a new interdisciplinary activity which was evidenced by a rapid increase of materials science departments between 1960 and 1970 and beyond.  In addition, to the building of new facilities infrastructure these centers of excellence led to the training of not only materials scientists, but also physicists, chemists, engineers and other professionals.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The National Academy study&lt;ref name=coscmat&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; noted that though the IDLs were considered a success, there was room for growth of interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty from different university departments. However, it was acknowledged that joint  block funding and joint use of shared experimental facilities by students and faculty from diverse departments had planted the seeds for increased interdisciplinarity in materials research.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===  The Materials Research Laboratories (MRLs) 1972-1994 ===

In late 1969 an amendment to the Military Authorization Act, sponsored by Senator Mike Mansfield, placed restrictions on the funding of long-term basic research by agencies of the Department of Defense, including ARPA/DARPA.&lt;ref name=nsb70s&gt;The National Science Board: A History in Highlights 1950-2000; [https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/1970/mansfield.html "The 1970s: The Mansfield Amendment"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsb80s&gt;The National Science Board: A History in Highlights 1950-2000; [https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/1980/debate.html "The 1980s: The Debate over Centers"]&lt;/ref&gt; (ARPA was changed to DARPA in 1972). Consequently, a decision was made in 1970 to transfer the IDLs to the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The block type IDL grant for multidisciplinary research and shared facilities would mean a distinct departure of NSF's funding approach at that time which was support of predominantly small, single investigator grants in a particular discipline.   After an in-depth review by NSF of the IDL program a transfer of the then existing 12 IDLs to NSF was recommended. However, the transfer came with several major critical provisions.  These included the following:&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

"The laboratories, now renamed 'Materials Research Laboratories', would retain locally administered block (or 'core') funding intended to 'facilitate research in materials science and engineering which is either difficult or unfeasible to carry out under traditional funding of individual research.' Most importantly, the new component added by NSF was that 'scientific excellence is viewed as a necessary, but no longer sufficient, condition to qualify for MRL core support.' In addition, the MRLs would be judged by their ability to foster 'coherent, multidisciplinary and multi-investigator projects requiring the expertise of two or more materials related disciplines.' These so-called thrust groups are the heart of the current core funding at MRLs; at their best they have achieved a transformation in the way materials research is done at universities and in the way graduate education proceeds."&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Acceptance by NSF of the new materials laboratories in 1972 led to the creation of the Division of Materials Research (DMR).  Its initial portfolio consisted of the MRL program as well as individual investigator programs closely related to materials science which were drawn from other parts of NSF.  Initially, the MRL program made up approximately 40% of the DMR budget. By 1985, with the growth of individual investigator and small group programs, the MRL program was funded at a level of about 20% of the total DMR budget.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1972 and 1985, a number of additional MRLs were added and some of the existing centers were phased out.  The following table summarizes this information:&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;The National Science Foundation's Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers Program: Looking Back, Moving Forward, (The National Academies Press, 2007) [http://www.nap.edu/read/11966/chapter/1-xii "Read-only link"]&lt;/ref&gt;

MRL technical accomplishments are significant and have been detailed in a number of studies.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; J.G. Ling and M.A. Head, "Federal Funding in Materials Research," (summary of the findings of the MITRE report). Science 209, 1203 (1980); Technical Report 7764 (MITRE Corp., Bedford, Mass., Sept. 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Another important impact has been the cultural change at U.S. universities in how research could be conducted across traditional departmental boundaries.  This trend was initiated by the IDLs but greatly strengthened by the MRL program because of the new NSF guidelines concerning requirements for interdisciplinarity.  A new generation of students would be trained in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary environment and the experiences of the IDL/MRL programs in the fields of materials and condensed matter sciences would be the proving ground for other center type endeavors in a wide range of fields.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===  Impact of IDLs/MRLs on other NSF Centers ===

The mid-1980s saw a convergence of a number of favorable trends for the establishments of NSF center based activities in a wide range of different fields. There was a strong interest in government investments in basic science that could be leveraged by matching funds from industry and other sources. In addition, the role of multidisciplinary teams in conducting research and educating students was widely appreciated.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first new centers-based initiative at NSF was the creation of the [[Engineering Research Centers]] (ERCs) in 1985.  Although the role of the previous 25-year history of funding the materials laboratories in preparing universities to accept a wider role in conducting interdisciplinary research was instrumental for the creation of new types of centers, this historical connection was not widely appreciated. Both NSF and the Office of Science Technology Policy, viewed the creation of ERCs as the major new initiative in 1985 for leveraging NSF funds. The following description of the announcement of the ERC program in 1985 is illuminating:&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sciencegovreport1985&gt;Science and Government Report 15 (18), 4 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

"George A. Keyworth II, President's Reagan Science Advisor and Director of the [[Office of Science Technology Policy]], refers to the creation of the ERCs by the National Science Foundation as:
'the single most important thing that we've done as an Administration in increasing efficiency and effectiveness of federal R&amp;D dollars.'&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sciencegovreport1985&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He said the centers address a widely recognized need in various fields of science and technology: 
'Continued pushing of the frontiers in those fields was constrained by the difficulty of assembling multidisciplinary teams to work on the problems. Our universities are, justifiably and understandably, structured to pursue disciplinary research.  On the other hand, we increasingly find ourselves as a nation confronting the solving of problems that have technically based solutions. We need to expose our young people to a problem-solving environment....These Centers - I'd rather call them Science and Technology Centers - are multidisciplinary mechanism by which chemists, physicists, neurobiologists, engineers, etc, can get together and solve exciting, intellectually demanding, real-world problems.' "&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sciencegovreport1985&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It was pointed out by [[William O. Baker]] that the above comments about the economic potential of the ERCs are nearly the same as those describing the original IDLs in the early 1960s.  Baker concludes that "it is refreshing indeed to find such current agreement on the concept that has involved so significant a portion of our best academic talent."&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first six ERC awards were made in 1985. These awards are generally for five years with one other 5 year renewal possible for a total funding length of 10 years.&lt;ref name=ERCs&gt;Engineering Research Centers [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5502 "National Science Foundation website"]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year NSF made five-year awards for five supercomputing centers and made plans for the development of a program for Science and Technology Centers (STCs) that would ultimately touch all areas of NSF programs. The first 11 STCs were established in 1988.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The 13 centers that are part of the 2013 class of STCs  cover a wide range of subjects ranging from studies of brain and intelligence to modeling of atmospheric processes to the study of quantum materials.&lt;ref name=STCs&gt;Science and Technology Centers [https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/active_centers/ACTIVE.jsp "National Science Foundation website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of concerns about the impact on center funding on individual investigator awards the [[National Science Board]] required that center awards cannot be renewed without  open recompetition.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the establishment of ERCs and STCs a large number of other centers have been established across all major NSF disciplines and now represent an essential element of the NSF funding portfolio.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of MRSECs (1994 - 1996) ===

As can be seen from Table 1 the majority of MRLs were started between 1972 and 1984 with only a few later additions.  The MRL competition of 1992 led to the start of only one new center: the MRL at the University of California Santa Barbara. The lack of new awards, coupled with the National Science Board re-competition requirement, provided one impetus for the development of the NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSEC) program. Previously, MRLs, once funded, could be continually supported without a need to compete against other center candidates. The MRSEC program limits awards to a fixed time period, currently six years.  Additional support is possible, but only on the basis of a new proposal that competes nationally against all other applicants.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition from the MRL to the MRSEC programs occurred through two competitions held in 1993/4 and 1995/96, respectively.  The competitions were open to all US academic institutions, including those with then current MRL awards. Institutions with awards made under the Materials Research Group (MRG) program, which was initiated at NSF in 1984, were eligible to participate in the competition. All MRL and MRG awards were discontinued after 1996. In all, 10 MRLs and 17 MRGs participated in the competitions of 1994-96. As seen in Table 2, nine of the MRLs were successful in transitioning to MRSECs, and six MRSEC awards went to institutions with prior MRG awards.  Importantly, new MRSEC awards were made to six institutions that never had any substantial NSF center or large group support in materials research.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

TABLE 2 Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers established after open competitions in 1994 and 1996. Those institutions with existing Materials Research Laboratories (MRLs) or Materials Research Groups (MRGs) in 1994 or 1996 are indicated, while "new" refers to institutions that did not have a current MRL or MRG award.  The MRL and MRG programs were discontinued after 1996.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent MRSEC competitions were held every two years (with a four-year award cycle) and, every three years starting in 2002 (with a six-year award cycle). The required open competition for any center that wishes to be supported for more than the initial six-year award period is consistent with the re-competition requirements set by the National Science Board.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Academy Study of MRSEC program (2007) ==

An assessment of the MRSEC program was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2007.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Executive Summary summarizes the impact of the program:

"MRSEC awards continue to be in great demand. The intense competition for them within the community indicates a strong perceived value."&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The report lists a number of key areas where the MRSEC program has an impact, including providing the resources and environment that fosters:&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* interdisciplinary, collaborative research;
* interdisciplinary training for the future scientific and technical workforce; 
* rapid response to new ideas, including support for higher-risk projects, than is possible with single-investigator  grants;	
* increased  institutional, local, and/or state support for materials research; 
* attraction of  high quality students and junior faculty;
* development of infrastructure helpful for organizing and managing experimental and computational facilities and educational and industrial outreach.

Among the report's recommendations are an increase in the grant size of the centers, which would allow adequate resources for education and outreach, while ensuring that the support for research activities is not compromised.  Recent MRSEC competitions&lt;ref name=nsfpress2010&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsfpress2015&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; have responded to the recommendations by increasing award sizes, notably by requiring that each new award will support a minimum of two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). In addition, the NAS study recommends strengthening the cooperative aspects of MRSECs and continue the progress made in the past toward building a national cooperating network of centers.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The report concludes that such a network, once fully established, would  "strengthen materials science and engineering in the United States as a discipline and as a factor in U.S. competitiveness."&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical statistics''' deals with applications of [[statistics]] to [[medicine]] and the [[health science]]s, including [[epidemiology]], [[public health]], [[forensic medicine]], and [[clinical research]]. Medical statistics has been a recognized branch of statistics in the United Kingdom for more than 40 years but the term has not come into general use in North America, where the wider term '[[biostatistics]]' is more commonly used.&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003)  ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{isbn|0-19-850994-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "biostatistics" more commonly connotes all applications of statistics to [[biology]].&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt; Medical statistics is a subdiscipline of statistics. "It is the science of summarizing, collecting, presenting and interpreting data in medical practice, and using them to estimate the magnitude of associations and test hypotheses. It has a central role in medical investigations. It not only provides a way of organizing information on a wider and more formal basis than relying on the exchange of anecdotes and personal experience, but also takes into account the intrinsic variation inherent in most biological processes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirkwood|first=Betty R.|title=essential medical statistics|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell|location=Blackwell Science, Inc., 350 Main Street, Malden, Massachusetts 02148–5020, USA|isbn=978-0-86542-871-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmaceutical statistics==
'''Pharmaceutical statistics''' is the application of statistics to matters concerning the [[pharmaceutical industry]].  This can be from issues of [[design of experiments]], to analysis of drug trials, to issues of commercialization of a medicine.

There are many professional bodies concerned with this field including:
* European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (EFSPI)
* [[Statisticians In The Pharmaceutical Industry]] (PSI)

There are also journals including:
* ''[[Statistics in Medicine (journal)|Statistics in Medicine]]''
* ''[[Pharmaceutical Statistics]]''

==Basic concepts==
;For describing situations
* [[Incidence (epidemiology)]] vs. [[Prevalence]] vs. [[Cumulative incidence]]
*all types of medical test results can be true positive or [[false positive]] and true negative or [[false negative]]...these categories are hugely dependent on the prevalence of the disease being tested for; and, for example, a false positive test result is more likely when the prevalence of the disease being tested for is very low (such as a lab test for cold-weather influenza being done  in June in South Carolina, USA. and giving a "positive" result).
* [[Transmission risks and rates|Transmission rate]] vs. [[force of infection]]
* [[Mortality rate]] vs. [[standardized mortality ratio]] vs. [[age-standardized mortality rate]]
* [[Pandemic]] vs. [[epidemic]] vs. [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] vs. [[syndemic]]
* [[Serial interval]] vs. [[incubation period]]
* [[Cancer cluster]]
* [[Sexual network]]
* [[Years of potential life lost]]
* [[Maternal mortality rate]]
* [[Perinatal mortality rate]]
* [[Birth weight|Low birth weight ratio]]

;For assessing the effectiveness of an intervention:
* [[Absolute risk reduction]]
* [[Control event rate]]
* [[Experimental event rate]]
* [[Number needed to harm]]
* [[Number needed to treat]]
* [[Odds ratio]]
* [[Relative risk reduction]]
* [[Relative risk]]
* [[Relative survival]]
* [[Minimal clinically important difference]]

==Related statistical theory==
* [[Survival analysis]]
* [[Proportional hazards models]]
* Active control trials: clinical trials in which a kind of new treatment is compared with some other active agent rather than a placebo.
* ADLS(Activities of daily living scale): a scale designed to measure physical ability/disability that is used in investigations of a variety of chronic disabling conditions, such as arthritis. This scale is based on scoring responses to questions about self-care, grooming, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S|first=KATZ|author2=FORD A B |author3=MOSKOWITZ R W |author4=JACKSON B A |author5= JAFFE M W |title=STUDIES OF ILLNESS IN THE AGED.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22277">'''Modular art''' is art created by joining together standardized units ([[Modular design|module]]s) to form larger, more complex compositions. In some works the units can be subsequently moved, removed and added to – that is, ''modulated'' – to create a new work of art, different from the original or ensuing configurations.

== Origins ==
Historically, alterable objects of art have existed since the [[Renaissance]], for example, in the [[Triptych]] "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]" by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or in the so-called "alterable [[altarpiece]]s", such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] by [[Matthias Grünewald]], or [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Dürer's]] [[Paumgartner altarpiece]], where changing motifs could be revised in accord with the changing themes of the ecclesiastical calendar.

== 20th century ==
Beginning in the first half of the 20th century, a number of contemporary artists sought to incorporate [[kinetic art|kinetic techniques]] into their work in an attempt to overcome what they saw as the predominantly static nature of art. [[Alexander Calder|Alexander Calder's]] mobiles are among the most widely known demonstrations of physical dynamism in the visual arts, in which form has the potential to continually vary through perpetual motion, sometimes even without the agency of the human hand. [[Jean Tinguely|Jean Tinguely's]] efforts to create a self-destructive art machine constitute perhaps the ultimate expression of art's mutability, in this case by taking the form of its total eradication. [[Victor Vasarely]] postulated in his ''Manifest Jaune'' in 1955 in Paris that works of art should feature the properties of being multiplicable and repeatable in series. More recently, the notion that visual art need not be conceived solely in terms of perpetually fixed objects is embodied in performance and installation art by virtue of their unfolding and temporary qualities.&lt;ref&gt;See "Modularity in the arts" in [[Modularity]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industrial design and architecture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Image:Pfarrkirche Liesing - Erwin Hauer Design 3.JPG|thumb|alt=An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.|An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.]][[Modularity]] enters the modern artistic repertory largely through the disciplines of industrial design and architecture. Belgian architect [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] led a team of countrymen in creating one of the first modular product systems in their Cubex kitchen series of 1932. The series consisted of standardized and industrially produced components that could be combined and arrayed in limitless combinations to accommodate almost any size kitchen. New York designer [[Gilbert Rohde]] crafted several lines of modular casework for the [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller Corporation]] in the 1930s and 40s; like De Koninck, Rohde standardized the units in dimensions, materials and configurations to facilitate mass production and interchangeability. His Executive Office Group (EOG) line, launched in 1942, was a similarly ground-breaking systems approach to office furniture. Just a year before [[Eero Saarinen]] and [[Charles Eames]] had jointly produced a suite of modular domestic furniture for the Red Lion Company, a result of a competition held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1950 Herman Miller brought out the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100526040623/http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Eames-Desk-and-Storage-Units EAS Storage Unit series] by Charles and Ray Eames, a very successful modular shelving and wall unit system that remains in production today.

The module enjoys a long history in the realm of architecture. In antiquity architects utilized the module primarily as a unit of measurement guiding the proportions of plan and elevation. The Roman author and architect Vitruvius deployed the modular method in his descriptions of the classical orders and the composition of buildings in his treatise ''Ten Books on Architecture'', the only complete text on architecture to survive from antiquity. Architects of the Renaissance perpetuated the Vitruvian system in their resurrection of the classical orders, a tradition which continues to the present day. Among modern architects, the module is frequently employed as a design and planning tool.

=== Modular constructivism ===
{{main|Modular Constructivism}}
Architecture and modular sculpture intersected starting in the 1950s in the work of [[Norman Carlberg]], [[Erwin Hauer]] and Malcolm Leland. All three received commissions to design perforated architectural screens built out of repetitive modular motives cast in concrete. Non-structural, the screens were used on building exteriors to divide space, filter light and create visual interest. Their work has come to be described as [[Modular Constructivism]], reflecting both its compositional methodology and its architectural context. Each created stand-alone modular-themed sculptures into the 1960s and after as well.

=== Modularity in the fine arts===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ondahalfoster/2546134482/ "White Painting"] of 1951; consisting of just four equal white squares, with its geometry of interlocking forms, is among the earliest statements of modularity as an autonomous subject of art. Rauschenberg explored this theme that same year in a three- and seven-panel format; the linear array of rectangular panels in these versions suggests their potentially infinite replication.  The cool abstraction of these canvases presages the emergence of modularity as a full-fledged topic of [[Minimalist art]] in the 1960s. [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]] and [[Donald Judd]] are among this school's most prolific exponents during the period. In particular, the work of Smith is key to understanding the transformation of modularity from a compositional and production tool into a broadly investigated artistic theme in its own right.

[[Image:Minneapolis14.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, Minnesota.|Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, MN.]]Smith began his career as an architectural designer. To further his education he apprenticed himself on some projects by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] for a couple of years starting in 1938. From Wright he learned to utilize modular systems in generating architectural designs in two-dimensional plans as well as in three-dimensional applications, such as the development of building sections and interior built-ins. As an architect, Wright himself was part of a centuries-old continuum stretching back through [[Vitruvius]] to Greco-Roman antiquity in which the module was utilized to proportion built and sculpted form. In the case of Wright, the interest in modular design also may have derived from his familiarity with [[tatami|modular practice in traditional Japanese architecture]].

Wright's Hanna House of 1937 is a clear example of the master's facility with modern modular design in multiple dimensions. Its striking angled forms are built up from the individual hexagonal modules that define the floor plan and various vertical elements. Wright's use of the hexagon here is by no means an arbitrary aesthetic choice, but an example of how he rooted his architecture in nature by drawing from its forms and principles – the interlocking hexagonal cells of the bee's honeycomb being nature's most perfect representation of modular design. Not surprisingly, this project is sometimes  referred to as the "Honeycomb House".

Smith would employ the hexagon and other elemental geometries in his own architectural practice and again in the sculpture he began to fabricate in the early 1960s. Freed from the programmatic and extensive structural requirements of his architectural work, Smith's sculptures are three-dimensional extrusions of modular form with no ostensible pragmatic purpose beyond aesthetic contemplation.

Significantly, Smith himself did not manually fabricate the final version of his sculptures. Instead, he outsourced their production to skilled ironworkers in foundries and industrial facilities, who worked off his drawings and models to manufacture the designs. In part this reflects Smith's training as an architect, who customarily designs and documents but does not construct his art. It further reinforces the idea of modular art as a [[generative art|generative system]] in which the arrangement of pre-determined formal units – rather than wholesale imaginative invention – defines the creative act. Finally, it is consistent with the notion implicit in modularity that the supply of modules in a modular system must be infinite, that is, that they be industrially rather than artisanally produced, for the system to be realized. (Bees in a honeycomb are essentially operating as an industrial enterprise insofar as the production of cells is without end.)

The work of Smith and the minimalist school constitute the most far-ranging exploration of modularity in art before the millennium. However, neither it nor the explorations of movable and alterable art in the preceding centuries synthesized the two central features of modular art. Mobiles and other kinetic pieces were not modular, and the modular work of the mid-century Minimalist artists was, with a few exceptions, not changeable.

=== Co-creativity ===
A school of thought coming out of the United States emphasizes modular art's alignment with the [[post-industrial]] character of 21st century culture and its contrast with traditional notions of art.&lt;ref&gt;[Rattner, Donald]. "A Comparison of Conventional and Modular Art" in ''[http://issuu.com/art-rethought/docs/art_catalogue?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed A.R.T. Catalogue v2.0]''. New York: lulu.com, 2010. Pp. C-1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Core characteristics of post-industrialism, as largely defined by the theorist [[Daniel Bell]] in his 1973 book ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', include the emergence of a service economy in place of a manufacturing one; the social and economic pre-eminence of the creative, professional and technical classes; the central place of theoretical knowledge as a font of innovation; the strong influence of technology on daily life; and high levels of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society''. New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular art appears to synchronize perfectly with several of these criteria. For example, its manual changeability opens up the possibility of co-creative art, in which the collector or user collaborates with the originating modular artist to jointly determine the appearance of the work of art. This presupposes the existence of creative people capable of and interested in serving such a role – a demographic evolution that was already underway in Bell's time and that has since been studied in works like Richard Florida's ''Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Florida, Richard. ''The Rise of the Creative Class and How It's Transforming Work, Leisure and Everyday Life''. Basic Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Co-creation]] is closely associated with [[mass customization]], a production model that combines the opportunity for individual personalization with mass production. Modular art and mass customization share a commonality in their synthesis of two opposing qualities. On the one hand, as previously stated the very concept of modularity implies a limitless supply of identical modules such as only industrial production can provide; on the other hand, the ability of the individual to re-arrange these modules in the work of art based on aesthetic criteria re-injects a subjective and purely human dimension into the creative act.

Mass customization is itself only made possible with the advent of computers and a type of software known as a [[configurator]]. A configurator is a software tool used by the buyer to configure a product from the options made available by the vendor. Applied to the purpose of composing a work of modular art onscreen, it can greatly facilitate the design of a modular assembly by allowing the user to study multiple design options more quickly and in far greater depth than by using analog methods. Once the design is established a computer file is then sent over the air to a manufacturing facility where robotically controlled equipment produces the object according to its specifications. Not only does this computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) allow for the customization of mass-produced objects, it also enables a much higher level of precision and fit – qualities critical for modules to be physically joined together. Bell's identification of technology as a central axis of post-industrial life is underscored in the intertwining of the digital with the physical realization of modular art.

=== The de- and re-constructive approach in Europe ===
In Europe, where the 1960s Minimalist school of modular art was often seen as a principally American phenomenon, the discussion of modularity often focuses on its changeability. For example, the mutability of art is a core principle of [[Arte Povera]], a contemporaneous movement that emerged in Italy which holds that works of art "should not be seen as fixed entities", but as objects of change and movement to "include time and space in a new manner. At stake is the issue of transferring the phenomenology of human experience" into the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monopol-magazin.com/magazine/2009/09/interview-carolyn-christov-bakargiev Interview with Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev.] See also: Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. ''Arte Povera (Themes &amp; Movements)''. New York: Phaidon Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the artist [[Leda Luss Luyken]] has produced modular paintings, composed of movable painted panels set in steel frames. Luss Luyken has dubbed her work "ModulArt".&lt;ref&gt;The term "ModulArt" was first mentioned in 1975 in a German arts encyclopedia as "a form of art […] made by movable elements that […] transfer the object into a new state of being by moving their variable parts" in: Ludewig, Werner (Ed.). ''Kunst – Literatur – Musik, Daten und Fakten''. Lexikon-Institut Bertelsmann, 1975, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, changing the configuration of a modular painting constitutes a form of motion, offering the spectator alternative views and alternative interpretations, and thus aligning the work more closely than a static object to the dynamism of physical human experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/ModulArt&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian and theorist [[Denys Zacharopoulos]] called this "a new way of motion in painting".&lt;ref&gt;von Kap-herr, Georg (Ed.). ''ModulArt''. Bobingen (Germany), 2008, pp. 6-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of modular art allows the user to de-compose and to re-compose a work of art that is already completed by re-arranging its parts, thus providing numerous possibilities for ever newer pictures not yet imagined. The original painting can be re-contextualized ad libitum and ad infinitum.

== Modular artists and their work ==

===Visual artists===
Working in the 1950-60s in Manchester (UK), American artist [[Mitzi Cunliffe]] developed sculptures consisting of multiple blocks about twelve inches square which she put together in a variety of combinations to give a sculptured effect on a large scale. She referred to them as ''modular sculptures''. The University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) acquired some of these works, although there are no references to them in published accounts of her work.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 19 December 08 by Prof. E.G. Wedell, Manchester (UK), friend and landlord of Mitzi Cunliffe in Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptor and ceramicist Malcolm Leland designed in 1954 a similar [http://www.mocad.org/store/Vessel_LS_Fountain.html modular sculpture system] based on a single 23-inch tall module that could be stacked vertically by means of a centering pin; the module has a generally biomorphic, curvilinear outline that yields an undulating silhouette when multiple modules are placed on top of each other. The technique of stacking repetitive elements in the round recalls [[Endless Column|Brancusi's "Endless Column"]] of 1938.

Starting in the 1970s, Leland's contemporary Norman Carlberg produced groups of [http://www.francisfrost.com/carlbergprint.html square framed prints] which he placed together on a wall in a tight grid, each print conceived as an independent module. The viewer is then invited to rotate or reposition them to generate new composite images. The abstract quality of the prints enhanced the creative possibilities of their re-orientation insofar as they are non-directional and geometrically inter-related.

Greek-born [[conceptual artist]] [[Leda Luss Luyken]], who was initially trained as an architect, has been exploring [[modularity]] in the medium of painting since the 1990s. In her work standardized canvas panels are mounted as modules onto a steel frame within which they can be moved and rotated.

In the U.S. Moshé Elimelech creates what he has called [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107101439/http://www.mosheart.com/cubes/index.html "Cubic Constructions"]. These are multiple groupings of approximately three-inch cubes set inside pockets in a framed shadow box. On each cube he applies paint in fields of bright color and abstract pattern with precise, controlled brush strokes. Like Carlsberg, Elimelech then invites the viewer to reposition any or all of the cubes to display one of their six sides, each of which is painted in a different pattern. Exhibiting since the 1980s, Elimelech shows primarily in California galleries, and has work represented in several museum design stores as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807164738/http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |archive-date=2003-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another portfolio of interactive modular art comes out of [http://www.s4aa.com Studio for A.R.T. and Architecture], a New York-based firm headed by Donald Rattner. Rattner has designed modular art in the media of wall sculpture, rotational paintings, tapestries, artist's wallpapers and artist's books. To bring his work and those of other "modulartists" to the marketplace, Rattner founded [http://www.art-rethought.com A.R.T. (art-rethought)], an art storefront focused on co-creative and modular work. In his writings Rattner has emphasized the post-industrial aspect of the most recent trends in modular art, coining the term "New Industrialism" to denote mass customization, production on demand, open innovation, co-creative design, tele-fabrication, robotics and other computer-driven technologies that are re-defining how things are made in the global marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/the_studio_portfolio/docs/studio_portfolio_-_art?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true. Pp. A-3f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composers===
Modularity in music can be seen as bringing two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting:{{Clarify|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--Painting? What has this to do with music?--&gt; [[Variation (music)|variation]] of a theme and [[Moving image|movement]] of and within a picture. For this very reason the contemporary composer Minas Borboudakis has dedicated the third part of his trilogy ROAI III for piano and electronics to the modular methodology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Italian composer and arts theoretician [[Stefano Vagnini]] has developed a theory of [[Open source|open-source composition]] based on modular aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Vagnini, Stafano, ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, 161 pp, Rome: Falcon Valley Music, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a musical work of art being something closed, limited and immobile disappears in favor of a process of numerous aggregations that allow a composition to become infinite in principle. Several such compositions were performed in Europe, South America, Asia and in North America and discussed through conferences in Europe. The approach is being academically discussed at the [[University of West Georgia]] and the Carrollton Cultural Arts Centre in the USA. Writer, painter, and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modularity of Vagnini's compositions  as “circular like the existence, his works are not finished, but merely stimulus for new voices”. &lt;ref&gt;Gian Ruggero Manzoni, in: Vagnini, Stefano:'' SalmodieSubliminali'', Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007, pp 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multiple realizability''', in the [[philosophy of mind]], is the thesis that the same mental property, state, or event can be implemented by different physical properties, states, or events. The idea has its roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s when a number of philosophers, most prominently [[Hilary Putnam]] (1967, 1988) and [[Jerry Fodor]] (1975), put it forth as an argument against [[reductionism|reductionist]] accounts of the relation between mental and physical kinds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/ "Multiple Realizability" entry at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy by John Bickle]&lt;/ref&gt; In short, a theory of mind that includes multiple realizability allows for the existence of [[Chinese room#Strong AI|strong AI]]. The original targets of these arguments were the [[type-identity theory]] and [[eliminative materialism]]. The same arguments from multiple realizability were also used to defend many versions of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], especially ''Machine state functionalism''.

In recent years, however, multiple realizability has been used to attack the very theory that it was originally designed to defend.  As a result, functionalism has fallen out of favor as a dominant theory in the philosophy of mind.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The dominant theory ("received view" in the words of [[Ernest Lepore|Lepore]] and [[Zenon Pylyshyn|Pylyshyn]]) in modern philosophy of mind is a version of generic [[Physicalism#Non-reductive physicalism|non-reductive physicalism]]{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and one of its central pillars is the hypothesis of multiple realizability.

Complicating our historical understanding, [[Ricardo Restrepo Echavarria|Restrepo]] noted in 2009 that the thesis of the multiple realizability of the mental was held by [[Alan Turing|Turing]] at least ten years before the usually attributed authors described the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Restrepo, R. (2009). ''Russell's Structuralism and the Supposed Death of Computational Cognitive Science.'' Minds and Machines 19(2): 181-197.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Turing expressed the multiple realizability of the mental in the following:

{{quote|The [Babbage Engine's] storage was to be purely mechanical, using wheels and cards.

The fact that Babbage's [[Analytical Engine]] was to be entirely mechanical will help us rid ourselves of a superstition. Importance is often attached to the fact that modern digital computers are electrical, and the nervous system is also electrical. Since Babbage's machine was not electrical, and since all digital computers are in a sense equivalent, we see that this use of electricity cannot be of theoretical importance. ... If we wish to find such similarities we should look rather for mathematical analogies of function.&lt;ref&gt;Turing, A. (1950). Computing machinery and intelligence. Mind 59. In J. Copeland (Ed.), The essential Turing (pp. 433–460). Oxford: Claredon Press, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Putnam's formulation==
[[Image:Reduktionismus.png|thumb|right|An illustration of multiple realizability. ''M'' stands for mental state and ''P'' stands for physical state. More than one ''P'' can instantiate one ''M'', but not vice versa. Causal relations between states are represented by the arrows (''M1'' causes ''M2'', etc.)]]
In several papers published in he late 1960s, [[Hilary Putnam]] provides a classic example of the thesis of multiple realizability. In these papers, he argues that, contrary to [[Type physicalism|type-identity theory]], it is not the case that "pain is identical to [[C-fibre]] firing." Pain corresponds to, or is at least correlated with, completely different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms and yet they all experience the same [[Mental representation|mental state]] of "being in pain." Putnam cited numerous examples from all over the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. Is it likely that the brain structures of all mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians and molluscs realize pain, or other mental states, in exactly the same way? Do they even have the same brain structures? Clearly not, if we believe the evidence furnished by comparative [[neuroanatomy]] and [[neurophysiology]]. How can they possibly share the same mental states and properties? The answer must be that these mental kinds are realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then takes his argument a step further, and asks about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially-intelligent robots and silicon-based life forms. Should such hypothetical entities be considered ''a priori'' incapable of experiencing pain just because they do not possess the same neurochemistry as humans? Putnam concludes that type-identity and other reductive theorists make an extremely "ambitious" and "highly implausible" conjecture which can be disproved with just one example of multiple realizability. This argument is referred to as ''the likelihood argument''.

Putnam also formulates a complementary argument based on, what he calls, ''functional isomorphism''. He defines the concept in these terms: "Two systems are functionally isomorphic if ''there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations''." So, in the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the  sequential relations among states in the first are exactly mirrored by the sequential relations among states in the second. Therefore, a computer made out of silicon chips and a computer made out of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability. This is referred to as the "a priori argument".

Jerry Fodor, Putnam and others also note that, along with being a very effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that ''any'' low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena would be insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which attempts to identify mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the physico-chemical level of microphysics and hence seems to be a more suitable alternative explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves that are multiply realized at the physical level.

==Fodor's generalization==
[[Jaegwon Kim]] takes up the challenge of responding to the problems posed by multiple realizability for reductionist theories by suggesting that the physical realization base of a particular mental state is not a particular physical state but the disjunction of the physical states which realize it. [[Jerry Fodor]] replies to this objection by formulating a generalization of the multiple realizability thesis. According to Fodor, multiple realizability is not just something that occurs "across physical structure-types" but is a phenomenon that could occur even within the same token system (such as an organism). At different times, the same organism may realize type-identical mental kinds in physically different forms. (This thesis was later given some empirical support with the discovery of the relative [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of the human brain).

Fodor uses this generalized multiple realizability thesis to argue against reductionism of the mind and of the special sciences. The key to Fodor's argument is that, in his characterization of reductionism, all mental kind predicates in an ideal and completed psychology must correspond with a physical kind predicate in an ideal and completed physics. He suggests taking [[Ernest Nagel]]'s theory of reduction, which insists on the derivability of all terms in the theory to be reduced from terms in the reducing theory and the bridging laws, as the canonical theory of reduction. Given generalized multiple realizability, the physical science part of these psychophysical bridge laws will end up being a (possibly infinite) disjunction of all the terms referring to possible physical realizations of a mental kind. This disjunction cannot be a kind-predicate and therefore the entire statement cannot be a [[Physical law|law of physics]]. The special sciences cannot be reduced to physics in this way, according to Fodor.

In 1988, Hilary Putnam applied the argument from Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability to argue against functionalism itself, including, and above all, his own version of functionalism, [[machine state functionalism]]. Noting that functionalism is essentially a watered-down reductionist or identity theory in which mental kinds are ultimately identified with functional kinds, Putnam argues that mental kinds are probably multiply realizable over functional kinds. The same mental state or property can be implemented or realized by different states of a [[universal Turing machine]].

==Objections and responses==
Early objections to multiple realizability were limited to the narrow, "across structures-type" version. Starting with [[David Kellogg Lewis]], many reductionists argued that it is very common, perhaps the rule, in actual scientific practice to reduce one theory to another by way of "local" and structure-specific reductions. A frequently cited example of this sort of [[intertheoretic reduction]] is the case of temperature from classical thermodynamics. Temperature is identical to mean molecular kinetic energy, but this is only true of ''temperature in a gas''. Temperature in a solid is identical to mean ''maximal'' molecular kinetic energy, because the molecules of a solid are more restricted in their movements. Temperature in a plasma is something of a mystery, since the molecules of a plasma are torn apart. Therefore, temperature, in classical thermodynamics is multiply realized in a wide diversity of microphysical states.

One common defense of multiple realizability argues that any such response which attempts to address the problem of the possibility of ''generalized'' multiple realizability must necessarily be so "local" and "context" specific in nature, referring exclusively to a certain token system of a certain structure-type at a certain time, that its reductions would be incompatible with even a minimally acceptable degree of generality in scientific theorizing. This problem is well illustrated by the controversial question of the plasticity of the human brain. Simply put, neural plasticity consists in the fact that different areas of the brain can, and often do, take over the functions of other parts that have been damaged as the result of traumatic injury, pathology, natural biological development and other processes. Any psychology which is narrowed down sufficiently to handle this level of multiple realizability will almost certainly not be general enough to capture the generalizations needed to explain only human psychology.

Recent reductionists (including [[William Bechtel|Bechtel]] and [[Jennifer Mundale|Mundale]]) reply that this is not empirically plausible. In order to conduct research and carry out experiments in the neurosciences, some universal consistencies in brain structures must either exist or be assumed to exist. The similarity (produced by [[homology (biology)|homology]] or convergent evolution) of brain structures allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability (especially the generalized form) were an empirical fact, then results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful or useful when generalized to explain the behavior or characteristics of another species (or organism of the same species; or in the generalized form, even the same organism).

[[Sungsu Kim]] has recently responded to this objection by pointing to the important distinction between homology of brain structures and [[homoplasy]]. Homologies are any characteristics of physiology, morphology, behavior or psychology that are shared by two or more species and that are inherited from a common ancestor. Homoplasies are similar or identical characteristics that are shared by two or more species but that are not inherited from a common ancestor, having evolved independently. The feet of ducks and platypuses are a good example of homoplasy, while the hands of humans and chimps are a good example of homology. The fact that brain structures are homologous provides no evidence either for or against multiple realizability. The only way to empirically test the thesis of multiple realizability would be to examine brain structures and determine whether some homoplasious "psychological processes or functions might be 'constructed' from different material" and supported by different brain structures just as the flight capacities of bats and birds emerge from different morphophysiologies. The emergence of similar behavioral outputs or psychological functions brought about by similar or identical brain structures in [[Convergent evolution|convergent]] evolutionary lineages would provide some evidence against multiple realizability, since it is highly improbable that this would happen, if not for constraints on the type of physical system that can realize mental phenomena. This, however, would not completely refute the possibility of realizibility of mental states in radically different physical systems such as non-carbon based life forms or machines.

==Kim's argument==
[[Jaegwon Kim]] has recently argued against non-reductive physicalism on the grounds that it violates the [[Causal closure|causal closure of the physical]]. The rough idea is that physics provides a full explanation of physical events. If mental properties are causally efficacious, they must either be identical to physical properties, or there must be widespread overdetermination. The latter is often held to be either unlikely or even impossible on conceptual grounds. If Kim is right, then the options seem to be either reduction or elimination.

==Medium independence==
In his mechanistic account of computation, [[Gualtiero Piccinini]] appeals to the notion of medium independence.  To understand this, we must first differentiate three related qualities:  variable realizability, multiple realizability, and medium independence.  A property is said to be variably realizable if it can be instantiated by different realizers.  For a property to be multiply realizable, the property must be able to be instantiated by different realizers and different mechanisms.  For example, consider a winged corkscrew and a waiter's corkscrew.  Both have the property of removing corks and do so through the same mechanism - a screw and pull mechanism.  Because the mechanism is fundamentally unchanged, the property is variably realizable.  Next, consider the property of trapping mice as instantiated by mousetraps.  Consider the classic spring mousetrap and the glue mousetrap.  Both instantiate the same property, the ability to trap mice, but they do so through different mechanisms.  As such, the property is multiply realizable.  Medium independence has an criteria over and above those of multiple realizablity.  A property is medium independent if it can be instantiated by different realizers and different mechanisms and if the inputs and outputs of the mechanisms are also multiply realizable.  As you can see, a mousetrap is not medium independent; it must take a mouse as an input.  A computer, though, is medium independent.  A computer can be constructed from different parts assembled into different mechanisms and, importantly, can take different types of inputs and outputs.  In typical digital computers, the inputs and outputs are voltages, but in quantum computers, the inputs and outputs would be different. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Piccinini | first = Gualtiero | title = Physical Computation: A Mechanistic Account | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2015 | page = 10 | isbn = 9780199658855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1545">A '''''mythomoteur''''' ([[compound word|compound]] of the [[French language|French]] words for myth and engine) is the constitutive [[myth]] that gives an [[ethnic group]] its sense of purpose. The term was first used in this context by Ramon d’Abadal i de Vinyals, and was later taken up by [[John Alexander Armstrong|John Armstrong]] in his book ''Nations before Nationalism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|title=The Ethnic Origins of Nations|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford|year=1986|pages=229, n. 29|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=740O4K52DCwC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;vq=mythomoteur&amp;dq=ethnic+origins+of+nations&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U3fEHB8LEI3HGw_ROpkPs2gvOeE_Q | isbn=978-0-631-16169-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently become a common theme in [[Anthony D.

The '''National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)''' is a [[Federally Funded Research and Development Center]] of the [[United States]] [[National Science Foundation]] operated under cooperative agreement by [[Associated Universities, Inc]] for the purpose of [[radio astronomy]].  NRAO designs, builds, and operates its own high sensitivity [[radio telescope]]s for use by scientists around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/about About the NRAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==

===Charlottesville, Virginia===
The NRAO headquarters is located on the campus of the [[University of Virginia]]. The North American [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] Science Center and the NRAO Technology Center are also located in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/directions/cville/ Charlottesville NRAO Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Bank, West Virginia===
[[File:300ft after hi.tif|thumb|left|The 300ft telescope after collapsing in 1988]]
[[File:GBT.png|thumb|left|The 100 meter [[Green Bank Telescope]].]]
NRAO was, until October 2016, the operator of the world's largest fully steerable [[radio telescope]], the Robert C. Byrd [[Green Bank Telescope]], which stands near [[Green Bank, West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aui.edu/news/nrao-structural-changes-announcing-the-separation-of-the-green-bank-observatory-and-the-long-baseline-observatory/&lt;/ref&gt; The observatory contains several other telescopes, among them the {{convert|140|ft|m|adj=on}} telescope that utilizes an [[equatorial mount]] uncommon for radio telescopes, three {{convert|85|ft|m|adj=on}} telescopes forming the [[Green Bank Interferometer]], a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} telescope used by school groups and organizations for small scale research, a fixed radio '[[horn (telescope)|horn]]' built to observe the radio source Cassiopeia A, as well as a reproduction of the original antenna built by [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]] while he worked for Bell Labs to detect the [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]] that was discovered to be previously unknown natural [[radio waves]] emitted by the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gb.nrao.edu/othertelescopes.shtml Other Telescopes at NRAO Green Bank, West Virginia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Bank is in the [[United States National Radio Quiet Zone]], which is coordinated by NRAO for protection of the Green Bank site as well as the [[Sugar Grove, West Virginia]] monitoring site operated by the [[National Security Agency|NSA]].  The zone consists of a {{convert|13000|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} piece of land where fixed transmitters must coordinate their emissions before a license is granted.  The land was set aside by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in 1958.  No fixed radio transmitters are allowed within the area closest to the telescope.  All other fixed radio transmitters including TV and radio towers inside the zone are required to transmit such that interference at the antennas is minimized by methods including limited power and using highly directional antennas.  With the advent of [[wireless]] technology and microprocessors in everything from cameras to cars, it is difficult to keep the sites free of radio interference.  To aid in limiting outside interference, the area surrounding the Green Bank observatory was at one time planted with pines characterized by needles of a certain length to block electromagnetic interference at the wavelengths used by the observatory.  At one point, the observatory faced the problem of [[New World flying squirrel|North American flying squirrels]] tagged with [[US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]] telemetry transmitters.  Electric fences, electric blankets, faulty automobile electronics, and other radio wave emitters have caused great trouble for the astronomers in Green Bank.  All vehicles on the premises are powered by diesel motors to minimize interference by ignition systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gb.nrao.edu/nrqz/nrqz.shtml The National Radio Quiet Zone]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gb.nrao.edu/visitors/TheEnemyIsUs.pdf NRAO Green Bank Site RFI Regulations for Visitors.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socorro, New Mexico===
[[File:USA.NM.VeryLargeArray.02.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Very Large Array]] (VLA), an interferometer consisting of 27 dishes.]]
The NRAO's facility in Socorro is the Pete V. Domenici [[Array Operations Center]] (AOC). Located on the [[New Mexico Tech]] university campus, the AOC serves as the headquarters for the [[Very Large Array]] (VLA), which was the setting for the [[1997 in film|1997]] movie ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', and is also the control center for the [[Very Long Baseline Array]] (VLBA). The ten VLBA telescopes are located in [[Hawaii]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], and eight other sites across the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/ Socorro, New Mexico NRAO Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tucson, Arizona===
Offices are located on the [[University of Arizona]] campus.  NRAO formerly operated the [[ARO 12m Radio Telescope|12 Meter Telescope]] on [[Kitt Peak]].  NRAO suspended operations at this telescope and funding was rerouted to the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuc.nrao.edu/ Tucson, Arizon NRAO Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Arizona Radio Observatory]] now operates the 12 Meter Telescope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ Arizona Radio Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santiago, Chile===
The [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) site in Chile is at ~5000 m (~16,500&amp;nbsp;ft) altitude near [[Cerro Chajnantor]] in northern Chile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almaobservatory.org/ ALMA]&lt;/ref&gt; This is about 40&amp;nbsp;km (about 25 miles) east of the historic village of [[San Pedro de Atacama]], 130&amp;nbsp;km (about 80 miles) southeast of the mining town of Calama, and about 275&amp;nbsp;km (about 170 miles) east-northeast of the coastal port of [[Antofagasta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/location ALMA Location]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wide image|Halfway There - 33 ALMA Antennas on Chajnantor.jpg|799px|On 12 May 2012, another Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) antenna was carried up to the 5000-metre plateau of Chajnantor, bringing the total on the plateau to 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Halfway There: 33 ALMA Antennas on Chajnantor|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann12035/|accessdate=15 May 2012|newspaper=ESO Announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''National Skills Academy for Power''' is a skills academy for the energy and power industry in the UK.

==History==
The National Skills Academy for Power was first announced in October 2008 by the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]]. Steve Davies was made the Chief Executive in September 2009. It was given formal government approval on 18 March 2010.

It was the 15th National Skills Academy. £2.9 million of funding for the project was allocated from the government.

It held its first Annual Conference and Awards Dinner on 9 March 2011 at [[Twickenham Stadium]]. This also included the People in Power Awards.

==Structure==
It is based near [[Monkspath]] on the [[A34 road|A34]], next to the Corus Hotel Solihull&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corushotels.com/Corus-hotel-Solihull/hotel Corus Hotel Solihull]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/85906 Monkspath business park] close to junction 4 of the [[M42 motorway|M42]].

[[Image:Benkid77 Puddington-Shotwick footpath 27 110809.JPG|thumb|right|Power line near [[Shotwick]] in Cheshire]]
It is a partnership between the Sector Skills Council, [[Energy and Utility Skills]], and several energy companies:
* [[Alstom]]
* [[Galliford Try|Morrison]] Utility Services &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morrisonus.com Morrison Utility Services]&lt;/ref&gt; (based in [[Stevenage]])
* [[E.ON UK]]
* [[Scottish Power]]
* [[CE Electric UK]]
* [[Carillion]] Utility Services
* [[National Grid plc]]
* [[EDF Energy]]
* [[ABB Group]]
* [[Balfour Beatty]] Utility Solutions
* [[Scottish and Southern Energy]] 
* [[Morgan Sindall Group]] 
* ITI Energy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iti-energy.com ITI Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

It also works in conjunction with the [[IET Power Academy]], which was set up in 2004, an industry group that was formed by seven universities (Bath, Cardiff, [[Imperial College London]], Manchester, [[Queen's University Belfast]], Southampton and Strathclyde) and eighteen power companies.

==Function==
It seeks to focus and coordinate UK-wide training in the power sector by standardising training materials. It also promotes the industry sector, specifically its career choices, in a way similar to a trade association. Similar work, on a much broader focus, is carried out by the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4891">{{See also|Chicago school (literary criticism)}}
'''Neo-Aristotelianism''' is a view of [[literature]] and [[rhetorical criticism]] propagated by the [[Chicago school (literary criticism)|Chicago School]]&lt;ref&gt;James P. Beasley, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ocq0I7PbxiAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Prehistory of Rhetoric and Composition: New Rhetoric and Neo-Aristotelianism at the University of Chicago, 1947--1959]'', ProQuest, 2007, pp.129&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; [[Ronald S. Crane]], [[Elder Olson]], [[Richard McKeon]], [[Wayne Booth]], and others &amp;mdash; which means.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A view of literature and criticism which takes a pluralistic attitude toward the history of literature and seeks to view literary works and critical theories intrinsically"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/glossary/Neo-Aristotelianism.html
Definition from The University of Toronto National Library&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neo-Artistotelianism was one of the first rhetorical methods of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Sonja K.|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central features were first suggested in [[Herbert Wichelns|Herbert A. Wichelns]]' "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" in 1925. It focused on analyzing the methodology behind a speech's ability to convey an idea to its audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Herbert A.|last=Wichelns|author-link=Herbert Wichelns|editor-last=Drummond|editor-first=Alexander M.|title=The Literary Criticism of Oratory|encyclopedia=Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James A. Winans|year=1925|publisher=Century|location=New York|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Neo-Aristotelianism was further publicized, gaining popularity after William Norwood Brigance published A History and Criticism of American Public Address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brigance|first=William Norwood|title=A History and Criticism of American Public Address|year=1943|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike rhetorical criticism, which concentrates on the study of speeches and the immediate effect of rhetoric on an audience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss.|first=Sonja K|title=. Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Aristotelianism "led to the study of a single speaker because the sheer number of topics to cover relating to the rhetor and the speech made dealing with more than a single speaker virtually impossible. Thus, various speeches by different rhetors related by form of topic were not included in the scope of rhetorical criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foss|first=Sonja K|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice|year=1996|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, IL|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The Literary Criticism of Oratory"==&lt;!-- The article Herbert Wichelns links here --&gt;
Wichelns' work was one of the first that introduced Neo-Aristotelianism. It narrowed down speech to 12 key topics to be studied, similar to many of the topics discussed by Aristotle in the Rhetoric. His topics for speech critique include:
* Speaker's personality 
* Character of the speaker (how the audience views a speaker) 
* [[Audience]] 
* Major ideas 
* Motives to which the speaker appealed 
* Nature of the speaker's proof (credibility) 
* Speaker's judgment of human nature in the audience 
* Arrangement 
* [[Stylistics (field of study)|Mode of expression]] 
* Speech preparation 
* Delivery 
* Effect of the [[discourse]] on the immediate audience and long-term effects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wichelns|first=Herbert A.|title="The Literary Criticisms of Oratory," in Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James A. Winans|year=1925|publisher=Century|location=New York|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Mark S. Klyn, author of Towards a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism, "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" provided "substance and structure to a study which heretofore had been formless and ephemeral [...] it literally created the modern discipline of rhetorical criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klyn|first=Mark S.|title="Toward a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism," in Essays on Rhetorical Criticism|year=1968|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus regardless of the lack of detail on these topics, it provided a modern structure of critiquing and analyzing speech via Neo-Aristotelianism, according to Donald C. Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Donald C.|title=The Rhetorical Idiom: Essays in Rhetoric, Oratory, Language, and Drama|year=1958|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithica|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opera''' ({{IPA-it|ˈɔːpera|lang}}; English plural: ''operas''; Italian plural: ''opere'' {{IPA-it|ˈɔːpere|}}) is a form of [[theatre]] in which [[music]] has a leading role and the parts are taken by [[Singing|singers]].&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions of opera: "dramatic performance or composition of which music is an essential part, branch of art concerned with this" (''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]''); "any dramatic work that can be sung (or at times declaimed or spoken) in a place for performance, set to original music for singers (usually in costume) and instrumentalists" (Amanda Holden, ''Viking Opera Guide''); "musical work for the stage with singing characters, originated in early years of 17th century" (''[[Pears Cyclopaedia]]'', 1983 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a "work" (the literal translation of "opera") is typically a collaboration between a [[composer]] and a [[libretto|librettist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wagner]] and [[Arrigo Boito]] are notable creators who combined both roles.&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporates a number of the [[performing arts]], such as [[acting]], [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[costume]], and sometimes [[dance]] or [[ballet]]. The performance is typically given in an [[opera house]], accompanied by an [[orchestra]] or smaller [[musical ensemble]], which since the early 19th century has been led by a [[conducting|conductor]].

Opera is a key part of the [[Western culture#Music|Western]] [[classical music]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Comparable art forms from various other parts of the world, many of them ancient in origin, are also sometimes called "opera" by analogy, usually prefaced with an adjective indicating the region (for example, [[Chinese opera]]). These independent traditions are not derivative of Western opera but are rather distinct forms of [[musical theatre]]. Opera is also not the only type of Western musical theatre: in the ancient world, [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]] featured singing and instrumental accompaniment; and in modern times, other forms such as the [[musical theatre|musical]] have appeared.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include [[:Category:Opera genres|numerous genres]], including some that include spoken dialogue such as [[musical theater]], ''[[Singspiel]]'' and ''[[Opéra comique]]''. In traditional [[number opera]], singers employ two styles of singing: [[recitative]], a speech-inflected style&lt;ref name="Apel, p. 718"&gt;[[#Apel1969|Apel]], p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt; and self-contained [[aria]]s. The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous [[Gesamtkunstwerk|music drama]].

[[Origins of opera|Opera originated]] in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly [[Lost work|lost]] ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: [[Heinrich Schütz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as [[George Frideric Handel]]. [[Opera seria]] was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] reacted against its artificiality with his "reform" operas in the 1760s. The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian [[comic opera]]s, especially ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' (''Le nozze di Figaro''), ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', as well as ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (''The Abduction from the Seraglio''), and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (''Die Zauberflöte''), landmarks in the German tradition.

The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the [[bel canto]] style, with [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini]] all creating works that are still performed. It also saw the advent of [[Grand Opera]] typified by the works of [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]. The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in Italy and [[Richard Wagner]] in Germany. The popularity of opera continued through the [[verismo]] era in Italy and contemporary [[French opera]] through to [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Richard Strauss]] in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in [[Russian opera|Russia]] and [[Bohemia]]. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as [[atonality]] and [[serialism]] ([[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]), [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]] ([[Igor Stravinsky]]), and [[Minimalism]] ([[Philip Glass]] and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]). With the rise of [[sound recording|recording technology]], singers such as [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Maria Callas]] became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these mediums. Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live [[high-definition video]] transmissions of their performances in [[Movie theatre|cinemas]] all over the world. Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are [[Live streaming|live streamed]].

==Operatic terminology==

The words of an opera are known as the [[libretto]] (literally "small book"). Some composers, notably Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. Mozart with [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]]. Traditional opera, often referred to as "[[number opera]]", consists of two modes of singing: [[recitative]], the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech,&lt;ref name="Apel, p. 718"/&gt; and [[aria]] (an "air" or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Vocal duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as [[singspiel]], [[opéra comique]], [[operetta]], and [[semi-opera]], the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as [[arioso]]. The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail [[#Operatic voices|below]].&lt;ref&gt;General information in this section comes from the relevant articles in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', by. P.Scholes (10th ed., 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; During both the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms, each of which was accompanied by a different instrumental ensemble: ''secco'' (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by ''[[basso continuo]]'', which was usually a [[harpsichord]] and a cello; or ''accompagnato'' (also known as ''strumentato'') in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. Over the 18th century, arias were increasingly accompanied by the orchestra. By the 19th century, ''accompagnato'' had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Wagner revolutionized opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what Wagner termed "endless melody". Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner's example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' have bucked the trend. The changing role of the orchestra in opera is described in more detail [[#Changing role of the orchestra|below]].

==History==

===Origins===
{{Main article|Origins of opera}}
[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claudio Monteverdi]]]]
The Italian word ''opera'' means "work", both in the sense of the labour done and the result produced. The Italian word derives from the Latin ''opera'', a singular noun meaning "work" and also the plural of the noun ''[[:wikt:opus|opus]]''. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the Italian word was first used in the sense "composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined" in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed., s.v. "[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/131729 opera]".&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dafne]]'' by [[Jacopo Peri]] was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanists]] who gathered as the "[[Florentine Camerata|Camerata de' Bardi]]". Significantly, ''Dafne'' was an attempt to revive the classical [[Tragedy|Greek drama]], part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the [[Renaissance]]. The members of the Camerata considered that the "chorus" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of "restoring" this situation. ''Dafne,'' however, is lost. A later work by Peri, ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'', dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', composed for the court of [[Mantua]] in 1607.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 1; articles on Peri and Monteverdi in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mantua court of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzagas]], employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the [[concerto delle donne]] (till 1598), but also one of the first actual "opera singers"; [[Madama Europa]].&lt;ref&gt;Karin Pendle Women and music 2001 p. 65 "From 1587–1600 a Jewish singer cited only as Madama Europa was in the pay of the Duke of Mantua,"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian opera===
{{Main article|Italian opera}}

====Baroque era====

[[File:Pannini, Giovanni Paolo - Musical Fête - 1747.png|thumb|[[Teatro Argentina]] ([[Giovanni Paolo Panini|Panini]], 1747, [[Musée du Louvre]])]]

Opera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a "season" ([[Carnival]]) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'', for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower [[Francesco Cavalli]] helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by the [[Arcadian academy|Arcadian Academy]], which came to be associated with the poet [[Metastasio]], whose [[Libretto|libretti]] helped crystallize the genre of [[opera seria]], which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called [[opera buffa]].
Before such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an "opera-within-an-opera." One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public [[opera house]]s. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the [[commedia dell'arte]], a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of "intermezzi", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.

''Opera seria'' was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of ''secco'' recitative interspersed with long ''da capo'' arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of ''opera seria'' the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the high-pitched male [[castrato]] voice, which was produced by [[castration]] of the singer before [[puberty]], which prevented a boy's [[larynx]] from being transformed at puberty. Castrati such as [[Farinelli]] and [[Senesino]], as well as female [[soprano]]s such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], became in great demand throughout Europe as ''opera seria'' ruled the stage in every country except France.  Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] found himself composing the likes of ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]'' and ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the [[classical period (music)|classical period]] as well, for example in the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who wrote in Vienna near the century's close. Leading Italian-born composers of [[opera seria]] include [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Nicola Porpora|Porpora]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Opera seria]] had its weaknesses and critics. The taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. [[Francesco Algarotti]]'s ''Essay on the Opera'' (1755) proved to be an inspiration for [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s reforms. He advocated that ''opera seria'' had to return to basics and that all the various elements—music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging—must be subservient to the overriding drama. In 1765 [[Melchior Grimm]] published "{{Lang|fr|Poème lyrique}}", an influential article for the [[Encyclopédie]] on [[lyric poetry|lyric]] and opera [[libretto]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/musdico/Grimm/167991 Larousse ''Dictionnaire de la musique'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music and the Origins of Language: Theories from the French Enlightenment|first= Downing A|last= Thomas|page= 148|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0zct2C3-jaAC&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die%20Grimm%20article&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die%20Grimm%20article&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0521473071|date= 1995-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JgrFMhZy3aAC&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;pg=PA248#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;f=false|title=Lully Studies|first=John Hajdu|last=Heyer|date=7 December 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0521621830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SqdTxG3jUNMC&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;f=false|title=A History of Western Musical Aesthetics|first=Edward A.|last=Lippman|date=26 November 1992|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0803279513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/music/research/proj/esf/pos/sem1.aspx|title=King's College London –  Seminar 1|website=www.kcl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several composers of the period, including [[Niccolò Jommelli]] and [[Tommaso Traetta]], attempted to put these ideals into practice. The first to succeed however, was Gluck. Gluck strove to achieve a "beautiful simplicity". This is evident in his first reform opera, ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', where his non-virtuosic vocal melodies are supported by simple harmonies and a richer orchestra presence throughout.

Gluck's reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart, and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck's successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comic operas with libretti by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], notably ''[[Le Nozze di Figaro]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas today. But Mozart's contribution to ''opera seria'' was more mixed; by his time it was dying away, and in spite of such fine works as ''[[Idomeneo]]'' and ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', he would not succeed in bringing the art form back to life again.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Music: the Classical Era'', ed. [[Neal Zaslaw]] (Macmillan, 1989); entries on Gluck and Mozart in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bel canto, Verdi and verismo====
[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi, by [[Giovanni Boldini]], 1886]]
The [[bel canto]] opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Giovanni Pacini|Pacini]], [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]] and many others. Literally "beautiful singing", ''bel canto'' opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control. Examples of famous operas in the bel canto style include Rossini's ''[[The Barber of Seville|Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' and ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', as well as Bellini's ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' and Donizetti's ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''.

Following the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularized by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], beginning with his biblical opera ''[[Nabucco]]''. This opera, and the ones that would follow in Verdi's career, revolutionized Italian opera, changing it from merely a display of vocal fireworks, with Rossini's and Donizetti's works, to dramatic story-telling. Verdi's operas resonated with the growing spirit of [[Italian nationalism]] in the post-[[Napoleon]]ic era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement for a unified Italy. In the early 1850s, Verdi produced his three most popular operas: ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]''. The first of these, ''Rigoletto'', proved the most daring and revolutionary. In it, Verdi blurs the distinction between the aria and recitative as it never before was, leading the opera to be "an unending string of duets". ''La traviata'' was also novel. It tells the story of courtesan, and is often cited as one of the first "realistic" operas,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} because rather than featuring great kings and figures from literature, it focuses on the tragedies of ordinary life and society. After these, he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French [[Grand Opera]], ''[[Don Carlos]]'', and ending his career with two [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare-inspired]] works, ''[[Otello]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century. These final two works showed Verdi at his most masterfully orchestrated, and are both incredibly influential, and modern. In ''Falstaff'', Verdi sets the preeminent standard for the form and style that would dominate opera throughout the twentieth century. Rather than long, suspended melodies, ''Falstaff'' contains many little motifs and mottos, that, rather than being expanded upon, are introduced and subsequently dropped, only to be brought up again later. These motifs never are expanded upon, and just as the audience expects a character to launch into a long melody, a new character speaks, introducing a new phrase. This fashion of opera directed opera from Verdi, onward, exercising tremendous influence on his successors [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Richard Strauss]], and [[Benjamin Britten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardstrauss.at/strauss-and-wagner.html|title=Strauss and Wagner – Various articles – Richard Strauss|website=www.richardstrauss.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Verdi, the sentimental "realistic" melodrama of [[verismo]] appeared in Italy. This was a style introduced by [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' that came to dominate the world's opera stages with such popular works as [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', and ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. Later Italian composers, such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono|Nono]], have experimented with [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 5, 8 and 9.

===German-language opera===
{{Main article|German opera}}
[[File:Karl Friedrich Schinkel Die Sternenhalle der Königin der Nacht Bühnenbild Zauberflöte Mozart.tif|thumb|upright=1.3|The Queen of the Night in an 1815 production of Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'']]
The first German opera was ''[[Dafne (Opitz-Schütz)|Dafne]]'', composed by [[Heinrich Schütz]] in 1627, but the music score has not survived. Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms would develop in spite of this influence. In 1644, [[Sigmund Theophil Staden|Sigmund Staden]] produced the first ''[[Singspiel]]'', ''[[Seelewig]]'', a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theater am Gänsemarkt in [[Hamburg]] presented German operas by [[Reinhard Keiser|Keiser]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Yet most of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as [[Carl Heinrich Graun|Graun]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse|Hasse]] and later [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian. In contrast to Italian opera, which was generally composed for the aristocratic class, German opera was generally composed for the masses and tended to feature simple folk-like melodies, and it was not until the arrival of Mozart that German opera was able to match its Italian counterpart in musical sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Music: the Classical Era'' ed. [[Neal Zaslaw]] (Macmillan, 1989), pp. 242–47, 258–60;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' pp. 58–63, 98–103. Articles on Hasse, Graun and Hiller in ''Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RichardWagner.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Richard Wagner]]
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''Singspiele'', ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (1782) and ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' (1791) were an important breakthrough in achieving international recognition for German opera. The tradition was developed in the 19th century by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] with his ''[[Fidelio]]'', inspired by the climate of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Carl Maria von Weber]] established [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian [[bel canto]]. His ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) shows his genius for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include [[Heinrich Marschner|Marschner]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Albert Lortzing|Lortzing]], but the most significant figure was undoubtedly [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].
[[File:Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods p 180.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Brünnhilde throws herself on Siegfried's funeral pyre in Wagner's ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'']]
Wagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (a "complete work of art"), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring [[Theme (music)|themes]] often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama, of which prototypes can be heard in his earlier operas such as ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|Der fliegende Holländer]]'', ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' and ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]''; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as [[tonality]], in his quest for greater expressivity. In his mature music dramas, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]'', he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of "endless melody". Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] or [[Arthurian]] legend. Finally, Wagner built [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|his own opera house]] at [[Bayreuth]] with part of the patronage from [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.

Opera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, [[Richard Strauss]] accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions, along with incorporating the new form introduced by Verdi. He first won fame with the scandalous ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and the dark tragedy ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', where Mozart and Viennese [[waltz]]es became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Erich Korngold]], [[Franz Schreker]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Kurt Weill]] and the Italian-born [[Ferruccio Busoni]]. The operatic innovations of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his successors are discussed in the section on [[#Modernism|modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–3, 6, 8 and 9, and ''The Oxford Companion to Music''; more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century, the Austrian composer [[Johann Strauss II]], an admirer of the [[French language|French]]-language [[operetta]]s composed by [[Jacques Offenbach]], composed several German-language operettas, the most famous of which was ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', which is still regularly performed today.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]]. [http://www.musicals101.com/operetta.htm A History of The Musical: European Operetta 1850–1880]. Musicals101.com&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, rather than copying the style of Offenbach, the operettas of Strauss II had distinctly [[Vienna|Viennese]] flavor to them, which have cemented the Strauss II's place as one of the most renowned operetta composers of all time.

In rivalry with imported Italian opera productions, a separate French tradition was founded by the Italian [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] at the court of [[King Louis XIV]]. Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an [[Académie Royale de Musique|Academy of Music]] and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with ''[[Cadmus et Hermione]]'', Lully and his librettist [[Philippe Quinault|Quinault]] created ''[[tragédie en musique]]'', a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully's operas also show a concern for expressive [[recitative]] which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully's most important successor was [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], who composed five ''[[tragédie en musique|tragédies en musique]]'' as well as numerous works in other genres such as [[opéra-ballet]], all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. Despite the popularity of Italian [[opera seria]] throughout much of Europe during the Baroque period, Italian opera never gained much of a foothold in France, where its own national operatic tradition was more popular instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l_b2vIXHsUkC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=Italian+opera+not+popular+in+france#v=onepage&amp;q=Italian%20opera%20not%20popular%20in%20france&amp;f=false |title=A Short History of Opera |isbn=978-0231119580 |accessdate=11 April 2014|last1=Grout |first1=Donald Jay |last2=Grout |first2=Donald |last3=Williams |first3=Hermine Weigel |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rameau's death, the German [[Gluck]] was persuaded to produce six operas for the [[Paris|Parisian stage]] in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: ''[[opéra comique]]''. This was the equivalent of the German [[singspiel]], where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny|Monsigny]], [[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor]] and, above all, [[André Grétry|Grétry]]. During the [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] period, composers such as [[Méhul]] and [[Cherubini]], who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly "comic" in any case. Another phenomenon of this period was the 'propaganda opera' celebrating revolutionary successes, e.g. [[François Joseph Gossec|Gossec's]] ''Le triomphe de la République'' (1793).
[[File:Salzburger Festspiele 2012 - Carmen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Magdalena Kožená]] and [[Jonas Kaufmann]] in a scene from ''[[Carmen]]'', [[Salzburg Festival]] 2012]]

By the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for Italian [[bel canto]], especially after the arrival of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] in Paris. Rossini's ''[[Guillaume Tell]]'' helped found the new genre of [[Grand Opera]], a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]. Meyerbeer's works, such as ''[[Les Huguenots]]'', emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter ''opéra comique'' also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of [[Boïeldieu]], [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Ferdinand Hérold|Hérold]] and [[Adolphe Adam|Adam]]. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer [[Hector Berlioz]] struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece ''[[Les Troyens]]'', the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.

In the second half of the 19th century, [[Jacques Offenbach]] created [[operetta]] with witty and cynical works such as ''[[Orphée aux enfers]]'', as well as the opera ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]''; [[Charles Gounod]] scored a massive success with ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''; and [[Georges Bizet]] composed ''[[Carmen]]'', which, once audiences learned to accept its blend of [[Romanticism]] and realism, became the most popular of all opéra comiques. [[Jules Massenet]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Léo Delibes]] all composed works which are still part of the standard repertory, examples being Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'', Saint-Saëns' ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson et Dalila]]'' and Delibes' ''[[Lakmé]]''.  Their operas formed another genre, the Opera Lyrique, combined opera comique and grand opera. It is less grandiose than grand opera, but without the spoken dialogue of opera comique.  At the same time, the influence of [[Richard Wagner]] was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Many French critics angrily rejected Wagner's music dramas while many French composers closely imitated them with variable success. Perhaps the most interesting response came from [[Claude Debussy]]. As in Wagner's works, the orchestra plays a leading role in Debussy's unique opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' (1902) and there are no real arias, only recitative. But the drama is understated, enigmatic and completely un-Wagnerian.

Other notable 20th-century names include [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]] and [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]]. [[Francis Poulenc]] is one of the very few post-war composers of any nationality whose operas (which include ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carmélites]]'') have gained a foothold in the international repertory. [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s lengthy sacred drama ''[[Saint François d'Assise]]'' (1983) has also attracted widespread attention.&lt;ref&gt;General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–4, 8 and 9; and ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' (10th ed., 1968); more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, opera's antecedent was the 17th-century ''jig''. This was an afterpiece which came at the end of a play. It was frequently [[libel]]lous and scandalous and consisted in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes. In this respect, jigs anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French [[masque]] was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with even more lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery than had been seen before. [[Inigo Jones]] became the quintessential designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. In [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Lovers Made Men'' (1617), "the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo".&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite&gt;[http://www.webrarian.co.uk/ivanhoe/ivan01.html From Webrarian.com's] ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' site.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of the [[English Commonwealth]] closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the [[dramatist]] Sir [[William Davenant]] produced ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]''. Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Lawes, Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by ''[[The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru]]'' (1658) and ''[[The History of Sir Francis Drake]]'' (1659). These pieces were encouraged by [[Oliver Cromwell]] because they were critical of Spain. With the [[English Restoration]], foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''[[Psyche (Locke)|Psyche]]'', patterned on the 1671 'comédie-ballet' of the same name produced by [[Molière]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. [[William Davenant]] produced ''The Tempest'' in the same year, which was the first musical adaption of a [[Shakespeare]] play (composed by Locke and Johnson).&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite /&gt; About 1683, [[John Blow]] composed ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'', often thought of as the first true English-language opera.

Blow's immediate successor was the better known [[Henry Purcell]]. Despite the success of his masterwork ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead, he usually worked within the constraints of the [[semi-opera]] format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as [[Shakespeare]] in Purcell's ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'' (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in ''The Prophetess'' (1690) and ''Bonduca'' (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator [[John Dryden]]) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.

[[File:Thomas Augustine Arne.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Arne]]]]
Following Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to [[Thomas Arne]], both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being ''[[Thomas and Sally]]'' in 1760. His opera ''[[Artaxerxes (opera)|Artaxerxes]]'' (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown [[opera seria]] in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, ''Love in a Village'' (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. [[Charles Burney]] wrote that Arne introduced "a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated".
[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Mikado]]'' (Lithograph)]]
Besides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was [[George Frideric Handel]], whose ''opera serias'' filled the London operatic stages for decades and influenced most home-grown composers, like [[John Frederick Lampe]], who wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including in the work of [[Michael William Balfe]], and the operas of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Mozart, Beethoven, and Meyerbeer, continued to dominate the musical stage in England.

The only exceptions were [[ballad opera]]s, such as [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728), musical [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], European [[operetta]]s, and late [[Victorian era]] [[light opera]]s, notably the [[Savoy Operas]] of [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], all of which types of musical entertainments frequently spoofed operatic conventions. Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876),&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite /&gt; but he claimed that even his light operas constituted part of a school of "English" opera, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually performed in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage from the mid-19th century into the 1870s. London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' agreed, describing ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' as "a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage".&lt;ref&gt;The ''Daily Telegraph''{{'}}s review of ''Yeomen'' stated, "The accompaniments... are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly. ...we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage." (quoted at p. 312 in Allen, Reginald (1975). ''The First Night Gilbert and Sullivan''. London: Chappell &amp; Co. Ltd.).&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan produced a few light operas in the 1890s that were of a more serious nature than those in the G&amp;S series, including ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' and ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', but ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts—a record until Broadway's ''[[La bohème]]'') survives as his only [[Grand Opera]].

In the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and in particular [[Benjamin Britten]], who in a series of works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. More recently [[Harrison Birtwistle|Sir Harrison Birtwistle]] has emerged as one of Britain's most significant contemporary composers from his first opera ''[[Punch and Judy (opera)|Punch and Judy]]'' to his most recent critical success in [[The Minotaur (opera)|The Minotaur]]. In the first decade of the 21st century, the librettist of an early Birtwistle opera, [[Michael Nyman]], has been focusing on composing operas, including ''[[Facing Goya]]'', ''[[Man and Boy: Dada]]'', and ''[[Love Counts]]''. Today composers such as [[Thomas Adès]] continue to export English opera abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1, 3 and 9. ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Blow, Purcell and Britten.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 20th century, American composers like [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], [[Douglas Moore]], and [[Carlisle Floyd]] began to contribute English-language operas infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by composers such as [[Philip Glass]], [[Mark Adamo]], [[John Corigliano]], [[Robert Moran]], [[John Coolidge Adams]], [[André Previn]] and [[Jake Heggie]].

===Russian opera===
{{Main article|Russian opera}}
[[File:Feodor Chaliapin as Ivan Susanin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Feodor Chaliapin]] as [[Ivan Susanin]] in [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'']]
Opera was brought to Russia in the 1730s by the [[Italian opera]]tic [[wikt:troupe|troupes]] and soon it became an important part of entertainment for the Russian Imperial Court and [[aristocracy]]. Many foreign composers such as [[Baldassare Galuppi]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Giuseppe Sarti]], and [[Domenico Cimarosa]] (as well as various others) were invited to Russia to compose new operas, mostly in the [[Italian language]]. Simultaneously some domestic musicians like [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Dmitry Bortniansky]] were sent abroad to learn to write operas. The first opera written in Russian was ''[[Tsefal i Prokris]]'' by the Italian composer [[Francesco Araja]] (1755). The development of Russian-language opera was supported by the Russian composers [[Vasily Pashkevich]], [[Yevstigney Fomin]] and [[Alexey Verstovsky]].

However, the real birth of [[Russian opera]] came with [[Mikhail Glinka]] and his two great operas ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' (1836) and ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842). After him, in the 19th century in Russia, there were written such operatic masterpieces as ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' and ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]'' by [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' and ''[[Khovanshchina]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]], ''[[Prince Igor]]'' by [[Alexander Borodin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], and ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'' and ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. These developments mirrored the growth of Russian [[nationalism]] across the artistic spectrum, as part of the more general [[Slavophilism]] movement.

In the 20th century, the [[tradition]]s of Russian opera were developed by many composers including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in his works ''[[The Miserly Knight]]'' and ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Rachmaninoff)|Francesca da Rimini]]'', [[Igor Stravinsky]] in ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|Le Rossignol]]'', ''[[Mavra]]'', ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'', and ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]] in ''[[The Gambler (Prokofiev)|The Gambler]]'', ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'', ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]'', ''[[Betrothal in a Monastery]]'', and ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]''; as well as [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', [[Edison Denisov]] in ''[[L'écume des jours (opera)|L'écume des jours]]'', and [[Alfred Schnittke]] in ''[[Life with an Idiot]]'' and ''[[Historia von D. Johann Fausten (opera)|Historia von D. Johann Fausten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard: Russia in 'The New Grove Dictionary of Opera', ed. Stanley Sadie (London, 1992); ''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other national operas===
[[File:Prodana Nevesta Cover 1919.JPG|thumb|Score of Smetana's ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'']]
Spain also produced its own distinctive form of opera, known as [[zarzuela]], which had two separate flowerings: one from the mid-17th century through the mid-18th century, and another beginning around 1850. During the late 18th century up until the mid-19th century, Italian opera was immensely popular in Spain, supplanting the native form.

Czech composers also developed a thriving national opera movement of their own in the 19th century, starting with [[Bedřich Smetana]], who wrote eight operas including the internationally popular ''[[The Bartered Bride]]''. [[Antonín Dvořák]], most famous for ''[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]'', wrote 13 operas; and [[Leoš Janáček]] gained international recognition in the 20th century for his innovative works including ''[[Jenůfa]]'', ''[[The Cunning Little Vixen]]'', and ''[[Káťa Kabanová]]''.

In Russian Eastern Europe, several national operas began to emerge. Ukrainian opera was developed by [[Semen Hulak-Artemovsky]] (1813–1873) whose most famous work ''[[Zaporozhets za Dunayem]]'' (A Cossack Beyond the Danube) is regularly performed around the world. Other Ukrainian opera composers include [[Mykola Lysenko]] (''[[Taras Bulba (opera)|Taras Bulba]]'' and ''[[Natalka Poltavka (opera)|Natalka Poltavka]]''), [[Heorhiy Maiboroda]], and [[Yuliy Meitus]]. At the turn of the century, a distinct national opera movement also began to emerge in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] under the leadership [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], who fused local [[folk song]]s and stories with 19th-century [[Romantic music|Romantic]] classical themes.

[[File:Erkel Ferenc Györgyi Alajos.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ferenc Erkel]], the father of Hungarian opera]]
The key figure of Hungarian national opera in the 19th century was [[Ferenc Erkel]], whose works mostly dealt with historical themes. Among his most often performed operas are ''[[Hunyadi László (opera)|Hunyadi László]]'' and ''[[Bánk bán]]''. The most famous modern Hungarian opera is [[Béla Bartók]]'s ''[[Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]''.

[[Stanisław Moniuszko]]'s opera ''[[The Haunted Manor|Straszny Dwór]]'' (in English ''The Haunted Manor'') (1861–64) represents a nineteenth-century peak of [[Polish opera|Polish national opera]].&lt;ref&gt;See the chapter on "Russian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian Opera to 1900" by John Tyrrell in ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, other operas created by Polish composers included ''[[King Roger]]'' by [[Karol Szymanowski]] and ''[[Ubu Rex]]'' by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]].

The first known opera from [[Turkey]] (the [[Ottoman Empire]]) was ''[[Arshak II (opera)|Arshak II]]'', which was an Armenian opera composed by an ethnic Armenian composer [[Tigran Tchoukhajian]] in 1868 and partially performed in 1873. It was fully staged in 1945 in Armenia.

The first years of the [[Soviet Union]] saw the emergence of new national operas, such as the ''[[Koroğlu (opera)|Koroğlu]]'' (1937) by the [[Azerbaijan]]i composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]]. The first [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]] opera, ''Ai-Churek'', premiered in Moscow at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] on 26 May 1939, during Kyrgyz Art Decade. It was composed by [[Vladimir Vlasov]], [[Abdylas Maldybaev]] and [[Vladimir Fere]]. The libretto was written by Joomart Bokonbaev, Jusup Turusbekov, and Kybanychbek Malikov. The opera is based on the Kyrgyz heroic epic ''[[Epic of Manas|Manas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Abazov, Rafis (2007).

[[Chinese contemporary classical opera]], a Chinese language form of Western style opera that is distinct from traditional Chinese opera, has had operas dating back to ''[[The White Haired Girl]]'' in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia =World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre|volume = Asia/ Pacific|page = 111 |editor1-last =Rubin|editor1-first = Don|editor2-last = Chua|editor2-first =Soo Pong|editor3-last = Chaturvedi|editor3-first = Ravi|editor4-last = Majumdar|editor4-first =Ramendu|editor5-last = Tanokura|editor5-first =Minoru|editor6-last = Brisbane|editor6-first = Katherine|date = 2001|quote= Western-style opera (also known as High Opera) exists alongside the many Beijing Opera groups.

In Latin America, opera started as a result of European colonisation. The first opera ever written in the Americas was ''[[La púrpura de la rosa]]'', by [[Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco]], although ''[[Partenope (Zumaya)|Partenope]]'', by the Mexican [[Manuel de Zumaya]], was the first opera written from a composer born in Latin America (music now lost). The first Brazilian opera for a libretto in Portuguese was ''A Noite de São João'', by [[Elias Álvares Lobo]]. However, [[Antonio Carlos Gomes]] is generally regarded as the most outstanding Brazilian composer, having a relative success in Italy with its Brazilian-themed operas with Italian librettos, such as ''[[Il Guarany]]''. Opera in Argentina developed in the 20th century after the inauguration of [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires—with the opera ''[[Aurora (opera)|Aurora]]'', by [[Ettore Panizza]], being heavily influenced by the Italian tradition, due to immigration. Other important composers from Argentina include [[Felipe Boero]] and [[Alberto Ginastera]].

===Contemporary, recent, and modernist trends===

====Modernism====
Perhaps the most obvious stylistic manifestation of modernism in opera is the development of [[atonality]]. The move away from traditional tonality in opera had begun with [[Richard Wagner]], and in particular the [[Tristan chord]]. Composers such as [[Richard Strauss]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Giacomo Puccini]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, [[Paul Hindemith]], Benjamin Britten and [[Hans Pfitzner]] pushed Wagnerian harmony further with a more extreme use of chromaticism and greater use of dissonance. Another aspect of modernist opera is the shift away from long, suspended melodies, to short quick mottos, as first illustrated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in his ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''. Composers such as Strauss, Britten, Shostakovich and Stravinsky adopted and expanded upon this style.

[[File:Schiele - Bildnis des Komponisten Arnold Schönberg . 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Arnold Schoenberg in 1917; portrait by [[Egon Schiele]]]]
Operatic modernism truly began in the operas of two Viennese composers, [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his student [[Alban Berg]], both composers and advocates of atonality and its later development (as worked out by Schoenberg), [[dodecaphony]]. Schoenberg's early musico-dramatic works, ''[[Erwartung]]'' (1909, premiered in 1924) and ''[[Die glückliche Hand]]'' display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used [[Sprechstimme]].

The two operas of Schoenberg's pupil Alban Berg, ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1925) and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (incomplete at his death in 1935) share many of the same characteristics as described above, though Berg combined his highly personal interpretation of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character) which perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots. Schoenberg's theories have influenced (either directly or indirectly) significant numbers of opera composers ever since, even if they themselves did not compose using his techniques.
[[File:Igor Stravinsky Essays.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky in 1921]]
Composers thus influenced include the Englishman [[Benjamin Britten]], the German [[Hans Werner Henze]], and the Russian [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. ([[Philip Glass]] also makes use of atonality, though his style is generally described as [[minimalist music|minimalist]], usually thought of as another 20th-century development.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/discover/periods/modern/minimalism-guide/|title=Minimalist music: where to start|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Most readers will find it startling to hear Glass associated with atonality.--&gt;

However, operatic modernism's use of atonality also sparked a backlash in the form of [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. An early leader of this movement was [[Ferruccio Busoni]], who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical [[number opera]] ''[[Arlecchino (opera)|Arlecchino]]'' (first performed in 1917).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Walton, "Neo-classical opera" in [[#Cooke2005|Cooke]], p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Also among the vanguard was the Russian [[Igor Stravinsky]]. After composing music for the [[Diaghilev]]-produced ballets ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' (1927).  Stravinsky had already turned away from the modernist trends of his early ballets to produce small-scale works that do not fully qualify as opera, yet certainly contain many operatic elements, including ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (1916: "a burlesque in song and dance") and ''[[Histoire du soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'' (1918: "to be read, played, and danced"; in both cases the descriptions and instructions are those of the composer). In the latter, the actors declaim portions of speech to a specified rhythm over instrumental accompaniment, peculiarly similar to the older German genre of ''[[Melodrama]]''.  Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (1914), and ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore [[serialism|serialist technique]] and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style [[diatonic]] number opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951). His resistance to serialism (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many{{who|date=October 2012}}&lt;!-- if references had a page number it might be possible to replace weaslely phrase with a concrete example --&gt; other composers.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 8; ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Schoenberg, Berg and Stravinsky; Malcolm MacDonald ''Schoenberg'' (Dent,1976); Francis Routh, ''Stravinsky'' (Dent, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other trends====
A common trend throughout the 20th century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, is the use of smaller orchestras as a cost-cutting measure; the grand Romantic-era orchestras with huge string sections, multiple harps, extra horns, and exotic percussion instruments were no longer feasible. As government and private patronage of the arts decreased throughout the 20th century, new works were often commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and short, one-act operas. Many of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; [[Mark Adamo]]'s two-act realization of ''[[Little Women (opera)|Little Women]]'' is scored for 18 instrumentalists.

Another feature of late 20th-century opera is the emergence of contemporary historical operas, in contrast to the tradition of basing operas on more distant history, the re-telling of contemporary fictional stories or plays, or on myth or legend. ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'', ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]'', and ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'' by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], ''[[Dead Man Walking (opera)|Dead Man Walking]]'' by [[Jake Heggie]], and ''[[Anna Nicole]]'' by [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]] exemplify the dramatisation onstage of events in recent living memory, where characters portrayed in the opera were alive at the time of the premiere performance.

The Metropolitan Opera in the US reports that the average age of its audience is now 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/met-backtracks-on-drop-in-average-audience-age/ | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel J. | last=Wakin | title=Met Backtracks on Drop in Average Audience Age | date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many opera companies have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for [[classical music]] since the last decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;General reference for this section: ''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to attract younger audiences, the Metropolitan Opera offers a student discount on ticket purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/about/education/student.aspx |title=Information about Metropolitan Opera Company student discounts |publisher=Metoperafamily.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller companies in the US have a more fragile existence, and they usually depend on a "patchwork quilt" of support from state and local governments, local businesses, and fundraisers. Nevertheless, some smaller companies have found ways of drawing new audiences. [[Opera Carolina]] offer discounts and happy hour events to the 21- to 40-year-old demographic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operayoungprofessionals.org/ Opera Carolina discount information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221220758/http://www.operayoungprofessionals.org/ |date=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to radio and television broadcasts of opera performances, which have had some success in gaining new audiences, broadcasts of live performances in HD to movie theatres have shown the potential to reach new audiences.

====From musicals back towards opera====
By the late 1930s, some [[musical theatre|musicals]] began to be written with a more operatic structure. These works include complex polyphonic ensembles and reflect musical developments of their times. ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935), influenced by jazz styles, and ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' (1956), with its sweeping, lyrical passages and farcical parodies of opera, both opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] but became accepted as part of the opera repertory. Popular [[Musical theatre|musicals]] such as ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Passion (musical)|Passion]]'', ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and others tell dramatic stories through complex music and in the 2010s they are sometimes seen in opera houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/dec/17/classicalmusicandopera1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Clements | title=Sweeney Todd, Royal Opera House, London | date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'' (1952) is quasi-operatic and has been revived by the [[New York City Opera]]. Other [[rock musical|rock influenced musicals]], such as ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1971), ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1980), ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996), ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'' (2006), and ''[[Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812]]'' (2012) employ various operatic conventions, such as [[through composed|through composition]], recitative instead of dialogue, and [[leitmotif]]s.

===Acoustic enhancement in opera===
A subtle type of sound electronic reinforcement called [[acoustic enhancement]] is used in some modern concert halls and theatres where operas are performed. Although none of the major opera houses "...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre", many use a [[sound reinforcement system]] for acoustic enhancement and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, child singers, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in ''[[Tosca]]'' or thunder effects in Wagnerian operas).&lt;ref&gt;Kai Harada, [http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&amp;magazinearticleid=66853&amp;siteid=15&amp;magazineid=138 "Opera's Dirty Little Secret"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031082324/http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&amp;magazinearticleid=66853&amp;siteid=15&amp;magazineid=138 |date=31 October 2013 }}, ''Entertainment Design'', 1 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operatic voices==
Operatic vocal technique evolved, in a time before electronic amplification, to allow singers to produce enough volume to be heard over an orchestra, without the instrumentalists having to substantially compromise their volume.

===Vocal classifications===
Singers and the roles they play are classified by [[voice type]], based on the [[tessitura]], [[vocal weight|agility, power]] and [[timbre]] of their voices. Male singers can be classified by [[vocal range]] as [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[bass-baritone]], [[baritone]], [[tenor]] and [[countertenor]], and female singers as [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]]. (Men sometimes sing in the "female" vocal ranges, in which case they are termed [[sopranist]] or [[countertenor]]. The [[countertenor]] is commonly encountered in opera, sometimes singing parts written for [[castrati]]—men neutered at a young age specifically to give them a higher singing range.) Singers are then further classified by [[vocal weight|size]]—for instance, a soprano can be described as a lyric soprano, [[coloratura]], [[soubrette]], [[spinto]], or dramatic soprano. These terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer's voice with the roles most suitable to the singer's vocal characteristics.

Yet another sub-classification can be made according to acting skills or requirements, for example the ''[[Basso Buffo]]'' who often must be a specialist in [[Patter song|patter]] as well as a comic actor. This is carried out in detail in the ''[[Fach]]'' system of German speaking countries, where historically opera and spoken [[drama]] were often put on by the same [[repertory]] company.

A particular singer's voice may change drastically over his or her lifetime, rarely reaching vocal maturity until the third decade, and sometimes not until middle age. Two French voice types, ''premiere dugazon'' and ''deuxieme dugazon'', were named after successive stages in the career of [[Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre]] (Mme. Dugazon). Other terms originating in the star casting system of the [[Paris Opera#See also|Parisian theatres]] are ''[[Jean-Blaise Martin|baryton-martin]]'' and [[soprano]] ''[[Cornélie Falcon|falcon]]''.

===Historical use of voice parts===
:''The following is only intended as a brief overview. For the main articles, see [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[countertenor]] and [[castrato]]''.

The soprano voice has typically been used as the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera since the latter half of the 18th century. Earlier, it was common for that part to be sung by any female voice, or even a [[castrato]]. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high [[A (musical note)|A]] ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], for example, only wrote one role extending to a high [[C (musical note)|C]]), though the castrato [[Farinelli]] was alleged to possess a top [[D (musical note)|D]] (his lower range was also extraordinary, extending to tenor C). The mezzo-soprano, a term of comparatively recent origin, also has a large repertoire, ranging from the female lead in Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' to such heavyweight roles as Brangäne in Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' (these are both roles sometimes sung by sopranos; there is quite a lot of movement between these two voice-types). For the true contralto, the range of parts is more limited, which has given rise to the insider joke that contraltos only sing "witches, bitches, and [[breeches role|britches]]" roles. In recent years many of the "trouser roles" from the Baroque era, originally written for women, and those originally sung by castrati, have been reassigned to countertenors.

The tenor voice, from the Classical era onwards, has traditionally been assigned the role of male protagonist. Many of the most challenging tenor roles in the repertory were written during the ''bel canto'' era, such as [[Donizetti]]'s sequence of 9 Cs above middle C during ''[[La fille du régiment]]''. With Wagner came an emphasis on vocal heft for his protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as ''Heldentenor''; this heroic voice had its more Italianate counterpart in such roles as Calaf in Puccini's ''Turandot''. Basses have a long history in opera, having been used in ''opera seria'' in supporting roles, and sometimes for comic relief (as well as providing a contrast to the preponderance of high voices in this genre). The bass repertoire is wide and varied, stretching from the comedy of Leporello in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' to the nobility of Wotan in [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Wagner's ''Ring Cycle,'']] to the conflicted King Phillip of Verdi's ''[[Don Carlos]]''. In between the bass and the tenor is the baritone, which also varies in weight from say, Guglielmo in Mozart's ''Così fan tutte'' to Posa in Verdi's ''Don Carlos''; the actual designation "baritone" was not standard until the mid-19th century.

===Famous singers===
[[File:Senesino portrait edited.jpg|thumb|upright|The castrato [[Senesino]], c. 1720]]
Early performances of opera were too infrequent for singers to make a living exclusively from the style, but with the birth of commercial opera in the mid-17th century, professional performers began to emerge. The role of the male hero was usually entrusted to a [[castrato]], and by the 18th century, when Italian opera was performed throughout Europe, leading castrati who possessed extraordinary vocal virtuosity, such as [[Senesino]] and [[Farinelli]], became international stars. The career of the first major female star (or [[prima donna]]), [[Anna Renzi]], dates to the mid-17th century. In the 18th century, a number of Italian sopranos gained international renown and often engaged in fierce rivalry, as was the case with [[Faustina Bordoni]] and [[Francesca Cuzzoni]], who started a fist fight with one another during a performance of a Handel opera. The French disliked castrati, preferring their male heroes to be sung by an [[haute-contre]] (a high tenor), of which [[Joseph Legros]] (1739–1793) was a leading example.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (ed. Parker, 1994), Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Though opera patronage has decreased in the last century in favor of other arts and media (such as musicals, cinema, radio, television and recordings), mass media and the advent of recording have supported the popularity of many famous singers including [[Maria Callas]], [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Amelita Galli-Curci]], [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Juan Arvizu]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mexican+musicians+in+California+and+the+United+States%2C+1910-50.-a0155283831 ''The Free Library – Mexican Musicians in California and the United States 1910–50 – Two Mexican Tenors'' – Juan Arvizu opera tenor in thefreelibrary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lzmTAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:sZtJSSJbdm4C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9sOe62dXZAhXPct8KHYJeCmcQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Juan%20Arvizu&amp;f=false ''Agustin Lara: A Cultural Biography'' – "Juan Arvizu Biography" – operatic tenor] Andrew Grant Wood.

==Changing role of the orchestra==
Before the 1700s, Italian operas used a small [[string orchestra]], but it rarely played to accompany the singers. Opera solos during this period were accompanied by the [[basso continuo]] group, which consisted of the [[harpsichord]], "plucked instruments" such as [[lute]] and a bass instrument.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"&gt;John Spitzer. (2009). Orchestra and voice in eighteenth-century Italian opera. In: Anthony R. DelDonna and Pierpaolo Polzonetti (eds.) [[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Eighteenth-Century Opera]]. pp. 112–39. [Online]. Cambridge Companions to Music. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The string orchestra typically only played when the singer was not singing, such as during a singer's "...entrances and exits, between vocal numbers, [or] for [accompanying] dancing". Another role for the orchestra during this period was playing an orchestral [[ritornello]] to mark the end of a singer's solo.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"/&gt; During the early 1700s, some composers began to use the string orchestra to mark certain aria or recitatives "...as special"; by 1720, most arias were accompanied by orchestra. Opera composers such as [[Domenico Sarro]], [[Leonardo Vinci]], [[Giambattista Pergolesi]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Johann Adolf Hasse]] added new instruments to the opera orchestra and gave the instruments new roles. They added wind instruments to the strings and used orchestral instruments to play instrumental solos, as a way to mark certain arias as special.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"/&gt;
[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006329 030 Orchester im Orchestergraben.jpg|thumb|right|German opera orchestra from the early 1950s]]
The orchestra has also provided an instrumental [[overture]] before the singers come onstage since the 1600s. [[Jacopo Peri|Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' opens with a brief instrumental [[ritornello]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) opens with a [[toccata]], in this case a fanfare for muted [[trumpet]]s. The [[French overture]] as found in [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s operas&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, George Gow, and James R. Anthony. 2001. "French Overture". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; consist of a slow introduction in a marked "dotted rhythm", followed by a lively movement in [[fugato]] style. The overture was frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rose. This overture style was also used in English opera, most notably in [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''. [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] also uses the French overture form in some of his Italian operas such as [[Giulio Cesare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8fHja-D-FvsC&amp;dq=Giulio+Cesare+French+overture&amp;q=Giulio+Cesare+French+overture#v=snippet&amp;q=Giulio%20Cesare%20French%20overture&amp;f=false |last= Burrows |first = Donald|date = 2012|page = 178|title = Handel|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 978-0199737369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, a distinct form called "overture" arose in the 1680s, and became established particularly through the operas of [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2001"&gt;Fisher, Stephen C. 2001. "Italian Overture." ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses three generally [[homophony|homophonic]] [[Movement (music)|movements]]: fast–slow–fast. The opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples was short, and could be in a contrasting key; the concluding movement was dance-like, most often with rhythms of the [[gigue]] or [[minuet]], and returned to the key of the opening section. As the form evolved, the first movement may incorporate fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called "sonatina form" ([[sonata form]] without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2001"/&gt;

In Italian opera after about 1800, the "overture" became known as the ''sinfonia''.&lt;ref name=FISH&gt;Fisher, Stephen C. 1998. "Sinfonia". ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', four volumes, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]]. London: Macmillan Publishers, Inc. {{ISBN|0333734327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher also notes the term ''Sinfonia avanti l'opera'' (literally, the "symphony before the opera") was "an early term for a sinfonia used to begin an opera, that is, as an overture as opposed to one serving to begin a later section of the work".&lt;ref name=FISH/&gt; In 19th-century opera, in some operas, the overture, ''Vorspiel'', ''Einleitung'', Introduction, or whatever else it may be called, was the portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises; a specific, rigid form was no longer required for the overture.

The role of the orchestra in accompanying the singers changed over the 19th century, as the Classical style transitioned to the Romantic era. In general, orchestras got bigger, new instruments were added, such as additional percussion instruments (e.g., bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, etc.). The [[orchestration]] of orchestra parts also developed over the 19th century. In Wagnerian operas, the forefronting of the orchestra went beyond the overture. In Wagnerian operas such as ''[[Tristan]]'', the orchestra often played the recurrent musical themes or [[leitmotif]]s, a role which gave a prominence to the orchestra which "...elevated its status to that of a [[prima donna]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Christopher John |date=2004 |title=Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era |url= |location= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |page=772 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner's operas were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity, adding more brass instruments and huge ensemble sizes: indeed, his score to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' calls for six [[harp]]s.

As the role of the orchestra and other instrumental ensembles changed over the history of opera, so did the role of leading the musicians. In the Baroque era, the musicians were usually directed by the harpsichord player, although the French composer Lully is known to have conducted with a long staff. In the 1800s, during the Classical period, the first violinist, also known as the [[concertmaster]], would lead the orchestra while sitting. Over time, some directors began to stand up and use hand and arm gestures to lead the performers. Eventually this role of [[music director]] became termed the [[conducting|conductor]], and a podium was used to make it easier for all the musicians to see him or her. By the time Wagnerian operas were introduced, the complexity of the works and the huge orchestras used to play them gave the conductor an increasingly important role. Modern opera conductors have a challenging role: they have to direct both the orchestra in the [[orchestra pit]] and the singers up on stage.

==Language and translation issues==
Since the days of Handel and Mozart, many composers have favored Italian as the language for the libretto of their operas. From the Bel Canto era to Verdi, composers would sometimes supervise versions of their operas in both Italian and French. Because of this, operas such as ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' or ''[[Don Carlos]]'' are today deemed canonical in both their French and Italian versions.&lt;ref&gt;de Acha, Rafael. [http://seenandheard-international.com/2013/09/don-carlos-in-french/ "Don Carlo or Don Carlos? In Italian or in French?"] (Seen and Heard International, 24 September 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Till the mid 1950s, it was acceptable to produce operas in translations even if these had not been authorized by the composer or the original librettists. For example, opera houses in Italy routinely staged Wagner in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/whose-language-is-opera-the-audiences-or-the-composers/news-story/b8b5ea7dfc230f1eda72a2eb329d1daa|title=Whose language is opera: the audience's or the composer's?|author=[[Lyndon Terracini]]|date=11 April 2011|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After WWII, opera scholarship improved, artists refocused on the original versions, and translations fell out of favor. Knowledge of European languages, especially Italian, French, and German, is today an important part of the training for professional singers."The biggest chunk of operatic training is in linguistics and musicianship," explains mezzo-soprano [[Dolora Zajick]]. "[I have to understand] not only what I'm singing, but what everyone else is singing. I sing Italian, Czech, Russian, French, German, English."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2014/03/19/291410969/dolora-zajick-singing-is-connected-to-the-body "For Opera Powerhouse Dolora Zajick, 'Singing Is Connected To The Body'"] (Fresh Air, 19 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called [[surtitles]]) began to appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally condemned as a distraction,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Tommasini|Tommasini, Anthony]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/arts/music/06tomm.html "So That's What the Fat Lady Sang"] (''The New York Times'', 6 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's [[proscenium]] arch, or individual seat screens where spectators can choose from more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a [[RAI]] broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung discourse is much harder to understand than a spoken one—even in the ears of native speakers. Subtitles in one or more languages have become standard in opera broadcasts, simulcasts, and DVD editions.

Today, operas are only rarely performed in translation. Exceptions include the [[English National Opera]], the [[Opera Theater of St. Louis]], [[Opera Theater of Pittsburgh]], and Opera South East,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operasoutheast.org.uk/all-past-productions.html "Opera South East's past productions back to 1980...

Accessed 11 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Another milestone occurred in Italy in 1992 when ''[[Tosca]]'' was broadcast live from its original Roman settings and times of the day:  The first act came from the 16th-century Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle at noon on Saturday; the 16th-century Palazzo Farnese was the setting for the second at 8:15 P.M.; and on Sunday at 6 A.M., the third act was broadcast from Castel Sant'Angelo. The production was transmitted via satellite to 105 countries.&lt;ref name="O'Connor 1 January 1993"&gt;{{cite news

Major opera companies have begun presenting their performances in local cinemas throughout the United States and many other countries. The [[Metropolitan Opera]] began a [[Metropolitan Opera Live in HD|series]] of live [[high-definition video]] transmissions to cinemas around the world in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metopera.org/hdlive Metropolitan Opera] high-definition live broadcast page&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Met performances were shown in over 424 theaters in 350 U.S. cities. ''[[La bohème]]'' went out to 671 screens worldwide. [[San Francisco Opera]] began prerecorded video transmissions in March 2008. As of June 2008, approximately 125 theaters in 117 U.S. cities carry the showings. The HD video opera transmissions are presented via the same [[Digital cinema|HD digital cinema projectors]] used for major [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebiggerpicture.us/opera |title=The Bigger Picture |publisher=Thebiggerpicture.us |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109064153/http://www.thebiggerpicture.us/opera/ |archivedate=9 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; European opera houses and [[List of opera festivals|festivals]] including the [[Royal Opera, London|Royal Opera]] in London, [[La Scala]] in Milan, the [[Salzburg Festival]], [[La Fenice]] in Venice, and the [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino|Maggio Musicale]] in Florence have also transmitted their productions to theaters in cities around the world since 2006, including 90 cities in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opera.emergingpictures.com Emerging Pictures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630062054/http://opera.emergingpictures.com/ |date=30 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Where to See Opera at the Movies" sidebar p.

The emergence of the Internet has also affected the way in which audiences consume opera. In 2009 the British [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] offered for the first time an online digital video download of its complete 2007 production of ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''. In 2013 season the festival [[Live streaming|streamed]] all six of its productions online.&lt;ref&gt;[[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]] (26 August 2009).

'''''Ostforschung''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔɔstˌfɔʁʃʊŋ|lang}}, "research on the east") is a [[German language|German]] term dating from the 18th century for the study of the areas to the east of [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|the core German-speaking region]].

Traditional ''Ostforschung'' has fallen into disrepute with modern German historians as it often reflected Western European [[Anti-Polish sentiment|prejudices of the time]] towards [[Poles]].&lt;ref name=Karin&gt;{{cite book |first=Karin |last=Friedrich |date=2006 |title=The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569-1772 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=5, 13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpulHjDt8UEC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''Ostforschung'' itself remained in use in the names of some journals and institutes throughout the [[Cold War]], but was replaced by more specific terms by the 1990s (e.g., the journal ''Zeitschrift für Ostforschung'', established in 1952, was renamed ''[[Zeitschrift für Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung]]'' in 1994).

Since the 1990s, ''Ostforschung'' itself has become a subject of historical research.

''Ostforschung'' was also the name of a multidisciplinary organization set up before [[World War II]] by Nazi German chief propagandist [[Albert Brackmann]] supporting Nazi genocidal policies, ethnic cleansing and anti-semitism. Brackmann and several other Nazi and nationalist historians and anthropologists co-ordinated Nazi German research on [[Eastern Europe]], mainly the [[Second Polish Republic]]. The research conducted by this organisation, as well as the [[Ahnenerbe]], was instrumental in planning of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] of local non-German populations in [[Generalplan Ost]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36536">'''Plaçage''' was a recognized extralegal system in French and Spanish slave colonies of North America (including the Caribbean) by which ethnic European men entered into civil unions with [[person of color|non-Europeans]] of African, Native American and mixed-race descent. The term comes from the French ''placer'' meaning "to place with". The women were not legally recognized as wives but were known as ''placées''; their relationships were recognized among the [[free people of color]] as ''mariages de la main gauche'' or [[Morganatic marriage|left-handed marriages]]. They became institutionalized with contracts or negotiations that settled property on the woman and her children, and in some cases gave them freedom if enslaved. The system flourished throughout the [[Louisiana (New France)|French]] and [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish colonial]] periods, reaching its zenith during the latter, between 1769 and 1803.

It was widely practiced in New Orleans, where planter society had created enough wealth to support the system. It also took place in the Latin-influenced cities of [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]; [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]]; [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]];&lt;ref&gt;''Chained to the Rock of Adversity, To Be Free, Black &amp; Female in the Old South,'' edited by Virginia Meacham Gould, University of Georgia Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Saint-Domingue]] (now the Republic of [[Haiti]]). Plaçage became associated with [[New Orleans]] as part of its cosmopolitan society.

In recent years, at least three historians (''viz.'' Kenneth Aslakson, Emily Clark, and Carol Schlueter) have challenged the [[historicity]] of plaçage and have referred to many of its features, including quadroon balls, as "a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?tag=quadroon-balls|title=Mixed Race Studies   » quadroon balls|website=www.mixedracestudies.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/stacy-parker-aab/quadroons-for-beginners-d_b_3869605.html|title=Quadroons for Beginners: Discussing the Suppressed and Sexualized History of Free Women of Color with Author Emily Clark|first=Stacy Parker Le|last=Melle|date=4 September 2013|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development of the plaçage system==
The plaçage system developed from the predominance of men among early colonial populations, who took women as consorts from Native Americans, current free women of color that came to America from places such as Saint-Domingue and some enslaved Africans. Adding to what was known as free people of color in Louisiana, and especially New Orleans, during the colonial years, from whom wealthy men would choose. In this period there was a shortage of European women, as the colonies were dominated in the early day by male explorers and colonists. Given the harsh conditions in Louisiana, persuading women to follow the men was not easy. France recruited willing farm- and city-dwelling women, known as casket or ''[[casquette girl]]s'', because they brought all their possessions to the colonies in a small trunk or casket. France also sent women convicted along with their debtor husbands, and in 1719, deported 209 women felons "who were of a character to be sent to the French settlement in Louisiana."&lt;ref name=Morlas&gt;Katy F. Morlas, "La Madame et la Mademoiselle," graduate thesis in history, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; (France also relocated young women orphans known as [[King's Daughters]] ({{lang-fr|filles du roi}}) to their colonies for marriage: to both Canada and Louisiana.)

[[Image:departcassettegirls.jpg|left|thumbnail|A print by Dupin after [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] depicting "comfort women" embarking unwillingly for the Americas. Whether "comfort women", "casket girls", or aristocrats, French women were reluctant to migrate to the French colonies.]]
Historian Joan Martin maintains that there is little documentation that "casket girls", considered among the ancestors of white French Creoles, were brought to Louisiana. The [[Ursulines|Ursuline order of nuns]] supposedly chaperoned the casket girls until they married, but the order has denied they followed this practice. Martin suggests this was a myth, and that interracial relationships occurred from the beginning of the encounter among Europeans, Native Americans and Africans. She also writes that some Creole families who today identify as white had ancestors during the colonial period who were African or [[multiracial]], and whose descendants married white over generations.&lt;ref&gt;Joan M. Martin, ''Placage and the Louisiana Gens de Couleur Libre'', in [[Creole language|Creole]], edited by Sybil Kein, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through warfare and raids, Native American women were often captured to be traded, sold, or taken as wives. At first, the colony generally imported African men to use as slave labor because of the heavy work of clearing to develop plantations. Over time, it also imported African women as slaves. Marriage between the races was forbidden according to the [[Code Noir]] of the eighteenth century, but interracial sex continued. The upper class [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] men during this period often did not marry until their late twenties or early thirties. [[Premarital sex]] with an intended white bride, especially if she was of high rank, was not permitted socially.

===Free people of color===
White male colonists, often the younger sons of noblemen, military men, and planters, who needed to accumulate some wealth before they could marry, took women of color as consorts before marriage or in some cases after their first wives died. Merchants and administrators also followed this practice if they were wealthy enough. When the women bore children, they were sometimes emancipated along with their children. Both the woman and her children might take the surnames of the man. When Creole men reached an age when they were expected to marry, some also kept their relationships with their placées, but this was less common. A wealthy white man could have two (or more) families: one legal, and the other not. Their mixed-race children became the nucleus of the class of [[free people of color]] or ''[[gens de couleur|gens de couleur libres]]'' in Louisiana and Saint-Domingue. After the [[Haitian Revolution]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, many refugees came to New Orleans, adding a new wave of French-speaking free people of color.

During the period of French and Spanish rule, the ''gens de couleur'' came to constitute a third class in New Orleans and other former French cities - between the white Creoles and the mass of black slaves. They had certain status and rights, and often acquired education and property. Later their descendants became leaders in New Orleans, holding political office in the city and state, and becoming part of what developed as the [[African-American middle class]] in the [[United States]].

By 1788, 1500 Creole women of color and black women were being maintained by white men.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", in ''Race Consciousness'', edited by Judith Jackson Fossett and Jeffrey A. Tucker, New York University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain customs had evolved. It was common for a wealthy, married Creole to live primarily outside New Orleans on his [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] with his white family. He often kept a second address in the city to use for entertaining and socializing among the white elite. He had built or bought a house for his placée and their children. She and her children were part of the society of Creoles of color. The white world might not recognize the placée as a wife legally and socially, but she was recognized as such among the Creoles of color. Some of the women acquired [[slavery|slaves]] and plantations. Particularly during the Spanish colonial era, a woman might be listed as owning slaves; these were sometimes relatives whom she intended to free after earning enough money to buy their freedom.

While in New Orleans (or other cities), the man would cohabit with the placée as an official "boarder" at her Creole cottage or house. Many were located near [[Rampart Street]] in New Orleans-—once the demarcation line or wall between the city and the frontier. Other popular neighborhoods for Creoles of color were the [[Faubourg Marigny]] and [[Tremé]]. If the man was not married, he might keep a separate residence, preferably next door or in the same or next block as his placée. He often took part in and arranged for the upbringing and education of their children. For a time both boys and girls were educated in France, as there were no schools in New Orleans for mixed-race children. As supporting such a plaçage arrangement(s) ran into thousands of dollars per year, it was limited to the wealthy.

===Inheritance and work===
Upon the death of her protector, the placée and her family could, on legal challenge, expect up to a third of the man's property. Some white lovers tried, and succeeded, in making their mixed-race children primary heirs over other white descendants or relatives. A notable inheritance case was the daughters of [[Nicolás María Vidal]], a former high official in Spanish Louisiana, who with their mother, Eufrosina Hisnard, successfully petitioned the U.S. government in the 1830s to intercede on their behalf to secure a portion of Vidal's estate.&lt;ref name="Congress1834"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States Congress|title=American State Papers: Documents, Legislative and Executive, of the Congress of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhVFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA868|year=1834|publisher=Gales and Seaton|location=Washington, D.C.|chapter=Transactions in the Floridas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClintonGillespie1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clinton|first1=Catherine|last2=Gillespie|first2=Michele|title=The Devil's Lane: Sex and Race in the Early South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37q5j7Ix-fkC&amp;pg=PA239|accessdate=17 October 2018|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-802721-8|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women in these relationships often worked to develop assets: acquiring property, running a legitimate rooming-house, or a small business as a hairdresser, [[marchande]] (female street or country merchant/vendor), or a seamstress. She could also become a placée to another white Creole. She sometimes taught her daughters to become placées, by education and informal schooling in dress, comportment, and ways to behave. A mother negotiated with a young man for the dowry or property settlement, sometimes by contract, for her daughter if a white Creole were interested in her. A former placée could also marry or cohabit with a Creole man of color and have more children.

Contrary to popular misconceptions, placées were not and did not become prostitutes. Creole men of color objected to the practice as denigrating the virtue of Creole women of color, but some, as descendants of white males, benefited by the transfer of social capital. Martin writes, "They did not choose to live in concubinage; what they chose was to survive."{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after Reconstruction and with the reassertion of white supremacy across the former Confederacy, the white Creole historians, [[Charles Gayarré]] and [[Alcée Fortier]], wrote histories that did not address plaçage in much detail. They suggested that little race mixing had occurred during the colonial period, and that the placées had seduced or led white Creole men astray. They wrote that the French Creoles (in the sense of having long been native to Louisiana) were ethnic Europeans who were threatened by the spectre of race-mixing like other Southern whites.

Gayarré, when younger, was said to have taken a woman of color as his placée and she had their children, to his later shame. He married a white woman late in life. His earlier experience inspired his novel ''Fernando de Lemos''.

==Notable placées==

===Marie Thérèse Metoyer===
[[Marie Thérèse Metoyer]] ''dite'' [[Coincoin]] became an icon of black female entrepreneurship in colonial Louisiana. She was born at the frontier outpost of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] on [[Cane River]] in August 1742 as a slave of the post founder, the controversial explorer [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis]]. She would be, for twenty years, the placée of a French colonial merchant-turned-planter, [[Claude Thomas Pierre Métoyer]] two years her junior. At the onset of their plaçage, she was already the mother of five children; she would bear ten more to Métoyer. In 1778, he freed her after the parish priest filed charges against Coincoin as a "public concubine" and threatened to have her sold at New Orleans if they did not end their relationship. As a free woman, she remained with Métoyer until 1788, when his growing fortune persuaded him to take a wife who could provide legal heirs. (He chose another Marie Thérèse, a white Créole of French and German birth.)

In setting Coincoin aside, Métoyer donated to her his interest in 80 [[arpent]]s, about {{convert|68|acre|m2}} of unpatented land, adjacent to his plantation, to help support their free-born offspring. On that modest tract, Coincoin planted tobacco, a valuable commodity in the struggling colony. She and her children trapped bears and wild turkeys for sales of meat, hide, and oil locally and at the New Orleans market. She also manufactured medicine, a skill shared by her freed-slave sister Marie Louise ''dite'' Mariotte and likely one acquired from their African-born parents. With this money, she progressively bought the freedom of four of her first five children and several grandchildren, before investing in three African-born slaves to provide the physical labor that became more difficult as she aged. After securing a colonial patent on her homestead in 1794, she petitioned for and was given a land concession from the Spanish crown. On that piney-woods tract of 800 arpents (667 ac) on Old Red River, about 5&amp;nbsp;mi from her farmstead, she set up a vacherie (a ranch) and engaged a Spaniard to tend her cattle. Shortly before her death in 1816, Coincoin sold her homestead and divided her remaining property (her piney-woods land, the three African slaves, and their offspring) among her own progeny.

As often happened among the children of plaçages, Coincoin's one surviving daughter by Métoyer, Marie Susanne, became a placée also. As a young woman, apparently with the blessing of both parents, she entered into a relationship with a newly arrived physician, Joseph Conant from New Orleans. When he left Cane River, soon after the birth of their son, she formed a second and lifelong plaçage with a Cane River planter, Jean Baptiste Anty. As a second-generation entrepreneur, Susanne became far more successful than her mother and died in 1838 leaving an estate of $61,600 (equivalent to $1,500,000 in 2009 currency).

Modern archaeological work at the site of Coincoin's farmstead is documenting some of the aspects of her domestic life. A mid-nineteenth century dwelling, now dubbed the Coincoin-Prudhomme House although it was not the actual site of her residence, commemorates her within the Cane River National Heritage Area. Popular lore also has, erroneously, credited her with the ownership of a Cane River plantation founded by her son Louis Metoyer, known today as [[Melrose Plantation]], and its historic buildings Yucca House and [[African House]]. Her eldest half-French son, [[Nicolas Augustin Métoyer]], founded [[St. Augustine Parish (Isle Brevelle) Church]], the spiritual center of Cane River's large community of Creoles of color who trace their heritage to Coincoin.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Elizabeth Shown.

===Eulalie de Mandéville===

There were many other examples of white Creole fathers who reared and carefully and quietly placed their daughters of color with the sons of known friends or family members. This occurred with [[Eulalie de Mandéville]], the elder half-sister of color to the eccentric nobleman, politician, and land developer [[Bernard de Marigny|Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandéville]]. Taken from her slave mother as a baby, and partly raised by a white grandmother, 22-year-old Eulalie was "placed" by her father, [[Count Pierre Enguerrand Philippe, Écuyer de Mandéville, Sieur de Marigny]], with [[Eugène de Macarty]], a member of the famous [[French people|French]]-[[Irish people|Irish]] clan in 1796. Their alliance resulted in five children and lasted almost fifty years.&lt;ref name=Morlas/&gt;

[[Image:BernardMarignyPortrait.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Portrait of Bernard de Marigny, flamboyant Creole millionaire and the half-brother of Eulalie de Mandéville de Macarty.]]
Macarty, like some white Creoles, never married a white woman.

[[Image:AugustinDeMacarty.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of Augustin de Macarty, military man, mayor of New Orleans, and brother of Eugène de Macarty.]]
In contrast to the Macartys' stable relationship, Eugène's brother [[Augustin de Macarty]] was married and was said to have had numerous, complex affairs with Creole women of color. When he died, several women made claims on behalf of their children against his estate.&lt;ref&gt;Violet Harrington Bryan, "Marcus Christian's Treatment of Les Gens de Couleur Libre", in Creole, edited by Sybil Kein, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his deathbed in 1845, Eugène de Macarty married Eulalie. He willed her all of his money and property, then worth $12,000. His white relatives, including his niece, [[Madame LaLaurie|Marie Delphine de Macarty LaLaurie]], contested the will. The court upheld his will. After Eulalie's death, their surviving children defeated another attempt by Macarty's relatives to claim his estate, by then worth more than $150,000. Eulalie de Mandéville de Macarty became a successful [[marchande]] and ran a dairy. She died in 1848.

===Rosette Rochon===
&lt;span id="RosetteRochon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:rosetterochon.gif|right|thumbnail|Sketch of Rosette Rochon: banker, speculator, entrepreneur, and placée.]] --&gt;

[[Rosette Rochon]] was born in 1767 in colonial [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], the daughter of Pierre Rochon, a shipbuilder from a Québécois family (family name was Rocheron in [[Québec]]), and his mulâtresse slave-consort Marianne, who bore him five other children. Once Rosette reached a suitable age, she became the consort of a Monsieur Hardy, with whom she relocated to the colony of [[Saint Domingue]]. During her sojourn there, Hardy must have died or relinquished his relationship with her; for in 1797 during the Haitian Revolution, she escaped to New Orleans, where she later became the placée of Joseph Forstal and Charles Populus, both wealthy white New Orleans Creoles.

Rochon came to speculate in real estate in the [[French Quarter]]; she eventually owned rental property, opened grocery stores, made loans, bought and sold mortgages, and owned and rented out (hired out) slaves. She also traveled extensively back and forth to [[Haiti]], where her son by Hardy had become a government official in the new republic. Her social circle in New Orleans once included [[Marie Laveau]], [[Jean Lafitte]], and the free black contractors and real estate developers [[Jean-Louis Doliolle]] and his brother [[Joseph Doliolle]].

In particular, Rochon became one of the earliest investors in the [[Faubourg Marigny]], acquiring her first lot from [[Bernard de Marigny]] in 1806. Bernard de Marigny, the Creole speculator, refused to sell the lots he was subdividing from his family plantation to anyone who spoke English. While this turned out to be a losing financial decision, Marigny felt more comfortable with the French-speaking, Catholic free people of color (having relatives, lovers, and even children on this side of the color line). Consequently, much of Faubourg Marigny was built by free black artisans for free people of color or for French-speaking white Creoles. Rochon remained largely illiterate, dying in 1863 at the age of 96, leaving behind an [[Estate (law)|estate]] valued at $100,000 (today, an estate worth a million dollars).

===Marie Laveau===
[[Marie Laveau]] (also spelled Leveau, Laveaux), known as the [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] queen of New Orleans, was born between 1795 and 1801 as the daughter of a white Haitian plantation owner, Charles Leveaux, and his mixed black and Indian placée Marguerite Darcantel (or D'Arcantel). Because there were so many whites as well as free people of color in [[Haiti]] with the same names, Leveaux could also have been a free man of color who owned slaves and property as well. All three may have escaped Haiti along with thousands of other Creole whites and Creoles of color during the slave uprisings that culminated in the French colony's becoming the only independent black republic in the New World.

At 17, Marie married a Creole man of color popularly known as [[Jacques Paris]] (however, in some documents, he is known as [[Santiago Paris]]). Paris either died, disappeared or deliberately abandoned her (some accounts also relate that he was a merchant seaman or sailor in the navy) after she produced a daughter. Laveau was styling herself as the Widow Paris and was a hairdresser for white matrons (she was also reckoned to be an herbalist and [[yellow fever]] nurse) when she met [[Louis-Christophe Dumesnil de Glapion]] and in the early 1820s, they became lovers.

Marie was just beginning her spectacular career as a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] practitioner (she would not be declared a "queen" until about 1830), and Dumesnil de Glapion was a fiftyish white Creole veteran of the [[Battle of New Orleans]] with relatives on both sides of the color line. Recently,{{vague|date=September 2016}} it has been alleged that Dumesnil de Glapion was so in love with Marie, he refused to live separately from his placée according to racial [[convention (norm)|custom]]. In an unusual decision, Dumesnil de Glapion [[Passing (racial identity)|passed]] as a man of color in order to live with her under respectable circumstances—thus explaining the confusion many historians have had whether he was truly white or black.&lt;ref&gt;Caryn Cosse Bell, "The Real Marie Laveau", review of Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau, by Martha Ward, University Press of Mississippi, Jackson, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is popularly thought that Marie presented Dumesnil de Glapion with fifteen children, only five are listed in vital statistics and of these, two daughters—one the famous Marie Euchariste or [[Marie Leveau II]]—lived to adulthood. Marie Euchariste closely resembled her mother and startled many who thought that Marie Leveau had been resurrected by the black arts, or could be at two places at once, beliefs that the daughter did little to correct.

Sebastopol: This [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States#Plantation house|plantation house]] and property was built and cultivated by Don Pedro Morin in the 1830s in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. It was bought twenty years later by Colonel Ignatius Szymanski a Polish American who later served in the Confederate Army, and renamed Sebastopol. At his death, Colonel Szymanski willed this estate to his placée Eliza Romain, a free woman of color, and to their son John Szymanski.

==Quadroon balls==
The term [[quadroon]] is a fractional one referring to a person with one white and one mulatto parent, some courts would have considered one-fourth Black. The "quadroon balls" were social events designed to encourage mixed-race women to form liaisons with wealthy white men through a system of concubinage known as plaçage.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 68-9&lt;/ref&gt; Monique Guillory writes about quadroon balls that took place in New Orleans, the city most strongly associated with these events. She approaches the balls in context of the history of a building the structure of which is now the Bourbon Orleans Hotel. Inside is the Orleans Ballroom, a legendary, if not entirely factual, location for the earliest quadroon balls.

[[File:SignaresBal.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a [[signare]] ball in colonial [[Saint-Louis, Senegal]].]]

The origin of quadroon balls can be traced to the ''[[redoutes des filles de couleur]]'' in [[Cap-Francais]] in the French colony of [[Saint Domingue]].&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;Jorge Canizares-Esguerra, Matt D. Childs, James Sidbury: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vxx0F6zZUfwC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=redoutes+des+filles+de+couleur+saint+domingue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NhDck48HCS&amp;sig=MqL4IUUKqWS5Oa7DwwusI4w6suM&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA6Z618LHVAhUSalAKHdYMCT0Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=redoutes%20des%20filles%20de%20couleur%20saint%20domingue&amp;f=false The Black Urban Atlantic in the Age of the Slave Trade]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Burnard, John Garrigus: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FNM7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=saint+domingue+white+women&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiak8LRta_VAhVmQZoKHVyhDY0Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=quadroon%20balls&amp;f=false The Plantation Machine: Atlantic Capitalism in French Saint-Domingue]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The French colony, where the male population outnumbered women, white women were few and there were few alternatives to prostitution for free women of color, was known in the Caribbean for its "Mulatto Courtesans", whose trademark was elegance, a haughty demeanor and the demand to be courted.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; As there were no brothels in the colony, where sex workers worked independently, these balls were the place where the most exclusive courtesans met their clients; having met, they were set up as the official housekeeper or openly kept as mistresses,&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; and when their male client died or left for France, they were normally left with money, property or slaves for their future support.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart R. King: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ESy9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=juli+dahey+saint+domingue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nlcLr4Wg4y&amp;sig=-MjhjIZwwApjYg6s_9H0cOWRfQo&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eJ-UVIBL4qLIA9KtgdAN&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=juli%20dahey%20saint%20domingue&amp;f=false Blue Coat Or Powdered Wig: Free People of Color in Pre-revolutionary Saint Domingue]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1805, a man named Albert Tessier began renting a dance hall where he threw twice weekly dances for free quadroon women and white men only.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 80&lt;/ref&gt; These dances were elegant and elaborate, designed to appeal to wealthy white men. Although race mixing was prohibited by New Orleans law, it was common for white gentleman to attend the balls, sometimes stealing away from white balls to mingle with the city's quadroon female population. The principal desire of quadroon women attending these balls was to become ''placée'' as the mistress of a wealthy gentleman, usually a young white Creole or a visiting European.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 81&lt;/ref&gt; These arrangements were a common occurrence, Guillory suggests, because the highly educated, socially refined quadroons were prohibited from marrying white men and were unlikely to find Black men of their own status.

A quadroon's mother usually negotiated with an admirer the compensation that would be received for having the woman as his mistress. Typical terms included some financial payment to the parent, financial and/or housing arrangements for the quadroon herself, and, many times, paternal recognition of any children the union produced. Guillory points out that some of these matches were as enduring and exclusive as marriages. A beloved quadroon mistress had the power to destabilize white marriages and families, something she was much resented for.

According to Guillory, the system of plaçage had a basis in the economics of mixed race. The plaçage of black women with white lovers, Guillory writes, could take place only because of the socially determined value of their light skin, the same light skin that commanded a higher price on the slave block, where light skinned girls fetched much higher prices than did prime field hands.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 82&lt;/ref&gt; Guillory posits the quadroon balls as the best among severely limited options for these near-white women, a way for them to control their sexuality and decide the price of their own bodies. She contends, "The most a mulatto mother and a quadroon daughter could hope to attain in the rigid confines of the black/white world was some semblance of economic independence and social distinction from the slaves and other blacks" (83). She notes that many participants in the balls were successful in actual businesses when they could no longer rely on an income from the plaçage system. She speculates they developed business acumen from the process of marketing their own bodies.

==History==
The concept of rapid automatized naming began with a study by Geshwind and Fusillo in 1966. They found some adults who suffered from a [[stroke]] were later unable to name colors despite being able to color match and having no evidence of [[color blindness]].&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denckla|first1=Martha Bridge|last2=Cutting|first2=Laurie E. |title=History and significance of rapid automatized naming|journal=Annals of Dyslexia |volume=49 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=29–42|issn=0736-9387|doi=10.1007/s11881-999-0018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals however were able to spell and write, indicating that their brain structures were intact and that they could generate the pathway from spoken words to visual and kinaesthetic representations.&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt; This visual-verbal disconnection led to a search for individuals who could not read and may be unable to name colors, primarily grade one students. It was found that in grade one students who could not read, color naming was possible but took much longer than color naming in children who could read.&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt;

The first color naming task was located in Ruesch and Wells Mental Examiner’s Handbook (1972).&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt; It consisted of 50 squares of 5 [[primary colors]] repeated in random order 10 times. The test was originally administered as a timed continuous test at the bedside of individuals recovering from head injury.&lt;ref name="Denckla, Cutting, 1999"/&gt;

Rapid automatized naming was first identified in 1974 as predicting reading abilities in young English readers between 5–11 years of age by Martha Denckla and Rita Rudel of [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Denckla MB, Rudel R |title=Rapid "automatized" naming of pictured objects, colors, letters and numbers by normal children |journal=Cortex |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=186–202 |date=June 1974 |pmid=4844470 |doi= 10.1016/s0010-9452(74)80009-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faster times in RAN trials have been found to be a good indicator of reading competence, not only in alphabetic [[writing system]]s, but in writing systems such as Chinese [[logograph]]s  and Japanese [[kanji]] and [[hiragana]].&lt;ref name="HoLai1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ho |first1=Connie Suk-Han|last2=Lai|first2=Daphne Ngar-Chi|title=Naming-speed deficits and phonological memory deficits in Chinese developmental dyslexia|journal=Learning and Individual Differences |volume=11|issue=2 |year=1999|pages=173–186 |issn=1041-6080 |doi=10.1016/S1041-6080(00)80004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kobayashi MS, Haynes CW, Macaruso P, Hook PE, Kato J |title=Effects of mora deletion, nonword repetition, rapid naming, and visual search performance on beginning reading in Japanese |journal=Ann Dyslexia |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=105–28 |date=June 2005 |pmid=16107782 |doi= 10.1007/s11881-005-0006-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAN testing has been shown to be effective in testing reader’s [[fluency]] in languages with [[Orthography|orthographically]] transparent [[Alphabet|alphabetic scripts]] such as [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Heinz|last2=Mayringer|first2=Heinz|last3=Landerl|first3=Karin|title=The double-deficit hypothesis and difficulties in learning to read a regular orthography.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=92 |issue=4|year=2000 |pages=668–680 |issn=1939-2176|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.92.4.668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timed reading tests of poor readers of transparent [[Orthography|orthographies]] show very few reading errors; their main reading problem is slow, laborious decoding for words that are automatically read by their peers. This was also found for other readers in languages with consistent [[Orthography|orthographies]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"/&gt; English is an inconsistent [[orthography]] because it has poor [[Phonemic orthography|letter sound correspondences]]. English [[orthography]] and  [[Orthography of French|French orthography]] are also inconsistent because of their use of silent letters.&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"/&gt;

It has been found that continuous rapid naming of a list, compared to naming of single items, is easier for nondyslexic readers than it is for [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]] ones.&lt;ref name="JonesBranigan2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Manon W.|last2=Branigan|first2=Holly P.|last3=Kelly|first3=M. Louise|title=Dyslexic and nondyslexic reading fluency: Rapid automatized naming and the importance of continuous lists|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=16|issue=3|year=2009|pages=567–572|issn=1069-9384|doi=10.3758/PBR.16.3.567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Wimmer, Mayringer and Landerl (2000) suggest that the diagnosis of [[dyslexia]] in English readers often overlooks naming-speed deficit and that most studies rely on poor word recognition to diagnose [[reading disability]].&lt;ref name="Wimmer, Mayringer, 2000"/&gt;

==Types of RAN Testing==
Rapid automatized naming can be used in many different ways. One of its strengths is flexibility in what types of stimuli categories it uses. Different categories consist of colors, digits, objects and letters.&lt;ref name="Arnell, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arnell KM, Joanisse MF, Klein RM, Busseri MA, Tannock R |title=Decomposing the relation between Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) and reading ability |journal=Can J Exp Psychol |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=173–84 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19739900 |doi=10.1037/a0015721 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers use RAN to test [[Orthography|orthographic]] interpretation and [[phonological awareness]]. Two RAN tests are the CTOPP and TOWRE.&lt;ref name="FurnesSamuelsson2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnes|first1=Bjarte|last2=Samuelsson|first2=Stefan|title=Phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming predicting early development in reading and spelling: Results from a cross-linguistic longitudinal study|journal=Learning and Individual Differences |volume=21 |issue=1|year=2011 |pages=85–95 |issn=1041-6080|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2010.10.005|pmc=3045196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two formats of RAN testing are used, discrete and serial testing.

===Serial Testing===
Using a serial testing method, participants are shown a row or column of [[symbol]]s and must name the symbols sequentially as fast as possible. An assumption made of serial RAN testing is that it consists of two components: [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] time (the mean time it takes to articulate the symbol), and  pause time (the mean length of time between naming two adjacent symbols).  When referring to pause time, this can include [[Saccade|saccadic eye movements]], disengagement from previously named symbols and focusing on upcoming symbols.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Jong|first1=Peter F.|title=What Discrete and Serial Rapid Automatized Naming Can Reveal About Reading|journal=Scientific Studies of Reading|volume=15|issue=4|year=2011|pages=314–337|issn=1088-8438|doi=10.1080/10888438.2010.485624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrete Testing===
Using the discrete testing method, participants are shown symbols individually usually on a computer screen. In discrete RAN testing each individual symbols' naming latency is measured. The naming latency consists of the mean time from presentation to articulation of symbol. It is scored using the mean naming latency of all symbols. Some theorists believe that discrete RAN testing reflects the retrieval of [[Phonology|phonological code]] from [[memory]] which can also be referred to as lexical access speed.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt;

Some researchers argue that discrete testing is a better method because of individual differences in the reading speed of a list of sight words; the relationship of RAN and reading will be stronger if sight word reading speed is measured by discrete presentation.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Today RAN is frequently used as a clinical instrument for diagnosing [[Reading disability|reading disabilities]] in children. It is often used to predict category membership in reading group sub-types. Some concerns with diagnosis using rapid automatized naming arise because it assesses a wide range of [[Cognition|cognitive skills]]. Speed and accuracy can be influenced by many different processing mechanisms and variables, including the perceived speed of the object to be named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ben-Haim|first1=Moshe Shay|last2=Chajut|first2=Eran|last3=Hassin|first3=Ran|last4=Algom|first4=Daniel|title=Speeded naming or naming speed? The automatic effect of object speed on performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=April 2015|volume=2|issue=144|pages=326–338|doi=10.1037/a0038569|pmid=25559652|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/144/2/326/|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is identifying which cognitive mechanisms are shared with reading. It is not clear whether RAN is testing [[Orthography|orthographic knowledge]] or whether it is testing phonological processing.&lt;ref name="Arnell, 2009"/&gt;

==Theories==
The role RAN plays in testing reading ability is contentious. Research supports the use of RAN as a measure of phonological processing, as a measure of [[Orthography|orthographic processing]] and integration, and as a measure of reading ability. It has been suggested that RAN may link to reading because reading depends on object-naming circuits in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] that are recruited in reading to underpin word-recognition abilities.&lt;ref name="Lervåg, 2009"/&gt;

===Orthographic and/or Phonological Processing===
Little is known about the mediator variable between [[phonological awareness]] and RAN and the relationship between [[phonological awareness]] and RAN.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanson|first1=H. L.|last2=Trainin|first2=G. |last3=Necoechea |first3=D. M.|last4=Hammill|first4=D. D.|title=Rapid Naming, Phonological Awareness, and Reading: A Meta-Analysis of the Correlation Evidence|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=73 |issue=4|year=2003 |pages=407–440|issn=0034-6543 |doi=10.3102/00346543073004407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers argue that RAN tests "the ability to retrieve phonological representations rapidly from long-term memory".&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt; Part of this view consists of RAN as tapping into the phonological system  by measuring the rate of retrieval of phonological information in long term memory. "The theoretical underpinnings being that, beyond the precision or accuracy of the grapheme–phoneme representations itself, rapid access to phonological representations is the main prerequisite to develop automaticity in reading a transparent writing system".&lt;ref name="FurnesSamuelsson2011"/&gt;

Others however dispute the link between RAN testing and phonological processing. They argue that [[phonological awareness]] is more strongly  related  to  pure  decoding ability, whereas  naming  speed  appears to be  more  strongly related to [[Fluency|reading fluency]].&lt;ref name="Schatschneider, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schatschneider C, Carlson CD, Francis DJ, Foorman BR, Fletcher JM |title=Relationship of rapid automatized naming and phonological awareness in early reading development: implications for the double-deficit hypothesis |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=245–56 |year=2002 |pmid=15493321 |doi=10.1177/002221940203500306  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other researchers view RAN as a sub-process of [[phonological awareness]]. In this view RAN is seen as a task that draws on accessing phonological codes for effective execution.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt; Although the relationship between RAN and [[phonological awareness]] is [[monotonic]], these measures do not produce uniform changes. Instead, as reading skills increase or decrease, RAN and [[phonological awareness]] skills do not change uniformly.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt;

An alternative view is that RAN plays a larger role in measuring [[Orthography|orthographic processing]]. Here RAN is believed to measure processes that are important in gaining [[Orthography|orthographic representations]].&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt; Studies have been conducted where RAN has been seen to measure reading of different kinds of words. These researchers argue that  "the relationship of RAN with reading should be higher if the reading task requires more [[Orthography|orthographic knowledge]]." The results of some studies tend to support this prediction as stronger relationships were found with exception word reading.&lt;ref name="de Jong2011"/&gt;

Still other studies focus on the relationship between phonological processing and [[Orthography|orthographic processing]]. "The fact that RAN as a predictor of reading and spelling was not affected by [[Orthography|orthographic]] regularity seems to suggest that RAN is a compound skill that consists of several sub-processes that are related to early literacy development. These processes might very well imply both [[Orthography|orthographical]] and phonological skills".&lt;ref name="FurnesSamuelsson2011"/&gt;

===Reading Ability===
There are several theories why rapid automatized naming is associated with reading abilities. One suggestion is that they both exploit the speed with which [[phonological]] representations are retrieved from [[long-term memory]]. Another related theory is that both depend on variations in the rate of development of a general cognitive speed of information processing.&lt;ref name="Kail, Hall, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kail|first1=Robert|last2=Hall|first2=Lynda K.|title=Processing speed, naming speed, and reading.|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=30 |issue=6|year=1994 |pages=949–954 |issn=0012-1649|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.30.6.949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kail, Hall, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kail|first1=Robert|last2=Hall|first2=Lynda K.|last3=Caskey|first3=Bradley J.|title=Processing speed, exposure to print, and naming speed|journal=Applied Psycholinguistics|volume=20|issue=02|year=1999|issn=0142-7164|doi=10.1017/S0142716499002076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence exists that RAN’s contribution to reading ability decreases as we age. Longitudinal studies report that the contribution of naming speed to reading skills after grade 3 diminishes, whereas the contribution of [[phonological awareness]] remains constant.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt;

The validity of RAN in measuring reading ability is based on three assumptions.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt; First, that RAN deficits and phonological deficits are independent of one another. Secondly, the relationship between RAN and [[phonological awareness]] varies according to reading maturity. Finally, naming speed is a complex process involving processes beyond the phonological system.

Labelling RAN as a measure of reading ability ignores many complexities of the task. Schatschneider et al. argue "that rapid naming tasks are composed of [[attention]]al, [[Visual system|visual]], [[Lexicon|lexical]], [[Temporal lobe|temporal]], and [[Memory|recognition]] sub-processes that all contribute to naming speed performance. Lumping all these sub-processes under the category of phonological processes obscures the complexity of rapid naming tasks. Such a hypothesis is consistent with the finding that naming speed tasks consistently account for variance in early reading skills beyond that accounted for by measures of phonemic awareness".&lt;ref name="Schatschneider, 2002"/&gt;

Another viewpoint is that rapid automatized naming directly relates to differences in reading competence. Supporting this is the fact that the ability to rapidly name digits and letters predicts reading better than rapidly naming colors and objects.  This suggests a difference due to differences in experience with letters. However, rapid automatized naming of colors, objects, numbers and letters measured in children before they learn to read predicts later differences in reading skill, while early differences in reading ability do not predict later differences in rapid automatized naming.&lt;ref name="Lervåg, 2009"/&gt;

===Double Deficit Hypothesis===
It has been proposed that [[dyslexia]] is due to a "[[Double deficit (education)|double-deficit hypothesis]]" in which phonological deficits and naming-speed deficits are two separate causes of reading problems, such that when they are combined, they produce a greater dyslexic defect than would be produced by either deficit individually.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Wolf, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowers|first1=Patricia Greig|last2=Wolf|first2=Maryanne|title=Theoretical links among naming speed, precise timing mechanisms and orthographic skill in dyslexia |journal=Reading and Writing |volume=5 |issue=1|year=1993 |pages=69–85 |issn=0922-4777 |doi=10.1007/BF01026919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf, Bowers, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf |first1=Maryanne |last2=Bowers|first2=Patricia Greig|title=The double-deficit hypothesis for the developmental dyslexias.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=3 |year=1999|pages=415–438|issn=0022-0663|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.3.415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The double-deficit hypothesis suggests that RAN and [[phonological awareness]] operate as independent systems that are equally important in word identification. This model is based on literature showing that phonological disabilities and naming speed-deficits underlie some forms of reading disabilities. In the case of modest or severe reading disability, the concurrence of both a phonological deficit and rapid naming deficit characterizes the most difficult forms of reading disabilities. These individuals score lowest on reading measures.&lt;ref name="Swanson, Trainin, 2003"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15139">'''Religious skepticism''' is a type of [[skepticism]] relating to [[religion]]. Religious skeptics question religious authority and are not necessarily [[Antireligion|anti-religious]] but skeptical of specific or all religious beliefs and/or practices. [[Socrates]] was one of the most prominent and first religious skeptics of whom there are records; he questioned the legitimacy of the beliefs of his time in the existence of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek gods]]. Religious skepticism is not the same as [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]] and some religious skeptics are [[Deism|deists]].

== Overview ==

The word [[skeptic]] (sometimes [[sceptic]]) is derived from the middle [[French language|French]] ''sceptique'' or the [[Latin-language|Latin]] ''scepticus'', literally "sect of the sceptics". Its origin is in the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''skeptikos'', meaning inquiring, reflective or one that doubts.{{R|"defined"}} As such, religious skepticism generally refers to doubting or questioning something about religion. Although, as noted by [[J. L. Schellenberg|Schellenberg]] the term is sometimes more generally applied to anyone that has a negative view of religion.{{R|"schellenberg2"}}

The earliest beginnings of religious skepticism can be traced back to [[Xenophanes]]. He critiqued popular religion of his time, particularly false conceptions of the divine that are a byproduct of the human propensity to [[anthropomorphize]] deities. He took the scripture of his time to task for painting the gods in a negative light and promoted a more rational view of religion. He was very critical of religious people privileging their belief system over others without sound reason{{R|"xenophanes"}}{{R|"vogt"}}

The majority of skeptics are agnostics and atheists but there are also a number of religious people that are skeptical of religion.{{R|"sturgess"}} The religious are generally skeptical about claims of other religions, at least when the two denominations conflict concerning some stated belief. Some philosophers put forth the sheer diversity of religion as a justification for skepticism by theists and non-theists alike.{{R|"schellenberg3"}} Theists are also generally skeptical of the claims put forth by atheists.{{R|"mann"}}

[[Michael Shermer]] wrote that religious skepticism is a process for discovering the truth rather than general non-acceptance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} For this reason a religious skeptic might believe that [[Jesus]] existed while questioning claims that he was the messiah or performed miracles (see [[historicity of Jesus]]). [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s ''[[The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth]]'', a literal cut and paste of the [[New Testament]] that removes anything [[supernatural]], is a prominent example.

=== Modern religious skepticism ===

The term has morphed into one that typically emphasizes scientific and historical methods of evidence. There are some skeptics that question whether religion is a viable topic for criticism given that it doesn't require proof for belief. Others, however, insist it is as much as any other knowledge. Especially when it makes claims that contradict those made by science.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"kurtz"}}

There has been much work since the late 20th century by philosophers such as Schellenburg and [[Paul Moser|Moser]] and both have written numerous books pertaining to the topic.{{R|"schellenbergbooks"}}{{R|"moserbooks"}} Much of their work has focused on defining what religion is and specifically what people are skeptical of about it.{{R|"moser2007"}}{{R|"schellenberg2"}} The work of others have argued for the viability of religious skepticism by appeal to higher-order evidence (evidence about our evidence and our capacities for evaluation),{{R|"king"}} what some call meta-evidence.{{R|"wykstra"}}

There are still echos of early Greek skepticism in the way some current thinkers question the intellectual viability of belief in the divine.{{R|"penner"}}

In modern times there is a certain amount of mistrust and lack of acceptance of religious skeptics, particularly towards those that are also atheists.{{R|"hughes"}}{{R|"zuckerman"}}{{R|"edgell"}} This is coupled with concerns many skeptics have about the government in countries, such as the [[U.S.A.]], where [[separation of church and state]] are central tenants.{{R|"coskun"}}

== Selected historical occurrences ==

[[Socrates]] was raised in polytheistic society in which the gods were not omnipotent and required sacrifice and ritual. Socrates' conception of the divine was that they always benevolent, truthful, authoritative, and wise. Divinity was to operate within the standards of rationality.{{R|"socrates"}} This critique ultimately resulted in his [[Trial of Socrates|trial for impiety and corruption]] as documented in [[Apology (Plato)|The Apology]].

In ancient India, there was a materialist philosophical school called the [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]], who were known as being skeptical of the religious claims of [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], its rituals and texts.

The historian [[Will Durant]] writes that [[Plato]] was "as skeptical of atheism as of any other dogma."{{R|"durant"}}{{R|"vogt"}}

[[Democritus]] was the father of [[Materialism]] and there is no trace of a belief in afterlife in his work. Specifically in ''Those in Hades'' he refers to constituents of the soul as atoms that dissolve upon death.{{R|"Ferwerda"}}

In [[De Natura Deorum]] the Roman statesman [[Cicero]] calls into question the character of the gods, whether or not they participate in earthly affairs, and questions their existence. This a significant evolution from his earlier writings wherein he was more accommodating to religion{{R|"verhine"}}

In the poem [[De rerum natura]] [[Lucretius]] introduces [[epicurean]] philosophy to the Romans and proclaims that the universe operates according to physical principles and guided by ''fortuna'', or chance, instead of the [[Roman gods]].{{R|"lucretius"}}

[[Thomas Hobbes]] took positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings. He argued repeatedly that there are no [[incorporeal]] substances, and that all things, even [[God]], [[heaven]], and [[hell]] are [[Matter|corporeal]], matter in motion. He argued that "though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity".{{R|"lawler"}}

[[Voltaire]], although himself a deist, was a forceful critic of religion and advocated for acceptance of all religions as well as separation of church and state.{{R|"Pomeau"}}

'''Richard Bentley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|t|l|i}}; 27 January 1662 – 14 July 1742) was an English [[Classics|classical scholar]], critic, and theologian. He was Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].

Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] learning and was known for his literary and textual criticism. Called the "founder of historical [[philology]]", Bentley is credited with the creation of the English school of [[Hellenism (Academia)|Hellenism]], and introduced the first competitive written examinations in a Western university.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Richard Bentley blue plaque Bentley Square Oulton.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque on Bentley Square, Oulton]]
Bentley was born at [[Oulton, West Yorkshire|Oulton]] near [[Rothwell, West Yorkshire|Rothwell]], [[Leeds]], West Yorkshire, in northern England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}} A blue plaque near his birthplace commemorates the fact. His father was Thomas Bentley of Oulton. His grandfather, Captain James Bentley,{{citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=for both his father and Grandfather's names}} had suffered for the [[Charles I of England|Royalist]] cause following the [[English Civil War]], leaving the family in reduced circumstances. Bentley's mother, the daughter of a [[stonemason]], had some education, and was able to give her son his first lessons in [[Latin language|Latin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

After attending [[grammar school]] in [[Wakefield]], Bentley was an undergraduate at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in 1676.{{efn|His portrait hangs in the formal dining hall of the College.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}}} He afterwards obtained a scholarship and took the degree of B.A. in 1680 (M.A. 1683).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}{{sfn|ACAD|BNTY676R}}

==Academic work==
He never became a [[Fellow]], but was appointed to be the headmaster of [[Spalding Grammar School]] before he was 21. [[Edward Stillingfleet]], dean of St Paul's, hired Bentley as tutor to his son, which enabled the younger man to meet eminent scholars, have access to the best private library in England, and become familiar with Dean Stillingfleet. During his six years as tutor, Bentley also made a comprehensive study of [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin writers, storing up knowledge which he used later.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

In 1689, Stillingfleet became [[bishop of Worcester]], and Bentley's pupil went to [[Wadham College, Oxford]], accompanied by his tutor. Bentley soon met [[John Mill (theologian)|Dr John Mill]], [[Humphrey Hody]], and [[Edward Bernard]]. Here he studied the manuscripts of the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]], [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]] and other college libraries. He collected material for literary studies. Among these are a corpus of the fragments of the Greek poets and an edition of the Greek [[lexicographer]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

The Oxford (Sheldonian) press was about to bring out an edition (the ''[[editio princeps]]'') from the unique manuscript of the ''[[Greek Chronicle]]'' in the [[Bodleian Library]]. It was a [[universal history]] (down to AD 560) of John of Antioch (date uncertain, between 600 and 1000), called [[John Malalas]] or "John the Rhetor". The editor, Dr John Mill, principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], asked Bentley to review it and make any remarks on the text.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

Bentley wrote the ''Epistola ad Johannem Millium'', which is about 100 pages included at the end of the ''Oxford Malalas'' (1691). This short treatise placed Bentley ahead of all living English scholars. The ease with which he restored corrupted passages, the certainty of his [[:wikt:emendation|emendation]] and command over the relevant material, are in a style totally different from the careful and laborious learning of [[Humphrey Hody|Hody]], Mill or [[Edmund Chilmead]]. To the small circle of classical students (lacking the great critical dictionaries of modern times), it was obvious that he was a critic beyond the ordinary.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

[[Image:Bust of Richard Bently by Louis-François Roubiliac.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of Bentley now stands in the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
In 1690, Bentley had taken [[deacon]]'s orders. In 1692 he was nominated first [[Boyle Lectures|Boyle lecturer]], a nomination repeated in 1694. He was offered the appointment a third time in 1695 but declined it, as he was involved in too many other activities. In the first series of lectures ("A Confutation of Atheism"), he endeavours to present [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[physics]] in a popular form, and to frame them (especially in opposition to [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]) into proof of the existence of an intelligent Creator. He had some correspondence with Newton, then living in [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on the subject. The second series, preached in 1694, has not been published and is believed to be lost.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

After being [[ordain]]ed, Bentley was promoted to a [[prebendal stall]] in [[Worcester Cathedral]]. In 1693 the curator of the royal library became vacant, and his friends tried to obtain the position for Bentley, but did not have enough influence. The new librarian, a Mr Thynne, resigned in favour of Bentley, on condition that he receive an annuity of £130 for life out of the £200 salary. In 1695 Bentley received a royal [[chaplaincy]] and the [[Benefice|living]] of [[Hartlebury]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

That same year, he was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], and in 1696 earned the degree of D.D. (Doctor of Divinity). The scholar [[Johann Georg Graevius]] of [[Utrecht]] made a dedication to him, prefixed to a dissertation on [[Albert Rubens (1614-1657)|Albert Rubens]], ''De Vita Fl. Mallii Theodori'' (1694).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

===Dissertation on the ''Epistles'' of Phalaris===
Bentley had official apartments in [[St. James's Palace]], and his first care was the royal library. He worked to restore the collection from a dilapidated condition. He persuaded the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]] to ask for additional rooms in the palace for the books. This was granted, but Marlborough kept them for personal use. Bentley enforced the law, ensuring that publishers delivered nearly 1000 volumes which had been purchased but not delivered.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

The [[University of Cambridge]] commissioned him to obtain Greek and Latin fonts for their classical books; he had these made in Holland. He assisted [[John Evelyn]] in his ''Numismata''. Bentley did not settle down to the steady execution of any of the major projects he had started. In 1694, he designed an edition of [[Philostratus]], but abandoned it to Gottfried Olearius (1672–1715), "to the joy," says [[Friedrich August Wolf|F. A. Wolf]], "of Olearius and of no one else." He supplied [[Graevius]] with collations of [[Cicero]], and [[Joshua Barnes]] with a warning as to the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Euripides]]. Barnes printed the epistles anyway and declared that no one could doubt their authenticity but a man ''perfrictae frontis aut judicii imminuti''. For Graevius's ''Callimachus'' (1697), Bentley added a collection of the fragments with notes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

He wrote the ''Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris'' (1699), his major academic work, almost accidentally. In 1697, [[William Wotton]], about to bring out a second edition of his ''Ancient and Modern Learning'', asked Bentley to write out a paper exposing the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Phalaris]], long a subject of academic controversy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} The [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] editor of Phalaris, [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery|Charles Boyle]], resented Bentley's paper. He had already quarrelled with Bentley in trying to get the manuscript in the royal library collated for his edition (1695). Boyle wrote a response which was accepted by the reading public, although it was much later criticised as showing superficial learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} cites Dr [[Alexander Dyce]], ''Bentley's Works, 1836–1838''&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for Boyle's book required a second printing. When Bentley responded, it was with his dissertation. The truth of its conclusions was not immediately recognised, but it has a high reputation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

===Master of Trinity College===
In 1700, the commissioners of ecclesiastical [[patronage]] recommended Bentley to the Crown for the mastership of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He arrived an outsider and proceeded to reform the college administration.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} He started a programme of renovations to the buildings, and used his position to promote learning. He is also credited by the British mathematician [[Rouse Ball]]{{sfn|Ball|1835|p=193}}  with starting the first written examinations in the West in 1702, all those prior to this being oral in nature.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} At the same time, he antagonised the fellows, and the capital programme caused reductions in their incomes, which they resented.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

After ten years of stubborn but ineffectual resistance, the fellows appealed to the Visitor, the [[bishop of Ely]] ([[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]]). Their petition was full of general complaints. Bentley's reply (''The Present State of Trinity College'', etc., 1710) is in his most crushing style. The fellows amended their petition and added a charge of Bentley's having committed 54 breaches of the statutes. Bentley appealed directly to the Crown, and backed his application with a dedication of his ''[[Horace]]'' to the lord treasurer (Harley).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

The Crown lawyers decided against him; the case was heard (1714) and a sentence of expulsion from the mastership was drawn up. Before it was executed, the bishop of Ely died and the process lapsed. The feud continued in various forms at lower levels. In 1718 Cambridge rescinded Bentley's degrees, as punishment for failing to appear in the vice-chancellor's court in a civil suit. It was not until 1724 that he had them restored under the law.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

In 1733 the fellows of Trinity again brought Bentley to trial before the bishop of Ely (then [[Thomas Green (bishop)|Thomas Greene]]), and he was sentenced to deprivation. The college statutes required the sentence to be exercised by the vice-master [[Richard Walker (philosopher)|Richard Walker]], who was a friend of Bentley and refused to act. Although the feud continued until 1738 or 1740 (about thirty years in all), Bentley remained in his post.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

===Later studies===
During his mastership, except for the first two years, Bentley continuously pursued his studies, although he did not publish much. In 1709 he contributed a critical appendix to [[John Davies (1679–1732)|John Davies]]'s edition of [[Cicero]]'s ''Tusculan Disputations''. In the following year, he published his emendations on the ''Plutus'' and ''Nubes'' of [[Aristophanes]], and on the fragments of [[Menander]] and [[Philemon (poet)|Philemon]]. He published the last work under the pen name of "Phileleutherus Lipsiensis."  He used it again two years later in his ''Remarks on a late Discourse of Freethinking'', a reply to [[Anthony Collins]] the [[deism|deist]]. The university thanked him for this work and its support of the Anglican Church and clergy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

Although he had long studied Horace, Bentley wrote his version quickly in the end, publishing it in 1711 to gain public support at a critical period of the Trinity quarrel. In the preface, he declared his intention of confining his attention to criticism and correction of the text. Some of his 700 or 800 [[:wikt:emendations|emendations]] have been accepted, but the majority were rejected by the early 20th century as unnecessary, although scholars acknowledged they showed his wide learning.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

In 1716, in a letter to [[William Wake]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Bentley announced his plan to prepare a critical edition of the [[New Testament]]. During the next four years, assisted by [[J. J. Wetstein]], an eminent biblical critic, he collected materials for the work. In 1720 he published ''Proposals for a New Edition of the Greek Testament'', with examples of how he intended to proceed. By comparing the text of the [[Vulgate]] with that of the oldest Greek manuscripts, Bentley proposed to restore the Greek text as received by the church at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]].&lt;!--EB1911 p. 752; states Nice not Nicaea--&gt;{{sfn|Dyce|1966|p=487}} Bentley's lead manuscript was ''[[Codex Alexandrinus]]'', which he described as "the oldest and best in the world".{{sfn|Jebb|1882|p=163}} Bentley used also manuscripts: [[Minuscule 51|51]], [[Minuscule 54|54]], [[Minuscule 60|60]], [[Minuscule 113|113]], [[Minuscule 440|440]], [[Minuscule 507|507]], and [[Minuscule 508|508]].{{sfn|Scrivener|1894|p=198}} [[John Walker (scholar)|John Walker]] worked over many manuscripts for the project, particularly in Paris with the help of the [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Maur]]ists.{{sfn|Wordsworth|1901|p=}} Numerous subscribers were obtained to support publication of the work, but he never completed it.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

His ''[[Terence]]'' (1726) is more important than his ''Horace''; next to the ''Phalaris'', this most determined his reputation. In 1726 he also published the ''Fables'' of [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] and the ''Sententiae'' of [[Publilius Syrus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

His ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1732), suggested by [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]], has been criticised as the weakest of his work. He suggested that the poet [[John Milton]] had employed both an [[amanuensis]] and an editor, who were responsible for clerical errors and interpolations, but it is unclear whether Bentley believed his own position.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} [[A. E. Housman]], who called him "the greatest scholar that England or perhaps that Europe ever bred" nevertheless criticised his poetic sensibility severely: "...we are not all so easily found out as Bentley, because we have not Bentley's intrepid candour. There is a sort of savage nobility about his firm reliance on his own bad taste...".{{sfn|Housman|1989|p=268}}

Bentley never published his planned edition of [[Homer]], but some of his manuscript and marginal notes are held by Trinity College. Their chief importance is in his attempt to restore the metre by the insertion of the lost ''[[digamma]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Relationships and personal life==
According to the anonymous author of his biography in the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] Bentley was self-assertive and presumptuous, which alienated some people. But, [[James Henry Monk]], Bentley's biographer, charged him (in his first edition, 1830) with an indecorum of which he was not guilty. Bentley seemed to inspire mixed feelings of admiration and repugnance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Marriage and family==
In 1701, Bentley married Joanna (died 1740), daughter of [[Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet]] of Brampton, [[Huntingdonshire]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|Collins|1741|p=364}}  They had three children together:
*[[Richard Bentley (writer)|Richard]] (1708–1782), an eccentric, playwright and artist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|''SoPSE''}}{{sfn|Radcliffe|2011}}, and two daughters, one named Johanna.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} {{efn|A portrait, by [[William Wissing]] of his wife Joanna, is in the collection of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] {{harv|ArtUK}}.}}

His daughter{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} Johanna Bentley{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} married [[Denison Cumberland]] in 1728, a grandson of [[Richard Cumberland (bishop)|Richard Cumberland]] the [[bishop of Peterborough]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} and himself later a bishop of the [[Church of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}Their son [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] developed as a prolific dramatist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} while earning his living as a civil servant.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Later life==
In old age, Bentley continued to read; and enjoyed the society of his friends and several rising scholars, J Markland, John Taylor, and his nephews Richard and Thomas Bentley, with whom he discussed classical subjects. He died on the 14 July 1742 of [[pleurisy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Legacy and honours==
*Bentley left about £5,000 in his estate (which would have the buying power of nearly £500,000 in 2010{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*He bequeathed a few Greek manuscripts, brought from [[Mount Athos]], to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*He bequeathed his books and papers to his nephew Richard Bentley, a fellow of Trinity. At his own death in 1786, the younger Bentley left the papers to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*The [[British Museum]] eventually purchased the books, which in many cases had valuable manuscript notes, and holds them in its collection.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

According to the anonymous author of his biography in the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of classical learning. Before him there were only [[John Selden]], and, in a more restricted field, [[Thomas Gataker]] and [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]].
{{quote|Bentley inaugurated a new era of the art of criticism. He opened a new path. With him criticism attained its majority. Where scholars had hitherto offered suggestions and conjectures, Bentley, with unlimited control over the whole material of learning, gave decisions|Jacob Mähly (1828–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cites {{harv| Mähly|1868}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The modern German school of [[philology]] recognised his genius. Bunsen wrote that Bentley "was the founder of historical philology." [[Jakob Bernays]] says of his corrections of the ''Tristia'', "corruptions which had hitherto defied every attempt even of the mightiest, were removed by a touch of the fingers of this British [[Samson]]".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

Bentley was credited with creating the English school of Hellenists, by which the 18th century was distinguished, including scholars such as [[Richard Dawes|R Dawes]], [[Jeremiah Markland|J Markland]], [[John Taylor (1704–1766)|John Taylor]], [[Jonathan Toup]], [[Thomas Tyrwhitt|T Tyrwhitt]], [[Richard Porson]], [[Peter Paul Dobree]], [[Thomas Kidd (classical scholar)|Thomas Kidd]] and [[James Henry Monk]]. Although the Dutch school of the period had its own tradition, it was also influenced by Bentley. His letters to [[Tiberius Hemsterhuis]] on his edition of [[Julius Pollux]] made the latter one of Bentley's most devoted admirers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

Bentley inspired a following generation of scholars. Self-taught, he created his own discipline; but no contemporary English guild of learning could measure his power or check his eccentricities. He defeated his academic adversaries in the Phalaris controversy. The attacks by [[Alexander Pope]] (he was assigned a niche in ''The Dunciad''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cite  Pope ''Dunciad'', b. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Arbuthnot]] and others demonstrated their inability to appreciate his work, as they considered textual criticism as pedantry.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} His classical controversies also called forth [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Battle of the Books]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In a university where the instruction of youth or the religious controversy of the day was the chief occupation, Bentley was unique. His learning and original views seem to have been developed before 1700. After this period, he acquired little and made only spasmodic efforts to publish.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} However A.E.Housman believed that the edition of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] (1739) was Bentley's greatest work.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Ringve Museum''' is [[Norway]]'s national [[museum]] for [[music]] and [[musical instruments]], with collections from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringve.com/English/ ''About Ringve'' (Ringve Museum)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514140102/http://www.ringve.com/English/ |date=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trondheim.com/ringve_museum/ ''Ringve Museum'' (Trondheim Local Authority)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515021504/http://www.trondheim.com/ringve_museum/ |date=2011-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Ringve Museum is located in the historic Ringve Farm in [[Trondheim]]. Ringve Farm was the childhood home of the Danish-Norwegian nobleman, [[Peter Tordenskjold]]. It is situated in a park on the [[Lade, Trondheim|Lade]] peninsula just outside [[Trondheim]] with a view over the [[Trondheimsfjord]], the park forming botanical gardens run by NTNU (the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]). The first house on the site was built in 1521, but the current group of buildings dates from the 1740s onwards. 

When the estate was auctioned in 1878, it was purchased by the Bachke family and one of the sons, Christian Anker Bachke (1873-1946) acquired the estate in 1919. In late 1919, he married Russian émigré [[Victoria Bachke|Victoria Rostin Bachke]], an artist who fled from the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. The couple had no children but put their considerable energies into their love of music and assembling a collection of historical musical instruments, which now numbers around 1,500 instruments, alongside other artifacts associated with music – pictures, recordings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asj.gr.jp/journal/pdf/museum08eng.pdf ''Victoria Bachke'' (Ringve Museum. U. Peter Svensson, Mats Krouthén)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is based on the private collection of founder Victoria Bachke and was opened to the public in 1952. Jon Voigt (1928-1997) succeeded Victoria Bachke as director in 1963 and continued until 1997. Over the years many famous musicians visited Ringve, including [[Artur Schnabel]], Lilly Krauss, [[Ignaz Friedman]], [[Percy Grainger]] and [[Kirsten Flagstad]], as well as the artist, [[Edvard Munch]].

==Exhibition==
[[File:Ringve Museum, Trondheim - IMG 8816.jpg|thumb|right|Ringve Museum manor house]]
The public exhibitions are divided in two parts: the Manor House and the Barn.

===The Manor House===
The period interiors of the Ringve Manor House provide the setting for themed rooms of working – mainly keyboard – instruments. In this section, open by guided tour only, the guides (often graduate music students) play an appropriate piece of music (or extract) as the tour proceeds.

The first room is called the Mozart room and contains a [[spinet]], [[clavichord]] and a domestic or house organ, from the 18th century. A [[Murano]] glass [[chandelier]] hangs from the ceiling.

The next room is called the ‘Beethoven’ and contains a harp piano of 1870 by Dietz, and a piano of type favoured by Beethoven.
A room dedicated to [[Chopin]] comes next, with examples of the composer’s preferred pianos, as well as a [[death mask]] and casts of his hands. There are also watercolours by [[George Sand]] and memorabilia about Chopin and [[Liszt]]. A card table and sofa that came from Chopin’s Paris home, and which were inherited by his Norwegian pupil Thomas Tellefsen are on display.
[[File:Ringve Museum, Trondheim - IMG 8809.jpg|thumb|left|Park in the English style]]

Upstairs there is a room based around singers Elisabeth Wiborg and [[Adelina Patti]] and includes a piano which Patti insisted on being accompanied. This is followed by a display of [[Hardanger fiddle]]s, a ‘[[Grieg]]’ room, a room of instruments associated with church and worship, and finally a room of curiosities, including a [[Cecilium]], a Norwegian-made [[barrel-organ]], musical toys and a [[Jankó keyboard|Janko]] piano.
===Fire===
[[File:Fire at the Ringve.jpg|alt=The Ringve Museum on fire|thumb|The Ringve Museum on fire]]
The manor was badly hit by a fire in the attic and second floor on 3 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsinenglish.no/2015/08/03/nightmare-fire-hits-music-museum/ "Nightmare Fire Hits Music Museum" - News In English]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Barn (Museet på Låven)===
The collections on display in the Barn are divided in two parts:
*Instruments mainly associated with western classical and popular music over four centuries. A Kirkman harpsichord of 1767, a Erberle viola d’amore of 1755, a five-octave Stein piano of 1783, a soprano saxophone by Sax (son) of 1907, along wide early electronic instruments and a 1948 [[jukebox]].
[[File:Ringve Museum, Trondheim - IMG 8764.jpg|thumb|right|Arboretum]]
*Folk instruments from all around the world, including a Runebomme (a type of Sami drum), a Tibetan zang-dang (horn), a nadomo (arched harp) from Congo and hardanger fiddles.

==Ringve Botanical Garden==
[[File:Ringve Museum, Trondheim - IMG 8800.jpg|thumb|left|Botanical garden]]
The Ringve Botanical Garden was established in 1973. The botanic garden has three main parts, the 19th-century garden, the arboretum, and the systematic section. The {{convert|32|acre|m2|adj=on}} botanical gardens consist of an [[arboretum]] (species from the Northern hemisphere) around a lake, a floral maze representing a systematic presentation of perennial plants, a Renaissance (herbal) Garden and, in front of the Manor House the historical ‘English’ garden of the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgci.org/resources/article/0177/ ''Ringve Botanical Garden'' (BGCI: The global network)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spitzer's Paper, 'An Examination of Wilhelm Reich's Demonstration of Orgone Energy'"], ''The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice'', Vol. 4, No. 1, Spring–Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Spitzer spent most of his career at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] as a Professor of Psychiatry until he retired in 2003.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; He was on the research faculty of the [[Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research]] where he retired after 49 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute to Robert L.

A colleague at Columbia has described him as an "iconoclast" who "looked for injustice".&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt;

=== Screening and Diagnostic Tools ===
Spitzer was a major architect of the modern [[classification of mental disorders]]. 
In 1968, he co-developed a computer program, ''Diagno I'', based on a logical [[decision tree]], that could derive a diagnosis from the scores on a Psychiatric Status Schedule which he co-published in 1970 and that the ''United States Steering Committee for the United States–United Kingdom Diagnostic Project'' used to check the consistency of its results.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;{{cite book|author=Cooper, J. E.|title=Psychiatric Diagnosis in New York and London |year=1972 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=0-19-712142-X|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}}

Spitzer was a member on the four-person ''United States Steering Committee for the United States–United Kingdom Diagnostic Project'', which published their results in 1972. They found the most important difference between countries was that the concept of [[schizophrenia]] used in New York was much broader than the one used in London, and included patients who would have been termed [[manic-depressive]] or [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]].&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;{{rp|vii}}

He developed psychiatric methods that focused on asking specific interview questions to get at a diagnosis as opposed to the [[open-ended question]]ing of psychoanalysis, which was the predominant technique of mental health.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; He codeveloped the [[Mood Disorders Questionnaire|Mood Disorder Questionnaire]] (MDQ), a screening technique used for diagnosing bipolar disorder. He also co-developed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PRIME-MD) which can be self-administered to find out if one has a mental illness.&lt;ref name=NYSPI /&gt;{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer RL, Kroenke K, Williams JB. Patient Health Questionnaire Primary Care Study Group. Validation and utility of a self-report version of the PRIME-MD: the PHQ primary care study. JAMA. 1999;282:1737–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The portions of PRIME-MD directed at depression (PHQ2 and PHQ9) have since become accepted in primary care medicine for screening and diagnosis of major depression as well as for monitoring response to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Am Fam Physician. 2012;85(2):139-144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manea, Laura L (01/2015). "A diagnostic meta-analysis of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ([[PHQ-9]]) algorithm scoring method as a screen for depression.". General hospital psychiatry (0163-8343), 37 (1), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Position on the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ===
In 1974, Spitzer became the chair of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s task force of the third edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' the so-called, ''[[DSM-III]]'' which was released in 1980. Spitzer is a major architect of the modern classification of mental disorders which involves classifying mental disorders in discrete categories with specified diagnostic criteria but later criticized what he saw as errors and excesses in the DSM's later versions, although he maintained his position that the ''DSM'' is still better than the alternatives.&lt;ref name=psychtimes/&gt;

In 2003, Spitzer co-authored a position paper with ''[[DSM-IV]]'' editor [[Michael First]], stating that the "''DSM'' is generally viewed as clinically useful" based on surveys from practicing professionals and feedback from medical students and residents, but that [[primary care]] physicians find the ''DSM'' too complicated for their use.  The authors emphasized that given then-current limitations in understanding psychiatric disorders, a multitude of ''DSM'' codes/diagnoses might apply to some patients, but that it would be a "total speculation" to assign a single diagnosis to a patient. The authors rejected calls to adopt the [[ICD-9]] because it lacked diagnostic criteria and would "[set] psychiatry back 30 years," while the [[ICD-10]], closely resembled the DSM-III-R classification.&lt;ref name=psychtimes&gt;{{cite web| last1= First | first1= Michael | first2= Robert L. | last2= Spitzer| url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/48541 | title= The ''DSM'': Not Perfect, but Better Than the Alternative| date= 1 April 2003 | work=[[Psychiatric Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a definitive autobiography of Spitzer, "The Making of DSM-III®: A Diagnostic Manual's Conquest of American Psychiatry", was published by author and historian Hannah S. Decker.

Spitzer was briefly featured in the 2007 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[The Trap (television documentary series)|The Trap]]'', in which he stated that the ''DSM'', by [[operational definition|operationalizing the definitions]] of mental disorders while paying little attention to the context in which the symptoms occur, may have [[Medicalization|medicalized]] the normal human experiences of a significant number of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Spitzer, Robert |title=The Trap|publisher=BBC via The Internet Archive|time=Part 2 at 34:10|date=March 2007|url=https://archive.org/details/AdamCurtis_TheTrap|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Spitzer had criticized the revision process of the ''[[DSM-5]]'' for lacking [[transparency (social)|transparency]].&lt;ref name=nyt081218&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/health/18psych.html?pagewanted=all|title=Psychiatrists Revise the Book of Human Troubles|first=Benedict|last=Carey|date=December 17, 2008|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also criticized specific proposals, like the proposed introduction of the [[psychosis risk syndrome]] for people who have mild symptoms found in psychotic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Stein | first=Rob|title=Revision to the bible of psychiatry, ''DSM'', could introduce new mental disorders| work= The Washington Post|date=10 February 2010|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/10/AR2010021000009.html|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On homosexuality===

Spitzer led a successful effort, in 1973, to stop treating homosexuality as a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/27/461175226/psychiatrist-who-played-major-role-in-destigmatizing-homosexuality-has-died Psychiatrist Who Played Major Role In Destigmatizing Homosexuality Dies : The Two-Way : NPR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/us/robert-spitzer-psychiatrist-who-set-rigorous-standards-for-diagnosis-dies-at-83.html Robert Spitzer, 83, Dies; Psychiatrist Set Rigorous Standards for Diagnosis - The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was partly due to Spitzer's efforts that homosexuality was "removed" (i.e. renamed as Sexual Orientation Disturbance) in 1974 [[DSM-II]]: "By withdrawing it from the manual, homosexuality was legitimized as a normal difference rather than a psychiatric behavior. This early powerful statement by institutional psychiatry that this is normal sped up the confidence of people in the movement."
&lt;ref name=lancet&gt;Alison Snyder. Robert L Spitzer. Obituary. The Lancet. Volume 387, Issue 10017, 30 January–5 February 2016, Page 428.
doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00182-3.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Spitzer delivered a controversial paper, "[[Can Some Gay Men and Lesbians Change Their Sexual Orientation?]]" at the 2001 annual APA meeting; he argued that it is possible that some highly motivated individuals could successfully [[sexual orientation change efforts|change their sexual orientation]] from homosexual to heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stolaf.edu/people/huff/classes/Psych130S2012/LabDocuments/Spitzer.pdf Can Some Gay Men and Lesbians Change Their Sexual Orientation? 200 Participants Reporting a Change from Homosexual to Heterosexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Washington Post'' article indicated that Spitzer held 45 min telephonic interviews with 200 people who claimed that their respective sexual orientations had changed from homosexual to heterosexual. Spitzer said he "began his study as a skeptic," but the study revealed that "66 percent of the men and 44 percent of the women had arrived at what [Spitzer] called good heterosexual functioning," defined as "being in a sustained, loving heterosexual relationship within the past year, getting enough satisfaction from the emotional relationship with their partner to rate at least seven on a 10-point scale, having satisfying heterosexual sex at least monthly and never or rarely thinking of somebody of the same sex during heterosexual sex."

Spitzer also found that "89 percent of men and 95 percent of women said they were bothered only slightly, or not at all, by unwanted homosexual feelings" but that "only 11 percent of the men and 37 percent of the women reported a complete absence of homosexual indicators, including same-sex attraction.... Some 43 percent of the sample had been referred to Spitzer by 'ex-gay ministries.... An additional 23 percent were referred by the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality." Spitzer has stated that his research "shows some people can change from gay to straight, and we ought to acknowledge that."&lt;ref name="Some Gays Can"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010509/aponline013921_000.htm | title=Study: Some Gays Can Go Straight | first= Malcolm | last = Ritter | work=The Washington Post | date=9 May 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering how difficult it had been to find 100 participants, and that they were considered the best cases of [[conversion therapy]], Spitzer concluded that although change could occur, it was probably very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ZwE6_dLweYo|Interview with Dr Spitzer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthwinsout.org/in-dr-robert-spitzers-own-words/ In Dr. Robert Spitzer's Own Words], TruthWinsOut.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The APA issued an official disavowal of Spitzer's paper, noting that it had not been peer reviewed and stating, "There is no published scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of [[reparative therapy]] as a treatment to change one's sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gayhealth.com/templates/1153405334669988619162/common/feature.html?record=552&amp;trycookie=1?record=552 Article]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928091622/http://www.gayhealth.com/templates/1153405334669988619162/common/feature.html?record=552&amp;trycookie=1%3Frecord%3D552 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, was published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior.

Two thirds of the reviews were critical, and the publication decision sparked controversy, with one member of the publication's supporting organization resigning in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=180133 |title=Storm over gay 'cure' |date=October 3, 2003 |first=Steve |last=Farrar |work=[[Times Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper has been criticized for its sampling methods and criteria for success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_spit.htm Analysis of Dr. Spitzer's study of reparative therapy], ReligiousTolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 interview, Spitzer stated, "Many colleagues were outraged" following the publication of the study. Spitzer added, "Within the gay community, there was initially tremendous anger and feeling that I had betrayed them." When asked whether he would consider a follow-up study, Spitzer said no and added that he felt "a little battle fatigue."&lt;ref name=TherIncor&gt;Leblanc, Douglas. Interview of Robert Spitzer. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/april/20.94.html "Therapeutically Incorrect: Atheist psychiatrist argues that gays can change"], ''Christianity Today'', 29 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While Spitzer has said that he has no way of knowing whether the study participants were being honest,&lt;ref name="Some Gays Can" /&gt; he has also indicated that he believed that the interviewees were being candid with him.&lt;ref name=TherIncor /&gt;

In a 2012 interview, Spitzer said he asked to retract the study and stated that he agreed with its critics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | url=http://prospect.org/article/my-so-called-ex-gay-life/
  | work=The American Prospect 
  | title=My So-Called Ex-Gay Life
  | date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: "In retrospect, I have to admit I think the critiques are largely correct," he said. "The findings can be considered evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more." He said he spoke with the editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior about writing a retraction, but the editor declined. (Repeated attempts to contact the journal went unanswered.)

In a letter to [[Kenneth J Zucker]], editor of ''Journal of Sexual Behavior'', Spitzer wrote:
{{quote|"Several months ago I told you that because of my revised view of my 2001 study of reparative therapy changing sexual orientation, I was considering writing something that would acknowledge that I now judged the major critiques of the study as largely correct. After discussing my revised view of the study with Gabriel Arana, a reporter for ''American Prospect', and with Malcolm Ritter, an [[Associated Press]] science writer, I decided that I had to make public my current thinking about the study. Here it is.
&lt;br&gt;"'''Basic Research Question.''' From the beginning it was: “can some version of reparative therapy enable individuals to change their sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual?” Realizing that the study design made it impossible to answer this question, I suggested that the study could be viewed as answering the question, “how do individuals undergoing reparative therapy describe changes in sexual orientation?” – a not very interesting question.
&lt;br&gt;"'''The Fatal Flaw in the Study – There was no way to judge the credibility of subject reports of change in sexual orientation.''' I offered several (unconvincing) reasons why it was reasonable to assume that the subject’s reports of change were credible and not self-deception or outright lying. But the simple fact is that there was no way to determine if the subject’s accounts of change were valid.&lt;br&gt;I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy. I also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works with some “highly motivated” individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Emotion}}
'''Social rejection''' occurs when an individual is deliberately excluded from a [[interpersonal relationship|social relationship]] or [[social interaction]]. The topic includes ''interpersonal rejection'' (or peer rejection), ''romantic rejection'' and ''familial estrangement''. A person can be rejected by individuals or an entire group of people. Furthermore, rejection can be either ''active'', by [[bullying]], [[teasing]], or ridiculing, or ''[[passive-aggressive behaviour|passive]]'', by ignoring a person, or giving the "[[silent treatment]]". The experience of being rejected is [[subjectivity|subjective]] for the recipient, and it can be [[perception|perceived]] when it is not actually present. The word [[ostracism]] is often used for the process (in [[Ancient Greece]] ostracism was voting into temporary exile).{{failed verification|date=February 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;ostracize. Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ostracize (accessed: November 17, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[humans]] are [[society|social]] beings, some level of rejection is an inevitable part of life. Nevertheless, rejection can become a problem when it is prolonged or consistent, when the relationship is important, or when the individual is highly sensitive to rejection. Rejection by an entire [[group (sociology)|group]] of people can have especially negative effects, particularly when it results in [[social isolation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Kipling D. |author2=Joseph P. Forgas |author3=William von Hippel  | title = The Social Outcast: Ostracism, Social Exclusion, Rejection, and Bullying | publisher = Psychology Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-84169-424-5 | page = 366 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of rejection can lead to a number of adverse psychological consequences such as [[loneliness]], low [[self-esteem]], [[aggression]], and [[clinical depression|depression]].&lt;ref name="McDougall, P. 2001 pp. 213-247"&gt;McDougall, P., Hymel, S., Vaillancourt, T., &amp; Mercer, L. (2001). The consequences of childhood rejection. In M. R. Leary (Ed.), ''Interpersonal rejection.'' (pp. 213-247). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also lead to feelings of insecurity and a heightened sensitivity to future rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richman|first=Laura Smart|last2=Leary|first2=Mark R.|date=April 2009|title=Reactions to Discrimination, Stigmatization, Ostracism, and Other Forms of Interpersonal Rejection|journal=Psychological Review|volume=116|issue=2|pages=365–383|doi=10.1037/a0015250|issn=0033-295X|pmc=2763620|pmid=19348546|hdl=10161/11810}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Need for acceptance==

Rejection may be emotionally painful because of the social nature of human beings and the need of social interaction between other humans is essential. [[Abraham Maslow]] and other theorists have suggested that the need for love and [[belongingness]] is a fundamental human [[motivation]].&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. H. (1954). ''Motivation and personality''. New York, NY: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maslow, all humans, even [[introvert]]s, need to be able to give and receive affection to be psychologically healthy.

Psychologists believe that simple contact or social interaction with others is not enough to fulfill this need. Instead, people have a strong motivational drive to form and maintain caring interpersonal relationships. People need both stable relationships and satisfying interactions with the people in those relationships. If either of these two ingredients is missing, people will begin to feel lonely and unhappy.&lt;ref name="pmid7777651"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Baumeister RF, Leary MR | title=The need to belong: desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation | journal=Psychol Bull | year= 1995 | volume= 117 | issue= 3 | pages= 497–529 | pmid=7777651 | doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497| pmc= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, rejection is a significant threat. In fact, the majority of human [[anxiety|anxieties]] appear to reflect concerns over [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. F. | last2 = Tice | first2 = D. M. | year = 1990 | title = Anxiety and social exclusion | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 165–195 | doi=10.1521/jscp.1990.9.2.165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a member of a group is also important for [[social identity]], which is a key component of the [[self-concept]]. Mark Leary of Duke University has suggested that the main purpose of [[self-esteem]] is to monitor social relations and detect social rejection. In this view, self-esteem is a [[sociometer]] which activates negative emotions when signs of exclusion appear.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R., Downs, D. L., (1995). Interpersonal functions of the self-esteem motive: The self-esteem system as a sociometer. In M. H. Kernis, ''Efficacy, agency, and self-esteem''. New York, NY: Plenum Press, pp. 123-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social psychology (psychology)|Social psychological]] research confirms the motivational basis of the need for acceptance. Specifically, fear of rejection leads to [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] to [[peer pressure]] (sometimes called normative influence), and [[social psychology (psychology)|compliance]] to the demands of others. Our need for affiliation and social interaction appears to be particularly strong when we are under stress.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==In childhood==

Peer rejection has been measured using [[sociometry]] and other rating methods. Studies typically show that some children are popular, receiving generally high ratings, many children are in the middle, with moderate ratings, and a minority of children are rejected, showing generally low ratings. One measure of rejection asks children to list peers they like and dislike. Rejected children receive few "like" nominations and many "dislike" nominations. Children classified as ''neglected'' receive few nominations of either type.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

According to Karen Bierman of Pennsylvania State University, most children who are rejected by their peers display one or more of the following behavior patterns:
#Low rates of [[altruism|prosocial]] behavior, e.g. taking turns, sharing.
#High rates of [[aggression|aggressive]] or disruptive behavior.
#High rates of inattentive, immature, or [[Impulsivity|impulsive]] behavior.
#High rates of [[social anxiety]].

Bierman states that well-liked children show [[social skills|social savvy]] and know when and how to join play groups. Children who are at risk for rejection are more likely to barge in disruptively, or hang back without joining at all. Aggressive children who are athletic or have good social skills are likely to be accepted by peers, and they may become ringleaders in the harassment of less skilled children. Minority children, children with disabilities, or children who have unusual characteristics or behavior may face greater risks of rejection. Depending on the norms of the peer group, sometimes even minor differences among children lead to rejection or neglect. Children who are less outgoing or simply prefer solitary play are less likely to be rejected than children who are socially inhibited and show signs of insecurity or anxiety.&lt;ref name="Bierman, K. L. 2003"&gt;Bierman, K. L. (2003). ''Peer rejection: Developmental processes and intervention strategies''. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bullying on Instituto Regional Federico Errázuriz (IRFE) in March 5, 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rejected children are more likely to be bullied at school and on playgrounds.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}]]

Peer rejection, once established, tends to be stable over time, and thus difficult for a child to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Cillessen, A., Bukowski, W. M., &amp; Haselager, G. (2000). ''Stability of sociometric categories''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that active rejection is more stable, more harmful, and more likely to persist after a child transfers to another school, than simple neglect.&lt;ref name="Bierman, K. L. 2003"/&gt; One reason for this is that peer groups establish reputational biases that act as [[stereotype]]s and influence subsequent social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hymel, S., Wagner, E., &amp; Butler, L. J. (1990). Reputational bias: View from the peer group. In S. R. Asher, &amp; J. D. Coie, (Eds.). ''Peer rejection in childhood''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when rejected and popular children show similar behavior and accomplishments, popular children are treated much more favorably.

Rejected children are likely to have lower [[self-esteem]], and to be at greater risk for ''internalizing'' problems like depression.&lt;ref name="McDougall, P. 2001 pp. 213-247"/&gt; Some rejected children display ''externalizing'' behavior and show [[aggression]] rather than depression. The research is largely correlational, but there is evidence of reciprocal effects. This means that children with problems are more likely to be rejected, and this rejection then leads to even greater problems for them. Chronic peer rejection may lead to a negative developmental cycle that worsens with time.&lt;ref&gt;Coie, J. D. (1990). Toward a theory of peer rejection. In S. R. Asher &amp; J. D. Coie (Eds). ''Peer rejection in childhood'' (pp. 365-401). Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejected children are more likely to be [[bullying|bullied]] and to have fewer friends than popular children, but these conditions are not always present. For example, some popular children do not have close friends, whereas some rejected children do. Peer rejection is believed to be less damaging for children with at least one close friend.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

An analysis of 15 [[school shootings]] between 1995 and 2001 found that peer rejection was present in all but two of the cases (87%). The documented rejection experiences included both acute and chronic rejection and frequently took the form of ostracism, bullying, and romantic rejection. The authors stated that although it is likely that the rejection experiences contributed to the school shootings, other factors were also present, such as depression, poor impulse control, and other psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leary | first1 = M.

There are programs available for helping children who suffer from social rejection. One large scale review of 79 controlled studies found that social skills training is very effective (''r'' = .40 effect size), with a 70% success rate, compared to 30% success in control groups. There was a decline in effectiveness over time, however, with follow-up studies showing a somewhat smaller effect size (''r'' = .35).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = B.

==In the laboratory==

Laboratory research has found that even short-term rejection from strangers can have powerful (if temporary) effects on an individual. In several social psychology [[experiment]]s, people chosen at random to receive messages of social exclusion become more aggressive, more willing to cheat, less willing to help others, and more likely to pursue short-term over long-term goals. Rejection appears to lead very rapidly to self-defeating and antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name="pmid12219857"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Twenge JM, Catanese KR, Baumeister RF | title=Social exclusion causes self-defeating behavior | journal=J Pers Soc Psychol | year= 2002 | volume= 83 | issue= 3 | pages= 606–15 | pmid=12219857 | doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.83.3.606| pmc= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also investigated how the brain responds to social rejection. One study found that the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]] is active when people are experiencing both physical pain and "social pain," in response to social rejection.&lt;ref name="pmid14551436"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Eisenberger NI, Lieberman MD, Williams KD | title=Does rejection hurt? An FMRI study of social exclusion | journal=Science | year= 2003 | volume= 302 | issue= 5643 | pages= 290–2 | doi=10.1126/science.1089134 | pmc= | pmid=14551436  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent experiment, also using [[MRI|fMRI]] neuroimaging, found that three regions become active when people are exposed to images depicting rejection themes. These areas are the posterior [[cingulate]], the [[parahippocampal gyrus]], and the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. Furthermore, individuals who are high in rejection sensitivity (see below) show less activity in the left [[prefrontal cortex]] and the right dorsal [[superior frontal gyrus]], which may indicate less ability to regulate emotional responses to rejection.&lt;ref name="pmid17536965"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kross E, Egner T, Ochsner K, Hirsch J, Downey G | title=Neural dynamics of rejection sensitivity | journal=J Cogn Neurosci | year= 2007 | volume= 19 | issue= 6 | pages= 945–56 | pmid=17536965 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2007.19.6.945 | pmc= | url= | citeseerx=10.1.1.386.718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent experiment at the University of California at Berkeley found that individuals with a combination of low [[self-esteem]] and low attentional control are more likely to exhibit eye-blink [[startle response]]s while viewing rejection themed images.&lt;ref name="pmid17894606"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gyurak A, Ayduk O | title=Defensive physiological reactions to rejection: the effect of self-esteem and attentional control on startle responses | journal=Psychol Sci | year= 2007 | volume= 18 | issue= 10 | pages= 886–92 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01996.x | pmc= 4175371| pmid=17894606  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that people who feel bad about themselves are especially vulnerable to rejection, but that people can also control and regulate their emotional reactions.

A study at Miami University indicated that individuals who recently experienced social rejection were better than both accepted and control participants in their ability to discriminate between real and fake smiles. Though both accepted and control participants were better than chance (they did not differ from each other), rejected participants were much better at this task, nearing 80% accuracy.&lt;ref name="pmid19000206"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bernstein MJ, Young SG, Brown CM, Sacco DF, Claypool HM | title=Adaptive responses to social exclusion: social rejection improves detection of real and fake smiles | journal=Psychol Sci | year= 2008 | volume= 19 | issue= 10 | pages= 981–3 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02187.x | pmc= | pmid=19000206  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study is noteworthy in that it is one of the few cases of a positive or adaptive consequence of social rejection.

=== Ball toss / cyberball experiments ===
A common experimental technique is the "ball toss" paradigm, which was developed by Kip Williams and his colleagues at Purdue University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = K. D. | last2 = Sommer | first2 = K. L. | year = 1997 | title = Social ostracism by one's coworkers: Does rejection lead to loafing or compensation? | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 23 | issue = 7| pages = 693–706 | doi=10.1177/0146167297237003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure involves a group of three people tossing a ball back and forth. Unbeknownst to the actual participant, two members of the group are working for the experimenter and following a pre-arranged script. In a typical experiment, half of the subjects will be excluded from the activity after a few tosses and never get the ball again. Only a few minutes of this treatment are sufficient to produce negative [[emotion]]s in the target, including anger and sadness. This effect occurs regardless of self-esteem and other personality differences.

[[Gender differences]] have been found in these experiments. In one study, women showed greater nonverbal engagement whereas men disengaged faster and showed face-saving techniques, such as pretending to be uninterested. The researchers concluded that women seek to regain a sense of belonging whereas men are more interested in regaining self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, K. D. &amp; Zadro, L. (2001). Ostracism. In M. R. Leary (Ed.), ''Interpersonal rejection''. (pp. 21-53). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A computerized version of the task known as "cyberball" has also been developed and leads to similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zadro|first=Lisa|author2=Williams, Kipling D |author3=Richardson, Rick |title=How low can you go? Ostracism by a computer is sufficient to lower self-reported levels of belonging, control, self-esteem, and meaningful existence|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=30 June 2004|volume=40|issue=4|pages=560–567|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2003.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyberball is a virtual ball toss game where the participant is led to believe they are playing with two other participants sitting at computers elsewhere who can toss the ball to either player.  The participant is included in the game for the first few minutes, but then excluded by the other players for the remaining three minutes.  This simple and short time period of ostracism has been found to produce significant increases to self-reported levels of anger and sadness, as well as lowering levels of the four needs.  These effects have been found even when the participant is ostracised by out-group members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=A|author2=Williams, K |title=R U There?

People feel rejected even when they know they are playing only against the computer. A recent set of experiments using cyberball demonstrated that rejection impairs will power or [[ego depletion|self-regulation]]. Specifically, people who are rejected are more likely to eat cookies and less likely to drink an unpleasant tasting beverage that they are told is good for them. These experiments also showed that the negative effects of rejection last longer in individuals who are high in [[social anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oaten | first1 = M. | last2 = Williams | first2 = K.

== Psychology of ostracism ==
Most of the research on the psychology of [[ostracism]] has been conducted by the social psychologist Kip Williams.  He and his colleagues have devised a model of ostracism  which provides a framework to show the complexity in the varieties of ostracism and the processes of its effects.  There he theorises that ostracism can potentially be so harmful that we have evolved an efficient warning system to immediately detect and respond to it.&lt;ref name="Williams 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Kipling D.|title=Ostracism : the power of silence|year=2002|publisher=Guilford|location=New York|isbn=978-1-57230-831-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leary|first=edited by Mark R.|title=Interpersonal rejection|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-513015-7|pages=21–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the animal kingdom as well as in primitive human societies, ostracism can lead to death due to the lack of protection benefits and access to sufficient food resources from the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruter|first=M|author2=Masters, R |title=Ostracism as a social and biological phenomenon: An introduction|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|year=1986|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=149–158|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(86)90043-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Living apart from the whole of society also means not having a mate, so being able to detect ostracism would be a highly adaptive response to ensure survival and continuation of the genetic line.

It is proposed that ostracism uniquely poses a threat to four [[fundamental human needs]]; the need to belong, the need for control in social situations, the need to maintain high levels of self-esteem, and the need to have a sense of a meaningful existence.&lt;ref name="Williams 2002"/&gt;  A threat to these needs produces psychological distress and pain.  Thus, people are motivated to remove this pain with behaviours aimed at reducing the likelihood of others ostracising them any further and increasing their inclusionary status.

=== Popularity Resurgence ===
There has been recent research into the function of popularity on development, specifically how a transition from ostracization to popularity can potentially reverse the deleterious effects of being socially ostracized.  While various theories have been put forth regarding what skills or attributes confer an advantage at obtaining popularity, it appears that individuals who were once popular and subsequently experienced a transient ostracization are often able to employ the same skills that led to their initial popularity to bring about a popularity resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;{https://www.coursera.org/lecture/popularity/what-social-behaviors-make-people-popular-so-quickly-l0ddb}{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic==

In contrast to the study of childhood rejection, which primarily examines rejection by a group of peers, some researchers focus on the phenomenon of a single individual rejecting another in the context of a romantic relationship. In both teenagers and adults, ''romantic rejection'' occurs when a person refuses the [[courtship|romantic advances]] of another, ignores/avoids or is repulsed by someone who is romantically interested in them, or [[unilaterally]] ends an existing [[intimate relationship|relationship]]. The state of [[unrequited love]] is a common experience in youth, but mutual love becomes more typical as people get older.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R. F. 2001 pp. 55-72"&gt;Baumeister, R. F. &amp; Dhavale, D. (2001). Two sides of romantic rejection. In M. R. Leary (Ed.), ''Interpersonal rejection''. (pp. 55-72). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romantic rejection is a painful, [[emotional]] experience that appears to trigger a response in the [[caudate nucleus]] of the brain, and associated [[dopamine]] and [[cortisol]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, H. (2006) Lost Love: The Nature of romantic rejection, In Cut Loose: (mostly) midlife and older women on the end of (mostly) long-term relationships. Nan Bauer-Maglin (Ed.) New Jersey: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectively, rejected individuals experience a range of negative emotions, including [[frustration]], intense [[anger]], [[jealousy]], [[hate]], and eventually, [[resignation]], [[despair]], and possible long-term [[major depressive disorder|depression]].

==Rejection sensitivity==
{{See also|borderline personality disorder}}
[[Karen Horney]] was the first theorist to discuss the phenomenon of ''rejection sensitivity''.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, G. (2008). The disregulating effect of social threat in people with borderline personality disorder. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Feb. 7-9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that it is a component of the [[neuroticism|neurotic]] personality, and that it is a tendency to feel deep anxiety and humiliation at the slightest rebuff. Simply being made to wait, for example, could be viewed as a rejection and met with extreme anger and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Horney, K. (1937). ''The neurotic personality of our time''. New York: W. W. Norton and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Mehrabian]] developed an early questionnaire measure of rejection sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mehrabian | first1 = A | year = 1976 | title = Questionnaire measures of affiliative tendency and sensitivity to rejection | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 199–209 | doi=10.2466/pr0.1976.38.1.199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehrabian suggested that sensitive individuals are reluctant to express opinions, tend to avoid arguments or controversial discussions, are reluctant to make requests or impose on others, are easily hurt by negative feedback from others, and tend to rely too much on familiar others and situations so as to avoid rejection.

A more recent (1996) definition of rejection sensitivity is the tendency to "anxiously expect, readily perceive, and overreact" to social rejection.&lt;ref name="pmid8667172"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Downey G, Feldman SI |title=Implications of rejection sensitivity for intimate relationships |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |url=http://www.ffri.uniri.hr/~ibrdar/komunikacija/seminari/Downey,%201996%20-%20Rejection%20Sensitivity%20for%20intimate%20relationsh.pdf |year=1996 |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=1327–43 |pmid=8667172 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.6.1327 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731044210/http://www.ffri.uniri.hr/~ibrdar/komunikacija/seminari/Downey,%201996%20-%20Rejection%20Sensitivity%20for%20intimate%20relationsh.pdf |archivedate=July 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People differ in their readiness to perceive and react to rejection.&lt;ref name="pmid8667172"/&gt; The causes of individual differences in rejection sensitivity are not well understood.

==Health==

Social rejection has a large effect on a person's [[health]].  [[Roy Baumeister|Baumeister]] and [[Mark Leary|Leary]] originally suggested that an unsatisfied need to belong would inevitably lead to problems in behavior as well as [[mental health|mental]] and physical health.&lt;ref name="pmid7777651" /&gt;  Corroboration of these assumptions about behavior deficits were seen by [[John Bowlby]] in his research.&lt;ref name =  "Bowlby, 1969" &gt;Bowlby, J.

Overall, experiments show that those who have been rejected will suffer from more negative emotions and have fewer positive emotions than those who have been accepted or those who were in neutral or control conditions.&lt;ref name =  "Blackhart, Nelson, Knowles, &amp; Baumeister (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackhart | first1 = G.

One study by Cole, Kemeny, and [[Shelley E. Taylor|Taylor]] investigated the differences in the disease progression of HIV positive gay men who were sensitive to rejection compared to those who were not considered rejection sensitive.&lt;ref name =  "Cole, Kemeny, &amp; Taylor (1997)" /&gt;  The study, which took place over nine years, indicated significantly faster rate of low [[T helper cells]], therefore leading to an earlier [[AIDS]] diagnosis. They also found that those patients who were more sensitive to rejection died  from the disease an average of 2 years earlier than their non-rejection sensitive counterparts.&lt;ref name =  "Cole, Kemeny, &amp; Taylor (1997)" /&gt;

Other aspects of health are also affected by rejection. Both [[systolic blood pressure|systolic]] and [[diastolic blood pressure]] increase upon imagining a rejection scenario.&lt;ref name =  "Sommer et al., 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sommer | first1 = K.

As we developed into social creatures, social interactions and relationships became necessary to our survival, and the physical pain systems already existed within our bodies.&lt;ref name =  "MacDonald &amp; Leary, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacDonald | first1 = G. | last2 = Leary | first2 = M.

==In fiction, film and art==

Artistic depictions of rejection occur in a variety of art forms. One example of rejection in art is [[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture]] of the Greek deity, Apollo. In this work, the mythical nymph, Daphne, depicts the act of rejection. Apollo had been filled with passion for Daphne, but she repeatedly rejected his advances. The sculpture portrays the moment when Daphne cries out for safety from Apollo and as a result is transformed into a laurel tree. Apollo has been defeated and turns away, rejected.

Depictions of rejection also occur in film. One genre of film that most frequently depicts rejection is romantic comedies. In the film ''[[He's Just Not That Into You (film)|He's Just Not That Into You]]'', the main characters deal with the challenges of reading and misreading human behavior. This presents a fear of rejection in romantic relationships as reflected in this quote by the character Mary, "And now you have to go around checking all these different portals just to get rejected by seven different technologies. It's exhausting."&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1001508|He's Just Not That Into You}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social rejection is also depicted in theatrical plays and musicals. For example, the film ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' shares the story of Tracy Turnblad, an overweight 15-year-old dancer set in the 1960s. Tracy and her mother are faced with overcoming society's expectations regarding weight and physical appearances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3340">The '''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''' ('''SAHGB''') is a [[United Kingdom]] [[learned society]] for people interested in the [[history of architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahgb.org.uk/about.html About US], ''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki-riba01.seoss.co.uk/wiki/The_Society_of_Architectural_Historians_of_Great_Britain The Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206021321/http://wiki-riba01.seoss.co.uk/wiki/The_Society_of_Architectural_Historians_of_Great_Britain |date=2008-12-06 }}, [[RIBApedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/a/OL5265410A Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain], [[Open Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

The Society exists to encourage interest in the history of architecture, to enable the exchange and discussion of ideas related to this. The Society has no official location and its activities cover the [[United Kingdom]]. The Society also represents the interests of UK architectural history to governmental and non-governmental bodies within the education and heritage fields. The Society specifically avoids conservation issues.

''[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]'' is the main journal of the society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications Publications: Architectural History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311062734/http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications |date=2011-03-11 }}, ''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is published each autumn and members of SAHBG receive a copy. There is also a newsletter for members.

== History ==

The foundation of the Society was prompted in 1955 by [[Turpin Bannister]] in discussion with [[Frank Jenkins (architect)|Frank Jenkins]], a British architect and scholar who worked with Bannister at the [[University of Illinois]] in the [[United States]]. Initially it was conceived as being a chapter of the American [[Society of Architectural Historians]] partly because Bannister had been a founder-member in 1940. However, it was decided in 1956 that the Society should be independent. The early members were mainly architects and teachers. The Chairmen of the first meetings were Bruce Allsopp and William A. Singleton, the latter affiliated with the [[York Institute of Architectural Study]].

'''''The Music of Francis Poulenc (1899–1963): A Catalogue''''', abbreviated '''FP''', is a chronological catalogue of [[Francis Poulenc]]'s works which was published by Carl B. Schmidt in 1995. Schmidt provides for each known composition, which includes unfinished, unpublished and lost works, a detailed history of composition and performance, and lists manuscripts and publications.{{sfn|Schmidt|1995}}

As a pianist, Poulenc composed many pieces for his own instrument in [[List of solo piano compositions by Francis Poulenc|his piano music]] and [[chamber music]]. He wrote works for orchestra including several [[concerto]]s, also three [[opera]]s, two [[ballet]]s, [[incidental music]] for plays and [[film music]]. He composed songs (''mélodies''), often on texts by contemporary authors. His religious music includes the [[Mass (Poulenc)|Mass]] in G major, the [[Stabat Mater (Poulenc)|Stabat Mater]] and [[Gloria (Poulenc)|Gloria]].

== Overview ==
The composer had written a catalogue of his works in 1921, which is reproduced in Schmidt's book.{{sfn|Schmidt|1995|p=xxi}} According to this list, the first noted piece was in 1914 ''Processional pour la crémation d'un mandarin'' for piano, now lost or destroyed. Poulenc completed his last work, his [[Oboe Sonata (Poulenc)|Oboe Sonata]], in 1962.

'''Piano, chamber music and songs'''

As a professional pianist, Poulenc wrote many pieces for his own instrument. He was a prolific writer of works of [[chamber music]], often with piano, and some works for two pianos. Poulenc composed many songs (''mélodies''), most of them accompanied by piano, but some also in versions with a small instrumental ensembles, for example his ''[[Rapsodie nègre]]'' for baritone, flute, clarinet, string quartet and piano. He composed easily for woodwind instruments, scoring for example a [[Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano|piano trio with oboe and bassoon]] instead of the traditional violin and cello. Poulenc was less familiar with string instruments. The cellist [[Pierre Fournier]] helped him to write the [[Cello Sonata (Poulenc)|Cello Sonata]], which he premiered with the composer as the pianist.{{sfn|Prieto|2006}} Poulenc destroyed all sketches for string quartets and three for violin sonatas, while only the [[Violin Sonata (Poulenc)|fourth one]] survived, but was received critically.{{sfn|Hell|1978|p=180}}

'''Orchestra and stage'''

Among his works with orchestra are three [[opera]]s, two [[ballet]], [[incidental music]] for plays, [[film music]] and concertos, some with unusual solo instruments such as [[harpsichord]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]]. The harpsichordist [[Wanda Landowska]] inspired the composition of the [[Concert champêtre]].{{sfn|Ivry|1996}}

'''Collaboration in the group ''Les Six'''''

Poulenc was a member of the group of composers ''[[Les Six]]'', with [[Georges Auric]], [[Louis Durey]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[Darius Milhaud]] and [[Germaine Tailleferre]], and contributed to their collective productions, which included another ballet.{{sfn|Bialek|2012}}

'''Sacred music and choral music'''

Poulenc turned to writing also religious music in the 1930s, composing a [[Mass (Poulenc)|Mass]] in G major for [[a cappella]] choir. He composed the [[Stabat Mater (Poulenc)|Stabat Mater]] in 1950 in memory of the painter [[Christian Bérard]] in 1950. The late [[Gloria (Poulenc)|Gloria]] for soprano, choir and orchestra became one of his best-known works.{{sfn|Hyperion|2016}}{{sfn|Clements|2008}} He drew inspiration for his sacred compositions mostly from liturgical texts.

''' Songs '''

For his songs and [[song cycle]]s, he often collaborated with contemporary poets, setting poems by writers such as [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Louis Aragon]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] and [[Louise de Vilmorin]], whom he mentioned in titles. He further set poems by [[Louis Aragon]], [[Théodore de Banville]], [[Maurice Carême]], [[Colette]], [[Robert Desnos]], [[Maurice Fombeure]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Madeleine Ley]], [[François de Malherbe]], [[Jean Moréas]], [[Jean Nohain]] and [[Paul Valéry]], among others. In 1943, during the occupation of France, a cantata ''[[Figure humaine]]'' on poems by Éluard which celebrate ''[[Liberté (poem)|Liberté]]''.{{sfn|Hell|1978|p=183}}

== Table of works ==

In the table, the works are initially listed by the FP number. Other information given is the French title, a translation if commonly used, the [[Key (music)|key]], the scoring if not clear from the title, the year(s) of composition, the genre, text information, notes and a free score when available, and the page number in the catalogue. Abbreviations used are "rev." for "revised", "orch." for "orchestrated" and "sc." for "score".{{sfn|Schmidt|1995}}

In ''Genre'', instrumental pieces are distinguished as ''orchestral'' and ''chamber'' music, particularly that for piano. The group of stage works contains operas, ballets and incidental music, while film scores are marked separately. Sacred and secular music for voice is divided in ''choral'', for [[cantata]]s and [[motet]]s, and ''vocal'', holding songs and song cycles.

'''''The Religion of the Future''''' is a book by the philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, he argues that humanity is in need of a religious revolution that dispenses with the concept of God and elements of the supernatural, a revolution that expands individual and collective human empowerment by fostering a condition he calls "deep freedom"—a life of creativity, risk, experiment, and meaningful personal connection—protected by structure-revising social and political structures of an [[empowered democracy]] hospitable to the context-breaking capacities inherent in human life.

==Overview==

===Background and objective===
Unger opens the book by describing the four incurable defects of human life: death, groundlessness, insatiability, and belittlement. The major world religious traditions, although having certain elements in common, have differed in how they have dealt with these four defects of human life. Unger describes three “moments” in the evolution of religious belief: a first moment, when human life was so precarious that the flaws of existence did not occupy a central place in human consciousness; a second moment, when humans had achieved some degree of freedom from dependence on nature, allowing high culture to emerge and address the basic flaws of existence, which were now at the center of human consciousness. A hallmark of this second moment of religious belief was the common feature of religion in assuring believers that everything is alright. For the third moment to occur, Unger argues that a religious revolution is needed, a thoroughly naturalistic development of religious belief which offers no assurance that everything is alright, but offers a heightened, intensified, and more meaningful life in the present, rather than at some indefinitely postponed future time. This “religion of the future” would offer a way of confronting life without illusions.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=1-61}}

In the next three chapters, Unger will address each of the three major world religious traditions and explain their shortcomings as inspiration and sources for the religion of the future.

===Critique of religious tradition of "overcoming the world"===
The religious tradition of overcoming the world, chiefly represented by [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], is marked by a quest for serenity and benevolence. Unger contends that “overcoming the world” cannot serve as a starting point for a future religious revolution, because this tradition seeks a deliberate dimming of consciousness and vitality in its quest for serenity. The religion of the future, Unger contends, must turn toward the world, not away from it, and a religious tradition that denies time and distinction, and urges us to turn away from engagement with the world, cannot be a basis for the religious revolution Unger envisions.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=62-89}}

===Critique of religious tradition of "humanizing the world"===
The tradition of humanizing the world (represented by [[Confucianism]]) is marked by a belief that humans can find their place in the world by embracing an ethic of roles and the ennoblement of our relations with each other through this ethic of roles. Unger contends that this tradition, too, is unsuited to be a starting point for the religion of the future because it gives too much weight and authority to social structures and roles that may match the dispositions only of the most virtuous, conformist members of society. The picture of human morality presented by the tradition of humanizing the world is ultimately unrealistic, Unger contends, and fails to address in a satisfactory manner the flaws in human existence.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=90-120}}

===Critique of religious tradition of "struggling with the world"===
According to Unger, the religious tradition that holds the most promise as a starting point for the religion of the future is the tradition of “struggling with the world,” the semitic salvific religions including [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The tradition of “struggling with the world” also has a secular voice, in the form of the major doctrines of emancipation including [[liberalism]], [[socialism]] and [[democracy]]. The metaphysical vision of the various forms of “struggling with the world” include several points in common:
* There is one real world.
* Time is inclusively real.
* The new can happen.
* History is open.
* The self has unfathomable depth.
* The ordinary has more promise than the high-flown.

At the heart of the doctrine of the “struggle with the world,” both in its religious and secular variants, is a conception of the self as embodied spirit. Unger explains a key aspect of the nature of the embodied spirit is that it can always overflow and exceed its contexts: “There is more in us, in each of us individually and in all of us collectively--the human race--than there is or ever can be in them.” Unger explains how this context-transcending quality of human beings as embodied spirit is manifested in the context of the market economy, in areas of rigorous intellectual inquiry such as mathematics and physics, and in the confrontation of human beings with the enigmas of their experience in the context of religion. In each of these settings, Unger argues, we are not “ever entirely hostage to the social and conceptual worlds that have helped shape us. They may direct us over much of our lives, but they do not own us.”

This view of human nature as irrepressibly context-transcending is at the heart of what Unger finds useful for the religion of the future in the doctrine of the struggle with the world, and it is this element of the doctrine that he embraces as the starting point for his vision of a religion of the future. But he finds that all of its contemporary forms, the tradition of struggling with the world is radically defective.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=121-195}}

===Nature of the religious revolution represented by the religion of the future===
Unger argues that a new religious revolution would be thoroughly naturalistic and would pursue the task of enhancing life now, rather than promising salvation or reward in the indefinite future. Such a revolution would likely contain elements that resemble past religious revolutions such as visionary teaching and exemplary action, but would combined with elements unknown to the religious revolutions of the past. The religious revolution that Unger envisions would have the following qualities:
* It would not centralize prophetic power in a single individual and his decisive action in history.
* It would be concerned both with reshaping society as well as reorienting individual life.
* It would include a vision for the cumulative transformation of society that would not be reducible to a definite blueprint or formula.
* It would seek to remedy our condition of estrangement from the present moment, recognizing that time is our most precious possession, and that religion must help us transform our lives now, if only in fragmentary and inchoate form, no matter what changes are sought in the structure of society in historical time.
* It would reject the taboo on the religious criticism of religion.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=194-289}}

===Unger's conception of "deep freedom" and the social and political changes that would help bring it about===
Unger sets forth the structural changes in society that would be necessary to foster the emancipatory conditions of the religion of the future, to make society more open to experiment, fulfillment, connection, and surprise. At the heart of his political proposals in this chapter is the general concept of “structure-revising structure,” and the various ways that this can be embodied in political and social institutions. Unger’s vision for politics in this chapter includes “heating up” the political process, creating institutional mechanisms for breaking impasse between branches of government, and increasing mass mobilization of citizens so that all have a voice in the direction and operation of government.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=290-340}}

===Quality of human life under the religion of the future===
Unger speculates on the quality that life would have under the regime instituted by a future religious revolution. Individuals would become freer to innovate, experiment, take risks, and look for trouble. Connections between people would be deeper and more meaningful. Social mechanisms and safety nets would be in place that would allow and encourage this climate of experiment, risk, cooperation and love.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=341-444}}

==Reception==
Reviewing ''The Religion of the Future'' in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', Andrew B. Irvine wrote that “the book demands to be read not as a contribution to scholarly debate but as a direct intervention in the most important and urgent issues of today …  No review could cover all the angles from which this book deserves to be appreciated—and criticized.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=554}} Irvine contends that Unger’s argument  “dramatically ...simplifies the indefinitely complex data of religion, but it does so in the name of a single religious perspective.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=567}} Irvine asks: “What would this book look like if it were more deeply comparative and/or interreligious in its thinking? It is comparative and interreligious, of course, but Unger’s exclusivistic affirmation of the ‘struggle with the world’ seems insufficiently informed.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=567}} Irvine concludes his review by applauding ''The Religion of the Future'', stating that it “merits reading by philosophers, theologians, and activists, especially any who hold that a naturalistic metaphysics and praxis are vital to a flourishing human future. Its weaknesses are as instructive as its strengths.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=568}}

Bonaventure Chapman, writing in the Catholic publication ''Dominicana'', described ''The Religion of the Future'' as “a prophetic vision of any future religion,”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=11}} and stated that he considered the book, alongside [[Ronald Dworkin]]’s ''Religion Without God'', to be an example of “religious atheism,” that is, a “new attitude to God” that “presents a new horizon for Christianity.”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=22}} While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a “maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness.”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=22}}

Reviewing ''The Religion of the Future'' in ''[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]]'', Jeremy David Bendik-Keymer considered the book as the second part of the project that Unger began in ''[[The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound]]'' and concluded in ''[[The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time]]''. Bendik-Keymer summarizes Unger’s project in these works as one that “seeks a world in which we live in the present, free of repression of, or reactive attitudes towards, the existential limitations of being human and in which we act collectively to create the conditions for ongoing innovation and self-transformation” (internal citations omitted). Bendik-Keymer complains that Unger’s depiction of human beings is “belittling” and concludes that Unger “has simply missed the mark… Unger may think of his work as preparation for prophesy, but it ends up as pontification.”{{sfn|Bendik-Keymer|2014}}

==Quotes==

- p.236

{{quote|The category of religion lacks any permanent core. There is no set way in which the aspects of our experience that we designate as religious relate to other aspects. That the category of religion is historical, however, does not mean that it is empty of content. Its powers of discrimination are those that the history of mankind gives it. Each major change in the content of religion inspires a change in our idea of what the term most usefully designates.}}

- p.314

{{quote|Deep freedom is therefore freedom, grasped and realized through change of institutions and practices: not just through a one-time change but through a practice that can generate future, ongoing change in the institutional order of society. Deep freedom is thus also freedom as understood within the bounds of what I earlier described as the conception of a free society. The idea of deep freedom develops through an interplay between the conception of a free society and the institutional arrangements required to make that conception real. The conception informs the making of the institutional alternatives. The making of the alternative prompts us to enrich and revise the conception.}}

- p.349

{{quote|Our comprehensive conceptions of our identity, viewed in relation to our place in nature, are not, in this account, to be understood as merely or chiefly conjectures about a natural phenomenon, as if human nature were a thing. They do not resemble the thinking that produced the standard model of particle physics or the periodic table. They are prophecies, indeed imperfectly self-fulfilling prophecies, as I have argued in my defense of the concept of religion.}}

'''''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross: A Study of the Nature and Origins of Christianity Within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East''''' is a 1970 book about the [[linguistics]] of early [[Christianity]] and [[fertility cult]]s in the [[Ancient Near East]]. It was written by [[John Marco Allegro]] (1923–1988).&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Flint, Peter  |author2=VanderKam, James  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA324 |year= 2005 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-567-08468-2 |pages=324–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AllegroIrvin2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Allegro, John M.  |author2=Irvin, J.

==Theories==
The book relates the development of language to the development of myths, religions, and cultic practices in world cultures. Allegro argues, through etymology, that the roots of [[Christianity]], and many other religions, lay in [[fertility cult]]s, and that cult practices, such as ingesting [[entheogen|visionary plants]] to perceive the mind of God, persisted into the early [[Christian]] era, and to some unspecified extent into the 13th century with reoccurrences in the 18th century and mid-20th century, as he interprets the fresco of the [[Plaincourault Chapel]] to be an accurate depiction of the ritual ingestion of ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' as the [[Eucharist]]. Allegro argued that Jesus never existed as a historical figure and was a mythological creation of early [[Christian]]s under the influence of [[psychoactive]] mushroom extracts such as [[psilocybin]].&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"/&gt;

His claims have often been subject to ridicule and scorn due to Allegro's unconventional theory. As ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine put it in an article headed "Jesus as mushroom",&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909327,00.html "Religion: Jesus as Mushroom"], ''Time'', 8 June 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To some biblical scholars in Britain, the new book looked like the psychedelic ravings of a hippie cultist. To others, it was merely an outlandish hoax. One described it as reading "like a Semitic philologist's erotic nightmare".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reaction==
The book has been described as ''"notorious"'' and as ''"one of the strangest books ever published on the subject of [[religion]] and [[pharmacology]]"''.&lt;ref name="Taylor2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Taylor, Joan E. |title=The Essenes, the Scrolls, and the Dead Sea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWIMFY4VnI4C&amp;pg=PA305 |year= 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-955448-5 |pages=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[media frenzy]] when it was published at the dawn of the 1970s. This caused the publisher to apologize for issuing it and forced Allegro's resignation from his university position.&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Judith Anne |title=John Marco Allegro: The Maverick Of The Dead Sea Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXHf8qdq9kYC&amp;pg=PA291 |year=2005 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |isbn=978-0-8028-2849-1 |pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Anne Brown suggested that the book was ''"difficult to read and difficult to summarize, because he follows clues that criss-cross different cultures and lead into many-layered webs of association"''.&lt;ref name="Brown2005"/&gt; Mark Hall writes that Allegro suggested the scrolls all but proved that a historical Jesus never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Mark. "Foreword", in Allegro, John M. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls &amp; the Christian Myth''. Prometheus 1992, first published 1979, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Jenkins writes that Allegro was an eccentric scholar who relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them, and calls the ''Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' "possibly the single most ludicrous book on Jesus scholarship by a qualified academic".&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Philip (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv6x5kTHGvsC&amp;pg=PA180 "Hidden Gospels"]. Oxford University Press, p. 180, {{ISBN|0195156315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconsideration==
Some studies of Allegro's work have given new purported evidence and led to calls for his theories to be re-evaluated by the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Michael (2006) [http://www.egodeath.com/WassonEdenTree.htm "Wasson and Allegro on the Tree of Knowledge as Amanita"]. ''Journal of Higher Criticism''.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' was reprinted in a 40th anniversary edition with 30-page addendum by Prof. [[Carl A. P. Ruck]] of [[Boston University]].&lt;ref&gt;Allegro, John M. (2009) ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'', 40th anniversary edition, Gnostic Media, {{ISBN|978-0-9825562-7-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A more articulate exposition of Allegro's insights into early Christianity and his discoveries studying the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] was published in his 1979 book ''[[The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth]]''.

The work of Allegro also gained recognition and consideration by such late proponents of experiential psychedelia through pharmacological interaction as [[Terence McKenna]], who cited Allegro's claims of certain psychoactive fungi analogizing the [[Eucharist]], spoken in a live lecture in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Brown2005"/&gt;

Web. 10 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient symbol of Trinacria is the head of [[Medusa]] (a [[gorgon]] with a head of snakes) overlaying ''three legs conjoined at the hips and flexed in triangle and three stalks of wheat''. The Trinacria symbol has also been adopted by the modern Sicilian government and appears at the center of Sicily's flag. The symbol (without the central Gorgon's head) was adopted as the heraldic device of the Lord of the [[Isle of Man]] (located between [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]) in the 13th century and appears on the present [[coat of arms of the Isle of Man]].

==Triskelion==
The Trinacria's shape is often referred to as a [[triskelion]], which shape has been found in many places surrounding the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and in many European countries including [[France]], [[Sicily]], [[Crete]], [[Greece]], the North African coast.

== History of the Trinacria ==
The Trinacria came to be on the Sicilian flag in 1943 during [[World War II]] when [[Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile]] led an independence movement, in collaboration with the allies. Their plan was to help Sicily become independent and form a free republic. The separatist behind the movement used a yellow and red flag with the Trinacria in the center of it. When [[World War II]] ended, Sicily was recognized as an autonomous region in the Italian Republic. Although the Trinacria was recognized worldwide on Sicily's flag in World War II, the distinct symbol had made its first ''debut'' on Syracusan coins dating back to the fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;http://sonsofsicily.com/id11.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sicilian Mythology ==
=== Story of Colapesce ===
Colapesce, a boy from [[Messina]], loved staying in the water and would spend most of his days swimming. He resided in the water for so long that he slowly started to gain fish (Pesce) like characteristics, such as being able to swim underwater for long periods of time without needing air. When [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|King Frederick II]] found out about the young boy and his talent, he sailed to visit him. When he met him, he tested the boys abilities by throwing his possessions overboard for the boy to retrieve. He gradually began diving deeper into  the water, always returning with the king’s possessions. However, when the boy was asked to retrieve the kings crown, he noticed a peculiar sight under the water. He saw the island of Sicily being held and supported by three columns, one intact, the second slightly chipped and scratched, and the third was crumbling away, making Colapesce uneasy at the sight of it. When King Frederick asked the boy to retrieve his ring, Colapesce was worried he might not come back. Eventually he decide to go but asked for a handful of lentils, saying “If you see the lentils float to the surface then I will not be coming back.” After waiting a few days for Colapesce to return, the king looked into the water and saw his ring and lentils float to the surface. He then knew that Colapesce had chosen to take the broken column upon his shoulders to support Sicily. Sicilians claim that when the island shakes from earthquakes it is Colapesce, moving the island on his shoulder because he is tired.&lt;ref&gt;Manzetti, Tiziana.

[[File:Wendel Dietterlin.png|150px|right]]
'''Wendel Dietterlin''' (c.1550&amp;ndash;1599), sometimes '''Wendel Dietterlin the Elder''', to distinguish him from his son, was a German [[Northern Mannerism|mannerist]] painter, [[printmaker]] and [[architectural theory|architectural theoretician]]. Most of his paintings are now lost, and he is best known&lt;ref&gt;Heck.&lt;/ref&gt; for his treatise on architectural ornament, ''Architectura'', published in its final edition in Nuremberg in 1598.

==Life==
Dietterlin was born at [[Pfullendorf]] in [[Württemberg]]; his original name was Grapp and he may have been a member of a family of artists in [[Swabia]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 703. According to Martin, he was the son of a Pfullendorf painter named Balthus Grapp or Krapf. Michèle-Caroline Heck, in her biography of Dietterlin in ''Grove'', claims that he "was the son of a Protestant pastor and spent his childhood in Lissenheim before moving to Strasbourg with his widowed mother."&lt;/ref&gt; spent most of his life in [[Strasbourg]] (then Strassburg), where he married Catharina Sprewer on 12 November 1570, and where he is known to have painted frescos for the ''Bruderhof'', the Bishop's residence, in 1575, but he is later recorded in [[Hagenau]] in 1583 and in [[Oberkirch (Baden)|Oberkirch]] in 1589. He also worked on large projects in Stuttgart for some time (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 703; Heck.&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in [[Strasbourg]].

==Paintings==
In Strasbourg, Dietterlin worked on the decoration of the ''Neuer Bau'' (currently the building of the [[Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie, Strasbourg|Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie]]) in 1589. Between 1590 and 1592 he was employed in [[Stuttgart]] with the execution of a large (57 metres long and 20 metres wide) ceiling painting in the upper hall of the ''[[Neues Lusthaus]]'', a building constructed by [[Duke of Württemberg|Duke Ludwig of Württemberg]] for entertainment purposes. In addition to the ceiling, Dietterlin painted the walls of the hall. The Renaissance ''Lusthaus'' having later been rebuilt several times and almost entirely replaced in 1845 by the new ''Hoftheater'' (which was destroyed in a fire in 1902, when some of the remains of the original building came to light),&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; nothing is now preserved of the paintings from the hall, but they are depicted in a 1619 etching by the Strasbourg-based painter and engraver [[Friedrich Brentel]] showing the interior of the large room.&lt;ref&gt;Heck; Borries.&lt;/ref&gt; Other of his paintings are known from engravings by Matthäus Greuter and by his own grandson Bartholomäus Dietterlin. The style, with "exaggerated foreshortenings", appears influenced by North Italian models, such as [[Giulio Romano]]'s frescos in Mantua, through German intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 703; Heck.&lt;/ref&gt;

His only extant painting is a ''Resurrection of Lazarus'' (in the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]]), signed and dated 1582 or 1587.

==The ''Architectura''==
[[File:Dietterlin, Architectura, Composita, plate 178.jpg|thumb|Columns of the Composite order in Wendel Dietterlin's version. From ''Architectura'', plate 178.]]
Dietterlin's architectural treatise ''Architectvra: Von Außtheilung, Symmetria vnd Proportion der Fünff Seulen'' was first published in separate parts in 1593 and 1594, and finally in a combined and expanded edition in 1598. The book described the [[classical order]]s and their character and proper use, as was traditional in such books. Dietterlin, however, showed less interest in the proportions of the order than in their ornamentation. According to the architectural historian Torbjörn Fulton, Dietterlin treats the orders "more as a basis or excuse for the development of a bizarre ornamental fantasy than as didactic examples of classical architectural ornamentation".&lt;ref&gt;"Även om gravyrserien följer den gängse grupperingen toscana – dorica – ionica – corintia – composita utgör dessa klassiska ordningar till synes mera en utgångspunkt eller förevändning för utvecklandet av en bisarr ornamental fantasi än didaktiska skådeexempel på klassisk arkitekturdekoration." Fulton, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other theoreticians, he ascribed masculine and feminine qualities to the orders. In giving them an appropriate ornamentation that would agree with these qualities, he borrowed from older forms of ornament, including [[Gothic tracery]]. Dietterlin was dependent on many older models, and like other representatives of the Northern Renaissance (such as [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]]) he filled his surfaces with [[scrollwork]], [[strapwork]], gemshapes and [[grotesque]]s. Dietterlin had Northern European contemporaries who likewise integrated Gothic elements in their designs, but he was unusual in the degree of blending of elements of different origin. While others kept Gothic elements clearly separate from Renaissance forms, Dietterlin would cover Renaissance elements in Gothic tracery or allow one to morph midway into the other.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, p. 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Water Monitoring Day (4049999633).jpg|thumb|Students in [[Denver, Colorado]] conduct monitoring on the [[South Platte River]] with [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] staff on World Water Monitoring Day in 2009]]
'''World Water Monitoring Day''' was established in 2003 by America's Clean Water Foundation (ACWF) as a global [[Environmental education|educational outreach]] program. The program, subsequently named the "World Water Monitoring Challenge" and "'''EarthEcho Water Challenge'''," aims to build public awareness and involvement in protecting [[water resource]]s around the world by empowering citizens to carry out [[Water quality#Sampling and measurement|basic monitoring]] of their local water bodies.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatermonitoringday.org |title=EarthEcho Water Challenge |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |publisher=EarthEcho International |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberta (Robbi) Savage, ACWF's President and CEO created WWMD, and Edward Moyer was the first WWMD Coordinator. 

A simple test kit enables everyone, children and adults, to sample local water bodies for a set of [[water quality]] parameters including temperature, acidity (pH), clarity ([[turbidity]]) and [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] (DO). Information on purchasing low-cost test kits is available from the current sponsoring organization, [[EarthEcho International]], and the results of monitoring events are then shared with participating communities around the globe on the sponsor's website.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"/&gt;

World Water Monitoring Day was originally celebrated annually on September 18. This date was initially chosen to be a month later (October 18) to recognize the anniversary of the US [[Clean Water Act]], which was enacted by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1972 to restore and protect the country’s water resources. In 2007, the date was changed to facilitate participation in parts of the world where temperatures reach freezing conditions at that time.

In 2006, ACWF transferred the coordination of the event to the [[Water Environment Federation]] (WEF) and the [[International Water Association]] (IWA). The collective goal was to expand participation to one million people in 100 countries by 2012. In January 2015 the management of World Water Monitoring Day was transferred to EarthEcho International.

2008 saw students from [[Indonesia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/11/25/students-take-part-water-monitoring.html?t=1227619851#comment-9070 Students take part in water monitoring], The Jakarta Post, November, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Arkansas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecabin.net/stories/112508/sty_1125080028.shtml Environmental concerns make water protection necessary], The Cabin.net, November, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; taking part in water sampling to bring attention to the importance of water quality.

As of 2018, EarthEcho International encourages participants to conduct their monitoring activities as part of the "EarthEcho Water Challenge" during any period between March 22 ([[World Water Day]]) and December of each year.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"/&gt;

'''Zoltán Gárdonyi''' (25 April 1906 – 27 June 1986) was a Hungarian [[composer]] and [[musicologist]]. He taught at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] for 26 years.

== Life and work ==
Gárdonyi was born in [[Budapest]]. His mother, the pianist Maria Weigl, studied at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] with [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s pupil, [[István Thomán]], at the same time and in the same class as [[Béla Bartók]]. At the age of 17, Gárdonyi began his studies in composition with [[Zoltán Kodály]] at the Liszt Academy in Budapest.{{r|bio}} After studying with [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Arnold Schering]] in Berlin, he taught as a professor at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest from 1941 until 1967.{{r|bio}} He also led the faculty for Protestant sacred music until it was closed by the communists in 1949.{{r|augsburg}}

His oeuvre includes sacred music, orchestral works and chamber music.{{r|bio}} Three of his motets for choir [[a cappella]] were published in German by [[Schott Music|Schott]], "Finnisches Busslied", "Der Herr ist mein Hirte" ([[Psalm 23]]) and "Singet dem Herren" ([[Psalm 96]]).{{r|schott}} Gárdonyi's musicological research yielded findings related to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]. His works were published in Germany, Sweden and the United States. Gárdonyi lived in Germany with his family beginning in 1972. He died in Westfalian [[Herford]] a few weeks after his 80th birthday.{{r|bio}}

His son is the composer and concert [[Organ (music)|organist]] [[Zsolt Gárdonyi]].

== Performances and recordings ==
Some of Gárdonyi's works were recorded, including his three organ sonatas and the ''Partita sopra Veni Creator Spiritus'', played by Dezső Karasszon, as well as several further organ works and German motets.{{r|Naxos}} The ''Partita'' is a symphonic organ composition, consisting of the following mouvements: introduction (Largo), theme (Lento), four variations and finale (Allegro maestoso), based on [[Martin Luther]]'s [[hymn]] for [[Pentecost]] "{{lang|de|[[Komm, Gott Schöpfer, Heiliger Geist]]}}".{{r|hannover}}
