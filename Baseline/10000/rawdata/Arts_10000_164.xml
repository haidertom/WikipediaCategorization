'''Alfred Barye "Le Fils"''' or '''Alf Barye''' (Paris, [[France]], 21 January 1839 – Paris, [[France]], 1882) was a [[France|French]] sculptor, of the [[Belle Époque]], pupil of his father the artist [[Antoine-Louis Barye]]. In cooperation with [[Émile-Coriolan Guillemin]], Barye did the artwork for ''"The Arab Warrior Knight on Horseback"''. Included in Barye's [[Work of art|oeuvre]] were [[animalier]] bronzes as well as [[Orientalism|Oriental]] subjects. At his father's request, he signed his work as "fils" to differentiate his work from his father's.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt;

==Early life==
Alfred Barye was born in Paris, France, on 21 January 1839,&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; the son of Antoine-Louis Barye. He learned his craft of animalier sculptor under the watchful eye of his father who was one of the original pioneers of animal sculpture in the mid-to-late 19th century. The younger Barye didn't always get along with his father; there were times when the two of them were not on speaking terms because until instructed not to do so, Barye was signing some of his bronzes as "A. Barye" which the senior Barye objected to because it created confusion as to which Barye, father or son, created the sculpture.&lt;ref name="Bronze Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bronze Gallery – Alfred Barye|url=http://bronze-gallery.com/sculptors/artist.cfm?sculptorID=3|website=bronze-gallery.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Alfred Barye bronze bird.JPG|thumb|right|210px|A [[Plating|silvered]] bronze sculpture of a [[pheasant]] by Barye ({{circa|1875}})]]
He specialized in the animalier school in the production of [[bronze sculptures]]. Although a fine artist in his own right, he struggled to create his own identity living in the shadow of his more famous father. The vast majority of his pieces are signed "A. Barye, fils" while some are marked "Barye" or "A. Barye" which created some confusion – intentional or not – with those of his father.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; The majority of the sculptures leaving the Barye foundry were [[sand casting]]s&lt;ref name="Bronze Gallery" /&gt; rather than [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax]] castings. Alfred typically used mid-brown [[patina]]s but would sometimes add green&lt;ref name="Green and Auburn patina"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Barye, French -- Rhinoceros (Lot 139)|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/european-sculpture-works-of-art-l13231/lot.139.html|website=Sothebys.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a color famously used by his father) and auburn-colored hues in the patination process.&lt;ref name="Green and Auburn patina" /&gt; Any Barye bronze – by father or son – will generally have an exquisite patina. Antoine-Louis was particularly finicky with his patinas and would not allow other foundries to apply them, preferring to do it himself for appearance and quality control purposes.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; Alfred, too, would not let a sculpture leave his workshop without a perfectly applied and visually pleasing patina.

Alfred Barye did a production of bronze sculptures and focused his attention on [[race horses]] or horses on the move. Some of his well-known bronzes are ''The Arab Warrior Knight on Horseback'' (1890–1910, made in Paris, height 87&amp;nbsp;cm, width 61&amp;nbsp;cm, depth 30&amp;nbsp;cm, bronze).

==Death and legacy==
Barye died in Paris in 1882. He is known for the precision detail in his bronze sculptures, as shown in the [[pheasant]] sculpture (''pictured right'').&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; Barye was known for great attention to detail on his bronzes. He produced a number of [[bird]] sculptures as well as [[Genre art|genre figures]].&lt;ref name=Kjellberg /&gt; He received "honourable mention" honors in the [[Salon (Paris)|1897 Salon]] for the work ''Aide Fauconnier Indien, Retour de Chasse à la Gazelle''. Alfred Barye's final submission at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] de [[Louvre]] was in 1882.&lt;ref name="Kjellberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kjellberg|first1=Pierre|title=Bronzes of the 19th Century|date=1994|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-88740-629-7|pages=53|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Old Woman Dozing''''' (circa 1656) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Nicolaes Maes]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]].

The woman is dozing over a book and on the table next to her is a [[lace pillow]] for [[bobbin lace]]. Lace pillows were a favorite subject by Maes, who painted them with their owners:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1914, who wrote; "99. AN OLD WOMAN DOZING OVER HER BOOK. 
She is in black with a white cap. She sits on a chair facing the spectator. 
Her spectacles are in her right hand, which rests on a Bible in her lap. 
Her head rests on her left hand ; her elbow is on the table with a red 
cover beside her. On the table are a lace-pillow and a Bible open at the 
book of Amos. On a shelf on the wall are a jug and a candlestick with a candle in it. 
Canvas, 54 inches by 41 1/2 inches. 
Acquired from [[Léon Gauchez|Gauchez]], Paris, 1885, for the Museum (for 66,000 francs). 
In the Brussels Museum, 1908 catalogue, No. 279."&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AHofstede_de_Groot_catalogue_raisonn%C3%A9%2C_Volume_6%2C_1914.djvu&amp;page=522 99. An Old Woman Dozing over her Book]" in Hofstede de Groot, 1914 {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Architectural mythology''' means the [[symbol]]ism of real-world [[architecture]], as well as architecture described in [[mythology|mythological]] stories.&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Lethaby, 1892&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to language a myth could be represented by a painting, a sculpture or a building.

It is about the overall story of an [[architecture|architectural]] work, often revealed through art.  Not all stories surrounding an architectural work incorporate a level of [[mythology|myth]]. These stories can also be well hidden to the casual viewer and are often built into the conceptual design of the architectural statement.

== Ancient greek architecture ==
[[File:Parthenon frieze w facade in situ.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Parthenon Frieze]]]]
Before 600 BC worship was done in the open. But when the Greeks began to represent their Gods by large statues, it was necessary to provide a building for this purpose. This led to the development of temples.&lt;ref name= Strong2&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek temple|ancient Greek temples]] were often enhanced with mythological decorations from the columns to the roof. The architectural functions of the temple mainly concentrated on the cella with the cult statue. The architectural elaboration served to stress the dignity of the cella.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="150835">The city of Paris has notable examples of architecture of every period from the Middle Ages to the 21st century.  It was the birthplace of the [[Gothic style]],  and has important monuments of the [[French Renaissance]], the Classical revival, and flamboyant style of the reign of [[Napoleon III]]; the [[Paris architecture of the Belle Époque|Belle Époque]], and the [[Art Nouveau]] style.  The great Paris Universal Expositions of 1889 and 1900 added Paris landmarks, including the [[Eiffel Tower]] and [[Grand Palais]].  In the 20th century, the [[Art Deco]] style of architecture first appeared in Paris, and Paris architects also influenced the [[postmodern architecture]] of the second half of the century.

Very little architecture remains from the ancient town of [[Lutetia]], founded by a Celtic tribe known as the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] in about the 3rd century BC.  It was conquered by the Romans in 52 BC, and turned into a Gallo-Roman garrison town.  It was rebuilt in the 1st century AD on the classic Roman plan;  a north-south axis, or ''cardo'' (now rue Saint-Jacques); and an east-west axis, or ''decumanus'', of which traces have been found on the [[Île de la Cité]], at rue de Lutèce.  The center of Roman administration was on the island;  the Roman governor's palace stood where the Palais de Justice is located today.  The right bank was largely undeveloped.  The city grew up the Left Bank, on the slopes of Mount Saint-Geneviève.  The Roman forum was on the summit of the hill, under the present Rue Soufflot, between the boulevard Saint-Michel and rue Saint-Jacques,{{Sfn|Fierro|1997|pages=11–12}}

The Roman town had three large baths near the forum, supplied with water by a 46-kilometer-long aqueduct. Vestiges of one bath, the [[Thermes de Cluny]], can still be seen on [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]].  It was the largest of the three baths, one hundred meters by sixty-five meters, and was built at the end of the 2nd century or beginning of the 3rd century BC, at the height of the town's grandeur. The baths are now part of the [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]], or National Museum of the Middle Ages. Nearby, on rue Monge,  are the vestiges of the Roman amphitheater, called the [[Arènes de Lutèce]], which was discovered and restored in the 19th century.  Though the population of the town was probably no more than 5–6 thousand persons, the amphitheater measured 130 meters by 100 meters, and could seat fifteen thousand persons. Fifteen tiers of seats remain from the original thirty-five. It was built in the 1st century AD and was used for the combat of gladiators and animals, and also for theatrical performances.{{Sfn|Fierro|1997|pages=11–12}}

Another notable piece of Gallo-Roman architecture was discovered under the choir of Notre-Dame de Paris; the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], a fragment of a Roman column with carvings of both Roman and Gallic gods. It was probably made at the beginning of the 1st century during the reign of the Emperor [[Tiberius]] to honor the league of the boatmen, who played an important part in the town's economy and religious and civic life. It is now on display in the Roman baths at the Museum of the Middle Ages.  Other fragments of Gallo-Roman architecture are found in the crypt under the square in front of the Cathedral of Notre Dame;  and in the Church of [[Saint-Pierre de Montmartre]], where several Roman columns, probably from a temple, were re-used in the late 12th century to build a Christian church. {{Sfn|Texier|2004|pages=8–9}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Unlike the south of France, Paris has very few examples of Romanesque architecture; most churches and other buildings in that style were rebuilt in the Gothic style.  The most remarkable example of Romanesque architecture in Paris is the church of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], built between 990 and 1160 during the reign of [[Robert II of France|Robert the Pious]].  An earlier church had been destroyed by the [[Vikings]] in the 9th century.  The oldest elements of the original church existing today are the tower (the belfry at the top was added in the 12th century), and the chapel of Saint Symphorien, on the south flank of the bell tower, built in the 11th century.  It is considered the earliest existing place of worship in Paris.  The gothic choir, with its flying buttresses, was added in the mid-12th century, it was consecrated by [[Pope Alexander III]], in 1163.  It was one of the earliest gothic style elements to appear in a Paris church.&lt;ref&gt;Brochure of the Church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanesque and Gothic elements are found together in several old Paris churches. The church of [[Saint-Pierre de Montmartre]] (1147–1200) is only surviving building of the vast Abbey of Montmartre, which once covered the top of the hill; it has both ancient Roman columns and one of the first examples of a Gothic arched ceiling, in the nave near the choir.  The interior of the church of [[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]] (1170–1220) has been extensively rebuilt, but it still has massive Romanesque columns and the exterior is a classic example of the Romano-Gothic style. The former priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs (1060–1140) has a choir and chapels supported by ''contreforts'' and a Romanesque bell tower. It now belongs to the Musee des Arts et Metiers. {{sfn|Texier|2012|pages=10–11}}

===The Palais de la Cité===
In 987 [[Hugues Capet]] became the first King of France, and established his capital in Paris, though at the time his kingdom was little bigger than the Île-de-France, or modern Paris region. The first royal residence, the [[Palais de la Cité]], was established within the fortress at the western end of the [[Île de la Cité]], where the Roman governors had established their residence. Capet and his successors gradually enlarged their kingdom through marriages and conquests.  His son, [[Robert II of France|Robert the Pious]] (972–1031), built the first palace, the Palais de la Cité,  and royal chapel within the walls of the fortress, and his successors embellished it over the centuries; by the reign of [[Philippe le Bel]] in the 14th century, it was the most magnificent palace in Europe.  The tallest structure was the Grosse Tour, or great tower, built by [[Louis VI of France|Louis le Gros]] between 1080 and 1137. It had a diameter of 11.7 meters at the base and walls three meters thick, and remained until its demolition in 1776. The ensemble of buildings (seen in the image at right as they were between 1412 and 1416) included a royal residence, a great hall for ceremonies, and four large towers along the Seine on the north side of the island, as well as a gallery of luxury shops, the first Paris shopping center. Between 1242 and 1248 King [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], later known as Saint Louis,  built an exquisite gothic chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]],  to house the relics of the [[Passion of Christ]] which he had acquired from the Emperor of Byzantium. {{sfn|Delon|2000|pages=6–8}}

In 1358 a rebellion of the Parisian merchants against the royal authority, led by [[Étienne Marcel]], caused the King, [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], to move his residence to a new palace, the [[Hôtel Saint-Pol]], near the [[Bastille]] at the eastern edge of the city. The Palace was used occasionally for special ceremonies and to welcome foreign monarchs, but housed the administrative offices and courts of the Kingdom, as well as an important prison. The Great Hall was destroyed by a fire in 1618, rebuilt;  another fire in 1776 destroyed the residence of the King, the tower of Mongomery.  During the [[French Revolution]], the revolutionary tribunal was housed in the building; hundreds of persons, including Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], were tried and imprisoned there, before being taken to the guillotine.  After the Revolution the Conciergerie served as a prison and courthouse. It was burned by the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871, but was rebuilt.  The prison was closed in 1934, and the Conciergerie became a museum. {{sfn|Delon|2000|pages=12–37}}

Several vestiges of the medieval Palais de la Cité, extensively modified and restored, can still be seen today; the royal chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]];  the Hall of the Men-at-Arms, (early 14th century), the former dining hall of the palace officials and guards, located underneath the now-vanished Great Hall;  and the four towers along the Seine facing the right bank. The façade was built in the 19th century. The tower on the far right, the Tour Bonbec, is the oldest, built between 1226 and 1270 during the reign of Louis IX, or Saint Louis. It is distinguished by the crenolation at the top of the tower. It originally was a story shorter than the other towers, but was raised to match their height in the renovation of the 19th century. The tower served as the primary torture chamber during the Middle Ages.  The two towers in the center, the Tour de César and the Tour d'Argent, were built in the 14th century, during the reign of [[Philippe le Bel]]. The tallest tower, the Tour de l'Horloge, was constructed by [[Jean le Bon]] in 1350, and modified several times over the centuries. The first public clock in Paris,  was added by Charles V in 1370. The sculptural decoration around the clock, featuring allegorical figures of The Law and Justice, was added in 1585 century by Henry III. {{sfn|Texier|2012|pages=12–13}}

===City walls and castles===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="150px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Much of the architecture of medieval Paris was designed to protect the city and King against attack;  walls, towers, and castles.  Between 1190 and 1202, King [[Philippe-Auguste]] began construction of a wall five kilometers long to protect the city on the right bank. The wall was reinforced by seventy-seven circular towers, each no more than six meters in diameter.  He also began construction of a large castle, the [[Louvre]], where the wall met the river. The Louvre was protected by a moat and a wall with ten towers.  In the center was a massive circular ''donjon'' or tower,  thirty meters high and fifteen meters in diameter.  It was not then the residence of the King, but Philippe Auguste placed the royal archives there.  Another walled complex of buildings, the Temple, the headquarters of the [[Knights Templar]], was located on the right bank, centered around a massive tower. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=12–13}}

The city on the right bank continued to grow outwards.  The Provost of the Merchants, [[Étienne Marcel]], began building a new city wall in 1356, which doubled the area of the city.  The Louvre, now surrounded by the city, was given rich decoration and a grand new stairway, and gradually became more of residence than a fortress. [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], in 1364–80, moved his primary residence from the City Palace to the Hôtel Saint-Pol, a comfortable new palace in the new [[Le Marais]] quarter. To protect his new palace and the eastern flank of the city, in 1570 Charles began building the [[Bastille]], a fortress with six cylindrical towers.  At the same time, further east, in the forest of Vincennes, Charles V built an even larger castle, the [[Château de Vincennes]], dominated by another massive keep or tower fifty-two meters high.  It was completed in 1369. Beginning in 1379, close to the Château, he began constructing a replica of Sainte-Chapelle.  Unlike the Sainte-Chapelle in the city, the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle of Vincennes was not divided into two levels; the interior was a single space, flooded with light. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=14–15}}

===Churches - the birth of the Gothic Style===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="150px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The style of [[Gothic architecture]] was born in the rebuilding of the chevet of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], just outside Paris, finished in 1144. Twenty years later, the style was used on a much larger scale by [[Maurice de Sully]] in the construction of the Cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]. The construction continued until the 14th century. beginning with the twin towers on the west toward the choir in the east. The style evolved as the construction continued;  the opening of the rose window on the western façade were relatively narrow;  the great rose windows of the central transept were much more delicate, and allowed in much more light.  At the western end, the walls were supported by buttresses built directly against the walls;  in the center, completed later, the walls were supported by two steps of flying buttresses.  In the last century of construction, the buttresses were able to cross the same distance with a single stone arch.  The towers on the west were more stately and solemn, in the classic Gothic style,  while the eastern elements of the Cathedral, with its combination of rose windows, spires, buttresses and pinnacles, belonged to more elaborate and decorative style, called the Gothic rayonnant. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=14–15}}

Other Paris churches soon adapted the Gothic style; the choir of Abbey church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés was completely rebuilt in the new style, with pointed arches and flying buttresses.  The church of [[Saint-Pierre de Montmartre]] was rebuilt with ''ogives'', or gothic pointed arches. The church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerois, next to the Louvre, was given a portal inspired by Notre Dame, and the [[Church of Saint-Séverin]] was given a Gothic nave with the first [[triforium]], or first-story side gallery,  in Paris. The supreme example of the new style was the upper chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], where the walls seemed to be made entirely of stained glass. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=14–15}}

The Gothic Style went through another phase between 1400 and about 1550; the [[Flamboyant Gothic]],  which combined extremely refined forms and rich decoration.  The style was used not only in churches, but also in some noble residences. Notable existing examples are the [[Church of Saint-Séverin]] (1489–95) with its famous twisting pillar;  the elegant choir of the church of [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]],;  the [[Tour Saint-Jacques]], the flamboyant Gothic vestige of an abby church destroyed during the Revolution;  and the chapel of the residence of the Abbots of Cluny, now the Museum of the Middle Ages. and the ceiling of the Tour Saint-Jean-Sans-Peur, a vestige of the former residence of the Dukes of Burgundy, in the 2nd arrondissement.

===Houses and manors===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The houses in Paris during the Middle Ages were tall and narrow; usually four or five stories.  They were constructed of wooden beams on a stone foundation, with the walls covered by white plaster, to prevent fires.  There was usually a shop located on the ground floor.  Houses built of stone reserved for the wealthy;  the oldest house in the Paris is considered to be the Maison de Nicolas Flamel, at 51 rue Montmorency in the 3rd arrondissement, built in 1407.  it was not a private residence, but a kind of hostel. Two houses with exposed beams at 13-15 rue François-Miron in the 4th arrondissement, often described as Medieval, were actually built in the 16th and 17th centuries. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=22–23}}

While there are no ordinary houses from the Middle Ages, there are several examples of manors built for the nobility and the high clergy.  The [[Tour Jean-sans-Peur]], at 20 rue Étienne-Marcel in the 2nd arrondissement, built in 1409–11, was part of the Hôtel de Burgogne, the Paris residence of the Dukes of Burgundy.  Built by Robert de Helbuterne, It contains a stairway with a magnificent flamboyant gothic ceiling.  The [[Hôtel de Cluny]] residence of the abbots of the Cluny Monastery, now the [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]], or National Museum of the Middle Ages,  (1490–1500), has a typical feature of manors of the period; a stairway in a tower on the exterior of the building, in the courtyard.  It also contains a chapel with a spectacular flamboyant gothic ceiling.  The [[Hôtel de Sens]] was the Paris residence of the Archbishop of Sens, who had authority over the Bishops of Paris. It also featured a separate stairway tower in the courtyard. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=22–23}}

The [[Italian Wars]] conducted by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] and [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], at the end of the 15th and early 16th century were not very successful from a military point of view, had a direct and beneficial effect on the architecture of Paris. The two Kings returned to France with ideas for magnificent public architecture in the new Italian Renaissance style, and brought Italian architects to build them.  A new manual of classical Roman architecture by the Italian [[Serlio]] also had a major effect on the new look of French buildings.  A distinctly French Renaissance style, lavishly using cut stone and lavish ornamental sculpture, developed under [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] after 1539, {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=26}}

The first structure in Paris in the new style was the old Pont Notre-Dame (1507–12), designed by the Italian architect [[Fra Giocondo]].  It was lined with 68 artfully designed houses, the first example of Renaissance urbanism. King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] commissioned the next project; a new [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], or city hall, for the city. It was designed by another Italian, [[Domenico da Cortona]], and begun in 1532 but not finished until 1628. The building was burned in 1871 by the [[Paris Commune]], but the central portion was faithfully reconstructed in 1882.  A monumental fountain in the Italian style, the [[Fontaine des Innocents]], was built in 1549 as a tribune for the welcome of the new King, Henry Ii, to the city on June 16, 1549.  It was designed by [[Pierre Lescot]] with sculpture by [[Jean Goujon]], and is the oldest existing fountain in Paris.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=24}}

The first Renaissance Palace built in Paris was the [[Château de Madrid]]; it was a large hunting lodge designed by [[Philibert Delorme]] and erected between 1528 and 1552 west of the city in what is now the [[Bois de Boulogne]]. It was combination of both French and Italian Renaissance styles, with a high French-style roof and Italian loggias. It was demolished beginning in 1787, but a fragment can still be senen today in the Trocadero Gardens in the 16th arrondissement.

Under Henry II and his successors, the Louvre was gradually transformed from a medieval fortress into a Renaissance palace.  The architect Pierre Lescot and sculptor Jean Gouchon made the Lescot wing of the Louvre, a masterpiece of combined French and Italian Renaissance art and architecture, on the southeast side of the Cour Carrée of the Louvre (1546–53).  Inside the Louvre, they made the staircase of Henry II (1546–53) and the Salle des Cariatides (1550).  Both French and Italian elements were combined;  the antique orders and paired columns of the Italian renaissance were combined with sculpted medallions and high roofs broken by windows (later known as the Mansard roof), which were characteristic of the French style.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=26–27}}

After the accidental death of [[Henry II of France]] in 1559, his widow [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519–1589) planned a new palace. She sold the medieval [[Hôtel des Tournelles]], where her husband had died, and began building the [[Tuileries Palace]] in using architect [[Philibert de l'Orme]]. During the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1589–1610), the building was enlarged to the south, so it joined the long riverside gallery, the Grande Galerie, which ran all the way to the older [[Louvre Palace]] in the east. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=24}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Most of the churches built in Paris in the 16th century are in the traditional [[flamboyant gothic]] style, though some have features borrowed from the Italian Renaissance. The most important Paris church of the Renaissance is [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]], 105 meters long, 44 meters wide and 35 meters high,  which in size and grandeur, approaches that of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. King Francis I wanted a monument as the centerpiece for the neighborhood of [[Les Halles]], where the main city market was located. The church was designed by the King's favorite architect, [[Domenico da Cortona]], The project was begun in 1519, and construction began in 1532.  The pillars were inspired by the monastery church of Cluny, and the soaring interior is taken from the gothic cathedrals of the 13th century, but Cortona added details and ornament taken from the Italian Renaissance. It was not completed until 1640.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=24}}

The other churches of the period follow the more traditional flamboyant gothic models. They include [[Saint-Merri]] (1520–52), with a plan similar to Notre-Dame; [[Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois]], which features impressive flying buttresses;  and the Église Saint-Medard. whose choir was built in beginning in 1550; [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] features a soaring gothic vault in the apse, but also had a transept a more sober classical style inspired by the Renaissance.  (The baroque façade was added in the 17th century).in the  [[Saint-Étienne-du-Mont]] (1510–86), near the modern Pantheon on Mont Sainte-Genevieve, has the only remaining Renaissance [[rood screen]] (1530–35), a magnificent bridge across the center of the church. The flamboyant gothic church of [[Saint-Nicholas-des-Champs, Paris|Saint-Nicholas-des-Champs]] (1559) has a striking Renaissance feature; a portal on right side inspired by designs of [[Philibert Delorme]] for the former royal residence, the Palace of Tournelles in the Marais.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=24–25}}

===Houses and hotels===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200px&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The ordinary Paris house of the Renaissance was little changed from the medieval house; they were four to five stories high, narrow, built on a stone foundation of wood covered with plaster. They usually had a ''pigeon'', or gabled roof.  The two houses at 13-15 rue François Miron (actually built in the 16th or 17th century, but often described as medieval houses) are good examples of the Renaissance house.{{Sfn|Texier|212|pages=22–23}}

Once the French court returned to Paris from the Loire Valley, the nobility and wealthy merchants began to build ''[[Hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]'', or large private residences, mostly in the Marais.  They were built of stone and richly decorated with sculpture.  They were usually built around a courtyard, and separated from the street. The residence was a located between the courtyard and garden. The façade facing the courtyard had the most sculptural decoration;  the façade facing the garden was usually rough stone. The [[Hôtel Carnavalet]] at 23 rue de Sévigné, (1547–49), designed by [[Pierre Lescot]], and decorated with sculpture by [[Jean Goujon]], is the best example of a Renaissance h As the century advanced, the exterior stairways disappeared and the façades became more classical and regular.  A good example of the later style is the [[Hôtel d'Angoulême Lamoignon]], at 24 rue Pavée in the 3rd arrondissement (1585–89), designed by Thibaut Métezeau.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=28–29}}

==The 17th century - The Baroque, the dome, and the debut of Classicism==

The architectural style of the French Renaissance continued to dominate in Paris through the Regency of [[Marie de' Medici]].  The end of the wars of religion allowed the continuation of several building projects, such as the expansion of the Louvre, begun in the 16th century but abandoned because of the war.  With the arrival in power Louis XIII and the ministers Richelleu and Mazarin, a new architectural style, the baroque, imported from Italy, began to appear in Paris.  Its purpose, like Baroque music and painting, was to awe Parisians with its majesty and ornament, in opposition to the austere style of the Protestant [[Reformation]]. The new style in Paris was characterized by opulence, irregularity, and an abundance of decoration.  The straight geometric lines of the buildings were covered with curved or triangular ''frontons'', niches with statues or ''cariatides'', ''cartouches'', garlands of drapery, and cascades of fruit carved from stone.

[[Louis XIV]] distrusted the unruly Parisians, and spent as little time as possible in Paris,  finally moving his Court to Versailles in,  but at the same time he wanted to transform Paris into "The New Rome", a city worthy of the Sun King.  Over the course of his long reign, from 1643 until 1715, the architectural style in Paris gradually changed from the exuberance of the baroque to a more solemn and formal classicism, the embodiment in stone of the King's vision of Paris as "the new Rome."   The new Academy of Architecture, founded in 1671,  imposed an official style, as the Academies of art and literature had earlier done. The style was modified again beginning in about 1690, as the government began to run short of money;  new projects were less grandiose.{{sfn|Renault|2006|page=48}}

In the 17th century, the first large-scale urban planning of Paris was initiated by royal ordinance, largely based on the model of Italian cities, including the construction of the first residential squares.  The first two squares, Place Royale (now [[Place des Vosges]], 1605–12) and [[Place Dauphine]], the latter in place of the old royal garden on the Île-de-la-Cité, were both begun by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]],  who also completed the first Paris bridge without houses, the [[Pont Neuf]] (1599–1604).  The Place Royale had nine large residences on each of its four sides, with identical façades. The Place Dauphine had forty houses on its three sides (of which just two remain today). Louis XIV continued the style with [[Place des Victoires]] (1684–97) and [[Place Vendôme]] (1699–1702).  Both of these squares were (1) designed by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], (2) had statues of the King in the center, and (3) were financed largely by the sale of the houses around the squares.  The residences around the latter two squares had identical classical façades and were built of stone, following Hardouin-Mansart's ''Grand Style'' used in his monumental buildings. The residential squares all had pedestrian arcades on the ground floors, and what became known as a ''mansart'' window breaking the line of the high roof. They set a model for European squares in the [[18th century]].{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=38–39}}

Urban planning was another important legacy of the 17th century. In 1667 formal height limits were imposed on Paris buildings; 48 ''pieds'' ({{convert|15.6|m|ft}}) for wooden buildings and 50 to 60 ''pieds'' ({{convert|16.25|to|19.50|m|ft}}) for buildings of stone, following earlier rules set in place in 1607.  To prevent fires, the traditional gabled roof was banned. Beginning in 1669, under the new regulations, large blocks of houses of uniform height and uniform façades were built along several Paris streets on the right bank, notably rue de la Ferronnerie (1st arr.), [[rue Saint-Honoré]] (1st arr.), rue du Mail (2nd arr.), and rue Saint-Louis-en-Île on the [[Île Saint-Louis]].  They usually were built of stone and composed of an arched arcade on the ground floor with two to four stories above, the windows separated by decorative columns, and a high roof broken by rows of windows.  This was the birth of the iconic Paris street architecture that dominated for the next two centuries. {{Sfn|Texier|2102|pages=36–37}}

Another element of the new architecture of Paris was the bridge. The [[Pont Neuf]] (1599–1604) and [[Pont Royal]] (1685–89), by engineer François Romain and architect [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], were built without the rows of houses that occupied earlier bridges, and were designed to match the grand style of the architecture around them.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
After the assassination of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] in 1610, his widow, [[Marie de' Medici]], became the regent for the young [[Louis XIII]] and between 1615 and 1631 she built a residence for herself, the [[Luxembourg Palace]], on the left bank.  It was inspired by the palaces of her native Florence, but also by the innovations of the French Renaissance. The architect was [[Salomon de Brosse]], followed by [[Marin de la Vallée]] and [[Jacques Lemercier]].  In the gardens, she built a magnificent fountain, the [[Medici Fountain]], also on the Italian model.

The construction of the Louvre was one of the major Paris architectural projects of the 17th century, and the palace architecture clearly showed the transition from the French Renaissance to the classical style of Louis XIV. [[Jacques Lemercier]] had built the Pavillon de l'Orloge in 1624–39 in an ornate baroque style.  Between 1667 and 1678 [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Charles Le Brun]], [[François d'Orbay]] and [[Claude Perrault]] rebuilt the east exterior façade of the courtyard with a long colonnade.  A competition was held in 1670 for the south façade, which included a proposal from the Italian architect [[Bernini]].  Louis XIV rejected Bernini's Italianate plan in favor of a classical design by Perrault, which had a flat roof concealed by a balustrade and a series of massive columns and triangular pediments designed to convey elegance and power. [[Louis Le Vau]] and [[Claude Perrault]] rebuilt the interior façade of the ''cour Carée'' of the Louvre in a more classical version than that of the facing Renaissance façade. The Louvre was gradually transformed from a Renaissance and baroque palace to the classical ''grand style'' of Louis XIV.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=40–41}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Church architecture in the 17th century was slow to change. Interiors of new parish churches, such as [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], [[Saint-Louis-en-l'Île]] and [[Saint-Roch, Paris|Saint-Roch]] largely followed the traditional gothic floor-plan of Notre-Dame,  though they did add façades and certain other decorative features from the Italian Baroque, and follow the advice of the [[Council of Trent]] to integrate themselves into the city's architecture, and they were aligned with the street. In 1675, an official survey on the state of church architecture in Paris made by architects [[Daniel Gittard]] and [[Libéral Bruant]] recommended that certain churches "so-called Gothic, without any good order, beauty or harmony" should be rebuilt "in the new style of our beautiful modern architecture", meaning the style imported from Italy, with certain French adaptations.

The architect [[Salomon de Brosse]] (1571–1626) introduced a new style of façade,  based on the traditional orders of architecture (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian),  placed one above the other.  He first used this style in the façade of the Church of [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] (1616–20).  The style of the three superimposed orders appeared again in the Eglise Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis, the new Jesuit church in Paris, designed by the Jesuit architects [[Étienne Martellange]] and [[François Derand]]. Saint-Roch (1653–90), designed by [[Jacques Lemercier]], had a Gothic plan but colorful Italian-style decoration. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=30–31}}

The most dramatic new feature of Paris religious architecture in the 17th century was the [[dome]], which was first imported from Italy in about 1630, and began to change the Paris skyline, which hitherto had been entirely dominated by church spires and bell towers. The domed churches began as a weapon of the Counter-Reformation against the architectural austerity of the Protestants.  The prototype for the Paris domes was the Church of the Jesu, the Jesuit church in Rome, built in 1568–84 by [[Giacomo della Porta]].  A very modest dome was created in Paris between 1608 and 1619 in the chapel of the Louanges on rue Bonaparte.  (Today it is part of the structure of the École des Beaux-Arts).  The first large dome was on the church of Saint-Joseph des Carmes, which was finished in 1630.  Modifications in the traditional religious services, strongly supported by the growing monastic orders in Paris, led to modification in church architecture, with more emphasis on the section in the center of the church, beneath the dome. The circle of clear glass windows of the lower part of the dome filled the church center with light.

The most eloquent early architect of domes was the architect [[François Mansart]].  His first dome was at the chapel of the Minimes (later destroyed), then at the chapel of the Church of the Convent of the Visitation Saint-Marie at 17 rue Saint-Antoine (4th arr.), built between 1632 and 1634.  Now the [[Temple du Marais]], It is the oldest surviving dome in the city. Another appeared on the Eglise-Saint-Joseph in the convent of the Carmes-dechaussés at 70 rue de Vaugirard (6th arr.) between 1628 and 1630. Another dome soon was built in the Marais;  the dome of the Church of [[Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis]] at 899-101 rue Saint-Antoine (1627–41), by [[Étienne Martellange]] and [[François Derand]].  It was followed by church of the Abbey of [[Val-de-Grâce (church)|Val-de-Grâce]] (5th arr.) (1624–69), by Mansart and [[Pierre Le Muet]];  then by a dome on the Chapel of Saint-Ursule at the College of the [[Sorbonne]] (1632–34), by [[Jacques Lemercier]]; and the College des Quatres-Nations (now the [[Institute of France]] (1662–68), by [[Louis LeVau]] and [[François d'Orbay]];  and the church of [[Notre-Dame de l'Assomption de Paris]] on rue Saint-Honoré (1st arr.) (1670–76) by [[Charles Errard]]. The most majestic dome was that of the chapel of [[Les Invalides]], by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], built between 1677 and 1706.  The last dome of the period was for a Protestant church, the Temple de Pentemont on rue de Grenelle  (7th arr.) (about 1700) by [[Charles de La Fosse]]. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=44–45}}

===Residential architecture - the rustic style===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
An elegant new form of domestic architecture, the rustic style, appeared in Paris in the wealthy [[Le Marais]] at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th century. This style of architecture was usually used for ornate apartments in wealthy areas, and for Hôtel Particuliers. It was sometimes called the "style of three crayons" because it used three colors;  black slate tiles, red brick, and white stone. This architecture was expensive, having a variety of different materials, and ornate stone work. This style inspired the unique [[Palace of Versailles|Palais de Versailles]]. The earliest existing examples are the house known as the ''Maison de Jacques Cœur''at 40 rue des Archives (4th arr.) from the late 16th century; the Hôtel Scipion Sardini at 13 rue Scipion in the (5th arr,) from 1532, and the Abbot's residence at the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] at 3-5 rue de l'Abbaye, (6th arr.), from 1586.  The most famous examples around found around the [[Place des Vosges]], built between 1605 and 1612. Other good examples are the Hospital of Saint-Louis on rue Buchat (10th arr.) from 1607 to 1611; the two houses at 1-6 [[Place Dauphine]] on the Île de la Cité, from 1607 to 1612; and the Hôtel d'Alméras at 30 rue des Francs-Bourgeois (4th arr.), from 1612.

===Residences - the classical style===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200px&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The palatial new residences built by the nobility and the wealthy in the Marais featured two new and original specialized rooms; the dining room and the ''[[Drawing room|salon]]''.  The new residences typically were separated from the street by a wall and gatehouse.  There was a large court of honor inside the gates, with galleries on either side, used for receptions, and for services and the stables. The house itself opened both onto the courtyard and onto a separate garden.  One good example in its original form, between the Place des Vosges and rue Saint-Antoine,  is the [[Hôtel de Sully]], (1624–29), built by [[Jean Androuet du Cerceau]]. {{sfn|Renault|2006|page=52}}

After 1650 the architect [[François Mansart]] introduced a more classical and sober style to the hôtel particular. The Hôtel de Guénégaud des Brosses at 60 rue des Archives (3rd arrondissement) from 1653 had a greatly simplified and severe façade. Beginning in the 1660s Mansart remade the façades of the [[Hôtel Carnavalet]], preserving some of the Renaissance decoration and a 16th portal but integrating them into a more classical composition, with columns, pediments and stone ''bossages''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the first half of the 18th century, the grand style of Louis XIV, defined by the Royal Academy of Architecture and evoking power and grandeur, dominated Paris architecture.  In 1722, Louis XV returned the court to Versailles, and visited the city only on special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Sarmant, Thierry, ''’Histoire de Paris'', pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;  While he rarely came into Paris, he did make important additions to the city's landmarks. His first major building was the ''[[École Militaire]]'', a new military school, on the Left Bank. It was built between 1739 and 1745 by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]].  Gabriel borrowed the design of the Pavillon d'Horloge of the Louvre by Lemercier for the central pavilion, a façade influenced by Mansart, and Italian touches from [[Palladio]] and [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=58–59}}

In the second part of the century,  a more purely neoclassical style, based directly on Greek and Roman models, began to appear. It was strongly influenced by a visit to Rome in 1750 by the architect [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]] and the future Marquis de Marigny, the director of buildings for King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].  They and other architects who made the obligatory trip to Italy brought back classical ideas and drawings which defined Paris architecture until the 1830s.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=60}}
 
Soufflot's Roman trip led to the design of the new church of Saint Genevieve, now the [[Panthéon]], the model of the neoclassical style, constructed on the summit of Mont Geneviéve between 1764 and 1790.  It was not completed until the [[French Revolution]], at which time it became a mausoleum for Revolutionary heroes. Other royal commissions in the new style included the royal mint,  the [[Hôtel des Monnaies, Paris|Hotel des Monnaies]] on the Quai de Conti (6th arr.), with a 117-meter-long façade along the Seine, dominated by its massive central ''Avant-corps'' and vestibule decorated with doric columns and caisson ceilings (1767–75).

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Churches in the first half of the 18th century, such as the church of Saint-Roche at 196 rue Saint-Honoré (1738–39) by [[Robert de Cotte]] and [[Jules-Robert de Cotte]],  stayed with the late baroque style of superimposed orders. Later churches ventured into neoclassicism, at least on the exterior.  The most prominent example of a neoclassical church was the Church of Saint Genevieve (1764–90), the future Pantheon. The church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule at 153 rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré (8th arr.) (1764–84) by [[Jean-François Chalgrin]] had an exterior inspired by the early Paleo-Christian church, though the nave in the interior was more traditional.  The Church of [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]] in the 6th arrondissement, by Jean-Nicolas Servandont, then by Oudot de Maclaurin and Jean-François Chalgrin was given a classical façade and two bell towers (1732–80).  Funding was exhausted before the second tower was finished, leaving the two towers different in style. The church of Saint-Eustache on rue-du-Jour (1st arr.) an example of both Gothic and Renaissance architecture, had its west faced redone by [[Jean Hardouin-Mansart]] and then [[Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux]], into a neoclassical façade with two orders (1754–78), and was intended to have two towers, but only one was finished. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=52–53}}

A large church with a dome, similar to Les Invalides,  had been planned for the [[Place de la Madeleine]] beginning in the 1760s. the King laid the cornerstone on April 3, 1763, but work halted in 1764.  The architect, [[Pierre Contant d'Ivry]], died in 1777,  and was replaced by his pupil Guillaume-Martin Couture, who decided instead to base his church on the [[Pantheon, Rome|Roman Pantheon]];  a classic colonnade topped by a massive dome. At the start of the [[French Revolution|Revolution of 1789]], however, only the foundations and the grand portico had been finished.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Regency and then the rule of [[Louis XV]] saw a gradual evolution of the style of the ''hôtel particular'', or mansion. The ornate wrought-iron balcony appeared on residences, along with other ornamental details called [[rocaille]] or [[rococo]], often borrowed from Italy. The style first appeared on houses in the Marais, then in the neighborhoods of Saint-Honoré and Saint-Germain, where larger building lots were available. These became the most fashionable neighborhoods by the end of the 18th century. The new hôtels were often ornamented with curve façades, rotundas and lateral pavilions, and had their façades decorated with sculpted ''mascarons'' fruit, cascades of trophies and other sculptural decoration.  The interiors were richly decorated with carved wood panels. The houses usually looked out onto courtyards on the front and gardens to the rear. The Hôtel de Chenizot, 51 rue Saint-Louis-en-Ile, by Pierre-Vigné de Vigny (about 1720), was a good example of the new style; it was a 17th-century house transformed by a new rocaille façade. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=54–55}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In 1748, the Academy of Arts commissioned a monumental statue of the king on horseback by the sculptor [[Bouchardon]], and the Academy of Architecture was assigned to create a square, to be called ''Place Louis XV'', where it could be erected. The site selected was the marshy open space between the Seine, the moat and bridge to the Tuileries garden, and the [[Champs-Élysées]], which led to the ''Étoile'', convergence of hunting trails on the western edge of the city (now ''[[Place Charles de Gaulle|Place Charles de Gaulle-Étoile]]''). The winning plans for the square and buildings next to it were drawn by the architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]]. Gabriel designed two large ''hôtels'' with a street between them, [[Rue Royale, Paris|''Rue Royale'']], designed to give a clear view of the statue in the center of the square.  The façades of the two hotels, with long colonnades and classical pediments, were inspired by Perrault's neoclassical façade of the Louvre. Construction began in 1754, and the statue was put in place and dedicated on 23 February 1763. The two large  ''hôtels'' were still unfinished, but the ''façades'' were finished in 1765–66. The Place was the theater for some of the most dramatic events of the [[French Revolution]], including the executions of [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]].  {{sfn|Antoine|1989|pages=556–557}}

===Urbanism under Louis XVI===
The later part of the 18th century saw the development of new residential blocks, particularly on the left bank at Odéon and Saint-Germain, and on the right bank in the first and second arrondissements.  The most fashionable neighborhoods moved from the Marais toward the west. with large residential buildings constructed in a simplified and harmonious neoclassical style. The ground floors were often occupied by arcades to give pedestrians shelter from the rain and the traffic in the streets.  Strict new building regulations were put into place in 1783 and 1784, which regulated the height of new buildings in relation to the width of the street, regulating the line of the cornice, the number of stories and the slope of the roofs.  Under a 1784 decree of the Parlement of Paris, the height of most new buildings was limited to 54 ''pieds'' or 17.54 meters, with the height of the attic depending upon the width of the building.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=66}}

Paris in the 18th century had many beautiful buildings, but it was not a beautiful city. The philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] described his disappointment when he first arrived in Paris in 1731: 
I expected a city as beautiful as it was grand, of an imposing appearance, where you saw only superb streets, and palaces of marble and gold. Instead, when I entered by the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, I saw only narrow, dirty and foul-smelling streets, and villainous black houses, with an air of unhealthiness; beggars, poverty; wagons-drivers, menders of old garments; and vendors of tea and old hats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Roche|title=The People of Paris: An Essay in Popular Culture in the 18th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ct-vURCb2BYC&amp;pg=PA10|year=1987|publisher=U. of California Press|page=10|accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, in ''Embellissements de Paris'', [[Voltaire]] wrote: "We blush with shame to see the public markets, set up in narrow streets, displaying their filth, spreading infection, and causing continual disorders… Immense neighbourhoods need public places. The center of the city is dark, cramped, hideous, something from the time of the most shameful barbarism."{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=133}}

The uniform neoclassical style all around the city was not welcomed by everyone.  Just before the Revolution the journalist [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] wrote: "How monotonous is the genius of our architects! How they live on copies, on eternal repetition! They don't know how to make the smallest building without columns… They all more or less resemble temples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis-Sébastien Mercier|title=Paris: Including a Description of the Principal Edifices and Curiosities of that Metropolis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIceJv8ct40C&amp;pg=PA21|year=1817|page=21|accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even functional buildings were built in the neoclassical style; the grain market (now the Chamber of Commerce) was given a neoclassical dome (1763–69) by [[Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières]].  Between 1785 and 1787, the royal government built a new wall around the edges of the city (The [[Wall of the Ferme générale]]) to prevent smuggling of goods into the city. it had fifty-five barriers, many of them in the form of Doric temples, designed by [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]]. A few still exist, notably at [[Parc Monceau]]. The wall was highly unpopular and was an important factor in turning opinion against Louis XVI, and provoking the French Revolution.

In 1774 Louis XV had constructed a monumental fountain, the [[Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons]], richly decorated with classical sculpture by [[Bouchardon]] glorifying the King, at 57–59 rue de la Grenelle. While the fountain was huge, and dominated the narrow street, it originally had only two small spouts, from which residents of the neighborhood could fill their water containers. It was criticized by [[Voltaire]] in a letter to the Count de Caylus in 1739, as the fountain was still under construction:

{{quote|I have no doubt that Bouchardon will make of this fountain a fine piece of architecture; but what kind of fountain has only two faucets where the water porters will come to fill their buckets? This isn't the way fountains are built in Rome to beautify the city. We need to lift ourselves out of taste that is gross and shabby. Fountains should be built in public places, and viewed from all the gates. There isn't a single public place in the vast [[faubourg Saint-Germain]]; that makes my blood boil. Paris is like [[Daniel 2|the statue of Nabuchodonosor]], partly made of gold and partly made of muck.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Voltaire to Caylus, extract published in A. Roserot (1902), cited by Rabreau, pg. 99.Translation by D.R Siefkin.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the French Revolution, the churches of Paris were closed and nationalized, and many were badly damaged.  Most destruction came not from the Revolutionaries, but from the new owners who purchased the buildings, and sometimes destroyed them for the building materials they contained.  The Abbey of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre was destroyed, and its church left in ruins. Parts of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés were turned into a gunpowder factory;  an explosion destroyed many of the buildings outside the church. The Church of Saint-Genevieve was turned into a mausoleum for revolutionary heroes.  The sculpture on the façade of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame was smashed or removed, and the spire torn down. Many of the abandoned religious buildings, particularly in outer neighborhoods of the city, were turned into factories and workshops.  Much of the architecture of the Revolution was theatrical and temporary, such as the extraordinary stage sets created for the [[Festival of the Supreme Being]] on the Champs-de-Mars in 1794.  However, work continued on some pre-revolutionary projects.  The rue des Colonnes in the second arrondissement, designed by Nicolas-Jacques-Antoine Vestier (1793–95), had a colonnade of simple Doric columns, characteristic of the Revolutionary period. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=66–67}}

===Monuments===
In 1806, in imitation of Ancient Rome, Napoléon ordered the construction of a series of monuments dedicated to the military glory of France. The first and largest was the [[Arc de Triomphe]], built at the edge of the city at the Barrière d'Étoile, and not finished before July 1836. He ordered the building of the smaller [[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]] (1806–08), copied from the arch of [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] and Constantine in Rome, next to the Tuileries Palace. It was crowned with a team of bronze horses he took from the façade of [[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]].  His soldiers celebrated his victories with grand parades around the Carrousel. He also commissioned the building of the [[Place Vendôme|Vendôme Column]] (1806–10), copied from the [[Trajan's Column]] in Rome, made of the iron of cannon captured from the Russians and Austrians in 1805. At the end of the Rue de la Concorde (given again its former name of Rue Roya on 27 April 1814), he took the foundations of an unfinished church, the [[La Madeleine, Paris|Église de la Madeleine]], which had been started in 1763, and transformed it into the Temple de la Gloire, a military shrine to display the statues of France’s most famous generals.

Many of Napoleon's contributions to Paris architecture were badly needed improvements to the city's infrastructure; He started a new canal to bring drinking water to the city, rebuilt the city sewers, and began construction of the Rue de Rivoli, to permit the easier circulation of traffic between the east and west of the city.&lt;ref name="Villefosse, René p. 303"&gt;Héron de Villefosse, René, ‘’Histoire de Paris’’, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; He also began construction of the [[Paris Bourse|Palais de la Bourse]] (1808–26), the Paris stock market, with its grand colonnade.  it was not finished until 1826.  In 1806 He began to build a new façade for the [[Palais Bourbon]], the modern National Assembly, to match the colonnade of the Temple of Military Glory (now the Madeleine),  directly facing it across the Place de La Concorde. {{Sfn|2012|Texier|pages=68–69}}

===The Egyptian style===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Parisians had a taste for the Egyptian style long before Napoleon;  pyramids, obelisks and sphinxes occurred frequently in Paris decoration, such as the decorative sphinxes decorating the balustrade of the Hotel Sale (now the [[Musée Picasso]]), (1654–59), and small pyramids decorating the Anglo-Chinese gardens of the [[Château de Bagatelle]] and [[Parc Monceau]] in the (18th century). However, Napoleon's Egyptian campaign gave the style a new prestige, and for the first time it was based on drawings and actual models carried back the scholars who traveled with Napoleon's soldiers to Egypt; the style soon appeared in public fountains and residential architecture, including the [[Fontaine du Fellah]] on rue de Sèvres by [[François-Jean Bralle]]  (1807) and the [[Fontaine du Palmier]] by Bralle and Louis Simon Boizot (1808). The sphinxes around this fountain were Second-Empire additions in 1856–58 by the city architect of Napoleon III, [[Gabriel Davioud]].  The grandest Egyptian element added to Paris was the [[Luxor Obelisk]] from the Temple of Thebes, offered as a gift by the Viceroy of Egypt to Louis-Philippe, and erected on the [[Place de la Concorde]] in 1836.  Examples continued to appear in the 20th century, from the Luxor movie palace on boulevard de Magenta in the 10th arrondissement (1921)  to the Louvre pyramid by [[I. M. Pei]] (1988). {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=64}}

===The debut of iron architecture===
Iron architecture made its Paris debut under Napoleon, with the construction of the [[Pont des Arts]] by Louis-Alexandre de Cessart and Jacques Lacroix-Dillon (1801–03).  This was followed by a metal frame for the cupola of the Halle aux blé, or grain market (now the Paris [[Bourse de commerce (Paris)|Bourse de Commerce]], or Chamber of Commerce).  Designed by the architect [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] and the engineer François Brunet (1811). It replaced the wooden-framed dome built by [[Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières]]  in 1767, which burned in 1802.  It was the first iron frame used in a Paris building. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=98}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Public buildings and monuments===
The royal government restored the symbols of the old regime, but continued the construction of most of the monuments and urban projects begun by Napoleon. All of the public buildings and churches of the Restoration were built in a relentlessly [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style.  Work resumed, slowly, on the unfinished [[Arc de Triomphe]], begun by Napoleon.  At the end of the reign of Louis XVIII,  the government decided to transform it from a monument to the victories of Napoleon into a monument celebrating the victory of the Duke of Angôuleme over the Spanish revolutionaries who had overthrown their Bourbon king. A new inscription was planned: "To the Army of the Pyrenees"  but the inscription had not been carved and the work was still not finished when the regime was toppled in 1830. {{sfn|Héron de Villefosse|1958|page=313}}

The [[Canal Saint-Martin]] was finished in 1822, and the building of the [[Bourse de Paris]], or stock market, designed and begun by [[Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart]] from 1808 to 1813, was modified and completed by [[Éloi Labarre]] in 1826. New storehouses for grain near the Arsenal, new slaughterhouses, and new markets were finished. Three new suspension bridges were built over the Seine;  the Pont d'Archeveché,  the Pont des Invalides and footbridge of the Grève.  All three were rebuilt later in the century.

===Religious architecture===
The church of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]], begun under Louis XVI, had been turned by Napoleon into the Temple of Glory (1807).  It was now turned back to its original purpose, as the Royal church of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]].  To commemorate the memory of [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] to expiate the crime of their execution,  King Louis XVIII built the [[Chapelle expiatoire]] designed by [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] in a neoclassical style similar to the Paris Pantheon.on the site of the small cemetery of the Madeleine, where their remains (now in the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]]) had been hastily buried following their execution. It was completed and dedicated in 1826.

Several new churches were begun during the Restoration to replace those destroyed during the Revolution. A battle took place between architects who wanted a neogothic style, modeled after Notre-Dame, or the neoclassical style, modeled after the basilicas of ancient Rome.  The battle was won by a majority of neoclassicists on the Commission of Public Buildings, who dominated until 1850. [[Jean Chalgrin]] had designed Saint-Philippe de Role before the Revolution in a neoclassical style; it was completed (1823–30) by [[Étienne-Hippolyte Godde]]. Godde also completed Chalgrin's project for Saint-Pierre-du-Gros-Caillou {1822–29), and built the neoclassic basilicas of Notre-Dame-du-Bonne Nouvelle ((1823–30) and Saint-Denys-du-Saint-Sacrament (1826–35). {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=84–85}}  Other notable neoclassical architects of the Restoration included [[Louis-Hippolyte Lebas]], who built [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Paris|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]] (1823–36); (1823–30); and [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]], who built the church of [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris|Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]] (1824–44).  Hittorff went on to along a brilliant career in the reigns of Louis Philippe and Napoleon III, designing the new plan of the Place de la Concorde and constructing the [[Gare du Nord]] railway station (1861–66). {{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page163}}

===Commercial architecture - the shopping gallery===
[[File:Galerie of the Palais Royal - interior, 1831.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Galerie d'Orleans at the [[Palais-Royal]] (1818–29), a shopping arcade covered with a glass roof, by [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]]]]
A new form of commercial architecture had appeared at the end of the 18th century; the passage, or shopping gallery, a row of shops along a narrow street covered by a glass roof. They were made possible by improved technologies of glass and cast iron, and were popular since few Paris streets had sidewalks and pedestrians had to compete with wagons, carts, animals and crowds of people.  The first indoor shopping gallery in Paris had opened at the [[Palais-Royal]] in 1786;  rows of shops, along with cafes and the first restaurants,  were located under the arcade around the garden.  It was followed by the passage Feydau in 1790–91,  the passage du Caire in 1799, and the [[Passage des Panoramas]] in 1800.{{sfn|Fierro|2003|page=36}}   In 1834 the architect [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] carried the idea a step further, covering an entire courtyard of the Palais-Royal, the Galerie d'Orleans, with a glass skylight. The gallery remained covered until 1935.  It was the ancestor of the glass skylights of the Paris department stores of the later 19th century. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=70–71}}

===Residential architecture===
[[File:Square d'Orléans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|English neoclassical house in the [[Square d'Orleans]] (1829–35) by [[Edward Cresy]]]] 
During the Restoration, and particularly after the coronation of King [[Charles X]] in 1824.  New residential neighborhoods were built on the Right Bank, as the city grew to the north and west.  Between 1824 and 1826, a time of economic prosperity, the quarters of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Europe, Beaugrenelle and Passy were all laid out and construction began.  The width of lots grew larger;  from six to eight meters wide for a single house to between twelve and twenty meters for a residential building. The typical new residential building was four to five stories high, with an attic roof sloping forty-five degrees, broken by five to seven windows.  The decoration was largely adapted from that of the Rue de Rivoli;  horizontal rather than vertical orders, and simpler decoration. The windows were larger and occupied a larger portion of the façades.  Decoration was provided by ornamental iron shutters and then wrought-iron balconies. Variations of this model were the standard on Paris boulevards until the Second Empire. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=74–75}}

The hôtel particular, or large private house of the Restoration, usually was built in a neoclassical style, based on Greek architecture or the style of [[Palladio]], particularly in the new residential quarters of Nouvelle Athenes and the Square d'Orleans on Rue Taibout (9th arrondissement), a private residential square (1829–35) in the English neoclassical style designed by Edward Cresy.  Residents of the square included [[George Sand]] and [[Frédéric Chopin]].  Some of the houses in the new quarters in the 8th arrondissement, particularly the quarter of François I, begun in 1822,  were made in a more picturesque style, a combination of the Renaissance and classical style, called the ''Troubadour'' style. This marked the beginning of the movement away from uniform neoclassicism toward eclectic residential architecture.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=74–75}}

===Monuments and public squares===
The architectural style of public buildings under the Restoration and Louis-Philippe was determined by the ''Academie des Beaux-Arts'', or Academy of Fine Arts, whose Perpetual Secretary from 1816 to 1839 was [[Quatremère de Quincy]], a confirmed neoclassicist. The architectural style of public buildings and monuments was intended to associate Paris with the virtues and glories of ancient Greece and Rome, as it had been under Louis XIV, Napoleon and the Restoration. {{Sfn|Renault|2006|page=104}}

The first great architectural project of the reign of [[Louis-Philippe]] was the remaking of the [[Place de la Concorde]] into its modern form.  The moats of the Tuileries were filled,  two large fountains, one representing the maritime commerce and industry of France, the other the river commerce and great rivers of France, designed by [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]], were put in place, along with monumental sculptures representing the major cities of France.&lt;ref&gt;*Beatrice de Andia (editor), ''Paris et ses Fontaines, de la Renaissance a nos jours'', Collection Paris et son Patrimoine, Paris, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  On 25 October 1836, a new centerpiece was put in place; a stone [[Luxor Obelisk|obelisk]] from [[Luxor]], weighing two hundred fifty tons, brought on a specially built ship from [[Egypt]], was slowly hoisted into place in the presence of Louis-Philippe and a huge crowd. {{sfn|Héron de Villefosse|1959|page=325}}  In the same year, the ''Arc de Triomphe'', begun in 1804 by Napoleon, was finally completed and dedicated. Following the return to Paris of the [[Retour des cendres|ashes of Napoleon]] from [[Saint Helena]] in 1840, they were placed with great ceremony in a tomb designed by [[Louis Visconti]] beneath the church of [[Les Invalides]].  Another Paris landmark, the [[July Column|column]] on the [[Place de la Bastille]], was inaugurated on 28 July 1840, on the anniversary of the July Revolution, and dedicated to those killed during the uprising.

Several older monuments were put to new purposes: the [[Élysée Palace]] was purchased by the French state and became an official residence, and under late governments the residence of the Presidents of the French Republic. The Basilica of Sainte-Geneviève, originally built as a church, then, during the Revolution, made into a mausoleum for great Frenchmen, then a church again during the Restoration, once again became the [[Panthéon]],  holding the tombs of great Frenchmen.

===Preservation and restoration===
The reign of Louis-Philippe saw the beginning of a movement to preserve and restore some of the earliest landmarks of Paris, inspired in large part by Victor Hugo's hugely successful novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (''Notre-Dame de Paris''), published in 1831. The leading figure of the restoration movement was [[Prosper Mérimée]], named by Louis-Philippe as the inspector General of [[Monument historique|Historic Monuments]].  The Commission of Public Monument was created in 1837, and in 1842, Mérimée began compiling the first official list of classified historical monuments, now known as the [[Base Mérimée]].

The first structure to be restored was the nave of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés|church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], the oldest in the city. Work also began in 1843 on the cathedral of Notre Dame, which had been badly damaged during the Revolution, and stripped of the statues on its façade. Much of the work was directed by the architect and historian [[Viollet-le-Duc]] who, sometimes, as he admitted, was guided by his own scholarship of the "spirit" of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] architecture, rather strict historical accuracy. The other major restorations projects were [[Sainte-Chapelle]] and the Hôtel de Ville, dating to the 17th century; the old buildings which pressed up against the back of the Hôtel de Ville were cleared away; two new wings were added, the interiors were lavishly redecorated, and the ceilings and walls of the large ceremonial salons were painted with murals by [[Eugène Delacroix]]. Unfortunately, all the interiors were burned in 1871 by the [[Paris Commune]].{{sfn|Héron de Villefosse|1959|page=325}}

===The Beaux-Arts style===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights=200px&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the same time, a small revolution was taking place at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], led by four young architects; [[Joseph-Louis Duc]], [[Félix Duban]], [[Henri Labrouste]] and [[Léon Vaudoyer]], who had first studied Roman and Greek architecture at the Villa Medici in Rome, then in the 1820s began the systematic study of other historic architectural styles; including French architecture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They instituted teaching about a variety of architectural styles at the École des Beaux-Arts,  and installed fragments of Renaissance and Medieval buildings in the courtyard of the school so students could draw and copy them. Each of them also designed new non-classical buildings in Paris inspired by a variety of different historic styles; Labrouste built the [[Sainte-Geneviève Library]] (1844–50);  Duc designed the new [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]] and [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] on the Île-de-la-Cité (1852–68); and Vaudroyer designed the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]] (1838–67), and Duban designed the new buildings of the École des Beaux-Arts. Together, these buildings, drawing upon Renaissance, Gothic and romanesque and other non-classical styles, broke the monopoly of neoclassical architecture in Paris. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=76–77}}

===The first train stations===
[[File:Victor Hubert - Paris-Saint Germain Railway 1837.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first Paris train station, on the site of the modern [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] (1837)]]
The first train stations in Paris were called ''embarcadéres'' (a term used for water traffic), and their location was a source of great contention, as each railroad line was owned by a different company, and each went in a different direction. The first ''embarcadére'' was built by the [[Péreire brothers]] for the line Paris-Saint-Germain-en-Laye, at the [[Place de l'Europe]]. It opened on 26 August 1837, and with its success was quickly replaced by a larger building on rue de Stockholm, and then an even larger structure, the beginning of the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]], built between 1841 and 1843. It was the station for the trains to Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Versailles and Rouen.

The Péreire brothers argued that Gare Saint-Lazare should be the unique station of Paris, but the owners of the other lines each insisted on having their own station. The first ''Gare d'Orléans'', now known as the ''[[Gare d'Austerlitz]]'', was opened on 2 May 1843, and was greatly expanded in 1848 and 1852. The first [[Gare Montparnasse]] opened on 10 September 1840 on ''avenue du Maine'', and was the terminus of the new Paris-Versailles line on the left bank of the Seine. It was quickly found to be too small, and was rebuilt between 1848 and 1852 at the junction of rue de Rennes and boulevard du Montparnasse, its present location. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=900–901}}

The banker [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] received the permission of the government to build the first railroad line from Paris to the Belgian border in 1845, with branch lines to [[Calais]] and [[Dunkerque]]. The first ''embarcadére'' of the new line opened on ''rue de Dunkerque'' in 1846. It was replaced by a much grander station, [[Gare du Nord]], in 1854. The first station of the line to eastern France, the [[Gare de l'Est]] was begun in 1847, but not finished until 1852. Construction of a new station for the line to the south, from Paris to [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne]] began in 1847 and was finished in 1852. In 1855 it was replaced by a new station, the first [[Gare de Lyon]], on the same site. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=900–901}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The rapidly growing French economy under [[Napoleon III]] led to major changes in the architecture and urban design of Paris. New types of architecture connected with the economic expansion;  railroad stations, hotels, office buildings, department stores and exposition halls, occupied the center of Paris, which previously had been largely residential. To improve traffic circulation and bring light and air to the center of the city,  Napoleon's Prefect of the Seine, destroyed the crumbling and overcrowded neighborhoods in the heart of the city and built a network of grand boulevards. The expanded use of new building materials, especially iron frames, allowed the construction of much larger buildings for commerce and industry. {{Sfn|Renault|2006|page=101}}

When he declared himself Emperor in 1852, Napoleon III moved his residence from the [[Élysée Palace]] to the [[Tuileries Palace]], where his uncle Napoleon I had lived, adjoining the Louvre.  He continued the construction of the [[Louvre]], following the grand design of Henry IV;  he built the Pavillon Richelieu (1857), the guichets of the Louvre (1867), and rebuilt the Pavillon de Flore;  he broke with the neo-classicism of the wings of the Louvre built by Louis XIV; the new constructions were perfectly in harmony with the Renaissance wings. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=48}}

The dominant architectural style of the Second Empire was the eclectic, drawing liberally from the architecture of the Gothic style, Renaissance style, and style of Louis XV and Louis XVI. The best example was the [[Opéra Garnier]],  begun in 1862 but not finished until 1875.  The architect was [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] (1825–1898), who won the competition against a Gothic-revival style by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]. When asked by the Empress Eugenie what the style of the building was called, he replied simply "Napoleon III."   It was at the time the largest theater in the world, but much of the interior space was devoted to purely decorative spaces; grand stairways, huge foyers for promenading, and large private boxes.  The façade was decorated with seventeen different materials, marble, stone, [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] and bronze. Other notable examples of Second Empire public architecture include the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]] and the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] by [[Joseph-Louis Duc]] (1862–68); the Tribunal de Commerce by [[Antoine-Nicolas Bailly]] (1860–65), and the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] by [[Gabriel Davioud]] (1859–62) and Theater de la Ville, facing each other on Place du Châtelet.

The Second Empire also saw the restoration of the famed stained glass windows and structure of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] by [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]]; and extensive restoration of  [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].  Later critics complained that some of the restoration was more imaginative than precisely historical.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The map and look of Paris changed dramatically under Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann. Haussmann demolished the narrow streets and crumbling medieval houses in the center of the city (including the house where he was born) and replaced them with wide boulevards lined by large residential buildings, all of the same height (Twenty meters to the cornice, or five stories on boulevards and four on narrower streets), with façades in the same style, and faced with the same cream-colored stone.  He completed the east-west axis of the city center, the [[Rue de Rivoli]] begun by Napoleon, built a new North-south axis, Boulevard de Sébastopol, and cut wide boulevards on both the right and left banks, including the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]], [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]], usually culminating in a domed landmark. if a dome was not already there, Haussmann had one built, as he did with the Tribunal de Commerce and the Church of Saint-Augustin.

The centerpiece of the new design was the new Paris Opera, designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]].  In the latter years of the Empire, he built new boulevards to connect the city center with the eight new arrondissements which Napoleon III attached to the city in 1860, along with new city halls for each arrondissement. New city halls were also built for many of the original arrondissements.  The new city hall of the First arrondissement by [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]] (1855–60), close the medieval church of Saint-Germain-Auxerois the historic center of the city.  The new city hall was in neo-Gothic style, echoing the medieval church, complete with a rose window.  A neo-Gothic bell tower by [[Théodore Ballu]]  (1862),

To provide green space and recreation for the residents of the outer neighborhoods of the city,  Haussmann built large new parks [[Bois de Boulogne]], [[Bois de Vincennes]], [[Parc Montsouris]] and [[Parc des Buttes Chaumont]] to the west, east, north and south, filled with picturesque garden follies, as well as numerous smaller parks and squares where the new boulevards met. City architect [[Gabriel Davioud]] devoted considerable attention to the details of the city infrastructure. Haussmann also built a new water supply and sewer system under the new boulevards, planted thousands of trees along the boulevards, and ornamented the parks and boulevards with kiosks, gateways, lodges and ornamental grills, all designed by Davioud.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=90=91}}

===Religious architecture - the Neo-Gothic and eclectic styles===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Religious architecture finally broke away from the neoclassical style which had dominated Paris church architecture since the 18th century.  Neo-Gothic and other historical styles began to be built, particularly in the eight new arrondissements farther from the center added by Napoleon III in 1860. The first neo-Gothic church was the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Basilica of Sainte-Clothilde]], begun by Christian Gau in 1841, finished by [[Théodore Ballu]] in 1857.  During the Second Empire, architects began to use metal frames combined with the Gothic style;  the Eglise Saint-Laurent, a 15th-century church rebuilt in Neo-Gothic style by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862–65), and [[Église Saint-Eugène-Sainte-Cécile|Saint-Eugene-Sainte-Cecile]] by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Adrien-Louis Lusson (1854–55);   and Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville by Jean-Bapiste Lassus (1854–59).  The largest new church built in Paris during the Second Empire was [[Saint-Augustin, Paris|Church of Saint Augustine]] (1860–71), by [[Victor Baltard]], the designer of the metal pavilions of the market of [[Les Halles]]. While the structure was supported by cast-iron columns, the façade was eclectic.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=78–79}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The industrial revolution and economic expansion of Paris required much larger structures, particularly for railroad stations, which were considered the new ornamental gateways to the city. The new structures had iron skeletons, but they were concealed by Beaux-Arts façades. The [[Gare du Nord]], by [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]] (1842–65), had a glass roof with iron columns thirty-eight meters high, while the façade was in the beaux-arts style faced with stone and decorated with statues representing the cities served by the railway.

The most dramatic use of iron and glass was in the new central market of Paris, [[Les Halles]] (1853–70), an ensemble of huge iron and glass pavilions designed by [[Victor Baltard]] (1805–1874).
[[Henri Labrouste]] (1801–1875)  used iron and glass to create a dramatic cathedral-like reading room for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], site Richelieu (1854–75). {{Sfn|Renault2006|pages=106}}

==The Belle Époque (1871–1913)==
{{see also|Paris architecture of the Belle Époque}}

The architecture of Paris created during the ''Belle Époque'', between 1871 and the beginning of the First World War in 1914, was notable for its variety of different styles, from [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]],  neo-Byzantine and neo-Gothic to [[Art Nouveau]], and [[Art Deco]].  It was also known for its lavish decoration and its imaginative use of both new and traditional materials, including iron, plate glass, colored tile and reinforced concrete.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The fall of Napoleon III in 1871 and advent of the Third Republic was followed by the brief Paris rule of the [[Paris Commune]]  (March–May 1871).  In the final days of the Commune, as the French Army recaptured the city, the Communards pulled down the column in [[Place Vendôme]] and burned a number of Paris landmarks, including the 16th-century [[Tuileries Palace]], the 17th-century [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], the Ministry of Justice, the Cour des Comptes,  the Conseil d'Etat, the [[Palais de la Légion d'Honneur]], the Ministry of Finance, and others.  The interior of the Tuileries Palace was completely destroyed, but the walls were still standing.  Haussmann and others called for its restoration, but the new government decided it was a symbol of the monarchy and had the walls torn down. (A fragment of the building can be seen today in the Park of the Trocadero).  Most of the others were restored to their original appearance.  To celebrate the rebuilding of the city the Parisians hosted the first of three universal expositions which attracted millions of visitors to Paris, and transformed the architecture of the city. 
* The [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1878]] saw the building of the [[Palais du Trocadéro]],  an eclectic composition of Moorish, renaissance and other styles, on the hill of Chaillot by [[Gabriel Davioud]] and Jules Bourdais (1876–78),  It was used in the Expositions of 1889 and 1900, and remained until 1937, when it was replaced by the [[Palais de Chaillot]]. 
*  The [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1889]] celebrated the centenary of the [[French Revolution]].  The [[Eiffel Tower]], (1887–89), conceived by entrepreneur [[Gustave Eiffel]], and built by engineers Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nougier and architect [[Stephen Sauvestre]], was the tallest structure in the world, was the gateway to the Exposition, and the Gallery of Machines, designed by Ferdinand Dufert and [[Victor Contamin]],  was the largest covered space in the world when it was built.  It combined modern engineering with colorful polychrome decoration, typical of the Belle Epoque.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
* The [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1900]] extended to both the right and left banks of the Seine.  It gave Paris three new landmarks;  the [[Grand Palais]], the [[Petit Palais]] and the [[Pont Alexandre III]].  The Beaux-Arts façade of the Grand Palais (1897–1900), designed by Henri Deglane, [[Charles Girault]], Albert Louvet and Albert Thomas, was a synthesis of the grand neoclassical styles of Louis XIV and Louis XV. concealed a vast interior space covered by a glass roof resting on slender iron pillars. The Petit-Palais (1897–1900), by Charles Girault, borrowed elements of Italian Renaissance architecture, and French neoclassical decorative elements from [[Les Invalides]], the hotels beside the [[Place de la Concorde]] and the palatial stables of Chantilly by [[Jean Aubert the Elder|Jean Aubert]].  Its interior was more revolutionary than the Grand Palais; Girault used reinforced concrete and iron to create a winding stairway along brightly lit galleries. The style of these two buildings, along with the colossal neoclassical style of Louis XVI, influenced the design of Paris residential and commercial buildings until 1920. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=108}}

The ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' became the most famous style of the ''Belle Époque'', particularly associated with the [[Paris Métro]] station entrances designed by [[Hector Guimard]], and with a handful of other buildings, including Guimard's ''Castel Béranger'' (1898) at 14 ''rue La Fontaine'', in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]], and the ceramic-sculpture covered house by architect [[Jules Lavirotte]] at 29 Avenue Rapp (7th arrondissement). {{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=202}} The enthusiasm for ''Art Nouveau'' did not last long; in 1904 the Guimard Metro entrance at Place de l'Opera it was replaced by a more classical entrance. Beginning in 1912, all the Guimard metro entrances were replaced with functional entrances without decoration.{{sfn|Marchand|1993|page=169}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
From the 1870s until the 1930s the most prominent style for Paris churches was the Romano-Byzantine style;  the model and most famous example was the [[Basilique du Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur]], by [[Paul Abadie]], whose design won a national exposition.  Its construction lasted the entire span of the Belle Epoque, between 1874 and 1913, under three different architects; it was not consecrated until 1919.  It was modeled after the romanesque and Byzantine cathedrals of the early Middle Ages, which Abadie had restored.  The style also appeared in the church of Notre-Dame d'Auteuil by [[Émile Vaudremer]] (1878–92)  The church of Saint-Dominque, by Leon Gaudibert, (1912–25) followed the style of Byzantine churches, with a massive central dome.  The first church in Paris to be constructed of [[reinforced concrete]] was [[Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre]], at 19 ''rue des Abbesses'' at the foot of Montmartre. The architect was [[Anatole de Baudot]], a student of [[Viollet-le-Duc]]. The nature of the revolution was not evident, because Baudot faced the concrete with brick and ceramic tiles in a colorful ''Art nouveau'' style, with stained glass windows in the same style.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=118–119}}

[[Aristide Boucicaut]] launched the first modern department store in Paris Au [[Bon Marché]], in 1852. Within twenty years, it had 1,825 employees and an income of more than 20 million francs.  In 1869 Boucicault began constructing a much larger store, with an iron frame, a central courtyard covered with a glass skylight. The architect was [[Louis-Charles Boileau]],  with assistance from the engineering firm of [[Gustave Eiffel]].  After more enlargements and modifications, the building was finished in 1887, and became the prototype for other department stores in Paris and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/celebrations2002/bonmarche.htm Naissance des grands magasins : le Bon Marché (by Jacques Marseille, in French, on the official site of the Ministry of Culture of France]&lt;/ref&gt;
Au Bon Marché was followed by au Louvre in 1865;  the [[Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville]]) in 1866, [[Printemps|Au Printemps]] in 1865; [[La Samaritaine]] in 1870, and [[Galeries Lafayette]] in 1895. All the new stores glass skylights whenever possible to fill the stores with natural light, and designed the balconies around the central courts to provide the maximum of light to each section. {{sfn|Plum|2014|page=28}}
Between 1903 and 1907 the architect [[Frantz Jourdain]] created the interior and façades of the new building of [[La Samaritaine]].{{sfn|Plum|2014|page=20}}

The safety elevator had been invented in 1852 by [[Elisha Otis]], making tall office buildings practical, and the first skyscraper, The first skyscraper, the [[Home Insurance Building]], a ten-story building with a steel frame. had been built in Chicago by [[Louis Sullivan]] in 1893–94,  but Paris architects and clients showed little interest in building tall office buildings.  Paris was already the banking and financial capital of the continent, and moreover, as of 1889 it had the tallest structure in the world, the Eiffel Tower. While some Paris architects visited Chicago to see what has happening, no clients wanted to change the familiar skyline of Paris. {{sfn|Plum|2014|pages=34–35}}

The new office buildings of the Belle Époque often made use of steel, plate glass, elevators and other new architectural technologies, but they were hidden inside sober neoclassical stone façades, and the buildings matched the height of the other buildings on Haussmann's boulevards.  The headquarters of the bank [[Crédit Lyonnais]],  built in 1883 on the boulevard des Italiens in 1883 by William Bouwens Van der Boijen, was in the Beaux-Arts style on the outside, but inside one of the most modern buildings of its time, using an iron frame and glass skylight to provide ample light to large hall where the title deeds were held.  In 1907 the building was updated with a new entrance at 15 rue du Quatre-Septembre, designed by [[Victor Laloux]], who also designed the Gare d'Orsay, now the [[Musée d'Orsay]] The new entrance featured a striking rotunda with a glass dome over a floor of glass bricks, which allowed the daylight to illuminate the level below, and the three other levels below.  The entrance was badly damaged by a fire in 1996;  the rotunda was restored, but the only a few elements still remain of the titles hall.{{sfn|Plum|2014|page=26}}

The Belle Époque was the golden age of the Paris railroad station; they served as the gateways of the city for the visitors who arrived for the great Expositions.  A new [[Gare de Lyon]] was built by Marius Tudor between 1895 and 1902, making the maximum use of glass and iron combined with a picturesque bell tower and Beaux-Arts façade and decoration. The café of the station looked down on the platform where the trains arrived.  The Gare d'Orsay (now the [[Musée d'Orsay]] was the first station in the center of the city, on the site of the old Ministry of Finance, burned by the [[Paris Commune]].  It was built in 1898–1900 in the palatial Beaux-Arts style by architect [[Victor Laloux]].  It was the first Paris station to be electrified and to place the train platforms below street level, a model soon copied by New York and other cities. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=86–87}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Private houses and apartment buildings in the Belle Époque were usually in the Beaux-Arts style, either neo-Renaissanace or neoclassical, or a mixture of the two. A good example is the Hôtel de Choudens (1901) by [[Charles Girault]], built for a client who wanted a house in the style of the [[Petit Palais]], which Giraud had designed.  Apartment buildings saw changes in the interiors;  with the development of elevators, the apartment of the wealthiest residents moved from the first floor above the street to the top floor. The rooflines of the new apartment buildings also changed, as the city removed the restrictions –imposed by Haussmann; the most extravagant example was the apartment building at 2729 quai Anatole-France in 7th arrondissement (1906) which sprouted profusion of turrets, spires and decorative arches, made possible by reinforced concrete.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=2012}}   A competition for new façades was held in 1898, and one winner was [[Hector Guimard]] for the design of a new apartment building, the [[Castel Béranger]] (1895–98]], the first Paris building in the [[Art Nouveau]] style.  The façade was inspired by the work of the Belgian Art-Nouveau pioneer [[Victor Horta]];  it used both elements of medieval architecture and curved motifs inspired by plants and flowers. Horta designed every detail of the house, including furniture, wallpaper, door handles and locks. The success of the Castel Beranger led to Guimard's selection to design the entrance of stations of the new [[Paris Métro]].  In 1901 the façade competition was won more extravagant architect, [[Jules Lavirotte]],  who designed a house for the ceramic maker [[Alexandre Bigot]] which was more a work of inhabited sculpture than a building.  The façade was entirely covered with decorative ceramic sculpture. The popularity of Art Nouveau did not last long; the last Paris building in the style was Guimard's own house, the Hôtel Guimard at 122 Avenue Mozart (1909–13).{{sfn|Lahor|2007|page=139}}

==Between the wars - Art Deco and modernism  (1919–39)==

===Art Deco===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="150px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[Art Nouveau]] had its moment of glory in Paris beginning in 1898, but was out of fashion by 1914.  The [[Art Deco]], which appeared just before the war, became the dominant style for major buildings between the wars.  The primary building material of the new era was reinforced concrete. The structure of the buildings was clearly expressed on the exterior, and was dominated by horizontal lines, with rows of bow windows and small balconies, They often had classical features, such as rows of columns, but these were expressed in a stark modern form; ornament was kept to a minimum;  and statuary and ornament was often applied, as a carved stone plaque on the façade,rather than expressed in the architecture of the building itself. {{Sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=206}}

The leading proponents of the art deco were [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Henri Sauvage]].  Perret designed the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], the first art deco building in Paris, in 1913, just before the War.  His major achievements between the wars were the building of the ''Mobilier National'' (1936) and the Museum of Public Works (1939), now the Economic and Social Council, located on place d'Iéna, with its giant rotunda and columns inspired by ancient Egypt.  Sauvage expanded the [[La Samaritaine]] department store in 1931, preserving elements of the Art-Nouveau interior and façades, while giving it an art-deco form.  He experimented with new, simpler forms of apartment buildings, including the stepped building, creating terraces for the upper floors;  and covered concrete surfaces with white ceramic tile, resembling stone. He also was a pioneer in the use of prefabricated building materials, reducing costs and construction time.

A related Paris fashion between the wars was the ''pacquebot'' style, buildings that resembled the ocean liners of the period, with sleek white façades, rounded corners, white façades, and nautical railings.  They often were built on narrow pieces of land, or on corners.  One example is the building at 3 boulevard Victor in the 15th arrondissement, built in 1935.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The international expositions of the 1920s and 1930s left fewer architectural landmarks than the earlier exhibitions.  The 1925 Exposition of decorative arts had several very modern buildings, the Russian pavilions, the art deco ''Pavillon du Collectionneur'' by Ruhlmann and the ''Pavillon d'Esprit'' by [[Le Corbusier]], but they were all torn down when the exhibit ended.  One impressive art deco building from the 1934 Colonial Exposition survived;  the Museum of the Colonies at la Port Doréé, by Albert Laprade, 89 meters long, with a colonnade and a front wall entirely covered with a bas-relief by [[Alfred Janniot]] on the animals, plants, and cultures the theme the cultures of the French colonies. The interior was filled with sculpture and murals from the period, still visible today.  Today the building is the [[Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration]], or museum of the history of immigration.

The [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition of 1937]], held on the eve of World War II,  was not a popular success;  its two largest national pavilions were those of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, facing each other across the central esplanade.  The chief architectural legacies were the [[Palais de Chaillot]], where the old Palais de Trocadero had been, by [[Jacques Carlu]], Louis Hippolyte Boileau and [[Léon Azéma]], (1935–37), built of concrete and beige stone, and the Palais de Iena, facing it.  Both were built in a monumental neoclassical style.  The nearby [[Palais de Tokyo]] was another exhibit legacy, designed by André Auber], Jean-Claude Dondel, Paul Viard and Marcel Dastugue (1934–37),  in a similar neoclassic style, with a colonnade.  It is now the modern art museum of the city of Paris.  Another exhibit legacy is the former Museum of Public Works (1936–48) at Place and Avenue Iena,  by [[Auguste Perret]].  It contains an impressive rotunda and conference hall with a neoclassical façade, all built of reinforced concrete. After the War it was converted into the headquarters of the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=138–39}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The architect [[Auguste Perret]] had anticipated modern residential style in 1904, with an art deco house of reinforced concrete faced with ceramics on Rue Franklin. [[Henri Sauvage]] also made art-deco residential buildings with clean geometric lines, made of reinforced concrete faced with white ceramic tiles. The architect Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris, better known as [[Le Corbusier]]. went further,  designing houses in geometric forms, lacking any ornament. At age of twenty-one worked as an assistant in the office of Perret.  In 1922 he opened his own architectural office with his cousin [[Pierre Jeanneret]] in 1922 and built some of his first houses in Paris, notably the [[Villa La Roche]] at 10 square du Docteur-Blanche in the 16th arrondissement, built for a Swiss pharmaceuticals magnate. Built in 1923, it introduced elements found in many of Corbusier's later buildings, including white concrete walls, was constructed in 1923, and introduced many of the themes found in Corbusier's later work, including an interior ramp between levels and horizontal bands of windows.  He also designed the furniture for the house. [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] pursued a similar modernist style, composed of geometric shapes, walls of glass, and an absence of ornament. He built a studio and residence with a large glass wall and spiral stairway for glass designer Louis Barillet at 15 square Vergennes (15th arrondissement) and constructed a series of houses for artists, each one different, on what is now known as rue Mallet-Stevens in the 16th arrondissement.  One of the most striking houses of the 1920s was the house of artist [[Tristan Tzara]] 15 avenue Junot in the 18th arrondissement. Designed by the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]]. The interior was completely irregular; each room was of a different size, and on a different level. Another unusual house was the [[Maison de Verre]] or "Glass house" at 31 rue Saint-Guillaume in the 7th arrondissement, built for Doctor Dalace by [[Pierre Chareau]], with Bernard Bijvoet (1927–31).  It was made entirely of bricks of glass, supported by a metal frame. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=128}}

Modernist buildings built in the 1920s and 1930s were relatively rare. The most characteristic Paris residential architect of the 1920s was [[Michel Roux-Spitz]],  who built a series of large luxury apartment buildings in the 1920s and 1930s, mostly in the 6th and 7th arrondissements. The buildings were all built of reinforced concrete, and featured and had white walls, often faced with stone, and horizontal rows of three-faced bow windows, a modernized version of the Haussmann apartment buildings on the same streets.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=128}}

===Public housing===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Beginning in 1919, soon after the end of World War I, the French government began building public housing on a huge scale, particularly on the vacant land of the former fortifications around the city.  The new buildings were called HBMs, or ''Habitations à Bon Marché'' (Low-cost residences].  They were concentrated to the north, east and south of the city, while a more expensive type of housing, the ILM, or ''Immeubles à loyer moyen'', or moderate priced residences,  intended for the middle class, were built to the west of the city. A special agency of architects was established to design the buildings. The first group of 2,734 new housing units, called the ''Cité de Montmartre''  was built between the Portes of Clignancourt and Montmartre between 1922 and 1928. The new buildings were constructed of concrete and brick. The earliest buildings had many decorative elements, particularly at the roofline, including concrete pergolas. The decoration became less over the years, and over time the brick gave way gradually to reinforced concrete façades. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=236}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Several new churches were built in Paris between the wars, in varied styles.  The [[Église du Saint-Esprit (Paris)|Église du Saint-Esprit]], (1928–32), designed by Paul Tournon, located at 186 Avenue Daumesnil in the 12th arrondissement, designed by Paul Tournon.  has a modern exterior, made of reinforced concrete covered with red brick and modern bell tower 75 meters high, but the central feature is a huge dome, 22 meters in diameter, The design, like that of the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur, was inspired by Byzantine churches. The interior was decorated with murals by several notable artists, including [[Maurice Denis]].  The [[Église Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot]], at 31 avenue Marceau (16th), was designed by Émile Bois (1932–38).  Its tower and massive Romanesque entrance was inspired by the churches of the [[Périgord]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin, Aline, ''Églises de Paris'' (2010), Éditions Nassin, {{ISBN|978-2-7072-0683-1}}, pages 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Church of Sainte-Odile at 2 Avenue Stephane-Mallarmé (17th arrondissement), by [[Jacques Barges]] (1935–39) has a single nave, three neo-Byzantine cupolas, and the highest bell tower in Paris.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=129}}

The [[Grand Mosque of Paris]] was one of the more unusual buildings constructed during the period. Intended to honor the Muslim soldiers from the French colonies who died for France during the war, it was designed by the architect [[Maurice Tranchant de Lunel]], and built and decorated with the assistance of craftsmen from North Africa. The project was funded by the National Assembly in 1920, construction began in 1922, and it was completed in 1924, and dedicated by the President of France, [[Gaston Doumergue]], and the Sultan of Morocco, [[Moulay Youssef]].  The style was termed "Hispano-Moorish"  and the design was largely influenced by the Grand Mosque of [[Fez]], Morocco. {{Sfn|Sarmant|2012|page=206}}

==After World War II (1946–2000)==

===The triumph of modernism===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the years after World War II, modernism became the official style for public buildings, both because it was new and fashionable, and partly because it was usually less expensive to build.  Buildings were designed to express their function, using simple geometric forms, with a minimum of ornament and decoration.  They were usually designed so that every office had its own window and view.  The materials of choice were reinforced concrete, sometimes covered with aluminum panels, and glass. The term "Palais" used for many public buildings before the war was replaced by the more modest term "Maison", or "House."   In place of decoration, the buildings often contained works of sculpture in interior courtyards and were surrounded by gardens.  There was little if anything specifically French about the new buildings; they resembled modernist buildings in the United States and other parts of Europe, and, particularly under President Mitterrand, were often designed by internationally famous architects from other countries.

Among the earliest and most influential of the new public buildings was the Maison de la Radio, the headquarters of French national radio and television, along the Seine in the 16th arrondissement, designed by [[Henry Bernard (architect)|Henry Bernard]] (1952–63).  Bernard had studied at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], won the [[Prix de Rome]], and eventually became the head of the Academy of Beaux-Arts, but he converted with enthusiasm to the new style. The Maison de Radio was composed of two circular buildings fitted one inside the other;  an outer circle facing the river, with a thousand offices;  an inner circle made up of studios;  and a 68-meter tall tower in the center, which contains the archives. It was originally designed with a concrete façade on the outer building, but it was modified and covered with a skin of aluminum and glass. It was described by its builders as a continuation toward the west of the line of great monuments beside the Seine;  the Louvre, the Grand Palais, and Palais de Chaillot. {{Sfn|Lemoine|2000|page=181}}

Other major public buildings in the monumental modernist style included the headquarters of UNESCO, the United Nations cultural headquarters, on Place Fontenoy in the 7th arrondissement, by [[Marcel Breuer]], [[Bernard Zehrfuss]] and [[Pier Luigi Nervi]] (1954–58), in the form of a tripod of three wings made of reinforced concrete, with gardens between the wings.  Each office in the building benefited from natural light and an exterior view. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=156}}  The headquarters of the French Communist Party at 2 Place du Colonel Fabien (19th arrondissement), was designed by [[Oscar Niemeyer]], who had just finished designing [[Brasília]], the new Brazilian capital city.  It was constructed between 1969 and 1980, and was an eight-story block built on columns above the street, with a smooth undulating glass façade.  The auditorium next to the building was half buried underground, covered by a concrete dome that allowed light to enter {{Sfn|Lemoine|2000|page=186}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the 1970s, French Presidents began to build major architectural projects which became their legacy, usually finished after they left office. The first was [[Georges Pompidou]], a noted admirer and patron of modern art, who made plans for what became, after his death in 1974, the [[Centre Pompidou]].  It was designed by [[Renzo Piano]] and [[Richard Rogers]], and expressed all of its mechanical functions on the exterior of the building, with brightly colored pipes, ducts and escalators. The principal architectural projects begun by his successor, [[Giscard d'Estaing]], were the conversion of the [[Musée d'Orsay]], a central railroad station transformed into a museum devoted to 19th-century French art,  (1978–86), and the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie|City of Sciences and Industry]] (1980–86) in the [[Parc de la Villette]] in the 19th arrondissement,  whose features included the [[La Géode]], a geodesic sphere 36 meters in diameter made of polished stainless steel, now containing an [[omnimax]] theater (1980–86), designed by Adrien Feinsilber. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=170–171}}

[[François Mitterrand]] (1981–95) had fourteen years in power, enough time to complete more projects than any president since Napoleon III. In the case of the Louve pyramid, he personally selected the architect, without a competition.  He completed the projects begun by Giscard and began even more ambitious projects of his own, many of them designed for the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution in 1989;   his ''Grands Travaux'' i("Great Works") included the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]], by architect [[Jean Nouvel]],  finished in 1987;  the Grand Louvre, including the glass pyramid (1983–89) designed by [[I. M. Pei]];  the [[Grande Arche]] of [[La Défense]] by the Danish architect [[Johan Otto von Spreckelsen]], a building in the form of a giant ceremonial arch, which marked the western end of the historical axis that began at the Louvre;   (inaugurated July 1989);  the [[Opéra Bastille]], by architect [[Carlos Ott]], opened on July 13, 1989, the day before the bicentennial of the French Revolution, and a new building for the Ministries of the Economy and Finance, at Bercy (12th arrondissement) (1982–88), a massive building next to the Seine which resembled both a gateway to the city and a huge bridge with its feet in the river, designed by [[Paul Chemetov]] and Borja Huidobro.  His last project was located on the other side of the Seine from the Finance Ministry; a group of four book-shaped glass towers for the [[French National Library]] (1989–95), designed by [[Dominique Perrault]].  The books were stored in the towers, while the reading rooms were located beneath a terrace between the buildings, with windows looking out onto a garden. {{Sfn|Texier|pages=170–71}}{{Sfn|Bezbakh|2004|pages=799–815}}

===The age of towers===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Until the 1960s there were no tall buildings in Paris to share the skyline with the [[Eiffel Tower]], the tallest structure in the city; a strict height limit of thirty-five meters was in place. However, in October 1958, under the Fifth Republic,  in order to permit the construction of more housing and office buildings, the rules began to change. A new urban plan for the city was adopted by the municipal council in 1959. Higher buildings were permitted, as long as they met both technical and aesthetic standards. The first new tower to be constructed was an apartment building, the Tour Croulebarbe, at 33 rue Croulebarbe in the 13th arrondissement. It was twenty-two stories, and 61 meters high, and was completed in 1961. Between 1960 and 1975, about 160 new buildings higher than fifteen stories were constructed in Paris, more than half of them in the 13th and 15th arrondissements. Most of them were about one hundred meters high; several clusters of high-rises the work one developer, Michel Holley, who built the towers of Place d'Italie, Front de Seine, and Hauts de Belleville. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=158}}

Two of the projects of residential towers were especially large; 29 hectares along the banks of the Seine at [[Beaugrenelle]], and 87 hectares between Place de l'Italie and Tolbiac. Blocks of old buildings were torn town and replaced with residential towers.{{Sfn|Marchand|1993|page=302}}

Between 1959 and 1968, the old Montparnasse railway station was demolished and rebuilt nearby, making a large parcel of land available for construction. The municipal council learned of the project only indirectly, through a message from the ministry in charge of construction projects. The first plan, proposed in 1957, was a new headquarters for Air France, a state-owned enterprise, in a tower 150 meters high. In 1959, the proposed height was increased to 170 meters. In 1965, to protect the views in the historic part of the city, the municipal council declared that the new building should be shorter, so it would not visible from the esplanade of Les Invalides. In 1967, the Prefect of Paris, representing the government of President de Gaulle, overruled the municipal council decision, raised the height to two hundred meters, to create more rentable office space. The new building, built between 1969 and 1972, was (and still is) the tallest building within the city limits.{{Sfn|Marchand|1993|page=302}}

The growing number of skyscrapers appearing on the Paris skyline provoked resistance from the Paris population.  In 1975, President [[Giscard d'Estaing]] declared a moratorium on new towers within the city, and in 1977 the City of Paris was given a new ''Plan d'Occupation des Sols'' (POS) or Land use plan, which imposed a height limit of twenty-five meters in the center of Paris and 31 meters in the outer arrondissements.  Also, new buildings are required to be constructed right up to the sidewalk, without setbacks, further discouraging very tall buildings.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=164}}  The building of skyscrapers continued outside of Paris, particularly in the new business district of [[La Défense]].

At the end of the 20th century, the tallest structure in the City of Paris and the [[Île-de-France]] was still the [[Eiffel Tower]] in the 7th arrondissement, 324 meters high, completed in 1889. The tallest building in the Paris region was the [[Tour First]], at 225 meters, located in [[La Défense]] built in 1974.

===Public housing - the HLM and the ''barre''===
[[File:Cité.JPG|thumb|right|200px|HLM, or public housing project, in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis]]
After the War Paris faced a severe housing shortage;  most of the housing in the city dated to the 19th century, and was in terrible condition. Only two thousand new housing units were constructed between 1946 and 1950.  The number rose to 4,230 in 1951 and more than 10,000 in 1956. The office of public housing of the City of Paris acquired the cheapest land it could buy, at the edges of the city. In 1961, when land within the city was exhausted, they were authorized to begin buying land in the surrounding suburbs. The first postwar social housing buildings were relatively low- three or four stories. Much larger buildings began to appear in the mid-1950s. They were built with prefabricated materials and placed in clusters. They were known as HLMs, or ''Habitations à loyer moderé'', or moderate-cost housing. A larger type of HLM began to appear in the mid-1950s, known as a ''barre'', because it was longer than it was high. The usually had between 200 and 300 apartments, were built in clusters, and were often some distance from shops and public transportation. They were welcomed by the families who lived there in the 1950s and early 1960s, but in later years they were crowded with recent immigrants and suffered from crime, drugs and social unrest.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=152–153}}

==Contemporary (2001- )==
Paris architecture since 2000 has been very diverse, with no single dominant style.  In the field of museums and monuments, the most prominent name has been [[Jean Nouvel]].  His earlier work in Paris included the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]] (1982–87), and the [[Fondation Cartier]] (1992–94), which features a glass screen between the building and the street. In 2006 he completed the [[Musée du Quai Branly]], the Presidential project of [[Jacques Chirac]], a museum presenting the cultures of Asia, Africa and the Americas. It also included a glass screen between the building and the street, as well as a façade covered with living plants. In 2015, he completed the new Paris symphony hall at La Villette. {{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages=285–286}}

The American architect [[Frank Gehry]] also made a notable contribution to Paris architect, for his American Center in Bercy (1994), which became the home of the Cinémathèque Française in 2005; and for the building of the [[Louis Vuitton Foundation]], a museum of modern and contemporary art in the [[Bois de Boulogne]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Supermodernism===
A notable new style of French architecture, called Supermodernism by critic Hans Ibeling, gives precedence to the visual sensations, spatial and tactile, of the viewer looking at the façade. The best-known architects in this school are Jean Nouvel and [[Dominique Perrault]].
* The Hôtel Berlier (1986–89) by [[Dominique Perrault]], an office building at 26-34 rule Brunneseau in the 13th arrondissement, is a block of glass, whose structure is nearly invisible. Perrault also designed the new [[French National Library]].
* The headquarters of the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' at 74–84 boulevard August-Blanqui in the 13th arrondissement, designed by Christian de Portzamparc (2005), has a façade that resembles the front page of the newspaper. 
* The administration building of the French Ministry of Culture at 182 rue Saint-Honoré (2002–04), by Francis Soler and Frédéric Druot, is an older structure whose façade is completely covered with an ornamental metal mesh. 
* The Hôtel Fouquet's Barrière at 2 rue Vernet, 23 rue Quentin-Bauchart and 46 avenue George-V, in the 8th arrondissement, designed by Édouard François, is covered by a skin of concrete which is a molding of the façade of an historic neighboring building.

===Ecological architecture===
One important theme of early-21st-century Paris architecture was making buildings that were ecologically friendly.

* The "Flower-Tower" built in 2004 by Édouard François, located at 23 rue-Albert-Roussel in the 17th arrondissement, is covered with the living foliage of bamboo plants, placed in concrete pots at the edges of the terraces on each floor, and watered automatically.
* The façade of the university restaurant building at 3 rue Mabillon in the 6th arrondissement, built in 1954,  was recovered by architect Patrick Mauger with the logs of trees, to provide better thermal isolation.
* A public housing hostel for the homeless, the Centre d'hebergement Emmaüs, designed by Emmanuel Saadi in 2011, located at 179 quai de Valmy in the 10th arrondissement, is entirely covered by photo-voltaic panels for generating solar electricity. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=180–181}}

===Conversions===
Another important theme in 21st-century Parisian architecture is the conversion of older industrial or commercial buildings for new purposes, called in French "reconversions" or  "transcriptions". 
* A large grain warehouse and flour mill in the 13th arrondissement were converted between 2002 and 2007 into buildings for the [[Paris Diderot University]] campus. The architects were Nicolas Michelin and Rudy Ricciotti.
* Les Docks, a large warehouse structure built before World War I alongside the Seine at 34 quai d'Austerlitz, was converted 2005–08 into the City of Fashion and Design, by means of a "plug-over" of ramps, stairways and passages.  The architects were Jakob and MacFarlane. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=178–179}}

===Public housing===
Since the 1980s the more recent constructions of HLMs, or public housing, in Paris have tried to avoid the massive and monotonous structures of the past, with more picturesque architectural detail, variety of styles, greater use of color,  and large complexes broken into smaller mini-neighborhoods.  The new style, called ''fragmentation'', was particularly pioneered by architects Christian de Portzamparc and Frédéric Borel. In one complex on rue Pierre-Rebière in the 17th arrondissement the 180 residences were designed by nine different teams of architects. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=172–173}}

The '''Badeschiff''' (in English, "bathing ship") is a floating public [[swimming pool]] in [[Berlin]], the capital city of [[Germany]]. Situated in the East Harbour section of the [[Spree|River Spree]], the Badeschiff allows citizens to swim in a sanitary environment near the river. The Spree itself is far too polluted to permit safe swimming.&lt;ref name=dwbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1302942,00.html |title=A Pool with a View |first=Kyle |last=James |publisher=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=2010-05-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402000218/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C2144%2C1302942%2C00.html |archivedate=2 April 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Badeschiff opened in the summer of 2004 as an art project organized by the [[Stadtkunstprojekte]] (City Art Project Society) of Berlin. It was created by local artist, [[Susanne Lorenz]], with Spanish architects AMP and Gil Wilk,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komat.de/susanne-lorenz/?site=realized/09_badeschiff&amp;lang=en Susanne Lorenz's website]&lt;/ref&gt; to enliven city life along a long-neglected stretch of the Spree.&lt;ref name=dwbs/&gt;

The pool was converted from the hull of a vessel measuring eight by thirty-two metres. It is open to the public daily from 8am to midnight. Disc jockeys commonly spin records outside the pool entrance where there is also a bar.&lt;ref name=dwbs/&gt;

[[File:Josaphat.jpg|thumb|300px|A Christian depiction of Josaphat, 12th Century manuscript]]

'''Barlaam and Josaphat''' ({{lang-la|Barlamus et Iosaphatus}}) are legendary Christian martyrs and saints. Their life story may have been based on the life of the [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;John Walbridge ''The Wisdom of the Mystic East: Suhrawardī and Platonic Orientalism'' Page 129  – 2001 "The form Būdhīsaf is the original, as shown by Sogdian form Pwtysfi and the early New Persian form Bwdysf. ... On the Christian versions see A. S. Geden, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v. "Josaphat, Barlaam and," and M. P. Alfaric, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; It tells how an Indian king persecuted the Christian Church in his realm. When astrologers predicted that his own son would some day become a Christian, the king imprisoned the young prince Josaphat, who nevertheless met the hermit Saint Barlaam and converted to Christianity. After much tribulation the young prince's father accepted the Christian faith, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.&lt;ref name="catholic-forum.com"&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden329.htm The Golden Legend: The Story of Barlaam and Josaphat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216150745/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden329.htm |date=16 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale derives from a second to fourth century [[Sanskrit]] [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] text, via a [[Manichaean]] version, then the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Kitab Bilawhar wa-Yudasaf'' (Book of Bilawhar and Yudasaf), current in [[Baghdad]] in the eighth century, from where it entered into Middle Eastern Christian circles before appearing in European versions. The two were entered in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] calendar with a feast-day on [[August 26 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|26 August]],&lt;ref name=SYNAXARISTES&gt;Great [[Synaxarium|Synaxaristes]] {{gr icon}}: ''[http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/466/sxsaintinfo.aspx Ὁ Ὅσιος Ἰωάσαφ γιὸς τοῦ βασιλιὰ τῆς Ἰνδίας Ἄβενιρ].'' 26 Αυγούστου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Roman Martyrology]] in the Western Church as "Barlaam and Josaphat" on the date of 27 November.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1900"&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur Anthony |last=Macdonnel |authorlink=Arthur Anthony Macdonell |title=A History of Sanskrit Literature |year=1900 |pages=420 |publisher=D.

==Background: the Buddha==
[[File:Battistero di parma, portale sud 03 leggenda di barlaam.JPG|thumb|Depiction of Barlaam and Josaphat at the [[Baptistery of Parma]], Italy]]
The story of '''Barlaam and Josaphat''' or '''Joasaph''' is a [[Christianity|Christianized]] and later version of the story of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], who became the [[buddhahood|Buddha]].&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Barlaam and Josaphat}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages the two were treated as Christian saints, being entered in the [[Greek Orthodox]] calendar on [[August 26 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|26 August]],&lt;ref name="SYNAXARISTES"/&gt; and in the [[Roman Martyrology]] in the Western Church as "Barlaam and Josaphat" on the date of 27 November.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1900"/&gt; In the Slavic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, these two are commemorated on [[November 19 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|19 November]]  (corresponding to 2 December on the Gregorian calendar).&lt;ref name=PRAVOSLAVIE&gt;''[http://days.pravoslavie.ru/en/Days/20121119.htm November 19/December 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301081443/http://days.pravoslavie.ru/en/Days/20121119.htm |date=1 March 2014 }}.'' Orthodox Calendar (Pravoslavie.ru).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCA&gt;''[http://oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&amp;ID=1&amp;FSID=103329 Venerable Joasaph the Prince of India].'' OCA – Feasts and Saints.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Christianized adaptation was the [[Georgian language|Georgian]] epic ''Balavariani'' dating back to the 10th century. A Georgian monk, [[Euthymius of Athos]], translated the story into [[Greek language|Greek]], some time before he was killed while visiting [[Constantinople]] in 1028 {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. There the Greek adaptation was translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] in 1048 and soon became well known in Western Europe as ''Barlaam and Josaphat''.&lt;ref&gt;William Cantwell Smith, "Towards a World Theology" (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek legend of "Barlaam and Ioasaph" is sometimes attributed to the 7th century [[John of Damascus]], but Conybeare argued it was transcribed by the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] monk [[Euthymius of Athos|Euthymius]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Conybeare, "The Barlaam and Josaphat Legend in the Ancient Georgian and Armenian Literatures" (Gorgias Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Barlaam and Josaphat was popular in the [[Middle Ages]], appearing in such works as the ''[[Golden Legend]]'', and a scene there involving three caskets eventually appeared, via [[William Caxton|Caxton]]'s English translation of a Latin version, in [[Shakespeare]]'s "[[The Merchant of Venice]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sangharakshita, "From Genesis to the Diamond Sutra – A Western Buddhist's Encounters with Christianity" (Windhorse Publications, 2005), p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Middle High German]] versions were produced: one, the "Laubacher ''Barlaam''", by Bishop [[Otto II of Freising]] and another, ''Barlaam und Josaphat'', a [[Chivalric romance|romance]] in verse, by [[Rudolf von Ems]]. The latter was described as "perhaps the flower of religious literary creativity in the German Middle Ages" by [[Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Die Blüte der heiligen Dichtkunst im deutschen Mittelalter ist vielleicht »Barlaam und Josaphat«...''  See Heinrich Heine, [http://www.heinrich-heine.net/schule/schuled1.htm Die romantische Schule (Erstes Buch)]  at heinrich-heine.net. {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Josaphat was re-told as an exploration of [[free will]] and the seeking of inner peace through [[meditation]] in the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==The legend==
According to the legend, King Abenner or Avenier in India persecuted the Christian Church in his realm, [[St. Thomas Christians|founded by]] the [[Apostle Thomas]]. When astrologers predicted that his own son would some day become a Christian, Abenner had the young prince Josaphat isolated from external contact. Despite the imprisonment, Josaphat met the hermit Saint Barlaam and converted to Christianity. Josaphat kept his faith even in the face of his father's anger and persuasion. Eventually Abenner converted, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.&lt;ref name="catholic-forum.com"/&gt;

==Name==
Ioasaph (Georgian ''Iodasaph'', Arabic ''Yūdhasaf'' or ''Būdhasaf'') is derived from the Sanskrit ''[[Bodhisattva]]''.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1900"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Trainor (ed), "Buddhism" (Duncan Baird Publishers, 2001), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit word was changed to ''Bodisav'' in Persian texts in the 6th or 7th century, then to ''Budhasaf'' or ''Yudasaf'' in an 8th-century Arabic document (possibly Arabic initial "b" ﺑ changed to  "y" ﻳ by [[Arabic alphabet|duplication of a dot]] in handwriting).&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Choisnel Les Parthes et la Route de la soie 2004 Page 202 "Le nom de Josaphat dérive, tout comme son associé Barlaam dans la légende, du mot Bodhisattva. Le terme Bodhisattva passa d'abord en pehlevi, puis en arabe, où il devint Budasaf. Étant donné qu'en arabe le "b" et le "y" ne different que ..."&lt;/ref&gt; This became ''Iodasaph'' in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the 10th century, and that name was adapted as ''Ioasaph'' in Greece in the 11th century, and then was assimilated to ''[[Jehoshaphat|Iosaphat/Josaphat]]'' in Latin.&lt;ref name="D.M. Lang 1957"&gt;D.M. Lang, The Life of the Blessed Iodasaph: A New Oriental Christian Version of the Barlaam and Ioasaph Romance (Jerusalem, Greek Patriarchal Library: Georgian MS 140), BSOAS 20.1/3 (1957):&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feast day==
Although Barlaam and Josaphat were never formally [[canonized]], they were included in earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology (feast day 27 November)&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Choisnel Les Parthes et la Route de la soie 2004 – Page 202 "Dans l'Église grecque orthodoxe, Saint Josaphat a été fêté le 26 août et, dans l'Église romaine, le 27 novembre a été la ... D. M. Lang, auteur du chapitre « Iran, Armenia and Georgia » dans la Cambridge History of Iran, estime pour sa part ..."&lt;/ref&gt; — though not in the [[Roman Missal]] — and in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] liturgical calendar (26 August in Greek tradition etc.&lt;ref name="SYNAXARISTES"/&gt; / 19 November in Russian tradition).&lt;ref name="PRAVOSLAVIE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCA"/&gt;

==Texts==
[[File:Barlaam and Josaphat. English lives of Buddha.djvu|page=9|thumb|180px|A page from the 1896 edition by Joseph Jacobs at the University of Toronto (Click on image to read the book)]]
There are a large number of different books in various languages, all dealing with the lives of Saints Barlaam and Josaphat in [[India]]. In this hagiographic tradition, the life and teachings of Josaphat have many parallels with those of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]. "But not till the mid-nineteenth century was it recognised that, in Josaphat, the Buddha had been venerated as a Christian saint for about a thousand years."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674990388 Barlaam and Ioasaph, John Damascene, Loeb Classical Library 34, Introduction by David M. Lang ]&lt;/ref&gt; The authorship of the work is disputed. The origins of the story seem to be a Central Asian manuscript written in the [[Manichaean]] tradition. This book was translated into [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Arabic]].

===Greek manuscripts===
The best-known version in Europe comes from a separate, but not wholly independent, source, written in [[Greek language|Greek]], and, although anonymous, attributed to a monk named John. It was only considerably later that the tradition arose that this was [[John of Damascus]], but most scholars no longer accept this attribution. Instead much evidence points to [[Euthymius of Athos]], a Georgian who died in 1028.&lt;ref name=loeb&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674990388 Barlaam and Ioasaph, John Damascene], Loeb Classical Library 34, at LOEB CLASSICAL LIBRARY&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern edition of the Greek text, from the 160 surviving variant manuscripts (2006), with introduction (German, 2009) is published as Volume 6 of the works of John the Damascene by the monks of the [[Abbey of Scheyern]], edited by Robert Volk. It was included in the edition due to the traditional ascription, but marked "spuria" as the translator is the Georgian monk [[Euthymius the Hagiorite]] (ca. 955–1028) at [[Mount Athos]] and not John the Damascene of the [[monastery of Saint Sabas]] in the [[Judaean Desert]]. The 2009 introduction includes an overview&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-06-04.html Pieter W. van der Horst, Utrecht – Review of 2006/2009 Robert Volk edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===English manuscripts===
Among the manuscripts in English, two of the most important are the [[British Museum]] ''MS Egerton 876'' (the basis for Ikegami's book) and  ''MS Peterhouse 257'' (the basis for Hirsh's book) at the [[University of Cambridge]].
The book contains a tale similar to The Three Caskets found in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and later in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.&lt;ref name=loeb/&gt;

'''Cabaret Mechanical Theatre''' is an English organisation that mounts exhibitions around the world of contemporary [[automata]] by a collective of artists. Founded by Sue Jackson, the group played a central role in the revival of automata from the 1970s onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midweekherald.co.uk/what-s-on/thg-to-take-a-curious-turn-with-mechanical-sculptures-in-honiton-1-5385780|title=THG to take a curious turn with mechanical sculptures in Honiton|first=Andrew|last=Coley|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jackson championed the idea of automata as a form of [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/25/sue-jackson-obituary|title=Sue Jackson obituary|first=Martin|last=Plimmer|date=25 April 2016|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabaret Mechanical Theatre was started in 1979 in [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], where Jackson encouraged local artists Peter Markey, Paul Spooner and [[Ron Fuller (artist)|Ron Fuller]] to manufacture automata for her craft shop, "Cabaret". The shop became an exhibition space&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; and the collection moved to [[Covent Garden]], central London, in 1984,&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; remaining there until 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=BBC – Radio 4 Woman's Hour – Cabaret Mechanical Theatre | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/04/2007_16_fri.shtml | publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; when rising rates forced it to close.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

'''Chelsea College of Arts''' is a constituent college of the [[University of the Arts London]] based in London, UK, and is a leading British art and design institution with an international reputation.&lt;ref name="Best British Art Schools"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4845433.ece |title=Best British Art Schools (The Times) |work= |accessdate=14 May 2009 | location=London | first=Natasha | last=Lennard | date=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers [[further education|further]] and higher education courses in fine art, [[graphic design]], interior design, [[spatial design]] and [[textile design]] up to PhD level.

==History==
===Polytechnic===
Chelsea College of Arts was originally an integral school of the '''South-Western Polytechnic''', which opened at Manresa Road, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], in 1895 to provide scientific and technical education to Londoners. Day and evening classes for men and women were held in [[domestic worker|domestic]] economy, mathematics, engineering, [[natural science]], art and music. Art was taught from the beginning of the [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|Polytechnic]], and included design, [[weaving]], [[embroidery]] and [[Electrophoretic deposition|electrodeposition]]. The South-Western Polytechnic became the '''Chelsea Polytechnic''' in 1922 and taught a growing number of registered students of the [[University of London]].

At the beginning of the 1930s, the School of Art began to widen, including courses in [[craft]] training and commercial design from 1931. H.S Williamson, the school's appointed headmaster from 1930 to 1958, introduced sculpture shortly after [[World War II]]. Notable artists from this period were employed as teachers such as [[Henry Moore]] and [[Graham Sutherland]]. Alumni from this period included [[Elizabeth Frink]], [[Edward Burra]], [[Patrick Caulfield]], [[Ethel Walker]], [[Dirk Bogarde]], [[Robert Clatworthy (sculptor)|Robert Clatworthy]], [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] and [[John Berger]].

The School of Science separated and became known as the '''Chelsea College of Science and Technology''' in 1957, and was later admitted as a constituent College of the [[University of London]] in 1966. The Chelsea College of Science and Technology was granted its [[Royal Charter]] in 1971 and merged with [[King's College London]] and [[Queen Elizabeth College]] in 1985.

===Chelsea School of Art===
The School of Art merged with the '''Hammersmith School of Art''', founded by Francis Hawke, to form the '''Chelsea School of Art''' in 1908. The newly formed school was taken over by the [[London County Council]] and a new building erected at Lime Grove, which opened with an extended curriculum. A trade school for girls was erected on the same site in 1914.
[[Image:Chelsea College of Art and Design - 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Chelsea College of Art and Design (South Block)]]

The school acquired premises at [[Great Titchfield Street]], and was jointly accommodated with [[Quintin Hogg (merchant)|Quintin Hogg]]'s [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|Polytechnic]] in [[Regent Street]] (a forerunner of the [[University of Westminster]]). The campus at Manresa Road introduced painting and [[graphic design]] in 1963, with both disciplines being particularly successful. During this period, Chelsea had the highest enrolment of fine art students in any school of its kind in the country, producing many notable artists such as [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]] and [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]].

[[Lawrence Gowing]], painter and [[art historian]], was appointed as the first headmaster of the Chelsea School of Art. He was responsible for the integration of history and theory with practice, employing artists rather than art historians to teach art history and theory. This approach remains intrinsic to Chelsea's teaching philosophy today.

Under Gowing, an option programme was introduced, which encompassed workshops in experimental music, poetry, [[psychoanalysis]], philosophy and [[anthropology]]. A basic design course, pioneered by [[Victor Pasmore]] and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], was also developed during the same period, becoming the basis of the college's current [[foundation degree|foundation course]] in art and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chelsea College of Arts, University of the Arts London|url=http://www.hotcourses.com/course-provider/chelsea-college-of-art-and-design-university-of-the-arts-london/66536/|publisher=www.hotcourses.com|accessdate=30 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421042517/http://www.hotcourses.com/course-provider/chelsea-college-of-art-and-design-university-of-the-arts-london/66536/|archive-date=21 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor William Callaway, Head of School from 1989 to 1992. Colin Cina, appointed Dean of School of Art, and Bridget Jackson, Dean of School of Design. These three reformed the school and ensured the redevelopment of the entire academic program, introducing courses at multiple levels from [[Higher National Diploma|HND]] to accredited Honours and Postgraduate degrees. Initially, these were validated by the UK Council for National Academic Awards; i.e. in the short period prior to the London Institute gaining degree-awarding powers. Bridget Jackson was appointed Head of College in 1993, retiring in 1997 to be succeeded by Professor Colin Cina who led the college until his retirement in 2003.

===London Institute===
The Chelsea School of Art became a constituent College of the '''[[London Institute]]''' in 1986, formed by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] to associate London's art, design, fashion and media schools into a collegiate structure. The school was renamed '''Chelsea College of Art and Design''' in 1989. The London Institute was granted University status and was renamed [[University of the Arts London]] in 2004. In 2013, the College was renamed Chelsea College of Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/chelsea/ |title=Chelsea College of Arts – University of the Arts London |publisher=Arts.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002–2003, Professor Roger Wilson was appointed as the Head of College until his retirement in 2006. He led the relocation to the [[listed building|listed]] [[Royal Army Medical College]], renovated as a purpose-built art college by the architects [[Allies and Morrison]] in 2005. With this move, the Chelsea College of Arts presently resides next to [[Tate Britain]] at [[Millbank]], returning to one standalone campus.&lt;ref name="History (Official)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelsea.arts.ac.uk/history.htm |title=History (Official) |work=Chelsea.arts.ac.uk |accessdate=21 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803230056/http://www.chelsea.arts.ac.uk/history.htm |archivedate=3 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History (AIM25)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=6043&amp;inst_id=55&amp;nv1=search&amp;nv2=basic |title=History (AIM25) |work=Aim25.ac.uk |accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
The college comprises three notable on-site exhibition spaces:

#Chelsea Space is an international and interdisciplinary platform for professional practitioners to exhibit experimental curatorial projects. The gallery also releases regular publications from participating [[authors]], artists and designers.
#The Parade Ground, situated within the college, has been transformed into London's largest open-air gallery hosting events from film screenings to large scale installations in spring 2008. The exhibition ground had previously been used for students and professionals as an open area platform, notably artist [[Chris Burden]]'s 'A Flying Steamroller' in 2006. Recent exhibitions include [[Cildo Meireles]]'s 'Occasion', held in association with his exhibition at [[Tate Modern]] in 2008.
#The Triangle Gallery, pertaining to its name, has been designed as a modern angular shaped space for students to show their work throughout the year.

==Research==
The college organises its research activities in partnership with [[Camberwell College of Arts]] and [[Wimbledon College of Art]] hosts a variety of research centres, groups and clusters:
# International Centre for Fine Art Research (ICFAR)

'''Christian views on the [[classics]]''' have varied widely throughout history.

==Early period==
When Christianity at first appeared in [[Rome]], introduced by [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]], the instruction of youth was largely confined to the basics of reading, writing and mathematics followed by the study of grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and history.  Much of the history was in verse; chief among which were the works of [[Horace]] and [[Virgil]]. Until the [[peace of the Church]], early in the fourth century, the value and use of classical studies were unquestioned. Converts to Christianity brought with them such mental cultivation as they had received while [[paganism|pagans]]. They used their knowledge of [[mythology]] and ancient traditions as a means of attacking paganism. [[Tertullian]] forbade Christians to teach, but admitted that school attendance by Christian pupils was unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De idolatria'', 10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnobius]],&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius, ''Adversus nationes'', II, 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lactantius]], and Cassianus&lt;ref&gt;Prudentius, ''Liber Peristephanon'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; were classical Christian teachers.&lt;ref&gt;De Rossi, ''Roma Sotterranea'', II, 810&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fourth century the value of secular literature began to be questioned by [[Bible|Biblical scholars]]. This opposition is condensed in the accepted translation, dating from [[Jerome]] from [[Psalm]] 70:15-16  ''Quoniam non cognovi litteraturam, introibo in potentias Domini; Domine memorabor justitiae tuae solius''. (Because I have not known learning I will enter into the powers of the LORD: O LORD I will be mindful of thy justice alone.[[Douay-Rheims]] 1899) The opposition between [[divine judgement]] and literature became gradually an accepted Christian idea.

Later persecution under [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] led Christian writers to express more definitely their views on the subject. It produced little effect in the West. However, [[Marius Victorinus]], one of the most distinguished professors in Rome, chose "to give up the idle talk of the school rather than the Word of God."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Confessions'', VIII, 5&lt;/ref&gt; Thenceforth, Christians studied more closely and more appreciatively their own literature, i.e., the Biblical writings. Jerome discovers therein a Horace, a [[Catullus]] and an [[Alcaeus of Messene|Alcaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Epistle 30''&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''De doctrina christiana'' Augustine shows how the Scriptures could be turned to account for the study of [[eloquence]]; he analyses periods of the prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and shows excellent examples of rhetorical figures in the Pauline Epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De doctrina christiana'', IV, 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; It would seem that the Church, therefore, ought to have given up the study of pagan literature. It did not do so. Augustine suggested his method only to those who wished to become priests, and even for these he did mean to make it obligatory. Men of less marked ability were to use the ordinary method of instruction. The ''De doctrina christiana'' was written in 427, at which time his advancing age and the increasing strictness of monastic life might have inclined Augustine to a rigorous solution. Jerome's scruples and the dream he relates in one of his letters are quite well known. In this dream he saw angels scourging him and saying: "Thou art not a Christian, thou art a Ciceronian."&lt;ref&gt;Paul, ''Epistle 25''&lt;/ref&gt; He finds fault with ecclesiastics who find too keen a pleasure in the reading of Virgil; he adds, nevertheless, that youths are indeed compelled to study him.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, ''Epistle 21''&lt;/ref&gt; In his quarrel with [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] he declares that he has not read the profane authors since he left school, "but I admit that I read them while there. Must I then drink the waters of [[Lethe]] that I may forget?"&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Adv. Ruf.'', I, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In defending himself the first figure that occurs to him is taken from mythology. What these eminent men desired was not so much the separation but the combination of the treasures of profane literature and of Christian truth. Jerome recalls the precept of [[Deuteronomy]]: "If you desire to marry a captive, you must first shave her head and eyebrows, shave the hair on her body and cut her nails, so must it be done with profane literature, after having removed all that was earthly and idolatrous, unite with her and make her fruitful for the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Epistle 83''&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine uses another Biblical allegory. For him, the Christian who seeks his knowledge in the pagan authors resembles the [[Israelite]]s who despoil the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] of their treasures in order to build the tabernacle of God. As to [[Ambrose]], he has no doubts whatever. He quotes quite freely from [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Virgil, and the ''Consolatio'' of [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus|Servius Sulpicius]]. He accepts the earlier view handed down from the Hebrew apologists to their Christian successors, viz., that whatever is good in the literature of antiquity comes from the Sacred Books. [[Pythagoras]] was a Jew or, at least, had read [[Moses]]. The pagan poets owe their flashes of wisdom to [[David]] and [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]]. [[Tatian]], following earlier Jews had learnedly confirmed this view, and it recurs, more or less developed, in the other Christian apologists. In the West [[Minucius Felix]] gathered carefully into his ''Octavius'' whatever seemed to show harmony between the new doctrine and ancient learning. This was a convenient argument and served more than one purpose.

But this concession presupposed that pagan studies were subordinate to Christian truth, the "Hebraica veritas". In the second book of his ''[[De doctrina christiana]]'', Augustine explains how pagan classics lead to a more perfect apprehension of the Scriptures, and are indeed an introduction to them. In this sense Jerome, in a letter to Magnus, professor of eloquence at Rome, recommends the use of profane authors; profane literature is a captive.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Epistle 85''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, men neither dared nor were able to do without classical teaching. Rhetoric continued to inspire a kind of timid reverence. The [[panegyric|panegyrists]], for example, do not trouble themselves about the [[Roman Emperor|emperor's]] religion, but addressed him as pagans would a pagan and draw their literary embellishments from mythology. [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] himself did not dare to exclude pagan authors from the school. A professor like [[Ausonius]] pursued the same methods as his pagan predecessors. [[Magnus Felix Ennodius]], deacon of Milan under [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] and later Bishop of [[Pavia]], inveighed against the impious person who carried a statue of [[Minerva]] to a disorderly house, and himself under pretext of an "epithalamium" wrote light and trivial verses. It is true that Christian society at the time of the [[migration period|barbarian invasions]] repudiated mythology and ancient culture, but it did not venture to completely banish them. In the meantime the public schools of antiquity were gradually closed. Private teaching took their place but even that formed its pupils, e.g. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], according to the traditional method. Christian asceticism, however, developed a strong feeling against secular studies. As early as the fourth century [[Martin of Tours]] finds that men have better things to do than study. There are lettered monks at [[Lérins Abbey|Lérins]], but their scholarship is a relic of their early education, not acquired after their monastic profession. The [[Rule of Benedict]] prescribes reading, it is true, but only sacred reading. [[Gregory the Great]] condemns the study of literature so far as bishops are concerned. [[Isidore of Seville]] condenses all ancient culture into a few data gathered into his ''Origines'', just enough to prevent all further study in the original sources. [[Cassiodorus]] alone shows a far wider range and makes possible a deeper and broader study of letters. His encyclopedic grasp of human knowledge links him with the best literary tradition of pagan antiquity. He planned a close union of secular and sacred science whence ought to issue a complete and truly Christian method of teaching. Unfortunately the invasions of the barbarians followed and the ''Institutiones'' of Cassiodorus remained a mere project.

==Medieval period==
About the middle of the sixth century, the first indication of classical culture were seen in [[Great Britain|Britain]], and,  towards the close of the century, in [[Ireland]]. Irish scholars and then teachers, created a culture which the Anglo-Saxons developed. This culture placed literature and [[science]] at the service of [[theology]] and [[exegesis]]. They devoted themselves chiefly to grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics.

It is quite unlikely that manuscripts had been brought to Ireland between 350 and 450, to bring about a much later literary renaissance. The small ecclesiastical schools almost everywhere preserved elementary teaching, reading and writing. Irish scholarship went far beyond that.

During the sixth and seventh centuries, manuscripts were still being copied in continental Europe. The writing of this period is [[uncial]] or semi-uncial. Even after eliminating fifth- century manuscripts there still remains a fair number of manuscripts in this style of writing. We find among these works practical information: glossaries, treatises on [[surveying|land-surveying]], [[medicine]], the [[veterinary medicine|veterinary art]], [[jurisprudence|juridical]] commentaries.

On the other hand, the numerous ecclesiastical manuscripts prove the persistence of certain scholarly traditions. The continuations of sacred studies sufficed to bring about the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. It was likewise a purely ecclesiastical culture which the Irish brought back to the continent in the sixth and seventh centuries. The chief aim of these Irish monks was to preserve and develop religious life. When the scattered items of information are examined, especially the hagiological indications, their importance is peculiarly diminished, for the teaching in question generally concerns Scripture or theology. Even [[Columbanus]] does not seem to have organized literary studies in his monasteries. The Irish monks had a personal culture which they did not make any effort to diffuse, owing to the great distance between centers of learning. Moreover, the disciples of the Irish were men enamoured of ascetic mortification, who shunned an evil world and sought a life of prayer and penance. For such minds, beauty of language and verbal rhythm were frivolous attractions. The material equipment of the Irish religious establishments in Gaul scarcely admitted any other study than that of the Scriptures. Generally these establishments were but a group of huts surrounding a small chapel.

Thus, until [[Charlemagne]] and [[Alcuin]], intellectual life was confined to Great Britain and Ireland. It was revived in [[Gaul]] in the eighth century, when the classic Latin literature was again studied.  Pagan authors were read as secondary to Scripture and theology. Even towards the close of his life, Alcuin forbade his monks to read Virgil. [[Statius]] is the favourite poet, and, before long, [[Ovid]], whose licentiousness is glossed over by allegorical interpretation. Mediocre abstracts and compilations, products of academic decadence, appear among the books frequently read, e.g. [[Homerus latinus]] (''Ilias Latina''), [[Dictys]], [[Dares]], the distichs ascribed to [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]. Cicero is almost overlooked, and two distinct personages are made of Tullius and Cicero. There were a number of classical authors studied until the thirteenth century.

At the close of the twelfth century, in the early years of the University of Paris, the principal known authors are: Statius, Virgil, Lucian, Juvenal, Horace, Ovid (with exception of the erotic poems and the satires), Sallust, Cicero, Martial, Petronius (judged as combining useful information and dangerous passages), Symmachus, Solinus, Sidonius, Suetonius, Quintus Curtius, Justin (known as Trogus Pompeius), Livy, the two Senecas (including the tragedies), Donatus Priscian, Boethius, Quintilian, Euclid, and Ptolemy. In the thirteenth century the influence of Aristotle restricted the field of reading.

There are, however, a few real Humanists among the medieval writers. Einhard (770-840), Rabanus Maurus (776-856), the ablest scholar of his time, and Walafrid Strabo (809-849) are men of extensive and disinterested learning. Servatus Lupus, Abbot of Ferrières (805-862), in his quest for Latin manuscripts labours as zealously as any scholar of the fifteenth century. At a later period Latin literature is represented by Remigius of Auxerre (d. 908), Gerbert (later Pope Sylvester II d. 1003), Liutprand of Cremona (d. about 972), John of Salisbury (1110–1180), Vincent of Beauvais (d. 1264), and Roger Bacon (d. 1294).

Medieval Latin poetry drew its inspiration from Latin poetry. Among the imitations must be mentioned the works of Hroswitha (or Roswitha), Abbess of Gandersheim (close of the tenth century), whom Virgil, Prudentius, and Sedulius inspired to celebrate the acts of Otho the Great. She is of particular interest in the history of the survival of Latin literature, because of her comedies after the manner of Terence. It has been said that she wished to cause the pagan author to be totally forgotten. This statement is not reconcilable with her known simplicity of character. A certain facility in the dialogue and clearness of style do not offset the lack of ideas in her writings. They exhibit the fate of classical culture in the Middle Ages. Hroswitha imitates Terence, indeed but without understanding him, and in a ridiculous manner. The poems on actual life of Hugh of Orléans known as "Primas" or "[[Archpoet|Archipoeta]]" are far superior and betray genuine talent as well as an intelligent grasp of Horace.

&lt;!---probably should be merged with the above material---&gt;
During the Middle Ages the Church preserved secular literature by harboring and copying its works in monasteries, where valuable libraries existed as early as the ninth century:
*in Italy, at [[Monte Cassino]] (founded in 529), and at [[Bobbio]] founded in 612 by Columbanus);
*in Germany at [[Saint Gall]] (614), [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]] (794), [[Fulda]] (744), [[Lorsch]] (763), [[Hersfeld]] (768), [[Corvey]] (822), [[Hirschau]] (8430);
*in France at St. [[Martin of Tours]] (founded in 372, but later restored), Fleury or [[Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire]] (620), [[Ferrières Abbey|Ferrières]] (630), [[Corbie]] (662), [[Cluny]] (910).

The reforms of Cluny and later of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] were not favourable to studies. The chief aim of the reformers was to combat the secular spirit and re-establish strict religious observances. This influence is in harmony with the tendencies of scholasticism. Consequently, from the twelfth century and especially the thirteenth, the copying of manuscripts became a secular business, a source of gain. The following is a list of the most ancient or most useful manuscripts of the Latin classics for the Middle Ages:
*Eighth-ninth centuries: [[Cicero]]'s Orations, [[Horace]], the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Martial]].
*Ninth century: [[Terence]], [[Lucretius]], [[Cicero]], [[Sallust]], [[Livy]], [[Ovid]], [[Lucan]], [[Valerius Maximus]], [[Columella]], [[Persius]], the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Quintus Curtius]], the [[Thebaid]] of [[Statius]], [[Silius Italicus]], [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Juvenal]], [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]], [[Florus]], [[Claudian]].
*Ninth-Tenth centuries: Persius, Quintus Curtius, [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], Cicero, Horace, Livy, [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], Lucan, the philosopher Seneca, [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], Martial, [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].
*Tenth century: Caesar [[Catullus]], Cicero, Sallust, [[Lio]], Ovid, Lucan, Persius, Quintus Curtius, Pliny the Elder, [[Quintilian]], Statius, Juvenal.
*Eleventh century: Caesar, Sallust, Livy, Ovid, Tacitus, [[Apuleius]].
*Thirteenth century: [[Cornelius Nepos]], [[Propertius]], [[Varro]], "De lingua latina".

This list is incomplete. An author like Quintus Curtius is represented by numerous manuscripts in every century. Another, like Lucretius, was not copied anew between the ninth century and the Renaissance. Moreover, it was customary to compile manuscripts of epitomes and anthologies, some of which have preserved the only extant fragments of ancient authors. The teaching of grammar was deficient. This may account for the backwardness of philological science in the Middle Ages. Latin grammar is reduced to an abridgment of Donatius, supplemented by the meagre commentaries of the teacher, and replaced since the thirteenth century by the "Doctrinale" of Alexander de Villedieu (de Villa Dei).

'''Codarts University for the Arts''' ({{lang-nl|Codarts hogeschool voor de kunsten}}) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[vocational university]] in [[Rotterdam]] that teaches music, dance and circus. It was established in its present location in 2000.

==History==

Codarts can trace its origins to the  Rotterdam Conservatorium voor Muziek (Rotterdam Conservatory of Music), popularly known as the Conservatorium Holthaus after its director, Jos Holthaus (1879-1943).&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
In 1930 the alternative Rotterdamsch Toonkunst Conservatorium (Rotterdam Musical Arts Conservatory) was founded with the composer [[Willem Pijper]] as director.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;
The Rotterdamse Dansschool (Rotterdam Dance School) was established in 1931 by [[Corrie Hartong]] as director and the German dancer [[Gertrud Leistikow]] as a teacher.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;  
At first the dance school was part of the Conservatorium Holthaus.&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
In 1935 the dance school transferred to Pijper's conservatory.  
Hartong remained as director. She was to stay in this position until 1961, and continued to teach until 1967.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;

[[World War II]] broke out in 1939 and the Netherlands were invaded in May 1940. On 14 May 1940 the buildings of the dance school and the main building of Pijper's conservatory were destroyed by bombs.  It was decided to merge Pijper's and Holthaus's conservatories into one building on Mathenesserlaan, where Holthaus had a branch.
Soon they moved again to a big old house that had somehow been spared, totally surrounded by rubble, and managed to continue day classes and early evening classes before curfew throughout the remainder of the war.
Until Holthaus died in 1943 the combined conservatory had two directors.&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;

The Rotterdamse Dansschool was renamed the Rotterdamse Dansacademie (Rotterdam Dance Academy) in 1954.  In 1986 the Conservatory and Dance Academy became the Hogeschool voor Muziek en Theater Rotterdam (Rotterdam University of Music and Theatre).&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
The school moved into its present modern building next to the [[De Doelen|Doelen]] concert hall in 2000 under the name Codarts - hogeschool voor de kunsten (Codarts - University of the Arts).&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;
The Circus arts program was launched in September 2006.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;

Codarts has three divisions: the Rotterdam Conservatory, Rotterdam Dance Academy, and Rotterdam Circus Arts.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;

The Rotterdam Conservatory is one of the largest conservatories in the Netherlands, with over 900 pupils.
It offers courses through which students may obtain a bachelor's degree in any of several disciplines: Music Theater, Pop, Jazz, Composition/arranging, Music Production, Argentinean tango, Indian music, Flamenco, Latin/Latin jazz/Brazilian, Turkish music, Classical music, and Music in Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The school puts on public performances, at times using the adjacent [[De Doelen]] concert hall.
Thus in April 2011 guest conductor [[Arie van Beek]] led the Codarts Orchestra and Codarts Chamber Choir in a performance in the Jurriaanse Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In September 2011 the Codarts Ensemble performed a program that explored the boundary between classical music and jazz, 
with works by Stravinsky, Gershwin, Shostakovich, Antheil and Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Dance Academy teaches dancers and arranges for students to appear in performances and tours.
Codarts helps students gain practical experience with internships with noted dance companies, and participates in student exchange programs with other European and American dance schools.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;
In May 2011 the Rotterdam Dance Academy performed at the [[Venice Biennale]] with a show called ''Talent on the Move''.
The program included works by established choreographers such as  [[Jiří Kylián]], [[Nacho Duato]] and [[Mauro Bigonzetti]] and by younger artists including graduates of the academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Circus Arts school began offering a bachelor's course in September 2006, training students for careers in [[Contemporary circus|contemporary]] and traditional circus, in [[variety show]]s and in local or street theater.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;
Circus students learn dance and drama as well as a wide range of circus techniques to prepare for a professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Building==
[[File:CodartsRotterdam2017.jpg|thumb|Codarts Rotterdam]]
The building abuts the 1966 [[De Doelen]] concert and conference building, home of the [[Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was built as part of an overall plan for an extension to De Doelen defined in 1993 by Jan Hoogstad.
A new building site beside the Kruisplein was created by reducing the size of Karel Doormanstraat, and this was used for the Doelen extension and the Codarts building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=DE DOELEN |work=Mimoa
 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The building was developed by the architectural firm of [[Jan Hoogstad|Ector Hoogstad]], and was completed in 2000.
The plinth is mainly used for commercial purposes.
The building is relatively high to accommodate all the demands of the school, and has a total floor space of {{convert|10500|m2}}.
Visually, the Codarts building appears to reach over the end of the conference center.&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;

The building's steel skeleton supports a "box in box" design for the interior spaces, including several tall spaces with variable lighting.
A long escalator connects the entrance lobby to the fifth floor.
This is the main floor for Codarts, holding the restaurant, library and several performance rooms, and opening onto a terrace on the roof of the Doelen extension.
Codarts occupies classrooms and offices below this floor.  
The conservatory is above it and the large dance studios are at the top of the building.
The building is clad in brick to give an appearance consistent with nearby apartment buildings.&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;

'''Copyright''' is a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]], existing in many countries, that grants the creator of an original work [[exclusive right]]s to determine whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others.{{Citation needed|reason=1.

Copyright is applicable to certain forms of creative work. Some, but not all jurisdictions require "fixing" copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders.{{Citation needed|reason=ref 1 describes US situation only; ref 2 links not to any content relevant to this article; ref 3. is only related to sports, not suitable to use for a general article: ref 4. is a standarised form with an agreement written for US jurisdiction, not suitable as reference |date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Copyright|publisher=University of California|year=2014|url=http://copyright.universityofcalifornia.edu/ownership/joint-works.html|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetlaw.org/publish/journal-conventions/|title=Journal Conventions - Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment &amp; Technology Law|website=www.jetlaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=kz1F6uAHtaEC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG4OnUo87RAhXqBcAKHQgZAD8Q6AEIHDAA&amp;q=%22rights+holder%22|title=Sports Marketing Agreements: Legal, Fiscal and Practical Aspects|first=Ian S.|last=Blackshaw|date=20 October 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xD_iBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT465&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG4OnUo87RAhXqBcAKHQgZAD8Q6AEIKDAC&amp;q=%22rights+holder%22|title=Publishing Forms and Contracts|first=Roy|last=Kaufman|date=16 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights frequently include reproduction, control over [[derivative work]]s, distribution, [[Performing rights|public performance]], and [[moral rights]] such as attribution.{{Citation needed|reason=ref refers to Section 106 of the Copyright Law of the United States, not suitable as source for general article on copyright |date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=17 U.S.C. § 106|publisher=United States of America|year=2011|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered "territorial rights". This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction. Copyrights of this type vary by country; many countries, and sometimes a large group of countries, have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works "cross" national borders or national rights are inconsistent.&lt;ref name="International Copyright Law Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcopyrightlaw.com/copyrightsurvey|title=International Copyright Law Survey|publisher=Mincov Law Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the public law [[Copyright term|duration of a copyright]] expires 50 to 100 years after the creator dies, depending on the jurisdiction. Some countries require certain [[copyright formalities]] to establishing copyright, others recognize copyright in any completed work, without formal registration. Generally, copyright is enforced as a [[civil law (common law)|civil]] matter, though some jurisdictions do apply [[criminal law|criminal]] sanctions.

Most jurisdictions recognize copyright limitations, allowing "fair" exceptions to the creator's exclusivity of copyright and giving users certain rights. The development of digital media and computer network technologies have prompted reinterpretation of these exceptions, introduced new difficulties in enforcing copyright, and inspired additional challenges to the philosophical basis of copyright law.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Simultaneously, businesses with great economic dependence upon copyright, such as those in the music business, have advocated the extension and expansion of copyright and sought additional legal and technological enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/8472957/bmg-reports-3-percent-revenue-bump-during-first-half-of-2018 |title=BMG Reports Revenue Bump During First Half of 2018 |last=Spahr |first=Wolfgang |date=2018-08-30 |website=Billboard |language=en |access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Copyright licenses can also be granted by those deputized by the original claimant, and private companies may request this as a condition of doing business with them. Services of internet platform providers like YouTube, Facebook, GitHub, Hotmail, DropBox, Instagram, WhatsApp or Twitter only can be used when users grant the platform provider beforehand the right to co-use all uploaded content, including all material exchanged per email, chat or cloud-storage. These copyrights only apply for the firm that operates such a platform, no matter in what jurisdiction the platform-services are being offered. Private companies in general do not recognize exceptions or give users more rights than the right to use the platform according certain rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.time.com/2012/08/10/new-site-grades-those-pesky-terms-of-service-agreements-you-never-read/|title=Those Pesky "Terms of Service" Agreements you never read|publisher=Time Inc. |accessdate=24 June 2018 |quote=Facebook — yet to be graded by the new site — has grown notorious over the years for fiddling with its terms of service and privacy policies.

==History==
{{main|History of copyright law}}

===Background===
Copyright came about with the invention of [[Printing press|the printing press]] and with wider literacy. As a legal concept, its origins in Britain were from a reaction to printers' monopolies at the beginning of the 18th&amp;nbsp;century. The English [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] was concerned about the unregulated [[copying]] of books and passed the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]],&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright in Historical Perspective'', p. 136-137, Patterson, 1968, Vanderbilt Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long been in effect.

Copyright laws allow products of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production, to be preferentially exploited and thus incentivized. Different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in [[Europe]] and not, for example, in Asia. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product and expression of the collective, rather than to see it as individual property. However, with copyright laws, intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual, with attendant rights. The most significant point is that patent and copyright laws support the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which [[capitalism]] led to the [[commodification]] of many aspects of social life that earlier had no monetary or economic value per&amp;nbsp;se.&lt;ref&gt;Bettig, Ronald V. (1996). ''Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy of Intellectual Property. Westview Press''. p. 9–17. {{ISBN|0-8133-1385-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright has grown from a legal concept regulating copying rights in the publishing of books and maps to one with a significant effect on nearly every modern industry, covering such items as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]], films, photographs, software, and architectural works.

===National copyrights===
{{See also|Statute of Anne|History of US Copyright Law}}
[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Statute of Anne]] (the Copyright Act 1709) came into force in 1710.]]
Often seen as the first real copyright law, the 1709 British [[Statute of Anne]] gave the publishers rights for a fixed period, after which the copyright expired.&lt;ref name="Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;as_brr=3 |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |page=13 |author=Ronan, Deazley |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |year=2006 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;as_brr=3 |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The act also alluded to individual rights of the artist. It began, "Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing&amp;nbsp;... Books, and other Writings, without the Consent of the Authors&amp;nbsp;... to their very great Detriment, and too often to the Ruin of them and their Families:".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrighthistory.com/anne.html |title=Statute of Anne |publisher=Copyrighthistory.com |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A right to benefit financially from the work is articulated, and court rulings and legislation have recognized a right to control the work, such as ensuring that the integrity of it is preserved. An irrevocable right to be recognized as the work's creator appears in some countries' copyright laws.

The [[Copyright Clause]] of the United States, Constitution (1787) authorized copyright legislation: "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." That is, by guaranteeing them a period of time in which they alone could profit from their works, they would be enabled and encouraged to invest the time required to create them, and this would be good for society as a whole. A right to profit from the work has been the philosophical underpinning for much legislation extending the duration of copyright, to the life of the creator and beyond, to their heirs.

The original length of copyright in the United States was 14&amp;nbsp;years, and it had to be explicitly applied for. If the author wished, they could apply for a second 14‑year monopoly grant, but after that the work entered the [[public domain]], so it could be used and built upon by others.

Copyright law was enacted rather [[Copyright in Germany|late in German states]], and the historian Eckhard Höffner argues that the absence of copyright laws in the early 19th century encouraged publishing, was profitable for authors, led to a proliferation of books, enhanced knowledge, and was ultimately an important factor in the ascendency of Germany as a power during that century.&lt;ref name="thad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,710976,00.html | author=Frank Thadeusz |title=No Copyright Law: The Real Reason for Germany's Industrial Expansion? |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date= 18 August 2010 |accessdate= 11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International copyright treaties===
{{See also|International copyright agreements|List of parties to international copyright agreements}}
[[File:Joseph Ferdinand Keppler - The Pirate Publisher - Puck Magazine - Restoration by Adam Cuerden.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|'' The Pirate Publisher—An International Burlesque that has the Longest Run on Record'', from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', 1886, satirizes the then-existing situation where a publisher could profit by simply stealing newly published works from one country, and publishing them in another, and vice versa.]]
The 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] first established recognition of copyrights among [[Sovereignty|sovereign nations]], rather than merely bilaterally. Under the Berne Convention, copyrights for [[creative works]] do not have to be asserted or declared, as they are automatically in force at creation: an author need not "register" or "apply for" a copyright in countries adhering to the Berne Convention.&lt;ref name="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P109_16834 |title=Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5 |accessdate=18 November 2011 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as a work is "fixed", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically entitled to all copyrights in the work, and to any derivative works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or until the copyright expires. The Berne Convention also resulted in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic authors, in any country signed onto the Convention. The UK signed the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100&amp;nbsp;years later with the passage of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]. Specially, for educational and scientific research purposes, the Berne Convention provides the developing countries issue compulsory licenses for the translation or reproduction of copyrighted works within the limits prescribed by the Convention. This was a special provision that had been added at the time of 1971 revision of the Convention, because of the strong demands of the developing countries. The United States did not sign the Berne Convention until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkle, Ann M; Fries, Janet; Lopez, Daniel; Possessky, Laura (1997). "Art conservation and the legal obligation to preserve artistic intent". [[JAIC]] 36 (2): 165–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and most [[Latin America]]n countries instead entered into the [[Buenos Aires Convention]] in 1910, which required a copyright notice on the work (such as ''[[all rights reserved]]''), and permitted signatory nations to limit the duration of copyrights to shorter and renewable terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.pdf "International Copyright Relations of the United States"], U.S.&amp;nbsp;Copyright Office Circular No.&amp;nbsp;38a, August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf Parties to the Geneva Act of the Universal Copyright Convention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625003242/http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }} as of 1 January 2000: the dates given in the document are dates of ratification, not dates of coming into force. The Geneva Act came into force on 16 September 1955, for the first twelve to have ratified (which included four non-members of the Berne Union as required by Art.&amp;nbsp;9.1), or three months after ratification for other countries. {{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625003242/http://www.unesco.org/culture/copyright/html_eng/ucc52ms.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.ht/en 165&amp;nbsp;Parties to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306215357/http://copyright.ht/en |date=6 March 2016 }} as of May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Copyright Convention]] was drafted in 1952 as another less demanding alternative to the Berne Convention, and ratified by nations such as the [[Soviet Union]] and developing nations.

The regulations of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] are incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]] agreement (1995), thus giving the Berne Convention effectively near-global application.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy"&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy|url= https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC |page=39 |author1=MacQueen, Hector L |author2=Charlotte Waelde |author3=Graeme T Laurie |isbn=978-0-19-926339-4 |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the [[United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property]] signed the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations]]. In 1996, this organization was succeeded by the founding of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], which launched the 1996 [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]] and the 2002 [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]], which enacted greater restrictions on the use of technology to copy works in the nations that ratified it. The [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] includes [[Trans-Pacific Partnership Intellectual Property Provisions|intellectual Property Provisions]] relating to copyright.

Copyright laws are standardized somewhat through these international conventions such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] and [[Universal Copyright Convention]]. These multilateral treaties have been ratified by nearly all countries, and [[international organizations]] such as the [[European Union]] or [[World Trade Organization]] require their member states to comply with them.

==Obtaining protection==
===Ownership===
The original holder of the copyright may be the employer of the author rather than the author himself if the work is a "[[work for hire]]".&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 201(b); Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[English law]] the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 provides that if a copyrighted work is made by an employee in the course of that employment, the copyright is automatically owned by the employer which would be a "Work for Hire". Typically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work i.e. the [[author]].&lt;ref name="fairuse.stanford.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/faqs/copyright-ownership/|title=Copyright Ownership: Who Owns What? - Copyright Overview by Rich Stim - Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center|website=fairuse.stanford.edu|language=en-US|access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fairuse.stanford.edu"/&gt; But when more than one person creates the work, then a case of [[joint authorship]] can be made provided some criteria are met.

===Eligible works===
Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or "works". Specifics vary by [[jurisdiction]], but these can include [[poem]]s, [[theses]], [[Copyright Protection for Fictional Characters|fictional characters]] [[drama|plays]] and other [[book|literary works]], [[film|motion pictures]], [[choreography]], [[music|musical compositions]], [[sound recording]]s, [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[computer software]], [[radio]] and [[television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasts]], and [[industrial design]]s.

Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.&lt;ref name="Art and copyright"&gt;{{cite book |title=Art and copyright|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=h-XBqKIryaQC&amp;as_brr=3|pages=48–49 |author=Simon, Stokes |isbn=978-1-84113-225-9 |year=2001 |publisher=Hart Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the copyright to a [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon restricts others from making copies of the cartoon or creating [[derivative work]]s based on [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] particular [[anthropomorphic]] mouse, but does not prohibit the creation of other works about anthropomorphic mice in general, so long as they are different enough to not be judged copies of Disney's.&lt;ref name="Art and copyright"/&gt; Note additionally that Mickey Mouse is not copyrighted because characters cannot be copyrighted; rather, [[Steamboat Willie]] is copyrighted and Mickey Mouse, as a character in that copyrighted work, is afforded protection.

===Originality===
{{main|Threshold of originality}}
Typically, a work must meet [[Threshold of originality|minimal standards of originality]] in order to qualify for copyright, and the copyright expires after a set period of time (some jurisdictions may allow this to be extended). Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the [[United Kingdom]] there has to be some "skill, labour, and judgment" that has gone into it.&lt;ref&gt;''Express Newspaper Plc v News (UK) Plc'', F.S.R. 36 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]] and the United Kingdom it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work. However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a [[trademark]] instead.

Copyright law recognizes the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an [[Original work|original creation]], rather than based on [[Plagiarism checker|whether it is unique]]; two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works, if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental, and neither was copied from the other.

===Registration===
{{main|Copyright registration}}
[[File:Fermat Last Theorem "proof" registered by Ukraine officials.jpg|thumb|right|A copyright certificate for proof of the [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], issued by the State Department of Intellectual Property of Ukraine.]]
In all countries where the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] standards apply, copyright is automatic, and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights.&lt;ref name="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5"/&gt; However, while registration isn't needed to exercise copyright, in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration, it serves as ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of a valid copyright and enables the copyright holder to seek [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] and attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright|url=http://copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.pdf|website=copyright.gov|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In the US, registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits.)

A widely circulated strategy to avoid the cost of copyright registration is referred to as the [[poor man's copyright]]. It proposes that the creator send the work to himself in a sealed envelope by registered mail, using the [[postmark]] to establish the date. This technique has not been recognized in any published opinions of the United States courts. &lt;!-- Note to editors: The previously-worded statement, "This technique has not been recognized by any United States court" is overbroad because not all such cases are reported, and it is impossible to know whether this is correct.--&gt; The United States Copyright Office says the technique is not a substitute for actual registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright in General (FAQ)|url=http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#poorman|publisher=U.S Copyright Office|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique and notes that the technique (as well as commercial registries) does not constitute dispositive proof that the work is original or establish who created the work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/copy/c-claim/c-register.htm "Copyright Registers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005014901/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/copy/c-claim/c-register.htm |date=5 October 2013 }}, United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-about/c-auto.htm "Automatic right"], United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- Note to editors: The previously-worded statement, "The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique but does not recommend its use." overstates the UK IPO position; the IPO does NOT recommend against the PMC approach.--&gt;

===Fixing===
The [[Berne Convention]] allows member countries to decide whether creative works must be "fixed" to enjoy copyright. Article 2, Section 2 of the Berne Convention states: "It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form." Some countries do not require that a work be produced in a particular form to obtain copyright protection. For instance, Spain, France, and Australia do not require fixation for copyright protection. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, require that most works must be "fixed in a tangible medium of expression" to obtain copyright protection.&lt;ref name="cyber.law.harvard.edu"&gt;See Harvard Law School, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#Fixation ''Module 3: The Scope of Copyright Law'']. See also Tyler T. Ochoa, [http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/chtlj/vol20/iss4/5 ''Copyright, Derivative Works and Fixation: Is Galoob a Mirage, or Does the Form(GEN) of the Alleged Derivative Work Matter?''], 20 {{smallcaps|Santa Clara High Tech.}} L.J. 991, 999–1002 (2003) ("Thus, both the text of the Act and its legislative history demonstrate that Congress intended that a derivative work does not need to be fixed in order to infringe."). The legislative history of the 1976 Copyright Act says this difference was intended to address transitory works such as ballets, pantomimes, improvised performances, dumb shows, mime performances, and dancing.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law requires that the fixation be stable and permanent enough to be "perceived, reproduced or communicated for a period of more than transitory duration." Similarly, Canadian courts consider fixation to require that the work be "expressed to some extent at least in some material form, capable of identification and having a more or less permanent endurance."&lt;ref name="cyber.law.harvard.edu"/&gt;

===Copyright notice===
{{main|Copyright notice}}
[[File:Copyright.svg|thumb|upright|A copyright symbol used in copyright notice]]
Before 1989, United States law required the use of a copyright notice, consisting of the [[copyright symbol]] (©, the letter '''C''' inside a circle), the abbreviation "Copr.", or the word "Copyright", followed by the year of the first publication of the work and the name of the copyright holder.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Act of 1976, {{USPL|94|553}}, 90 Stat. 2541, § 401(a) (19 October 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (BCIA), {{USPL|100|568}}, 102 Stat. 2853, 2857. One of the changes introduced by the BCIA was to section&amp;nbsp;401, which governs copyright notices on published copies, specifying that notices "may be placed on" such copies; prior to the BCIA, the statute read that notices "shall be placed on all" such copies. An analogous change was made in section&amp;nbsp;402, dealing with copyright notices on phonorecords.&lt;/ref&gt; Several years may be noted if the work has gone through substantial revisions. The proper copyright notice for sound recordings of musical or other audio works is a [[sound recording copyright symbol]] (℗, the letter&amp;nbsp;'''P''' inside a circle), which indicates a sound recording copyright, with the letter&amp;nbsp;'''P''' indicating a "phonorecord". In addition, the phrase ''[[All rights reserved]]'' was once required to assert copyright, but that phrase is now legally obsolete. Almost everything on the Internet has some sort of copyright attached to it. Whether these things are watermarked, signed, or have any other sort of indication of the copyright is a different story however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's Platform:Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age.|last=Taylor|first=Astra|publisher=Picador|year=2014|isbn=978-1-250-06259-8|location=New York City, New York, USA|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the United States enacted the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act, amending the 1976&amp;nbsp;Copyright Act to conform to most of the provisions of the Berne Convention. As a result, the use of copyright notices has become optional to claim copyright, because the Berne Convention makes copyright automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf |title=U.S. Copyright Office – Information Circular |format=PDF |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit&amp;nbsp;– using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of "innocent infringement" being successful.&lt;ref&gt;[[17 U.S.C.]]{{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|401(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
Copyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] court, but there are also criminal infringement statutes in some jurisdictions. While [[copyright registry|central registries]] are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily [[legal proof|prove]] that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the [[RIAA]] are increasingly targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court. (See: [[Legal aspects of file sharing]])

In most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright. This will usually involve engaging legal representation, administrative or court costs. In light of this, many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court.

"...by 1978, the scope was expanded to apply to any 'expression' that has been 'fixed' in any medium, this protection granted automatically whether the maker wants it or not, no registration required."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Astra|title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age|date=2014|publisher=Picador|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-250-06259-8|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright infringement===
{{main|Copyright infringement}}
For a work to be considered to infringe upon copyright, its use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] or [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]]. Improper use of materials outside of legislation is deemed "unauthorized edition", not copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = L. | doi = 10.1087/09531510125100313 | title = Piracy | journal = Learned Publishing | volume = 14 | pages = 67–70 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics regarding the effects of copyright infringement are difficult to determine. Studies have attempted to determine whether there is a monetary loss for industries affected by copyright infringement by predicting what portion of pirated works would have been formally purchased if they had not been freely available.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, S. Piracy Losses "Billboard" 199(36)&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports indicate that copyright infringement does not have an adverse effect on the entertainment industry, and can have a positive effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/dokumentation/mi/2011/2011-11-30.html |title=Urheberrechtsverletzungen im Internet: Der bestehende rechtliche Rahmen genügt |publisher=Ejpd.admin.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a 2014 university study concluded that free music content, accessed on YouTube, does not necessarily hurt sales, instead has the potential to increase sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing|ssrn=2425386|title=Video Killed the Radio Star? Online Music Videos and Digital Music Sales|ISSN=2042-2695|year=2014|authors=Tobias Kretschmer &amp; Christian Peukert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights granted==
===Exclusive rights===
Several exclusive rights typically attach to the holder of a copyright:
* protection of the work
* to determine and decide how, and under what conditions, the work may be marketed, publicly displayed, reproduced, distributed etc.
* to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies)
* to import or export the work
* to create [[derivative work]]s (works that adapt the original work)
* to perform or display the work publicly
* to sell or cede these rights to others
* to transmit or display by radio, video or internet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights |page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic right when a work is protected by copyright is that the holder may determine and decide how and under what conditions the protected work may be used by others. This includes the right to decide to distribute the work for free. This part of copyright is often overseen. The phrase "exclusive right" means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holder's permission. Copyright is sometimes called a "negative right", as it serves to prohibit certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than permitting people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the [[unregistered design right]] in [[English law]] and [[European law]]. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to not use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term. There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a [[Philosophy of copyright|philosophical interpretation of copyright law]] that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom G. Palmer, [http://www.tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/papers/morallyjustified.pdf "Are Patents and Copyrights Morally Justified?"] Accessed 5 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Little Nemo]] --&gt;
{{main|Copyright term|List of countries' copyright length}}
[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (currently based on the date of creation or publication).]]
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been [[Publication|published]], and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|305}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm part II], Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in question.

The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA|last=Nimmer|first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2003|isbn=  978-90-411-8876-2|oclc=50606064|page=63|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States].", ''[[Cornell University]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain. Hirtle points out that the great majority of these works (including 93% of the books) were not renewed after 28 years and are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;See Peter B. Hirtle, "Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States 1 January 2015" [https://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm online at footnote 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226112433/http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |date=26 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Books originally published outside the US by non-Americans are exempt from this renewal requirement, if they are still under copyright in their home country.

But if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication (or distribution of derivative work, such as a film based on a book protected by copyright) outside the U.S., the terms of copyright around the world must be considered. If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries.

In 1998, the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig, ''Copyright's First Amendment'', 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and exceptions==
{{main|Limitations and exceptions to copyright}}

In many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses. US copyright does NOT cover names, title, short phrases or Listings (such as ingredients, recipes, labels, or formulas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf (2012) ''Copyright Protection Not Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases'' U.S. Copyright Office]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are protections available for those areas copyright does not cover – such as [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.

There are some exceptions to what copyright will protect. Copyright will not protect:
* Names of products
* Names of businesses, organizations, or groups
* Pseudonyms of individuals
* Titles of works
* Catchwords, catchphrases, mottoes, slogans, or short advertising expressions
* Listings of ingredients in recipes, labels, and formulas, though the directions can be copyrighted

===Idea–expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine===
{{main|Idea–expression divide}}

The idea–expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of [[Baker v. Selden]], has since been codified by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] at 17 U.S.C. § 102(b).

===The first-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights===

{{main|First-sale doctrine|Exhaustion of rights}}
Copyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the United States this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s.

Some countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to [[patent]] and [[trademark]] rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.

In ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. v. Kirtsaeng |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702033641/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in a 6-3 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US without such permission.  The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to prevent such importation.

In addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.

===Fair use and fair dealing===
{{main|Fair use|Fair dealing}}
Copyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the [[Fair use|fair use doctrine]], codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:
# the purpose and character of one's use
# the nature of the copyrighted work
# what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and
# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html |title=US CODE: Title 17,107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In ''[[Alberta (Education) v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright)]]'', 2012 SCC 37, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that limited copying for educational purposes could also be justified under the fair dealing exemption. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. [[legal advice]]). Under current [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], although it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner, owners of a legitimate copy are permitted to “format shift” that work from one medium to another for personal, private use, or to “time shift” a broadcast work for later, once and only once, viewing or listening. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.

In the United States the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]] Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.

:''Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions''

:''No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''

Later acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed, making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner.&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights"/&gt; An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.

The [[copyright directive]] allows EU member states to implement a set of exceptions to copyright. Examples of those exceptions are:
*photographic reproductions on paper or any similar medium of works (excluding sheet music) provided that the rightholders receives fair compensation,
*reproduction made by libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, which are non-commercial
*archival reproductions of broadcasts,
*uses for the benefit of people with a disability,
*for demonstration or repair of equipment,
*for non-commercial research or private study
*when used in [[parody]]

===Accessible copies===
It is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired persons without permission from the copyright holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121|title=Chapter 1 - Circular 92 - U.S. Copyright Office|website=www.copyright.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_cvipsact2002.hcsp|title=Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 comes into force|publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People|date=1 January 2011|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Collective rights management|Extended collective licensing|Compulsory license|Copyright transfer agreement}}
[[File:All rights reserved.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|DVD: [[All Rights Reserved]].]]
A copyright, or aspects of it (e.g. reproduction alone, all but moral rights), may be assigned or transferred from one party to another.&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights"&gt;{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;as_brr=3|isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations. The creator (and original copyright holder) benefits, or expects to, from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the [[Internet]]; however, the [[record industry]] attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and his or her work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time.

A transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective,&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(2)"&gt;{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;as_brr=3|page=8 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example under the Australian [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]] the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]]. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a [[real estate]] transaction.

Copyright may also be [[license]]d.&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights"/&gt; Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed [[statutory license]] (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made.&lt;ref name="WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(3)"&gt;{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;as_brr=3|page=16 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performance rights organisation|performing rights organizations]] (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], and [[SESAC]]) have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.

===Free licenses===
Copyright licenses known as ''open'' or [[free license]]s seek to grant several rights to licensees, either for a fee or not. ''Free'' in this context is not as much of a reference to price as it is to freedom. What constitutes free licensing has been characterised in a number of similar definitions, including by order of longevity the [[Free Software Definition]], the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], the [[Open Source Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]]. Further refinements to these definitions have resulted in categories such as [[copyleft]] and [[permissive license|permissive]]. Common examples of free licences are the [[GNU General Public License]], [[BSD license]]s and some [[Creative Commons licenses]].

Founded in 2001 by [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], and [[Hal Abelson]], the [[Creative Commons]] (CC) is a non-profit organization&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/ |title=Creative Commons Website|website=creativecommons.org|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end, the organization provides a number of generic copyright license options to the public, [[gratis versus libre|gratis]]. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable.&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt;

Terms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enables the general public to use such works more freely. Six general types of CC licenses are available (although some of them are not properly free per the above definitions and per Creative Commons' own advice). These are based upon copyright-holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin, R. E. (2010) 'Foundations of Library and Information Science: Third Edition', Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}} approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Opposition to copyright}}
Some sources are critical of particular aspects of the copyright system. This is known as a debate over [[copynorms]]. Particularly to the background of uploading content to internet platforms and the digital exchange of original work, there is discussion about the [[copyright aspects of downloading and streaming]], the [[copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing]].

The interests of big internet platform service providers like Google, Amazon, Facebook or Microsoft, partly depending on users uploading content for free to their servers, collide with those of original content creators and right holders, both big, like Sony, Getty Images, Warner Bros, Elsevier, Springer and small, like local bands, national newspapers and TV-channels. In Germany the national public organisation GEMA, that collects copyright fees for composers, copywriters and music-publishers, won a juridical fight with Google over payment for songs published on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/kultur/gema-gewinnt-gegen-youtube-2782939.html|title=Gema gewinnt gegen YouTube |publisher=Saechsische Zeitung |accessdate= 24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns are often couched in the language of [[Digital rights|digital rights, digital freedom]], [[database right]]s, [[open data]] or [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edri.org/press-release-meps-ignore-expert-advice-and-vote-for-mass-internet-censorship/ |title=MEPs ignore expert advice and vote for mass internet censorship|publisher=European Digital Rights |accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions include ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', a 2004 book by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. Lessig coined the term [[permission culture]] to describe a worst-case system. ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' (documentary) and [[RiP!: A Remix Manifesto]], discuss copyright. Some suggest an [[alternative compensation system]]. In Europe consumers are acting up against the raising costs of music, film and books, a political party has been grown out of it, ''The Pirates''. Some groups reject copyright altogether, taking an [[anti-copyright]] stance. The perceived inability to enforce copyright online leads some to advocate [[Crypto-anarchism|ignoring legal statutes when on the web]].

==Public domain==
{{main|Public domain}}
Copyright, like other [[intellectual property rights]], is subject to a statutorily determined term. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be used or exploited by anyone without obtaining permission, and normally without payment. However, in [[paying public domain]] regimes the user may still have to pay royalties to the state or to an authors' association. Courts in common law countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the [[internet]], for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.

'''Desert X''' is a [[Site-specific art|site-specific]], [[contemporary art]] exhibition that was installed in the [[Coachella Valley]] in California from February 25 to April 30, 2017.  

==Background==
Desert X was formed by Desert Biennial, a [[501(c) organization|501(C)]] charitable organization founded in 2015.  The exhibit is meant to bring attention to the valley's environment through the display of works by emerging artists. Themes include [[climate change]], [[immigration]], [[tourism]], [[Indian gambling|gambling]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anna Rumer |url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/arts/2017/02/25/massive-desert-x-art-exhibit-debuts-palm-springs-area/98404980/ |title=Massive Desert X art exhibit debuts in Palm Springs area |publisher=Desertsun.com |date=2017-02-25 |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher Knight |url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-desert-x-coachella-review-20170309-htmlstory.html|title= International art invades the suburban Coachella Valley: The best of 'Desert X' |publisher = latimes.com |date = 2017-03-09|accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/arts/2017/03/16/how-desert-x-concept-making-art-accessible-became-reality/99217496/|title= How Desert X concept of making art accessible became a reality |publisher = desertsun.com |date = |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works included a camouflaged house covered in mirrors, an autonomous vehicle known as the "ShyBot" that is programmed to avoid people, as well as an underground bunker with a [[kitsch]] sculpture of [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jori Finkel |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/arts/desert-x-turns-an-arid-space-into-a-canvas.html?_r=0 |title=‘Desert X’ Treats Arid Space as a Rich Canvas |publisher = newyorktimes.com |date =2017-02-24 |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017 the robot’s creator, an Italian artist known as "Norma Jeane", lost contact with ShyBot.

'''''Early Bourgeois Revolution in Germany''''' ({{Lang-de|Frühbürgerliche Revolution in Deutschland}}), also known as the '''''Peasants' War Panorama''''' (''Bauernkriegspanorama''), is a monumental painting by the East German painter [[Werner Tübke]], executed from 1976 to 1987. It spans {{convert|14|m}} by {{convert|123|m}} and depicts a circular [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] of the [[Battle of Frankenhausen]], fought on 15 May 1525 during the [[German Peasants' War]]. The painting has more than 3000 characters.&lt;ref name="kunstarchiv"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gesichter-des-dka.gnm.de/content/mdc_person733a|title=Tübke, Werner|language=German|work=Die Gesichter des Deutschen Kunstarchivs|publisher=[[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]]|accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is the main attraction of the Panorama Museum, built specifically to host it, in [[Bad Frankenhausen]], [[Thuringia]].

==Creation==
The painting was commissioned in 1976 by the Ministry of Culture of East Germany. It was finished in 1987.&lt;ref name="kunstarchiv" /&gt; The canvas was woven in one piece at the textile factory in [[Sursk]], the Soviet Union, and weighs 1.1 [[ton]]s. Tübke dedicated 480 workdays to the painting and used a total of 90,000 tubes of paint.&lt;ref name="gotz"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Götz|first=Thomas|date=2004-05-10|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/das-bauernkriegspanorama-ist-werner-tuebkes-groesstes-werk--es-wird-noch-immer-bestaunt---der-maler-aber-war-lange-nicht-in-bad-frankenhausen-eine-runde-sache-mit-ecken-und-kanten-15564856|title=Das Bauernkriegspanorama ist Werner Tübkes größtes Werk.

The museum opened to the public on 14 September 1989, in time for the 500th anniversary of the birth of [[Thomas Müntzer]].&lt;ref name="gotz" /&gt;

===Music===
After finding his lead actors, Lee Daniels set out to find a producer to craft the music for the series. Because he felt his own musical tastes and desires would be a little too dated for the show, Daniels consulted with people he thought could give him a little more insight, his children. At the urging of his son and daughter, Daniels contacted super producer [[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]], known for scoring hits with some of pop's biggest artists including [[Missy Elliott]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Nelly Furtado]], [[Ginuwine]] and [[Aaliyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/category-songs_produced_by_timbaland.php|title=SONGS PRODUCED BY TIMBALAND|publisher=Songfacts.com|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As executive music Producer, Timbaland, co-songwriter/producer [[Jim Beanz]], and a team of other musical collaborators took their cues from the writing team, which gave them an idea of where the plot is headed, and craft songs to fit those themes. However, the musical aspect of the series is very reality based, unlike Fox's last musical series, ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', performances come with the organic development of the characters as artists, much like the performances featured in the ABC prime-time country musical drama ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]''.&lt;ref name=EWStack010715&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2015/01/07/empire-fox-lee-daniels/|title='Empire': Inside Fox's ambitious, groundbreaking musical soap|first=Tim|last=Stack|date=January 7, 2015|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alistarrecords.com/track/731526/what-the-dj-spins-from-empire?feature_id=157084&amp;trackship_id=833644 |title=What the DJ Spins (Empire) |publisher=Alistar Records |access-date=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any licensed songs and composer Fil Eisler's score are added after the episodes are filmed. The pilot itself consists of 12 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/timbaland-gives-lee-daniels-empire-hip-hop-cred-1201393126/|title=Timbaland Gives Lee Daniels' 'Empire' Hip-Hop Cred|first=Melinda|last=Newman|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=January 6, 2015|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia Records]] releases weekly soundtracks of ''Empire'' on the [[iTunes Store]], the same strategy used with ''Glee''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1860247/empire-tv-show-on-fox-empire-soundtrack-music-soars-on-itunes-ratings-break-records/ |title=‘EMPIRE’ TV SHOW ON FOX: ‘EMPIRE’ SOUNDTRACK MUSIC SOARS ON ITUNES, RATINGS BREAK RECORDS |last=Mooney |first=Paula |date=February 20, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2015, Fox announced that [[Ne-Yo]] and [[J.R. Rotem]] would write music for the show's second season, joining Timbaland.&lt;ref name="Neyo2"/&gt; Timbaland left ''Empire'' after season 2, and were replaced for season 3 by [[Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]] and [[Esther Dean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fuse.tv/2016/09/empire-timbaland-exit-ester-dean-rodney-jerkins-darkchild|title='EMPIRE' LOSES TIMBALAND, SIGNS ESTER DEAN &amp; RODNEY 'DARKCHILD' JERKINS

[[File:Göttingen-Gebäude.Enzyklopädie.des.Märchens.jpg|thumb|right|Workplace for the ''Enzyklopädie des Märchens'']]
The '''''Encyclopedia of Fairy Tales '''''&lt;ref&gt;The work is generally known in English as the '''''Encyclopedia of Fairy Tales''''', see, ''e.g.'' {{Cite web |title=De Gruyter: Profile: Literary science |publisher=De Gruyter |url=http://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/206/profil |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RYZAVTu0?url=http://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/206/profil |archivedate=3 August 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}, although '''''Encyclopedia of the Folktale''''' is an alternate translation.&lt;/ref&gt; ('''''Enzyklopädie des Märchens''''')  is a [[German language|German]] [[reference work]] on international [[Folkloristics]], which runs to fifteen volumes and is acknowledged as the most comprehensive work in its field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Marzolph, Ulrich |title= Celebrating the Growing Discipline of Folk Narrative Research |year= 2010 |journal= ISFNR Newsletter |publisher= International Society for Folk Narrative Research |volume= 5 |issue= 5 |pages= 4&amp;ndash;5 |url= http://www.isfnr.org/files/isfnr_newsletter_2010.pdf |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6RYnfY7x1?url=http://www.isfnr.org/files/isfnr_newsletter_2010.pdf |archivedate= 3 August 2014 |deadurl= no |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It examines over two centuries of research into the folk narrative tradition. It was begun by [[Kurt Ranke]] in the 1960s and was continued by chief editor [[Rolf Wilhelm Brednich]], both of the [[Göttingen Academy of Sciences]] (Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen).&lt;ref name="Uther"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Uther, Hans-Jörg|year=1986|chapter=''The Encyclopedia of the Folktale'' |editor= Bottigheimer, Ruth B. |title=Fairy Tales and Society: Illusion, allusion, and paradigm |publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press |location= Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn= 978-0-8122-8021-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor=Brednich, Rolf Wilhelm |year=2006 |title= Festgabe für Ines Köhler-Zülch: aus Anlaß ihres 65.

Like the technical periodical ''[[Fabula (journal)|Fabula]]'' it is published by the [[Walter de Gruyter GmbH]] [[Publishing |publishing house]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Märchenzeit (Fairy tale time) |date= 24 September 1979 |newspaper= [[Der Spiegel]] |url= http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-39868931.html |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6RYmsnMko?url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-39868931.html |archivedate= 3 August 2014 |deadurl= no |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with working premises at the  [[Georg-August University]] of [[Göttingen]] and as a project of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences. The forerunner of this work was the ''Handwörterbuch des deutschen Märchens'' (''Handbook of German Fairy Tales''), of which only two volumes were published.&lt;ref&gt;The first fascicle of volume 1 was published in 1930. The two completed volumes were: {{Cite book |editor= Mackensen, Lutz |year=1933 |title= Handwörterbuch des deutschen Märchens, Volume 1: Aarnes Märchentypensystem - Exotische Vögel |publisher= De Gruyter |location= Berlin |oclc= 163503036}} and {{Cite book |editor= Mackensen, Lutz |year=1940 |title= Handwörterbuch des deutschen Märchens, Volume 2: Fabel - Gyges |publisher= De Gruyter |location= Berlin |oclc= 163503041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wittman"&gt;{{Cite news |author= Wittman, Angela |date= 26 December 2005 |title= Was die Zwerge nicht wussten (What the dwarves did not know) |newspaper= [[Die Zeit]] |language= German |url= http://www.zeit.de/2005/52/C-M_8archen |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6RYfD9SSn?url=http://www.zeit.de/2005/52/C-M_8archen |archivedate= 3 August 2014 |deadurl= no |df=  }} (article on the making of the ''Enzyklopädie des Märchens'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The first article ''Aarne, Antti Amatus'' appeared in slip in 1975, and the first volume in 1977. By 2014, the final fourteenth volume had been published, followed by an additional volume with lists, indexes and corrigenda in 2015.  In all there are approximately 3900 articles,&lt;ref name="EM-Hist"&gt;{{Cite web |title=History and Scope of the EM |publisher=De Gruyter |url=http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~enzmaer/vorstellung-engl.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RYhsK6Bc?url=http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~enzmaer/vorstellung-engl.html |archivedate=3 August 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; alphabetically arranged, from over 800 authors from over 60 countries.&lt;ref name="Wittman" /&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia of Fairy Tales'' provides an overview in the following areas, as relevant to folk narrative research:&lt;ref name="Uther" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EM-Hist" /&gt;

'''''Erill la Vall Descent from the Cross''''' is a set of seven 12th-century wooden sculptures from the [[Pyrenees]] village of Erill la Vall in [[Catalonia]], originally painted, comprising a complete [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Descent from the Cross]] sculpture group, which in [[Catalonia]] has the peculiarity that it is made up of seven figures. Two of the carvings are kept at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]] (MNAC) and the rest at the [[Museu Episcopal de Vic|Vic Episcopal Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
In the centre was the figure of [[Jesus Christ]] held by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and unnailed by [[Nicodemus]], flanked by the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Saint John the Evangelist]] on either side, with the penitent and impenitent thieves, [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]], at the ends, respectively. The subject of the Descent adds a more narrative and dramatic feel to the representation of the [[Passion of Christ]], and these sculptures were probably used in Medieval liturgical drama. The MNAC's collection preserves figures from the Descents of [[Descent from the Cross sculpture group (Santa Maria de Taüll)|Santa Maria de Taüll]] and [[Vall de Boí|Durro]], both in the [[Vall de Boí]] (Boí Valley, a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=60da71412f83578e07bd0e3c65ede7c55bb4e1e6f01b4c011d96507a6f06a7e6?inventoryNumber=003918-000 The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Virgin and Saint John ===
[[File:MNAC-María y Juan Bautista de St. Eulalia Erill-la-Vall.jpg|thumb|250px|The Virgin and Saint John at the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|National Art Museum of Catalonia]].]]
The monumental sculptural groups in wood of the Descent from the Cross are an important chapter in Romanesque carving in Catalonia on account of the high artistic quality of the works preserved and of the unique features of their iconography. A significant proportion comes from the Boí Valley ([[Vall de Boí]]). One aspect that sets these Catalan series of carvings apart from other renderings of this theme is the presence of seven figures: in the centre was the figure of Christ, sustained by Joseph of Arimathea (on his right, the left for the observer) and Nicodemus on his right; on either side are Mary and St John, and at the ends the figures of the two thieves, Dismas and Gestas.

The theme of the Descent brings a greater narrative and dramatic sense to the treatment of the two episodes of the Calvary and may be related to the liturgical plays of the time. But the presence of these groups in Catalonia during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as some have tried to demonstrate, could also correspond to the struggle against the heresy of [[Catharism]]. As the subject could have a Eucharistic meaning, it could be used as a reply to the [[Cathars]]' negation of the death of Christ and of the Eucharist itself.

The Erill la Vall Descent is the most complete of all the known groups from the Catalan western Pyrenees, but all the figures are not exhibited together, being dispersed between the [[Vic Episcopal Museum]] and the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|National Art Museum of Catalonia]], although the two museums sometimes loan the works out to one another to display them as a complete set.

As a whole it is a masterpiece of Romanesque carving in Catalonia, to the extent that other works have been arranged around it, such as the Descent from [[Taüll|Santa Maria de Taüll]],&lt;ref&gt;(MNAC/MAC 3925)&lt;/ref&gt; what remains of the one from [[Vall de Boí|Durro]],&lt;ref&gt;(MNAC/MAC
15895)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as works of other types ([[altar frontal]]s, [[crucifix]]es)

The '''Esquiline Treasure''' is an ancient Roman silver treasure that was found in 1793 on the [[Esquiline Hill]] in Rome. The hoard is considered an important example of late antique silver work from the 4th century AD, probably about 380 for the major pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta; Cameron argues for about this date for the Projecta pieces, throughout; Shelton argues for "about 330-370", in Shelton (1985), 147&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1866, 57 objects, representing the great majority of the treasure, have been in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=32644&amp;plaA=32644-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two of the most important objects in the treasure are the ornate silver-gilt engraved boxes known as the ''Projecta Casket'' and the ''Muse Casket''. The treasure was part of the belongings of a wealthy Roman household of high social status, which can probably be identified. The collection includes 8 plates (4 circular and 4 rectangular), a fluted dish, a ewer inscribed for "Pelegrina", a flask with embossed scenes, an [[amphora]], 6 sets of horse trappings, with furniture fittings including 4 [[tyche]] figures representing the 4 main cities of the [[Roman Empire]]: Rome, [[Constantinople]], [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandria]], two hands clenching bannisters, and an assortment of jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta and other BM pages; see External links for how to reach these&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a number of large late Roman hoards have been discovered, most are from the fringes of the empire (such as [[List of Roman hoards in Britain|Roman Britain]]), and very few objects from the period can be presumed to have been made by silversmiths in Rome itself, giving the Esquiline Treasure a "special significance".&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 18-19, 44 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  This major hoard is displayed in room 41 of the British Museum alongside the [[Carthage Treasure]] and near the British finds of the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], [[Hoxne Hoard]], [[Water Newton Treasure]] and the [[Corbridge Lanx]]. It has been observed that the majority of the major surviving late Roman silver hoards are in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 9; at the start of his "Late-Roman silver plate: a reply to Alan Cameron" in the ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 6, 1993, Kenneth Painter lists (before the discovery of the [[Sevso Treasure]], which he implies should join the list) "the 5 surviving major hoards" of late Roman silver, of which four (Esquiline, Carthage, Mildenhall and the earlier Chaourse) are in the British Museum. The other was the [[Kaiseraugst Treasure]] in [[Augst]], Switzerland, [http://www.journalofromanarch.com/v6_first%20pages/lo-res%20PDFs/v6_06%20Painter.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of the Treasure==
[[Image:Esquiline Treasure (4).JPG|350px|thumb|left|Lid of the Projecta Casket]]
In the summer of 1793 workers encountered a large collection of silver objects during excavation work at the foot of the Esquiline Hill in Rome, which had been the area favoured by the Roman aristocracy for their houses throughout the Roman period. These items were found in the ruins of a Roman building, which was at that time in the premises of the monastery of San Francesco di Paola in [[Rome]]. The first official record of the finds was made one year after their discovery by the famous Italian classical archaeologist and later head of the Capitoline Museum [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]].&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta and other BM pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The treasure passed through many hands before eventually being acquired by the French collector and one-time ambassador to Rome the [[Pierre Louis Jean Casimir de Blacas|Duc de Blacas]]. In 1866 his collection was sold in its entirety to the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta and other BM pages&lt;/ref&gt; However, two other items in the treasure can be found in the [[Petit Palais|Musee du Petit Palais]] in Paris (a highly decorated ''trulla'' or saucepan),&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #94&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Nazionale]] in Naples (a jug in the form of a women's head).

==The Projecta Casket==
The so-called '''Projecta Casket''' (M&amp;ME 1866,12-29,1) is one of the most famous and magnificent examples of silver craftsmanship from [[late antiquity]] in Rome. It is partially [[gilding|gilded]] to highlight some areas, and was made by the [[repoussé]] technique - that is the ornamented relief was achieved by means of pressing or pushing back the metal surface. The box is 55.9&amp;nbsp;cm long, 28.6&amp;nbsp;cm high and 43.2&amp;nbsp;cm wide and has a weight of 8.2&amp;nbsp;kg. The base of the box has swinging handles at each end.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta&lt;/ref&gt;

The five panels on the lid of the box represent three mythological scenes, a double portrait and a bathing scene. On the top panel of the lid are half-length figures of a man and woman within a wreath held by standing [[erotes]] (or [[putti]] in modern terms) and an inscription which reads: "SECVNDE ET PROIECTA VIVATIS IN CHRI[STO] ('Secundus and Projecta, may you live in Christ').&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #88; Projecta&lt;/ref&gt; The attire of the two figures is clearly that of an affluent couple from late antiquity. The woman is wearing a long-sleeved tunic with a large necklace. In her hands she holds a papyrus roll. The man is in a long-sleeved tunic that he wears under a [[chlamys]].

The four panels of the box itself depict bathing and dressing scenes, representing the preparations for a grand Roman wedding. These are placed between columns joined by alternating arches and bottomless [[pediment]]s, all under a [[frieze]] with scrolling vines.  In one scene, Projecta is shown sitting on an ornate chair holding a decorated box similar in shape to the Muse Casket. She wears a long-sleeved tunic under a [[colobium]] or short-sleeved tunic.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #88; Projecta&lt;/ref&gt;  A smaller inscription on the front rim of the lid gives the weight as "XXII-III", meaning "[Pondo] XXII,III [Unciae],S[emuncia]" or "Twenty-two pounds, three and one-half ounces" in [[Roman pound|Roman units]].&lt;ref&gt;Projecta, catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

The casket has travelled abroad to several international exhibitions: New York in 1977-1978, [[Rimini]] in 1996, [[New Dehli]] in 1997, [[Mumbai]] in 1998, [[Trier]] in 2007, Paris in 2009 and most recently Chicago in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta, catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Muse Casket==
[[Image:Esquiline Treasure (3).JPG|thumb|left|300px|The "Muse Casket"]]
Another ornate object in the treasure is the Muse Casket (M&amp;ME 1866,12-29,2), which is a domed silver box, suspended on three chains. It is 25.4&amp;nbsp;cm high and 33&amp;nbsp;cm across. The outside of the box is decorated with [[relief]] panels showing eight of the [[Muse|Nine Muses]] alternating with decorative motifs. Inside the casket were found a set of five silver lidded bottles, or "four identical silver canisters and one silver flask" in the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Muse Casket in collection database&lt;/ref&gt;  These were presumably to hold perfumed oils for toiletries.  An apparently identical casket is carried by a female servant on the back panel of the Projecta Casket, suggesting that both were commissioned for the same wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #89&lt;/ref&gt;

This casket is also well-travelled, exhibited in New York in 1977-1978, Rome in 2000, Milan in 2003, Paris in 2009 and most recently Chicago in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projecta and the Turcii==
The British Museum follows Kathleen J. Shelton in dating the treasure as a whole to the period 330-370; Shelton favours a period of some 20 to 25 years within that range, with the major objects from the same workshop, and probably for more than one generation within a family.&lt;ref&gt;"Muse"; Shelton, 147-148. The British Museum website in January 2014 follows the "Damasus" dating of "about 380" for the Projecta Casket, but Shelton's "330-370" for the Muse Casket and other items.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Current research suggests that the Projecta Casket and some other items in the treasure (but probably not all of them) were a wedding gift to the newly married couple Projecta and Secundus.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta&lt;/ref&gt; Projecta has been associated with an [[epitaph]] for a woman of that name who died in 383, shortly before her 17th birthday, written by [[Pope Damasus I]] (r. 366-84) that was once displayed in the church of [[San Martino ai Monti]], close to where the find was made. Though only nine lines long, and described by [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] as "typically lame and frigid" (for a composition by Damasus) and "a tissue of tags and clichés shakily strung together and barely squeezed into the meter", the epitaph creates a number of puzzles and has generated much scholarly discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 136-139 being his contribution; 136 and 137 are quoted in turn; Shelton, 148-150 disagrees with him&lt;/ref&gt;  The epitaph reads:

[[Image:Arte tardoantica da roma, brocca di 'pelegrina' in niello, IV sec.jpg|thumb|The Pelegrina Ewer; her name can be seen at the widest point, across the three "dimples" to the right]]

The translation here of "PROIECTAE FVERAT PRIMO QVAE IVNCTA MARITO" as "Projecta, who had been the wife of Primus" continues to be hotly discussed; ''primus'', meaning "first" was a Roman male name, but other possibilities are that Projecta had a "first" husband, or that her unnamed husband was ''primus'' or "first" in the complimentary sense of being "the tops".  Alan Cameron, who supports the Projecta of the epitaph being the wife of L. Turcius Secundus and the owner of the casket, sees ''primo'' as punning wordplay by Damasus - "second" was actually "first" in quality; he says this would be typical of Damasus's style.  Kathleen Shelton disagrees, seeing no connection between two different women called Projecta, one of the epitaph and the other of the casket, and supporting "Primus" as the name of the husband in the epitaph.&lt;ref&gt;Their two articles referenced here deal at length with these questions, and the arguments of each other.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epitaph for Projecta gives her father's name as Florus, who may be the important and pious Iberian official of that name who was close to [[Theodosius I]] (himself Iberian), and given great appointments at just this period.  He was part of a coterie of Iberian Christians close to the emperor, most seemingly related, which included Pope Damasus.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;  Florus may be the figure of that name depicted with Damasus and a Simon and Peter in a [[gold glass]] cup in the [[Vatican Museums]] and in another with Simon (Simon appears in a further glass with Damasus), suggesting "a circle of friends, or at least associates".&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

Two pieces of silver plate, a rectangular dish and a circular one were inscribed with a monogram that has been translated as standing for Projecta Turci. Based on this evidence, some scholars have suggested that Projecta was married to L. Turcius Secundus, and given her age this must have been not long before 383. However, not all the monograms seem to relate to this couple, and it may well be that the treasure represented the family silver accumulated over more than one generation. A ewer in the treasure is inscribed with the female name Pelegrina, but her identity has not been the subject of equal speculation, as there is no other evidence to go on. Another couple of a Turcius and Pelegrina has been tentatively suggested, though how their dates would relate to Projecta and Secundus is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 135-136; Shelton (1985), 147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

While Projecta was evidently Christian, her husband, if he was L. Turcius Secundus, was a member of a prominent family many of whom remained pagans until the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta; Cameron, 142-144; Shelton, 152&lt;/ref&gt; The ivory [[Symmachi–Nicomachi diptych]] from the same period and milieu in Rome shows pagan iconography; some 70 years after the conversion of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] the old religion still had supporters in the Roman elite.  The four ''tyche'' of the main cities of the empire suggest they were made for the posts of a great official's chair or litter; members of the Turcii held several such positions. Cameron claims that the helmet of Constantinople is a form not found on ''tyche'' figures of that city before 380, when the see of Constantinople was suddenly raised to be second to Rome, above older ones such as Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 140-141; disputed by Shelton, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the treasure was buried at the Turcii house on the Esquiline Hill just before the [[Visigothic]] attack on Rome by [[Alaric I]] in 410 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian/Pagan Iconography==
In spite of the Christian inscription on the Projecta Casket, the [[iconography]] of the figurative decoration of the treasure is purely [[Ancient Roman religion|pagan]], a common mixture in Roman metalwork from the period to about 350, when [[Early Christian art]] had not yet devised iconography for essentially secular decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 17&lt;/ref&gt; Three sides of the Projecta Casket's lid are decorated with pagan mythological motifs - these include the deity [[Aphrodite|Venus]] on a cockleshell, [[nereid]]s (sea-nymphs) riding a [[ketos]] (a dragon-like sea monster) and a [[hippocamp]] (a monster with the front quarters of a horse and the tail of a fish).&lt;ref&gt;Projecta in collection database&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of Christian and pagan inscriptions and symbols may have been a compromise reflecting the affiliations of the bride and groom's families, described in the previous section.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta, catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Exploding Plastic Inevitable''''', sometimes simply called '''''Plastic Inevitable''''' or '''''EPI''''', was a series of [[multimedia]] events organized by [[Andy Warhol]] between 1966 and 1967, featuring musical performances by [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[Nico]], screenings of Warhol's films, and dancing and performances by regulars of Warhol's [[The Factory|Factory]], especially [[Mary Woronov]] and [[Gerard Malanga]]. ''Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' is also the title of an 18-minute film by Ronald Nameth with recordings from one week of performances of the shows which were filmed in [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1966. In December 1966 Warhol included a one-off magazine called ''The Plastic Exploding Inevitable'' as part of the ''[[Aspen (magazine)|Aspen]]'' No. 3 package.&lt;ref name=Aspen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=From the research laboratories of Andy Warhol comes this issue of Aspen Magazine |date=April 1967 |url=http://www.ubu.com/aspen/advertisements/aspen3Ad.html |journal=[[Evergreen Review]] |volume=11 |issue=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable with Nico.png|thumb|left|170px|Performance of Exploding Plastic Inevitable in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]]]
The ''Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' had its beginnings in an event staged on January 13, 1966, at a dinner for the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry. This event, called "Up-Tight", included performances by the Velvet Underground and Nico, along with Malanga and [[Edie Sedgwick]] as dancers&lt;ref name=BWJ&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Branden W. |last=Joseph |authorlink=Branden W.

==Legacy==
{{unsourced section|date=January 2017}}
[[Andy Warhol]]'s lights engineer Danny Williams pioneered many innovations that have since become standard practice in rock music light shows. From May 27–29 the '''''EPI''''' played [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco, where Williams built a light show including [[stroboscope|stroboscopes]], slides and film projections onstage. At [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s request he was soon to come back and build more. Film maker [[Jonas Mekas]] (who pioneered film projections during concerts at New York's Cinematheque), Andy Warhol and Danny Williams' influential ideas contributed much to the legendary Fillmore Auditorium's prestige and were also used at the [[Fillmore East]] and [[Fillmore West]], both opening in 1968.

'''''Flock''''', founded in 2002, is a biannual [[literary journal]] based in Jacksonville, Florida.

==History and mission==
Flock (formerly ''Fiction Fix'') was founded by [[University of North Florida]] students and author, musician, artist, and UNF faculty member Mark Ari in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/030503/neR_11892308.shtml Book offers readers their fix of fiction], River City News, March 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Its original Editor-in-Chief was Sarah Cotchaleovich, followed by Melissa Milburn, Thelma Young, and current editor-in-chief April Gray Wilder. The journal publishes "accessibly experimental" and "soulful" literature in both traditional and experimental forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newpages.com/item/5721-fiction-fix-2012-10 Fiction Fix - 2012], New Pages, October 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception the journal has been a part of a growing literary community in North East Florida and has attracted authors from across the United States and world. Between 2009 and 2013 the journal moved entirely online&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazelandwren.com/2011/wwr-fiction-fix/ What We're Reading: Fiction Fix] Hazel and Wren, December 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and began showcasing contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfspinnaker.com/features/2010/08/24/get-your-fiction-fix-now-with-a-side-of-art/ Get your Fiction Fix, now with a side of art], Spinnaker, Aug. 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under the name Fiction Fix, the journal published seventeen fiction issues, one issue of nonfiction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://brevity.wordpress.com/2011/06/27/bait-and-switch-fiction-fix-offers-nonfiction-issue/ Bait and Switch: Fiction Fix Offers Nonfiction Issue], Brevity, June 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; two poetry issues, and two winners of its novella award: "The Sleeping Wall" by Jane Downs and "Homesick Redux" by Daniel Coshnear. In 2016 the journal became Flock with an expanded mission to publish fully multi-genre issues twice a year.

==Awards==
The journal periodically opens for submissions to its Novella Award, offering publication to the winning submission.

[[File:L'Ermatena.jpg|thumb|An [[engraving]] of Hermathena published in ''L'Ermatena'' by [[Michele Arditi]] (1816)]]
'''Hermathena''' or '''Hermathene''' ({{lang-grc|Ἑρμαθήνη}}) was a composite statue, or rather a [[herma|herm]], which may have been a [[Term (architecture)|terminal bust]] or a [[Janus]]-like bust, representing the Greek gods [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]], or their Roman counterparts [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Minerva]].

==Symbolism==
It was natural to see these two deities unified or fused as one form: the Greek god Hermes presided over [[eloquence]], the goddess Athena over crafts and the sciences. The reverse of a medal of the [[Hadrian|Roman Emperor Hadrian]], who prided himself on his learning and eloquence, depicts Hermathena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Bell|title=Bell's New Pantheon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nypdAAAAMAAJ|year=1790|page=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Greek poetry and myth, Hermes and Athena share or 'double' each other's functions, and some of their powers are alternate and related versions of the same quality. For example, each god embodies the kind of clever intelligence or ''[[wiktionary:metis#Etymology 2|metis]]'' that manifests itself in the clever ruse and the winning strategy. For Hermes this quality leans toward the 'night-time' realm of stealth and theft, cunning deception, and successful guidance to the underworld; while for Athena it leans toward the 'day-time' realm of good judgement, quick thinking, and successful guidance on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Russo|date=2000|title=Athena and Hermes in Early Greek Poetry: Doubling and Complementarity|url=http://www.yale.edu/classics/downloads/parry/Athena_and_Hermes.pdf|page=596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermes and Athena were also described as half-siblings because [[Zeus]] was the father of both gods.

==Literature==
The only literary sources concerning Hermathena are found in letters by [[Cicero]] to [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]. Atticus had obtained a rare herm of Athena from Athens for Cicero's Tusculanum ([[Tusculum]] [[Roman villa|villa]]) in 67–65 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/hermathena-hermeracles-e509980?s.num=1&amp;s.start=120|title=Hermathena, Hermeracles|publisher=[[Brill's New Pauly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jérôme Carcopino|title=Cicero|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Hermathena#v=snippet&amp;q=Hermathena&amp;f=false|volume=1|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1969|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero writes to Atticus: ''"Your Hermathena pleases me greatly. It stands so prettily that the whole lecture-room looks like a votive chapel of the deity. I am greatly obliged to you".''&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;[[Cicero]]. ''[[Writings_of_Marcus_Tullius_Cicero#Letters|Letters to Atticus]]'' 1, 1, 5; 1, 4, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

He returns to the subject in another letter. Atticus had probably purchased for him another sculpture of the same kind.

''"What you write about the  Hermathena pleases me greatly. It is a most appropriate ornament for my own little 'seat of learning.' Hermes is suitable every where, and Minerva is the special emblem of a lecture-room. I should be glad if you would, as you suggest, find as many more ornaments of the same kind for the place".''&lt;ref name="Cicero"/&gt;

==In art==
[[File:Achillis Bocchii Bonon. Symbolicarum quaestionum - Hermathena.jpg|thumb|Hermathena [[emblem]] from ''Symbolicarum quaestionum'' by [[Achille Bocchi]] (1574)]]
It was common during the [[Roman period]] for the elite to collect herms and terminal figures as [[Roman gardens|garden ornaments]] and interior decorations for their villas and palaces. Having a statue of Hermathena may have also been believed to give [[artistic inspiration|divine inspiration]].

One of the few surviving Hermathenas is on display at the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]. A bust of Athena from the 1st century BC (circa 49–25 BC), that had once topped a terminal pillar, was found at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museoarcheologiconazionale/itinerari-tematici/nel-museo/collezioni-pompeiane/RIT_RA411|title=Erma di Atena (6322)|publisher=Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], a number of artists, for example [[Rubens]] and [[Vincenzo Cartari]], portrayed Hermathena in art either as two gods acting in conjunction, or as a single deity with the attributes of the other, for example Athene holding the [[caduceus]], which was a symbol of Hermes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Gordon|title=The Renaissance Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520040929|year=1980|pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ceiling at the [[Farnese Palace]] is a late-16th-century fresco of Hermathena, called the ''Gabinetto dell'Ermatena'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graziella Frezza|title=The Palazzo Farnese at Caprarola|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8880164481|year=2001|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Federico Zuccari]]; the fresco depicts an androgynous fusion of the deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-lune.com/v6/index?domain=labinf&amp;nodes=website&amp;author=Giulia%20Spina&amp;title=Palazzo%20Farnese%20di%20Caprarola|title=Il Palazzo Farnese di Caprarola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}

The '''idea–expression divide''' or '''idea–expression dichotomy''' limits the scope of [[copyright]] protection by differentiating an [[idea]] from the expression or manifestation of that idea.

The [[Computer Programs Directive|European Union Software Directive]], Article 1.2, for example, expressly excludes from copyright ideas and principles that underlie any element of a computer program, including those that underlie its interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Cite web|author=Mylly, Ulla=Maija|title=Harmonizing Copyright Rules for Computer Program Interface Protection|publisher=University of Louisville Louis D. Brandeis School of Law|location=Louisville, Kentucky|page=14|url=http://www.law.louisville.edu/sites/www.law.louisville.edu/files/cicl2-mylly.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605051113/http://www.law.louisville.edu/sites/www.law.louisville.edu/files/cicl2-mylly.pdf|archivedate=5 June 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:111:0016:0022:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by the European Court of Justice in [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1446134154470&amp;uri=CELEX:62010CJ0406 SAS Institute Inc. v World Programming Ltd.], "to accept that the functionality of a computer program can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."

In the United States the 1879 opinion of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Baker v. Selden]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|101|99|1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborated this doctrine, holding that, while exclusive rights to the "[[useful arts]]" (in this case [[bookkeeping]]) described in a book might be available by patent, only the description itself was protectable by copyright. In ''[[Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.]]'', 471 U.S. 539, 556 (1985), the Supreme Court stated that "copyright's idea/expression dichotomy 'strike[s] a definitional balance between the First Amendment and the Copyright Act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author's expression.'" (internal citation omitted). Additionally, in ''[[Mazer v. Stein]]'', 347 U.S. 201, 217 (1954), the Supreme Court stated "Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea—not the idea itself."

Some of the [[criticism of intellectual property|criticism directed at "intellectual property"]] is based on the confusion between [[patent]]s, which may confer [[Property|proprietary]] rights in relation to general ideas and concepts ''per se'' when construed as methods, and copyrights, which cannot confer such rights.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
An [[adventure novel]] provides an illustration of the concept. Copyright may subsist in the work as a whole, in the particular story or characters involved, or in any [[art]]work contained in the book, but generally not in the idea or [[genre]] of the story. Copyright, therefore, may not subsist in the idea of a man venturing out on a [[quest]], but may subsist in a particular story that follows that pattern. Similarly, if the methods or processes described in a work are [[patentability|patentable]], they may be the subject of various [[claim (patent)|patent claims]], which may or may not be broad enough to cover other methods or processes based on the same idea. [[Arthur C. Clarke]], for example, sufficiently described the concept of a communications satellite (a [[geostationary satellite]] used as a [[telecommunications]] relay) in a 1945 paper that it was not considered patentable in 1954 when it was developed (independently{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}) at [[Bell Labs]].

In the English decision of ''[[Donoghue v. Allied Newspapers Limited]]'' (1938) Ch 106, the court illustrated the concept by stating that "the person who has clothed the idea in form, whether by means of a picture, a play or a book" owns the copyright. In the Australian decision of ''[[Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co. Ltd v. Taylor]]'' (1937) 58 CLR 479 at 498, Latham CJ used the analogy of reporting a person's fall from a bus: the first person to do so could not use the law of copyright to stop other people from announcing this fact.

==Scènes à faire==
Some courts have recognized that particular ideas can be expressed effectively only by using certain elements or background. The [[French language|French]] name for this doctrine is ''[[Scènes à faire]]''. Therefore, even the expression in these circumstances is unprotected, or extremely limited to verbatim copying only. This is true in the United Kingdom and most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lai, Stanley|year=1999|chapter=Chapter V: The Position of ''Scenes a Faire'' in English Law|title=The Copyright Protection of Computer Software in the United Kingdom|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Hart Publishing|pages=54–56|isbn=978-1-84113-087-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] it is recognized that certain background elements are universal or at least commonplace in some types of work. For example, in ''Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc.'', 784 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1986), the [[Second Circuit]] said that in a film about cops in the South Bronx it was inevitable that the scenery would include drunks, stripped cars, prostitutes, and rats. In ''Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd.'', 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir. 1993), the Tenth Circuit held that hardware standards and mechanical specifications, software standards and compatibility requirements, computer manufacturer design standards, target industry practices and demands, and computer industry programming practices were unprotectable scenes a faire for computer programs. The principle must have a limit, however, so that something is outside the ''scènes à faire'' doctrine for South Bronx movies. Perhaps, cockroaches, gangs, and muggings are also part of the South Bronx ''scène à faire'', but further similarity such as the film having as characters "a slumlord with a heart of gold and a policeman who is a Zen Buddhist and lives in a garage surely goes beyond the South Bronx ''scène à faire''. There must be some expression possible even in a cliche-ridden genre."

==Merger==
A broader but related concept is the merger doctrine. Some ideas can be expressed intelligibly only in one or a limited number of ways. The rules of a game provide an example.&lt;ref&gt;''Morrissey v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.'', 379 F.2d 675 (1st Cir. 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases the expression merges with the idea and is therefore not protected.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc.'', 862 F.2d 204 (9th Cir. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States federal courts|United States courts]] are divided on whether merger constitutes a defense to infringement or prevents copyrightability in the first place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google, Inc., 750 F.3d 1339, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2014)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15197092051369647665&amp;q=oracle+v.+google&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is often pleaded as an [[affirmative defense]] to [[copyright infringement]].

==Look and feel==
In August 2013, [[Robin Thicke]], [[Pharrell Williams]], and [[T.I.]] had a [[lawsuit]] filed against them by the [[Personal_life_of_Marvin_Gaye|family]] and [[estate (law)|estate]] of [[Marvin Gaye]] regarding their song "[[Blurred Lines]]"; the family had argued that "Blurred Lines" had copied the "feel" and "sound" of the Marvin Gaye song "[[Got to Give It Up]]" (which Thicke cited as an influence on the song), contradicting the [[idea-expression]] divide.&lt;ref name=thr-blurredripoff&gt;{{cite news|title=Robin Thicke Sues to Protect 'Blurred Lines' from Marvin Gaye's Family (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/robin-thicke-sues-protect-blurred-607492|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=18 August 2013|first=Eriq|last=Gardner|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-blurred-lines-reaction-brian-wilson-bonnie-mckee-20150314-story.html#page=1 |title=Brian Wilson, Bonnie McKee and others react to 'Blurred Lines' verdict – LA Times |first= Randy|last= Lewis|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date= 2015-03-14|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |issn=0458-3035 |accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, a court ruled that, despite not sharing the same chords, lyrics, or other copyrightable elements, "Blurred Lines" had infringed on the copyrights of "Got to Give It Up" by copying its feel and sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020151203A30/Williams%20v.%20Bridgeport%20Music,%20Inc.

'''''Imitation of Life''''' is a 1934 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[John M. Stahl]]. The screenplay by William Hurlbut, based on [[Fannie Hurst]]'s 1933 [[Imitation of Life (novel)|novel of the same name]], was augmented by eight additional uncredited writers, including [[Preston Sturges]] and [[Finley Peter Dunne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0025301|Imitation of Life (1934)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Warren William]] and [[Rochelle Hudson]] and features [[Louise Beavers]] and [[Fredi Washington]].

The film was originally released by Universal Pictures on November 26, 1934, and later re-issued in 1936. A [[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|1959 remake with the same title]] was directed by [[Douglas Sirk]].

In 2005, ''Imitation of Life'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". It was also named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 2007 as one of "The 25 Most Important Films on Race".&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1709148_1709143_1709634,00.html ''Imitation of Life'' in ''Time'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
White widow Bea Pullman ([[Claudette Colbert]]) and her toddler daughter Jessie ([[Juanita Quigley]]), take in black housekeeper Delilah Johnson ([[Louise Beavers]]) and her daughter Peola (Sebie Hendricks), whose fair complexion conceals her [[mixed-race]] ancestry. Bea exchanges room and board for work, although struggling to make ends meet. Delilah and Peola quickly become like family to Jessie and Bea. They particularly enjoy Delilah's pancakes, made from a special family recipe.

Bea finds it difficult to make a living selling maple syrup, as her husband had done. Using her wiles to get a storefront on the busy Atlantic City boardwalk refurbished for practically nothing, she opens a pancake restaurant, where Delilah cooks in the front window. Five years later, Bea makes her last payment to the furniture man and is debt-free.

Jessie ([[Marilyn Knowlden]]) and Peola (Dorothy Black) have proven to be challenging children to raise: Jessie is demanding, not particularly studious, relying instead on her charm. She is the first person to call Peola "black" in a hurtful way, hinting that their childhood idyll is doomed. Peola does not tell her classmates at school that she is "colored" and is humiliated when her mother shows up one day, revealing her secret.
[[File:Imitation of Life.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Claudette Colbert]]]]

Later, at the suggestion of a passerby, Elmer Smith ([[Ned Sparks]]), Bea sets up an even more successful pancake flour corporation, marketing Delilah as an [[Aunt Jemima]]-like [[Mascot#Corporate mascots|product mascot]]. She offers Delilah a 20% interest in her family recipe, but childlike, Delilah refuses and continues to act as Bea's housekeeper and factotum, the shares held presumably in trust. Bea becomes wealthy from her business.

Ten years later, the two older women are confronted with problems. Eighteen-year-old Jessie ([[Rochelle Hudson]]), home on college vacation, falls in love with her mother's boyfriend, Stephen Archer ([[Warren William]]), who is unaware at first of her affections. Meanwhile, Peola ([[Fredi Washington]]), seeking more opportunities in the segregated society, [[Passing (racial identity)|passes]] as white, identifying with her European ancestry and breaking Delilah's heart.

Leaving her Negro college, Peola takes a job as a cashier in a whites only restaurant. When her mother and Bea track her down, she is humiliated to be identified as black. She finally tells her mother that she is going away, never to return, so she can pass as a white woman without the fear that Delilah will show up. Her mother is heartbroken and takes to her bed, murmuring Peola's name and forgiving her before eventually succumbing to heartbreak. The black servants sing a [[Negro spirituals|spiritual]] as she dies, with Bea holding her hand at the end. Delilah's last wish had been for a large, grand funeral, complete with a marching band and a horse-drawn hearse.

Bea sees to it that Delilah is given the funeral she wished for, and, just before the processional begins, a remorseful, crying Peola appears, begging her dead mother to forgive her.

Peola returns to her Negro college and presumably embraces her African descent. Bea breaks her engagement with Stephen, not wanting to hurt her daughter's feelings by being with him, but promises to find him after Jessie is over her infatuation with him. Ultimately, Bea embraces Jessie, remembering the girl's insistent demands for her toy duck (her "quack quack") when she was a toddler.

==Production==
[[Fannie Hurst]]'s inspiration in writing her novel ''[[Imitation of Life (novel)|Imitation of Life]]'' was a road trip to Canada she took with her friend, the black short-story writer and folklorist [[Zora Neale Hurston]].  The novel was originally to be called ''Sugar House'' but was changed just before publication.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, Jeff [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=79028&amp;category=Articles "Imitation of Life"], Turner Classics Movies article&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal borrowed Warren William from [[Warner Bros.]] for the male lead, but the studio had first wanted [[Paul Lukas]] for the part.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt;  The parents of the child playing "Jessie" as a baby changed her name from "Baby Jane" to "Juanita Quigley" during production of the film.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt;  Claudette Colbert was borrowed from Paramount.

Universal had difficulty receiving approval from the censors at the [[Hays Office]] for the original script they submitted for ''Imitation of Life''.  [[Joseph Breen]] objected to the elements of [[miscegenation]] in the story, which "not only violates the Production Code but is very dangerous from the standpoint both of industry and public policy."&lt;ref name=tcmnotes/&gt; He rejected the project, writing, "Hurst's novel dealing with a partly colored girl who wants to pass as white violates the clause covering miscegenation in spirit, if not in fact!"&lt;ref name="courtney"/&gt; The [[Production Code Administration]]'s (PCA) censors had difficulty in "negotiating how boundaries of racial difference should be cinematically constructed to be seen, and believed, on the screen."&lt;ref name="courtney"&gt;[http://www.genders.org/g27/g27_pr.html Courtney, "Picturizing Race: Hollywood's Censorship of Miscegenation and Production of Racial Visibility through Imitation of Life"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530175734/http://www.genders.org/g27/g27_pr.html |date=2013-05-30 }}, ''Genders'', Vol. 27, 1998, accessed 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Their concern was the character of Peola, in whose person miscegenation was represented by this young woman considered black, but with sufficient white ancestry to pass as white and the desire to do so. Susan Courtney says that the PCA participated in "Hollywood's ongoing desire to remake interracial desire, an historical fact, as always already having been a [[taboo]]."&lt;ref name="courtney"/&gt; In addition, she explains the quandary imagined by the censors: "the PCA reads Peola's light skin, and her passing, as signifiers of 'miscegenation.' By conflating miscegenation and passing in this way, the censors effectively attempt to extend the Code's ban on desire across black and white racial boundaries to include a ban on identification across those boundaries as well."&lt;ref name="courtney"/&gt;

They also objected to some language in the script, and a scene where a black boy is nearly [[lynching|lynched]] for approaching a white woman whom he believed had invited his attention. Breen continued to refuse to approve the script up to July 17, when the director had already been shooting the film for two weeks.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=79028&amp;category=Notes Notes], TCM&lt;/ref&gt;

''Imitation of Life'' was in production from June 27 to September 11, 1934, and was released on November 26 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=79028&amp;category=Overview Overview: ''Imitation of Life''], TCM&lt;/ref&gt;

All versions of ''Imitation of Life'' issued by Universal after 1938, including TV, VHS and DVD versions, feature re-done title cards in place of the originals. Missing from all of these prints is a title card with a short prologue, which was included in the original release. It reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Atlantic City, in 1919, was not just a boardwalk, rolling-chairs and expensive hotels where bridal couples spent their honeymoons. A few blocks from the gaiety of the famous boardwalk, permanent citizens of the town lived and worked and reared families just like people in less glamorous cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcf.ua.edu/classes/Jbutler/T440/ImitationOfLife1934Illustrations.htm Imitation of Life (1934) screenshots] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907130625/http://www.tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T440/ImitationOfLife1934Illustrations.htm |date=2006-09-07 }}, Turner Classics Films&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The scene in which Elmer approaches Bea with the idea to sell Delilah's pancake mix to retail customers refers to a legend about the origins of [[Coca-Cola]]'s success. It has been credited with strengthening the [[urban myth]] about the secret of Coke's success — that is, to "bottle it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/bottleit.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Coca-Cola in Bottles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
"According to [[Jean-Pierre Coursodon]] in his essay on [[John M. Stahl]] in ''American Directors,'' 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Fredi Washington]] ... reportedly received a great deal of mail from young blacks thanking her for having expressed their intimate concerns and contradictions so well. One may add that Stahl's film was somewhat unique in its casting of a black actress in this kind of part - which was to become a Hollywood stereotype of sorts.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Jeff Stafford, "''Imitation of Life'' (1934)", Turner Classics Film Article, Turner Classics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(Later films dealing with [[mulatto]] women, including the 1959 version of this work, cast white women in the roles.)&lt;ref name="turner"/&gt;

The themes of the movie, to the modern eye, deal with very important issues—[[Passing (racial identity)|passing]], the role of skin color in the black community and tensions between its light-skinned and dark-skinned members, the role of black servants in white families, and maternal affection.

Some scenes seem to have been filmed to highlight the fundamental unfairness of Delilah's social position—for example, while living in Bea's fabulous NYC mansion, Delilah descends down the shadowy stairs to the basement where her rooms are. Bea, dressed in the height of fashion, floats up the stairs to her rooms, whose luxury was built from the success of Delilah's recipe. Others highlight the similarities between the two mothers, both of whom adore their daughters and are brought to grief by the younger women's actions. Some scenes seem to mock Delilah, because of her supposed ignorance about her financial interests and her willingness to be in a support role, but the two women have built an independent business together. In dying and in death—especially with the long processional portraying a very dignified African-American community, Delilah is treated with great respect.

==Awards and honors==
''Imitation of Life'' was nominated for three [[Academy Award]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Assistant Director|Best Assistant Director]] for Scott R. Beal, and [[Academy Award for Sound|Sound Mixing]] for [[Theodore Soderberg (1890–1971)|Theodore Soderberg]].&lt;ref name="Oscars1935"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1935 |title=The 7th Academy Awards (1935) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-08-07|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, ''Imitation of Life'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the Library of Congress. In February 2007 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine included it among ''The 25 Most Important Films on Race'', as part of the magazine's celebration of [[Black History Month]].&lt;ref name=time /&gt;

==Home video==
Both the original 1934 film and its remake were issued in 2003 on a double-sided [[DVD]] from [[Universal Studios|Universal Home Entertainment]].
The movie as well as the 1959 remake were re-released on DVD and Blu-ray as part of Universal's 100th Anniversary on January 10, 2012.

The '''''Madonna and Child with St Jerome''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Pinturicchio]], painted around 1481 and housed in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] of [[Berlin, Germany]].

==Description==
The painting shows an infrequent composition, with the Virgin holding the Child who writes on a book, an allusion to his intervention in the Holy Books. On the right is [[St. Jerome]], recognizable by his cardinal dress, leaving a book on the marble throne where the Madonna sits: in this case this is one of his traditional attributes of knowledge.

Jesus wears a pearl-lined [[coif]] which can be seen in another Pinturicchio's work of the period, the ''[[Crucifixion between Sts. Jerome and Christoper]]'' (c. 1475), now at the [[Borghese Gallery]]. The theme, used also by [[Fiorenzo di Lorenzo]], was later abandoned by the Umbrian artist in favour of a free, curly hair.

On the right is an open landscape, a typical element of the Renaissance Umbrian school.

'''Monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo''' ({{lang-en|Monument to the Divine Savior of the World}}) is a [[monument]] located on Plaza El Salvador del Mundo (The Savior of the World Plaza) in [[San Salvador|San Salvador City]], [[El Salvador]]. It consists of a statue of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] standing on top of a global sphere of planet earth, placed on top of the tall four-sided concrete base pedestal.&lt;ref name="O'Malley2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlie O'Malley|title=Frommer's Nicaragua and El Salvador|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2__jaeRMFIwC&amp;pg=PA256|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-16027-5|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a landmark located in the country's capital San Salvador. It is a symbol that identifies and represents both El Salvador and Salvadorans throughout the world.

==History==
The monument was built on a pedestal originally used to decorate the tomb of [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]], the [[President of El Salvador]] between 1911 and 1913.,&lt;ref name="historia" /&gt; and presented by Araujo's family on November 26, 1942, in connection to the first National [[Eucharist]]ic Congress in San Salvador.&lt;ref name="historia"&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.amss.gob.sv/pages/ciudad/historia.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113190637/http://www.amss.gob.sv/pages/ciudad/historia.htm | archivedate = 13 January 2008 | title = Historia "Ciudad de San Salvador" | language = Spanish | accessdate = 2 May 2010 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconic statue of Christ on the globe sphere of planet earth is part of the Monument to Divino Salvador del Mundo on Plaza El Salvador del Mundo (The Savior of the World Plaza).

The statue was damaged in the [[1986 San Salvador earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inicia restauración imagen del Salvador del Mundo |url=http://elmundo.com.sv/inicia-restauracion-imagen-del-salvador-del-mundo |newspaper=[[Diario El Mundo]] |date=2 October 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Piden pintar monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo |author=Jamie García |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47868&amp;idArt=7469398 |newspaper=elsalvador.com |date=1 November 2012 |accessdate=19 April 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt and put back in place months after the campaign "Lift up your soul Salvadoran". In front of the plaza, there is a statue lifted in memory of [[Oscar Arnulfo Romero]]. On the other side, from that area, it is customary to begin the march of floats during the celebration of the festivities of the city.

==Remodelling==
The plaza was completely remodeled and entirely upgraded in 2010. As part of the reorganization plan to improve the image of San Salvador, mayor [[Norman Quijano]] made the remodeling and renaming of Plaza las Americas, now named Plaza Salvador del Mundo. The renovation work included the complete renovation of sidewalks, the stands and the area of the flags. The image of Christ, placed about 18 m high,  was also revamped with new paint.

'''''Music''''' (''La Musique'') is a wall-size painting made by [[Henri Matisse]] in 1910. The painting was commissioned by [[Sergei Shchukin]], who hung it with ''[[Dance (Matisse)|Dance]]'' on the staircase of his Moscow mansion. Matisse made the painting without any preparatory sketches, and thus the painting bears many traces of modifications. One can virtually trace the steps Matisse took to find the intended effect. Like in ''Dance'', the aim was to show man's attainment of a state of completeness by immersion in creativity. The painting is now in the collection of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;State Hermitage Museum - [http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/fcgi-bin/db2www/descrPage.mac/descrPage?selLang=English&amp;indexClass=PICTURE_EN&amp;PID=GJ-9674&amp;numView=1&amp;ID_NUM=11&amp;thumbFile=/tmplobs/XUXNV409V_403G9_23HX6.jpg&amp;embViewVer=&amp;comeFrom=quick&amp;sorting=no&amp;thumbId=6&amp;numResults=64&amp;tmCond=matisse&amp;searchIndex=TAGFILEN&amp;author=Matisse,%26%2332;Henri Music  ]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paumgartner Altar old.jpg|thumb|100 px|The right panel as it appeared before the 1903 restoration]]
The '''''Paumgartner altarpiece''''' (c. 1500) is an early [[triptych]] painting by [[Albrecht Dürer]], commissioned by the Paumgartner family of [[Nuremberg]]. The central panel depicts a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity scene]], while the wings depict [[Saint George]] (left) and [[Saint Eustace]] (right). The saint's faces are [[donor portrait]]s of the brothers Stephan and Lukas Paumgartner, respectively. Other members of the Paumgartner family are depicted as small figures in the center panel.

In 1616 the painting was bought by [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]] and taken to [[Munich]]. There it was altered to suit 17th century tastes. This entailed adding helmets, horses, and landscape backgrounds to the portraits of the saints and painting over the small donor figures in the center panel. These embellishments were removed by restorators in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;''Dürer und Grünewald, Der Frankfurter Heller-Altar'', Bernhard Decker, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gFTrAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=Paumgartner+altar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H84oT5HUL8iZgwelqsjdBA&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=Paumgartner%20altar&amp;f=false Brief article] from a contemporary periodical about the restoration&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1988, the ''Paumgartner altarpiece'' was one of three paintings at the [[Alte Pinakothek]] that were attacked with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] by the serial art vandal [[Hans-Joachim Bohlmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xKyeh1_V7IC&amp;pg=PA283|page=283|title=Albrecht Dürer: a guide to research|author=Jane Campbell Hutchison|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2000|isbn=0-8153-2114-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It alone suffered at least $12 million worth of damage.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/22/arts/3-durer-masterpieces-vandalized-with-acid.html 3 Durer Masterpieces Vandalized With Acid.]" ''New York Times'', 22 April 1988&lt;/ref&gt; After 21 years of restoration, it was returned to display in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, John.

'''Peeckelhaeringh''', or '''Pekelharing''', refers to an old Dutch word for [[pickled herring]]. Today it is best known as a [[jester]] by the same name who was the subject of a painting by [[Frans Hals]]. 

The star of 17th-century comic plays, Mr. Peeckelhaering was an actor who was later engraved by the local engraver [[Jonas Suyderhoef]], who accompanied his engraving with a poem declaring that "Mr. Peeckelhaering's wet lips show how he enjoys a fresh mug of beer because his throat is always dry." This painting was documented by [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote:

"95. THE MERRY TOPER. [[Wilhelm von Bode|B]]. 97 ; [[Ernst Wilhelm Moes|M]]. 267. Half-length, life size. A laughing man with a brown face is turned half right. His head is slightly inclined to the left ; he looks at the spectator. He has a slight beard and moustache. His rough hair sticks out from beneath a flat red cap with yellow trimming. His costume is also red and yellow. In his left hand he holds a mug with open lid. In the same style as 96 and 98. This picture is represented in two pictures by [[Jan Steen]], Nos. 137 and 446 (see Vol. I.). [Pendant to 123. Compare 99a.] Signed on the right above the mug " f. hals f." ; canvas, 29 1/2 inches by 24 inches. Engraved by J. Suyderhoef as "Monsieur Peeckelhaering." Under the name "Peeckelhaering" pictures are mentioned in the inventories of Henric Bugge, Leyden, 1666 ; Hendrick Huyck, Nymwegen, January 10, 1669 ; and Jan Zeeuw and Marie Bergervis, who died 1690, Amsterdam according to notes by A. Bredius. A copy on canvas, 29 1/2 inches by 26 inches, signed on the right with the monogram was in the sale : Vicomte de Buisseret, Brussels, April 29, 1891, No. 41. In the chief Kassel inventory of 1749, No. 363. In the Kassel Gallery, 1903 catalogue, No. 216."&lt;ref&gt; [https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/26/mode/1up Hofstede de Groot] on "The Merry Toper"; catalog number 95&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting was owned by the [[Leiden]] painter Jan Steen who painted it on the background walls of a few of his household scenes, namely ''The Doctor's Visit'', and ''As the Old Sang, So the Young Pipe''. The latter painting was itself based on a popular proverb from the [[Emblem book]] "Spiegel van den Ouden ende Nieuwen Tijdt" by Jacob Cats published in 1632 and referred to the habit of birds to echo the pipe, or peeping chirp of their parents.

A '''photo blanket''' is a large, rectangular piece of fabric displaying images, pictures, or designs, often with bound edges, used as a [[blanket]] or decorative object.  Historically photo blanket were made of thick cloth depicting people, objects, and symbols intended to tell a story or reveal historical events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/blanket.html Encarta (North American) Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The photo blanket has a history nearly as long as the history of clothing itself.  For thousands of years, people around the world used blankets as a form of communication through storytelling, honoring dead, and a well-respected form of art.

Ancient [[Egyptians]] weaved colored threads and sometimes even gold into a fabric (usually linen) or by painting with inks and dyes on [[papyrus]] cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eternalegypt.org Eternal Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cloth (blanket) would often form pictures to tell stories and to honor prominent people or one of the multiple gods of their culture.

[[Navajo people|Navajo]] tribes used special [[indigo dye]] from Mexico and other [[vegetal dyes]] to color multi-ply yarns and weave them into three main types of blankets - a [[serape]] (a shoulder covering blanket that is longer than it is wide), a [[saddle blanket]] (a blanket that was folded in half under a horse’s saddle for extra cushioning), and a chief's blanket (a shoulder blanket that was made wider than it was long).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianterritory.com Indian Territory]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] rug makers - one of the most respected jobs in their society - would use luxurious silks, wools, and hemp to create beautiful works or art.  Using vertical looms and fibers dyed with [[natural dye|natural vegetal dyes]], they form several different types of knots together for a soft and evenly tufted finish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lecaflor.co.uk/pdfs/tiger.pdf   Bringing New Life to an Ancient Craft]&lt;/ref&gt;

For hundreds of years, tribes throughout [[Indonesia]] and [[Africa]] have used a dye and resist technique called [[batik]] to create intricate patterns and pictures.  During the past two or three centuries batik has become one of the principal means of expression of the spiritual and cultural values of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discover-indo.tierranet.com/batikpag.htm Discover Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again used as a form of storytelling and passing down history, picture fabrics and blankets have been an integral part of their culture.

[[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]] have used weaving and blankets for the same purposes, using gold and other precious metals woven into their cloths and blankets.  As an important artistic form, it conveys the history and myths of a culture through [[iconography]] and pictures.

Throughout history, photo blankets have been an ever present and fundamental key to communication, decoration, and tradition.  Today’s photo blankets have changed to modern techniques and more efficient manufacturing, but the primary meaning has remained very similar.  People display meaningful photos that represent memories and reveal history.  Adding text or symbols communicate [[language]] and add to the blanket’s storytelling aspect.

== Uses ==
Photo blankets are used throughout the home for displaying pictures and images as objects of decor, for warmth, or to be given and received as gifts.

Uses in home decor include furniture coverings and as decorative displays of a design or [[photograph]].  Photo blankets can be used to cuddle up for warmth either in or outdoors.  They are often given as wedding, birthday, [[Christmas]], baby, or anniversary gifts to individuals or couples displaying memorable pictures, dates and quotes on them.

== Types ==
There are three main types of photo blankets - woven photo blankets, knitted photo blankets, and dyed photo blankets.

A woven photo blanket is made on a [[jacquard loom]] using digital software that scans a picture, creates a pattern and then creates a woven picture blanket using various colored yarns that interlace at 90 degree angles (see [[weaving|weave]]).  Woven photo blankets, comes in two varieties; an afghan photo blanket and a tapestry photo blanket.  The yarn used in the weave of an afghan photo blanket is the same thickness in both horizontal and vertical directions while a tapestry photo blanket is manufactured with yarn of two different diameters. In a tapestry photo blanket the thinner of the two yarns; i.e., the warp, actually consists of 6-8 different color strands of yarn which are combined in various ways, based on a photo, to re-create the colors as accurately as possible (even black and white).  

A knitted photo blanket is made by a machine that uses a similar scanning and pattern process, but instead of weaving the yarns together, knits them together in a looping technique (see [[knit]]).  Often knitted photo blankets consist of limited colors due to the knitting process and the continuous thread forming loops in the process.

A dyed photo blanket is the newest type of photo blanket and is made by printing dye onto fabric from a digital image (see [[dye sublimation]]).  This type allows for unlimited colors and has the sharpest picture clarity of the three.  

Each process creates a permanent picture, with varying degrees of softness, color and clarity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8720">'''''Poshlost''''' or '''''Poshlost' ''''' ({{lang-rus |по́шлость |p= ˈpoʂləsʲtʲ}}) is a Russian word  for a particular negative human character trait or man-made thing or idea.  It has been cited as an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] word, as there is no single exact English equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rbth.com/blogs/2014/05/29/a_question_of_taste_the_untranslatable_word_poshlost_37047.html | title = A question of taste: The untranslatable word 'poshlost' | last = Mikheev | first = Alexey | date = 29 May 2014 | website = Russia Beyond The Headlines | access-date = 12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It carries much cultural baggage in [[Russia]] and has been discussed at length by various writers.

It is derived from the adjective 
[[:wikt:пошлый|пошлый]].

==Description==
It has been defined as "petty evil or self-satisfied [[vulgarity]]",{{Sfn | Alexandrov | 1991 | p = 106}} while [[Svetlana Boym]]{{Sfn | Boym | 2001 | p = 279}} defines it briefly as "[[obscenity]] and bad taste".

Boym goes on to describe it at more length:{{Sfn | Boym | 1994 | p = 41}}
{{quote |''Poshlost’'' is the Russian version of banality, with a characteristic national flavoring of metaphysics and high morality, and a peculiar conjunction of the sexual and the spiritual.  This one word encompasses triviality, vulgarity, sexual promiscuity, and a lack of spirituality.  The war against ''poshlost’'' was a cultural obsession of the Russian and Soviet intelligentsia from the 1860s to 1960s.}}

Early examinations of ''poshlost'' in literature are in the work of [[Nikolai Gogol]].  Gogol wrote (of [[Pushkin]]),&lt;!--Please leave the following quotation as the author wrote it, including the part in brackets.--&gt;
{{Quote | He used to say of me that no other writer before me possessed the gift to expose so brightly life's ''poshlust'', to depict so powerfully the ''poshlust'' of a ''poshlusty'' man [''poshlost' poshlovo cheloveka''] in such a way that everybody's eyes would be opened wide to all the petty trivia that often escape our attention." | "The Third Letter à Propos ''Dead Souls''", 1843, quoted and translated by Davydov, 1995.  Brackets in original.  See below for his transliteration "poshlust".}}

In his novels, [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]] "tried to develop a heroic figure who could, with the verve and abandon of a [[Don Quixote]], grapple with the problems of Russian society, who could once and for all overcome 'poshlost’, the complacent mediocrity and moral degeneration of his environment".{{Sfn | Lindstrom | 1966 | p = 149}}  [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky |Dostoyevsky]] applied the word to the [[Satan |Devil]]; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]], to Western-influenced young people.{{Sfn | Boym | 1994 | page = 41}}

[[D. S. Mirsky]] was an early user of the word in English in writing about Gogol; he defined it as "'self-satisfied inferiority,' moral and spiritual".{{Sfn | Mirsky | 1927 | p = 158}}  [[Vladimir Nabokov]] made it more widely known in his book on Gogol, where he romanized it as "'''poshlust'''" (punningly: "[[wikt:posh|posh]]" + "[[lust]]"). Poshlust, Nabokov explained, "is not only the obviously trashy but mainly the falsely important, the falsely beautiful, the falsely clever, the falsely attractive.  A list of literary characters personifying ''poshlust'' will include... Polonius and the royal pair in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Rodolphe and Homais from ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', Laevsky in [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s 'The Duel', [[James Joyce|Joyce]]'s [[Molly Bloom|Marion [Molly] Bloom]], young Bloch in ''[[In Search of Lost Time|Search of Lost Time]]'', [[Guy de Maupassant |Maupassant]]'s '[[Bel Ami]]', [[Anna Karenina]]'s husband, and Berg in ''[[War and Peace]]''".{{Sfn | Nabokov | 1944 | p = 70 | ps = .  Brackets added.}} {{Harvnb | Nabokov | 1973}} also listed
{{quote |Corny trash, vulgar clichés, [[Philistinism]] in all its phases, imitations of imitations, bogus profundities, crude, moronic and dishonest pseudo-literature&amp;mdash;these are obvious examples.  Now, if we want to pin down poshlost in contemporary writing we must look for it in Freudian symbolism, moth-eaten mythologies, social comment, humanistic messages, political allegories, overconcern with class or race, and the journalistic generalities we all know.}}

[[Azar Nafisi]] mentions it and quotes the "falsely" definition in ''[[Reading Lolita in Tehran]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Guardian | place = [[United Kingdom |UK]] | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1039915,00.html | title = Books | type = review}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nabokov often targeted ''poshlost'' in his own work; the Alexandrov definition above refers to the character of M'sieur Pierre in ''[[Invitation to a Beheading]]''.

Another notable literary treatment is [[Fyodor Sologub]]'s novel ''[[Fyodor Sologub#The Petty Demon|The Petty Demon]]''.  It tells the story of a provincial schoolteacher, Peredonov, notable for his complete lack of redeeming human qualities. [[James H. Billington]]{{Sfn | Billington | 1966 | page = 494}} said of it:
{{quote|The book puts on display a Freudian treasure chest of perversions with subtlety and credibility.  The name of the novel's hero, Peredonov, became a symbol of calculating [[concupiscence]] for an entire generation...  [Peredonov] seeks not the ideal world but the world of petty venality and sensualism, ''poshlost'.''  He torments his students, derives erotic satisfaction from watching them kneel to pray, and systematically befouls his apartment before leaving it as part of his generalized spite against the universe.}}

[[Richard Taruskin]] summarized poshlost as "highfalutin bad taste," applying the term to a performance of the [[Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution (Prokofiev)]].

The '''Pub Design Awards (PDA)''' are an annual [[award]]s, established in 1983 and hosted by [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]] in association with [[English Heritage]] and the [[Victorian Society]], that are given to exceptional [[pub]]s in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] that have been newly built/converted or have recently undergone building/conservation work.

==Categories==
The awards cover 4 Categories:
#'''New Build''' ''(For newly constructed pubs)''
#'''Conversion of existing buildings to pub use''' ''(For use of a building that had not previously been a pub)''
#'''Refurbishment of existing public houses''' ''(For recently refurbished pubs. The final interior must suit the era of the building and enhance the 'feel' of the pub)''
#'''The ''English Heritage'' Award for conservation''' ''(For pubs that have retained much of their original design and/or decor, and have recently had conservation work to improve the overall condition of the interior.)''

There is also a fifth award which is given independently of the above categories and cannot be entered directly; the '''Joe Goodwin Conservation Award''', sometimes known as '' '[[Joe Goodwin]] Award for best 'Street-Corner Local' ''. This is chosen from all entries, not just winners of other categories.

Any pub can only enter one category, entries may be from anywhere in the [[British Isles]]. Anyone can enter a pub for the awards.

==Entry==
[[Photograph]]s and a typed description(Max. 2 A4 sheets) of the interior and exterior and what work was completed are required for entry, as are drawings of the interior plan and location map of the pub.

To qualify, the work must have been finished between 1 January and 31 December of the year before, e.g. For ''2007'', the work on the pub must have been completed sometime in ''2006''.

==Judging==
Judging takes place initially by shortlisting, after which the selection will be visited, the panel comprises members of the [[CAMRA Pubs Group]] along with conservation experts and architects outside ''CAMRA''.

Not every award is given every year(depending on the entries), but there are often mentions for highly commended pubs, and some years there are joint winners when there are a number of exceptional pubs in particular categories.

The winners receive a plaque which can be displayed publicly in the pub, permanently.

==Winners==
Where the entry reads ''None Awarded'', this means no award was given in that category for that year, even though there may be 'Highly Commended' pubs in that category(which are not listed here). ''None listed'', this means there was no information about that particular award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8777">[[File:RabulaGospelsFol13vAscension.jpg|thumb|250px|Folio 13v of the Rabbula Gospels contains a miniature of the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]].]]

The '''Rabbula Gospels''', or '''Rabula Gospels''', (Florence, Biblioteca Mediceo Laurenziana, cod. Plut. I, 56) is a 6th-century [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Gospel Book]]. One of the finest Byzantine works produced in [[Asia]], and one of the earliest Christian manuscripts with large miniatures, it is distinguished by the miniaturist's predilection for bright colours, movement, drama, and [[expressionism]]. Coming from a period from which little art survives, and which saw great development in Christian [[iconography]], the manuscript has a significant place in art history, and is very often referred to.

Recent scholarship has suggested that the manuscript completed in 586 was later partly overpainted by restorers and bound together with miniatures from other sources in the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref name="G.Peers"/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Meister des Rabula-Evangeliums 002.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest crucifixion in an [[illuminated manuscript]], from the Rabbula Gospels.]]
The Gospel was completed in 586 at Monastery of St. John of Zagba (Syriac: {{lang|syr|ܒܝܬ ܙܓܒܐ}}, ''{{transl|syr|Bēṯ Zaḡbā}}''), which, although traditionally thought to have been in Northern Mesopotamia, is now thought to have been in the hinterland between [[Antioch]] and [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]] in modern [[Syria]]. It was signed by its scribe, Rabbula ({{lang|syr|ܪܒܘܠܐ}}, ''{{transl|syr|Rabbulā}}'') about whom nothing else is known. In their current condition the folios are 34&amp;nbsp;cm (13.4&amp;nbsp;in) by 27&amp;nbsp;cm (10.6&amp;nbsp;in). Their original size is unknown because they were trimmed during previous rebindings. The text is written in black or dark brown ink in two columns of a variable number of lines. There are footnotes written in red ink at the bottom of many of the columns. The text is the [[Peshitta]] version of the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of the Gospels.

The manuscript is illuminated, with the text framed in elaborate floral and architectural motifs. The Gospel canons are set in [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s ornamented with flowers and birds. The miniaturist obviously drew some of his inspiration from [[Hellenistic]] art (draped figures), but relied mainly on the ornamental traditions of [[Persia]]. The miniatures of the Rabbula Gospels, notably those representing the [[Crucifixion]], the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] and [[Pentecost]], are real pictures with a decorative frame formed of [[zigzag]]s, [[curve]]s, [[rainbow]]s and so forth. The scene of the Crucifixion is the earliest to survive in an illuminated manuscript, and shows the Eastern form of the image at the time.  There is a miniature of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]s choosing a new twelfth member (after the loss of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]); this is not an event found in the [[Canonical Gospels]] (though it is mentioned in Chapter 1 of [[Acts]]) and is almost never seen in later art.  The artist was trained in the classical illusionist tradition, and is a competent and practiced hand rather than an outstanding talent; but surviving images from this period are so rare that his are extremely valuable for showing the style and [[iconography]] of his age.

The French Orientalist Edgard Blochet (1870–1937) argued that some of the folios of the manuscript, including the pictorial series, were an interpolation no earlier than the 10th or 11th century. Since the original [[Photo caption|caption]] accompanying the miniatures is of the same paleographic character as the main text of the manuscript, this theory was rejected by Giuseppe Furlani and by Carlo Cecchelli in the commentary of the facsimile edition of the miniatures published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sor.cua.edu/Bible/RabbulaMs.html Miniatures from the Rabbula Gospels ms.]&lt;/ref&gt;  But doubts as to the original unity of the contents continued.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David H. "The Date and Arrangement of the Illustrations in the Rabbula Gospels." Dumbarton Oaks Papers 27 (1973): 197-208. Web., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291340 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, scholars have proposed that the text of 586 was only bound up together with the miniatures in the 15th century, and that the miniatures themselves were taken from at least one other original manuscript, and come from two different campaigns of work.&lt;ref name="G.Peers"&gt;Peers, Glenn, [https://www.academia.edu/285889/Review_of_Il_Tetravangelo_di_Rabbula._Firenze_Biblioteca_Medicea_Laurenziana_Plut._1.56._L_illustrazione_del_Nuovo_Testamento_nella_Siria_del_VI_secolo_ed._M._Bernab%C3%B2_Rome_2008 Review of Bernabò] (see Further reading)&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the manuscript after it was written is vague until the 11th century when it was at [[(Maifuc -Jbeil/Byblos Lebanon)]].  In the late 13th or early 14th century it came to [[Kadisha Valley#The Qannubin Monastery|Quannubin]].  In the late 15th or early 16th century, the manuscript was taken by the [[Maronite]] Patriarch to the [[Laurentian Library]] in [[Florence]], where it is today.

The Manuscript has served during Medieval Age as register of Maronites Patriarches (Elias Kattar) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy Spirit University of Kaslik {{!}} لبنان الوسيط  عهد السلاطين المماليك|url=http://www.usek.edu.lb/en/publications/phoenix/loubnan-waseet|website=www.usek.edu.lb|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;,

[[File:Dutch, 17th century, Black boy with slave collar, Private Collection.jpg|thumb|upright|Black boy with [[slavery|slave collar]], Dutch 17th-century painting.]]

'''Representations of slavery in European art''' date back to ancient times. They show slaves of varied ethnicity, white as well as black.

In Europe, slavery became increasingly associated with blackness from the 17th century onwards. However, slaves before this period were predominantly white. The ''black'' in European art is not the same topic as the ''slave'' in European art: slaves were not always black and blacks not always slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Also note the ambiguity of the term "Turkish slave": a Turkish slave may be a Turk or someone enslaved by a Turk. See [[Turkish Slave]] for yet another layer of confusion about a picture by [[Parmigianino]].&lt;/ref&gt; The article also concentrates on European art rather than Western art in general.

== Slaves in art ==
[[File:Retrato de Juan Pareja, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]'', by Velázquez]]
[[File:Alexandre Dumas (1762-1806).JPG|thumbnail|upright|Thomas Alexandre Dumas]]

From the Renaissance onwards, a substantial number of bound figures, often naked and crouching, illustrate enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery had for one of its roots the ancient tradition of [[Roman Triumph]], but its contemporaneous relevance was greatly magnified by the prevalence of slavery within European countries. In particular, [[galley slaves]] were often used by artists as models for muscular nude bodies.

Sometimes the name of an individual who was a slave is known. One instance is  [[Juan de Pareja]] (1606–1670) who was a slave of [[Velázquez]] and was trained as a painter by the artist. Velázquez freed Juan de Pareja in 1650 and the document of manumission survives.&lt;ref&gt;See Carmen Fracchia's article in The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem, ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The document which was discovered by [[Jennifer Montagu]] is in the Archivio di Stato in Rome. See ''Burlington Magazine'', volume 125,1983,pages 683-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Juan de Pareja became a successful artist himself.

[[Alexandre Dumas]] of ''The Three Musketeers'' fame, was the son of a slave, [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas|also known as Alexandre]], who rose to be a general in chief in the French army. His portrait hardly suggests his early life as a slave. He was pawned by his father who was a French nobleman but was lucky enough to be retrieved by the father and brought up in France.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Reiss, ''The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo'' (New York: Crown Publishers, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frans Post]] (1612—1680) and [[Albert Eckhout]] (c.1610–1665) were two early Dutch painters to depict slavery. Post painted pictures of slaves working in  idyllic rural landscapes which do little to reflect the harsh realities of their life.&lt;ref&gt;See Ernest van den Boogaart article in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhout's work is a visual record of the ethnic mix in Dutch Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean Michel Massing in Studies in ''Imagery II: the World Discovered''. London 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Rebecca Parker Brienen, ''Albert Eckhout'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconographic aspects of slavery==


The trade in black Africans was widespread in Europe long before the [[Triangular Trade]] involving Europe, Africa and the Americas. Numerous portraits of high-class Europeans show them in the company of black figures, often children, whose status may be advertised by the silver [[slavery|slave collar]] being worn. A silver collar is usually worn in conjunction with luxurious clothes and other finery, which allowed the artist to show off his repertoire and the owner of the slave to show off his or her wealth. In fact, in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was the fashion among some wealthy Europeans to have their black household slaves or servants wear silver collars; these were often inscribed with the name of the owner or employer. The slave collar is seen in contemporary paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophies to Abolitionist Emblem| editor1= McGrath, Elizabeth  | editor2= Massing, Jean Michel |location= London |publisher=The Warburg Institute|date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chains, fetters, manacles, slave collars are the familiar iconographic markers of slavery with the broken chain being particularly useful for ''dis''-enslavement.{{cn|date=May 2014}} 

Slaves were chattel and so it is no surprise to see that they were on occasion branded like cattle in life and in art. Another sign of slavery, less obvious and much less gruesome, was the cropped pony tail or topknot which marked an enslaved Turk in the galleys.&lt;ref&gt;See articles by Elizabeth McGrath and Rick Scorza in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Often slaves were  prisoners captured in war and  there is an iconographical overlap between the two.  Michelangelo's [[Dying Slave]] was not given this title by him. He instead talked of such figures as prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Echinger-Maurach, ''Studien zu Michelangelos Juliusgrabmal'', 2 vols, Hildesheim,  1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The slave status of Caryatids is similarly open to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius ''De Architectura'' I.1.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not always clear from a picture that a slave or a servant or a free person has been represented. Thus, it is unknown if the portrait of Juan de Pareja were painted by Velázquez while the former was still a slave. In any case, the portrait is not an image of enslavement, even if Juan de Pareja were a slave at the time of painting.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

== Abolitionism ==

[[File:Wedgwood - Anti-Slavery Medallion - Walters 482597.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Anti-Slavery Medallion by Josiah Wedgwood]]

With [[Abolitionism]], the imagery of enslavement was turned to a social and political purpose. An instance of this is the medallion devised for the movement by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] which shows a  pleading grateful black slave. People wore the medallion as a token of their commitment to abolitionism.

An example of an anti-Abolitionist image is that by [[George Cruikshank]], ''New Union Club''. It satirises what supposedly took place at a celebrated dinner organised by Abolitionists.

== Films ==
{{main|List of films featuring eclipses}}
There is a body of films featuring [[solar eclipse]]s. Compared to other astronomical events featured in films, such as [[full moon]]s and [[asteroid]] strikes, solar eclipses are less commonly seen. When they have featured in films, they often drive the plot and have a portentous presence.&lt;ref name="hickman"&gt;{{cite news | last=Hickman | first=Matt | url=https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/blogs/movies-solar-eclipses-starring-role | title=9 movies starring solar eclipses | work=MNN | publisher=[[Mother Nature Network]] | date=August 8, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]]'s Glen Weldon said that films use eclipses "to signal to audiences that the normal rules have temporarily lifted, and things are about to get weird." The first film to feature a solar eclipse was the 1907 silent film ''[[The Eclipse, or the Courtship of the Sun and Moon]]'', which featured a solar eclipse as a fantastical consummation between the sun and the moon.&lt;ref name="weldon"&gt;{{cite news | last=Weldon | first=Glen | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/08/17/543962064/in-movies-a-solar-eclipse-means-change-is-coming | title=In Movies, A Solar Eclipse Means Change Is Coming | work=npr.org | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=August 17, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eclipses have been seen as bad omens throughout history and filmmakers leverage that belief "as visual cues or key plot points", according to ''[[The Oregonian]]''{{'}}s Amy Wang.&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;{{cite news | last=Wang | first=Amy | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/eclipse/2017/08/15_movies_where_eclipses_play.html | title=15 movies that include eclipses (not always accurately) | work=[[The Oregonian]] | date=August 6, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most accurate depiction of a solar eclipse in film is seen in the 1961 religious epic film ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'', which included film of an actual solar eclipse during a crucifixion scene.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite news | last=White | first=Amy | url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/18/16158544/solar-eclipses-science-fiction | title=Solar eclipses have been a science fiction theme for thousands of years | work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] | date=August 18, 2017 | accessdate=September 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984 eclipse and ''Witness'' ===
While director [[Peter Weir]] was filming ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985) in the [[Amish]] region of Pennsylvania, a solar eclipse occurred on [[Solar eclipse of May 30, 1984|May 30, 1984]]. Weir filmed several of his actors in costume, responding to the eclipse, with the vague intention of revising the film's plot to include a solar eclipse.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The eclipse footage was not included in the final edit.

== Television ==
* An episode of the 1980s science fiction comedy/drama ''[[The Edison Twins]]'', where the twin siblings foil a bank robbery attempt at a major city bank while employees are focusing on the solar eclipse.
* ''[[Sailor Moon]]''. In season four, two eclipses grant power to the villainous Dead Moon (Circus).
* ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' features eclipses prominently within the continuity and symbolism of the show. The title card and logo, for example, both feature an eclipse. An eclipse occurs in the pilot episode, "[[Genesis (Heroes)|Genesis]]", described as a "global event" and commonly understood to be the catalyst that activates the characters' abilities. Another eclipse appears in the first episode of season two, during which Hiro Nakamura teleports to 1671 feudal Japan. The two-part season three episode, "[[The Eclipse (Heroes)|The Eclipse]]", deals with the consequences of a third eclipse which removes all the characters' abilities as well as the unknown connection between eclipses and evolved humans.
* The ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'' episode, "Outcast Ashley", partly revolves around Gretchen's attempts to view the solar eclipse occurring that afternoon, and with whom she views it.
* In one of his cartoons, [[Bugs Bunny]] accidentally travels through time to the [[Middle Ages]].  While there, he tricks everyone into believing that he has put out the sun with a spell. This was a parody of and homage to [[Mark Twain]]'s novel, ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''.
* In an episode of ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', the titular character accidentally travels to the Middle Ages and is about to be executed as a [[warlock]] when he remembers that his execution is timed exactly with an eclipse. He threatens everyone that he will black out the sun unless released and begins to speak [[gibberish]], pretending to put a spell on the sun. However, he has misread the date of the solar eclipse by one day, and stands on the gallows for 24 hours, continuing the gibberish until the eclipse happens.

'''Stitch 'n Bitch''' is a name that has been used to refer to social knitting groups since at least World War II.&lt;ref name="idle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Macdonald, Anne L. |title=No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=[New York |year=1988 |pages=302 |isbn=0-345-33906-1 |url=http://www.cogknition.org/stitchnbitchdb/reference.php?id=73_0_4_0_M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the slang term “Stitch ‘n Bitch” was used, groups of women in the 1940s would join to knit and talk in organized Stitch and Bitch clubs.  The term was further used in the 1980s as part of the book ''Social History of American Knitting'' by Anne Macdonald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brightman|first=Emilee|title=Crafty Ladies: Local knitting group not what you would expect|url=http://www.lakewoodobserver.com/read/2009/01/27/crafty-ladies-local-knitting-group-not|publisher=The Lakewood Observer|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is partly due to the book's success that the modern day Stitch n' Bitch knitting groups have emerged in cities around the world. The groups, mainly women, meet to knit, stitch and talk. Typically, attendees knit, though others crochet (they are called 'Happy Hookers'), and still others engage in cross-stitching, embroidery, and other needlecraft.  Nowadays, the groups have been analyzed by scholars as expressions of resistance to major political, social and technological change in Western societies. However, political discussion is not unusual at these events, and at least some participants are proponents of progressive, liberal, and/or leftist social and political change. Furthermore, the term Stitch ‘n' Bitch is now used by women from across the globe to connect with others in the virtual space seeing as the term has re-emerged in a world where the public sphere is the cyberspace.

With over 1460 registered Stitch ‘n Bitch groups in 289 cities worldwide, the social knitting movement has demarked itself as a popular social gathering for avid knitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stitch 'n Bitch|title=Stitch 'n Bitch Find a knitting group or start your own|url=http://stitchnbitch.org/|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitting groups==
''Stitch 'n Bitch'' is a name used by knitting groups that meet on a weekly or monthly basis at locations throughout the world.  This use of the term originates as early as the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="idle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Elsworth | first = Catherine | title =  It's getting bitchy in knitting circles | work = Telegraph.co.uk | date = 2006-11-02 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/02/11/wknit11.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/02/11/ixworld.html | accessdate = 2007-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Debbie Stoller started a Stitch 'n Bitch group in NYC's East Village, which was open to anyone who wanted to come to knit along or learn to knit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In 2000, she wrote about her groups in ''BUST'' magazine, of which she is the editor-in-chief. Brenda Janish read the article and started the Chicago Stitch 'n Bitch group.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} That article inspired Vickie Howell to start the Los Angeles Stitch 'n Bitch group and later the Austin Stitch 'n Bitch group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/20/news/wk-alt20 "Sisters of the Stitch", L.A. Times, Nov. 20, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Stoller's original group, today's Stitch 'n Bitch clubs are generally casual groups of knitters who meet in public spaces such as bars or cafes for socializing and sharing knitting advice.  These groups are free or small fee required memberships and open to the public, and are listed in a directory of worldwide knitting groups that was started by Janish and today is maintained by Stoller:  Official Home of Stitch 'n Bitch. As of 2010, the site lists over 700 such groups.

==Book series and legal actions==
[[File:Stitch 'n Bitch Book Cover.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The cover of the first book in the series of knitting books by Debbie Stoller, ''Stitch 'n Bitch: The Knitter's Handbook''.]]

A book series by Debbie Stoller, includes ''Stitch 'n Bitch" : The Knitter's Handbook'', ''Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker,'' and other titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoller|first=Debbie|title=Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker|year=2006|publisher=Workman Publishing Company, Inc.|location=New York|pages=1–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 to 2008, Stitch 'n Bitch was the focus of a [[trademark]] dispute. In June 2005, the company [[Sew Fast Sew Easy]] filed a trademark application for ''Stitch &amp; Bitch'' to designate a line of knitting and sewing supplies. As of 2007 this application was suspended.&lt;ref name="S&amp;B"&gt;{{cite journal |author=United States Patent and Trademark Office | title = Serial Number: 78641350 | publisher = Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Inquiry System | date = November 28, 2007 | url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78641350&amp;action=Request+Status |accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2005, due to letters claiming [[trademark infringement]] from Sew Fast/Sew Easy's lawyers, knitting groups that had accounts with [[CafePress]] were forced to remove all items featuring the phrase "Stitch 'n Bitch". Local groups that communicated with each other through [[Yahoo! Groups]] were similarly forced to remove "Stitch 'n Bitch" from the name and description of their group.&lt;ref name="vogue"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Petrovsky | first = Lesley | title = Tempest in a Tea Cozy | journal = Vogue Knitting | date = Fall 2006 | url = http://freetostitchfreetobitch.org/pdfs/vogueknit.gif | accessdate = 2007-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some groups were deleted, but most groups were able to change their name on Yahoo! to SNB.&lt;ref name="knit"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Krementz | first = Cheryl | title = Stitch &amp; Bitch Slap | journal = Knit.1 | date = Summer 2006 | url = http://freetostitchfreetobitch.org/pdfs/knit1.gif | accessdate = 2007-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Sew Fast Sew Easy and Debbie Stoller reached a settlement in which Debbie Stoller retained the use of the mark in knitting while Sew Fast Sew Easy retains the use for sewing. Since then all four of Stoller's trademarks have now been registered. The Sew Fast Sew Easy store closed in 2012.

== Social implications ==
In recent years, the Stitch ‘n Bitch movement has been considered as a means of reclaiming women’s domestic work in feminist circles. Not only have groups officially been formed through website use, but groups of women on university campuses have also followed the trends in order to resist the taboo representation of the traditional woman.

Dr. Beth Ann Pentney, writing in Thirdspace journal, credited Stoller's publications with the rise of feminist knitting.  Stoller introduced this approach to feminism to merge political involvement with a women’s community-building activity set in a Do-It-Yourself culture.&lt;ref name="Pentney 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pentney|first=Beth Ann|title=Feminism, Activism, and Knitting: Are the Fibre Arts a Viable Mode for Feminist Political Action?|journal=Third Space: a journal of feminist theory and culture|date=Summer 2008|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://www.thirdspace.ca/journal/article/viewArticle/pentney/210|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to Stoller, much scrutiny on the effectiveness of the reclamation of domestic arts as a political feminist act has been done. Some say that the reason of the reintroduction of knitting in modern social gatherings is mainly due to the increase in the search for individualism and the anti-consumerism attitude of our generation.&lt;ref name="Pentney 2008"/&gt; With this said, it is important to denote the implication of technologies in the emergence of a “fabriculture” based on the reclamation of domestic arts and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratich|first=Jack|author2=Brush, Heidi M. |title=Fabricating activism: Craft-Work, Popular Culture, Gender|journal=Utopian Studies|date=27 November 2011|volume=22|issue=2|pages=233–260|url=https://www.academia.edu/1117424/Fabricating_Activism_Craft-Work_Popular_Culture_Gender|accessdate=19 March 2013|doi=10.5325/utopianstudies.22.2.0233}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the internet accessibility of online information and tips and tricks for knitters and crocheters, the traditionally personal practice of knitting can now be shared easily among strangers, and is open to public discussion and new ideas. These webs of knitters worldwide find affinities via a very modern technology opposing the traditional DIY nature of knitting.

:''For the album by musician Chris Mars, see [[Tenterhooks (album)]]''.

'''Tenterhooks''' are [[hook]]s in a device called a ''tenter''. Tenters were originally large wooden frames which were used as far back as the 14th century in the process of making [[wool]]len [[cloth]]. After a piece of cloth was woven, it still contained [[lanolin|oil]] and dirt from the fleece. A [[craft]]sman called a [[fulling|fuller]] (also called a tucker or wa[u]lker) cleaned the woollen cloth in a [[fulling mill]], and then had to dry it carefully or the woollen fabric would shrink. To prevent this shrinkage, the fuller would place the wet cloth on a tenter, and leave it to dry outdoors. The lengths of wet cloth were stretched on the tenter ({{ety|la|tendere|to stretch}}) using tenterhooks (hooked nails driven through the wood) all around the perimeter of the frame to which the cloth's edges ([[selvedge]]s) were fixed, so that as it dried the cloth would retain its shape and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trowbridgemuseum.co.uk/fulling-and-tentering/|title=Fulling and Tentering «  Trowbridge Museum|website=trowbridgemuseum.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some manufacturing areas, entire tenter-fields, larger open spaces full of tenters, were once common.

By the mid-18th century, the phrase "'''on tenterhooks'''" came to mean being in a state of tension, uneasiness, [[anxiety]], or suspense, i.e. figuratively stretched like the cloth on the tenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-ont1.htm|title=World Wide Words: On tenterhooks|website=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John_Ford_(dramatist)|John Ford's]] 1633 play ''Broken Heart'' contains the lines: "There is no faith in woman. Passion, O, be contain'd! My very heart-strings Are on the tenters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/editions/broken.htm#5.4|title=John Ford. The Broken Heart.|website=www.luminarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1690 the periodical ''The General History of Europe'' used the term in the modern sense: "The mischief is, they will not meet again these two years, so that all business must hang upon the tenterhooks till then."&lt;ref&gt;The general history of Europe, London [England] 1688–1693, republished in Early English newspapers, Microfilm, Woodbridge, Conn. Primary Source Microfilm, an imprint of Gale Group, 2000; reel 1,364.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1826, English periodical ''[[Monthly Magazine|Monthly magazine or British register of literature, sciences, and the belles-lettres]]'' contained the line "I hope (though the wish is a cruel one) that my fair readers, if any such readers have deigned to follow me thus far, are on tenterhooks to know to whom the prize was adjudged."&lt;ref&gt;[http://grammarist.com/usage/on-tenterhooks/ Grammarist], retrieved 14 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of 19th-century British periodicals]]&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his wife the same year, American educator [[Francis Wayland]] (waiting for his promised appointment as President of [[Brown University]]) wrote "I was never so much on tenter hooks before."&lt;ref&gt;Roelker, William G. [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44807076.pdf "Francis Wayland A neglected pioneer of higher education"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', '''53''' (1):27–78. 1944. retrieved 14 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''tenter'' is still used today to refer to production line machinery employed to stretch [[polyester]] films and similar fabrics. The spelling ''stenter'' is also found.

'''''The Battle of Alexander at Issus''''' (German: '''''Alexanderschlacht''''') is a 1529 [[oil painting]] by the German artist [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1480–1538), a pioneer of [[landscape art]] and a founding member of the [[Danube school]]. It portrays the 333&amp;nbsp;BC [[Battle of Issus]], in which [[Alexander the Great]] secured a decisive victory over [[Darius III of Persia]] and gained crucial leverage in his campaign against the [[Persian Empire]]. The painting is widely regarded as Altdorfer's masterpiece, and is one of the most famous examples of the type of Renaissance landscape painting known as the [[world landscape]], which here reaches an unprecedented grandeur.

[[William IV, Duke of Bavaria|Duke William IV of Bavaria]] commissioned ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' in 1528 as part of a set of historical pieces that was to hang in his [[Munich]] residence. Modern commentators suggest that the painting, through its abundant use of [[anachronism]], was intended to liken Alexander's heroic victory at Issus to the contemporary European conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In particular, the defeat of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] at the [[Siege of Vienna]] may have been an inspiration for Altdorfer. A religious undercurrent is detectable, especially in the extraordinary sky; this was probably inspired by the prophecies of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and contemporary concern within the Church about an impending [[apocalypse]]. ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus '' and four others that were part of William's initial set are in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] art museum in Munich.

[[Alexander III of Macedon]] (356–323&amp;nbsp;BC), best known as Alexander the Great, was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] king of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] who reigned from 336&amp;nbsp;BC until his death. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest military tacticians and strategists in history,&lt;ref&gt;Corvisier; Childs, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and is presumed undefeated in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Heckel; Yardley, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polelle, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned for his military leadership and charisma, he always led his armies personally and took to the front ranks of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neilburg, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; By conquering the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and unifying [[Greece]], Egypt and [[Babylon]], he forged the largest empire of the [[ancient world]]&lt;ref&gt;Sacks; Murray; Bunson, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and effected the spread of [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] throughout Europe and Northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 211–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander embarked on his expedition to conquer the Persian Empire in the spring of 334&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name="Smith970"&gt;Smith, p. 970&lt;/ref&gt; having pacified the warring Greek states and consolidated his military might.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, pp. 28–35&lt;/ref&gt; During the first months of the Macedonian passage into Persian Asia Minor, [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] – king of Persia – largely ignored the presence of Alexander's 40,000&amp;nbsp;men. The [[Battle of the Granicus]], fought in May,&lt;ref name="Smith970" /&gt; was Persia's first major effort to confront the invaders, but resulted in an easy victory for Alexander. Over the next year, Alexander took most of western and coastal Asia Minor by forcing the capitulation of the [[satrap]]ies in his path.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; He continued inland, travelling northeast through [[Phrygia]] before turning southeast toward [[Cilicia]]. After passing the [[Cilician Gates]] in October, Alexander was delayed by fever in [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]].&lt;ref&gt;Warry, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Darius meanwhile mustered an army of up to 100,000 (some ancient sources posit exaggerated figures of over 600,000)&lt;ref name="Romm48"&gt;Romm; Mensch, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and personally directed it over the eastern slopes of the [[Amanus Mountains]]. In early November, as Alexander proceeded about the [[Gulf of Issus]] from [[Mallus (city)|Mallus]] via [[Issus (town)|Issus]], the two armies inadvertently passed one another on opposite sides of the mountains.&lt;ref name="Buckley503" /&gt; This was decidedly to Darius' advantage: now at the rear of Alexander, he was able to prevent retreat and block the supply lines Alexander had established at Issus.&lt;ref&gt;Romm; Mensch, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until Alexander had encamped at [[Myriandrus]], a seaport on the southeastern shores of the Gulf of İskenderun, that he learned of the Persian position. He immediately retraced his route to the [[Pinarus River]], just south of Issus, to find Darius' force assembled along the northern bank.&lt;ref name="Buckley503"&gt;Buckley, p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle of Issus ensued.

Alexander devotes himself to a right approach with his Companion cavalry, having unseated the Persian foothill defence.]]
Darius' initial response was defensive: he immediately stockaded the river bank with stakes to impede the enemy's crossing. A core vanguard of traitorous Greek mercenaries and Persian royal guard was established; as was usual for Persian kings, Darius positioned himself in the centre of this vanguard, in order that he might effectively dispatch commands to any part of his large army.&lt;ref&gt;Warry, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; A group of Persian light infantry was soon sent to the foothills, as it was suspected that Alexander would make an approach from the right, away from the coast. A mass of cavalry commanded by [[Nabarsanes]] occupied the Persian right.&lt;ref&gt;Savill, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander made a cautious and slow advance, intending to base his strategy on the structure of the Persian force. He led a flank of his [[Companion cavalry]] on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit.&lt;ref name="Savill34"&gt;Savill, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of the importance of the foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.&lt;ref name="Savill34" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warry34"&gt;Warry, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

When within missile range of the enemy, Alexander gave the order to charge.&lt;ref name="Savill34" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warry35"&gt;Warry, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He spearheaded the assault of his heavily armed Companion cavalry, who quickly made deep cuts into the Persian left flank. The Macedonian left wing, commanded by [[Parmenion]],&lt;ref name="Warry34" /&gt; was meanwhile driven back by Nabarsanes' large cavalry. The Macedonians' central [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] crossed the river and clashed with the renegade Greek mercenaries who fronted Darius' vanguard. As the Companion cavalry pushed further into the Persian left, the danger arose that Darius would exploit the gap that had formed between Alexander and the rest of his army. When he was satisfied that the left wing was crippled and no longer a threat, Alexander remedied the situation by moving the Companions to assault the Persian centre in the flank. Unable to handle the added pressure, the Persian vanguard was forced to withdraw from the river bank, allowing the Macedonian phalanx to continue their advance and lifting the pressure on Parmenion's left wing.&lt;ref name="Warry35" /&gt;

Upon realising that the onslaught of Alexander's Companion cavalry was unstoppable, Darius and his army fled. Many were killed in the rush, trampled by those who fled with them or collapsed with their horses&lt;!--what does this mean?--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Warry, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Some escaped to regions as remote as Egypt, and others reunited with Darius in the north.&lt;ref name="Savill35"&gt;Savill, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of darkness ended the chase after approximately {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}; Alexander then recalled his army and set about burying the dead. Darius' family were left behind in the Persian camp; it is reported that Alexander treated them well and reassured them of Darius' safety.&lt;ref name="Savill35" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warry, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Darius' royal chariot was found discarded in a ditch, as were his bow and shield.&lt;ref name="Savill35" /&gt;

Ancient sources present disparate casualty figures for the Battle of Issus. [[Plutarch]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]] approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, in contrast with the 450 Macedonian deaths reported by [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]].&lt;ref name="De Sélincourt121"&gt;De Sélincourt, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, it is probable that more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle;&lt;ref&gt;Warry, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy I]], who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.&lt;ref name="De Sélincourt121" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romm; Mensch, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macedonian conquest of Persia continued until 330&amp;nbsp;BC, when Darius was killed and Alexander took his title as king.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks; Murray; Bunson, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander died in 323&amp;nbsp;BC, having recently returned from campaigning in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The [[Alexander the Great#Death|cause of death]] remains a subject of debate.&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander the Great and West Nile Virus Encephalitis (Letters)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no7/04-0039_104_396_320.htm |title=Alexander the Great and West Nile Virus Encephalitis (Replies) |author= |authorlink= |vauthors= |year= 2004|work= |publisher= CDC|pages= |language= |quote= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Previous work ===
[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 045.jpg|thumb|alt= A painting of St George slaying the dragon set in a dense forest in which the figures are dwarfed by the trees. A distant landscape is seen through a break.|''Saint George and the Dragon'' (1510)]]
[[Albrecht Altdorfer]] is regarded as one of the founders of Western [[landscape art]].&lt;ref&gt;Keane, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; He was a painter, [[etcher]], architect, and [[engraver]], and the leader of the [[Danube school]] of German art. As evidenced by such paintings as ''[[Saint George and the Dragon]]'' (1510) and ''[[commons:File:Albrecht Altdorfer 005.jpg|Allegory]]'' (1531), much of Altdorfer's work is characterised by an attachment to sprawling landscapes that dwarf the figures within them;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' epitomises this facet of his style. With reference to ''St George and the Dragon'' in particular, art historian Mark W. Roskill comments that "The accessory material of landscape [in Altdorfer's work] is played with and ornamentally elaborated so that it reverberates with the sense of a sequestered and inhospitable environment".&lt;ref&gt;Roskill, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by his travels around the [[Austrian Alps]] and the [[Danube River]],&lt;ref&gt;Earls, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Altdorfer painted a number of landscapes that contain no figures at all, including ''[[commons:File:Albrecht Altdorfer 019.jpg|Landscape with a Footbridge]]'' (c. 1516) and ''[[commons:File:Altdorfer, Albrecht - Donaulandschaft mit Schloß Wörth.jpg|Danube Landscape near Regensburg]]'' (c. 1522–25). These were the first "pure" landscapes since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Altdorfer's landscapes were made with a vertical format, in contrast with the modern conception of the genre. The horizontal landscape was an innovation of Altdorfer's [[Flemish]] contemporary [[Joachim Patinir]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 039.jpg|thumb|left|A miniature from ''Triumphal Procession'' (1512–16)|alt=A miniature painting showing four brightly clothed men carrying a large banner which is painted with a complex battle scene]]
Altdorfer also produced a great deal of religious artwork, in reflection of his devout Catholicism. His most frequent subjects were the [[Virgin Mary]] and the life and [[crucifixion of Christ]]. As in ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'', these paintings often feature settings of great majesty and use the sky to convey symbolic meaning. This meaning is not uniform throughout Altdorfer's corpus – for example, the visage of the setting sun connotes loss and tragedy in ''[[:commons:File:Albrecht Altdorfer 027.jpg|Agony in the Garden]]'', but serves as "the emblem of power and glory" in ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus''.&lt;ref name="Silver204.5"&gt;Silver, pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Silver of ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'' explains that ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' is both similar to and in direct contrast with Altdorfer's previous work: "Instead of the peaceful landscape of retreat for Christian events or holy figures, this panel offers just the opposite: a battleground for one of ancient history's principal epoch-making encounters&amp;nbsp;... Yet despite its global or cosmic dimensions, the ''Battle of Issus'' still ''looks like'' Altdorfer's earlier, contemplative liminal landscapes of retreat, complete with craggy peaks, bodies of water, and distant castles."&lt;ref&gt;Silver, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Battle of Alexander'' is atypical of Altdorfer in its size and in that it depicts war, his  ''Triumphal Procession'' – a 1512–16 [[illuminated manuscript]] commissioned by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire]] – has been described as a conceptual antecedent.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, pp. 23, 199–202&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Procession'' was produced in parallel with the ''Triumph of Maximilian'', a series of 137 [[woodcut]]s collaboratively executed by Altdorfer, [[Hans Springinklee]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Leonhard Beck]] and [[Hans Leonhard Schäufelein|Hans Schäufelein]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuneo, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences and commission ===
[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 036.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A panel from an altarpiece by Grünewald.

To the left an orchestra of cherubim plays in a Gothic loggia.|Matthias Grünewald's ''The Virgin and Child with the Heavenly Host'' (c. 1515)]]
Altdorfer's most significant contemporary influence was [[Matthias Grünewald]] (c. 1470–1528). Art historian [[Horst W. Janson]] remarked that their paintings "show the same 'unruly' imagination".&lt;ref name="Janson145"&gt;Janson, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' – particularly the sky – have been compared to Grünewald's ''Heavenly Host above the Virgin and Child'', which forms part of his masterpiece, the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]. [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1472–1553), also associated with the Danube school, was another important influence for Altdorfer. According to Roskill, works by Cranach from about 1500 "give a prominent role to landscape settings, using them as mood-enhancing backgrounds for portraits, and for images of hermits and visionary saints", and seem to play a "preparatory role" for the onset of pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Roskill, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; Altdorfer owed much of his style, particularly in his religious artwork, to [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528);&lt;ref&gt;Wood, pp. 70–73&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Silver writes that Altdorfer's "use of convincing German landscapes in combination with celestial phenomena for his religious narrative" is "firmly tied" to a tradition "modeled by Albrecht Dürer."&lt;ref&gt;Silver, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William IV, Duke of Bavaria]] commissioned ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' in 1528.&lt;ref name="Davis91"&gt;Davis, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Altdorfer was approximately 50 at the time, and was living in the [[Free Imperial City]] of [[Regensburg]].&lt;ref name="Hagen128"&gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of over a decade of involvement with the Regensburg city council, Altdorfer was offered the position of [[Burgomaster]] on 18 September 1528. He declined; the council annals reported his reasoning as such: "He much desires to execute a special work in Bavaria for my Serene Highness and gracious Lord, Duke [William]."&lt;ref name="Hagen128" /&gt; William probably wanted the painting for his newly built summer ''Lusthaus'' ("pleasure house") in the grounds of [[Munich Residence|his palace]] in [[Munich]], approximately {{convert|60|mi}} south of Regensburg.&lt;ref name="Davis91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagen128" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alte Pinakotek, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  There, it was to hang alongside seven other paintings with a similar format and subject matter, including [[Ludwig Refinger]]'s ''The Matyrdom of Marcus Curtius'', [[Melchior Feselen]]'s ''[[Battle of Alesia|The Siege of Alesia]] by Caesar'', and the painting of ''[[Battle of Cannae]]'' by [[Hans Burgkmair]] (1473–1531).&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagen131" &gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Another eight, each portraying a famous woman from history, were later added to the set, probably at the behest of the Duke's wife, Jacobaea of Baden.&lt;ref name="Hagen131" /&gt; Altdorfer's ''Susanna and the Elders'' (1526) was among these.&lt;ref&gt;Clanton, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earlier depictions ===
[[File:Alexandermosaic.jpg|thumb|alt=A large mosaic depicting an array of soldiers on horseback doing battle. Parts of it have been damaged or lost to time.|The Alexander Mosaic, as seen in the Naples National Archaeological Museum]]
Earlier depictions of the Battle of Issus are few. ''Battle of Issus'', a [[fresco]] by [[Philoxenus of Eretria]], is probably the first such. It was painted sometime around 310&amp;nbsp;BC for [[Cassander]] (c. 350–297&amp;nbsp;BC), who was one of Alexander the Great's successors.&lt;ref name="Kleiner142"&gt;Kleiner 2009, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander and Darius – each within a lance's length of the other – are pictured among a wild fray of mounted and downed soldiers. While Alexander maintains an aura of unshaken confidence, fear is etched in Darius' face, and his charioteer has already turned to rein his horses and escape.&lt;ref name="Kleiner142" /&gt; Roman author and natural philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]] claimed that Philoxenus' portrayal of the battle was "inferior to none".&lt;ref name="Kleiner142" /&gt; Some modern critics posit that ''Battle of Issus'' might not have been the work of Philoxenus, but of Helena of Egypt. One of the few named women painters who might have worked in Ancient Greece,&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad; Oppenheimer; Addiss, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; she was reputed to have produced a painting of the battle of Issus which hung in the [[Temple of Peace, Rome|Temple of Peace]] during the time of [[Vespasian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy Chennus|Ptolemy Hephaestion]] ''New History'' (codex 190) [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|''Bibliotheca'' Photius]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alexander Mosaic]], a [[floor mosaic]] dating from c. 100 BC, is believed to be a "reasonably faithful" copy of ''Battle of Issus'',&lt;ref name="Kleiner142" /&gt; though an alternative view holds it might instead be a copy of a work painted by [[Apelles of Kos]],&lt;ref&gt;Kinzl, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt; who produced several portraits of Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; It measures {{convert|5.82|x|3.13|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and consists of approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;million [[tesserae]] (coloured tiles), each about {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}} square. The mosaicist is unknown. Since the mosaic was not rediscovered until 1831, during excavations of [[Pompeii]]'s [[House of the Faun]],&lt;ref&gt;McKay, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Altdorfer could never have seen it. It was later moved to the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]] in [[Naples|Naples, Italy]], where it currently resides.

=== Description ===
[[File:BattleofIssusDetail1.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of [[Darius III of Persia]] in flight|alt=A figure on a chariot pulled by three horses, with soldiers on either side of the trail]]
''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' is painted on a [[limewood]] [[panel painting|panel]] measuring {{convert|158.4|x|120.3|cm|in|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinakothek.de/alte-pinakothek/sammlung/kuenstler/kuenstler_inc_en.php?inc=bild&amp;which=8303|title=''The Battle of Issus''|publisher=Alte Pinakothek|accessdate=10 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604061317/http://www.pinakothek.de/alte-pinakothek/sammlung/kuenstler/kuenstler_inc_en.php?inc=bild&amp;which=8303|archivedate=4 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portrays the moment of Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made to be the same size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene.&lt;ref name="Hagen133" /&gt; The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleiner510"&gt;Kleiner 2008, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of horse and foot soldiers immersed in a sea of spears and lances populate the foreground. The two armies are distinguished by their dress, anachronistic though it is: whereas Alexander's men clad themselves and their horses in full suits of heavy armour, many of Darius' wear turbans and ride naked mounts.&lt;ref name="Hagen130" /&gt; The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie underfoot. A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force, who flee the battlefield on the far left. The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses, and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry.&lt;ref name="Hagen131"/&gt; The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to the campsite and cityscape by the water, gravitating toward the mountainous rise at the scene's centre.

Beyond is the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the island of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="Hagen132"&gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Here, a transition in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in the lower half of the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The [[Nile River]] meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the [[Nile Delta]].&lt;ref name="Hagen132" /&gt; South of Cyprus is the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which forms a [[land bridge]] between Africa and Southwest Asia. The [[Red Sea]] lies beyond,&lt;ref name="Hagen132" /&gt; eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.
[[File:BattleofIssusDetail2.jpg|thumb|Detail of the sun and the Nile River|alt=A blazing sun above blue-tinged mountains and water]]
A fierce sky caught in the dichotomy between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates more than a third of the painting.&lt;ref name="Hagen133"&gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the [[Tower of Babel]] are cloaked in shadow.

The painting's subject is explained in the tablet suspended from the heavens. The wording, probably supplied by William's court historian [[Johannes Aventinus]],&lt;ref&gt;Wood, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; was originally in German but was later replaced by a Latin inscription. It translates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Alexander the Great defeating the last Darius, after 100,000 infantry and more than 10,000 cavalrymen had been killed amongst the ranks of the Persians. Whilst King Darius was able to flee with no more than 1,000 horsemen, his mother, wife, and children were taken prisoner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
No date is provided for the battle alongside these casualty figures. The lower left-hand corner features Altdorfer's [[monogram]] – an 'A' within an 'A' – and the lower edge of the tablet is inscribed with "&lt;small&gt;ALBRECHT ALTORFER ZU REGENSPVRG FECIT&lt;/small&gt;" ("Albrecht Altdorfer from Regensburg made [this]"). Tiny inscriptions on their chariot and harness identify Darius and Alexander, respectively.&lt;ref name="Janson544" /&gt; Each army bears a banner that reports both its total strength and its future casualties.&lt;ref name="Davis91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagen130"&gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis and interpretation ===
[[File:BattleofIssusDetail9.jpg|thumb|Detail of soldiers from both armies. Reinhart Koselleck comments that the Persians resemble the 16th-century Turks "from their feet to their turbans."]]

Anachronism is a major component of ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus''. By dressing Alexander's men in 16th-century steel armour and Darius' men in Turkish battle dress, Altdorfer draws deliberate parallels between the Macedonian campaign and the contemporary European–Ottoman conflict.&lt;ref name="Hagen128" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleiner510" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janson544"&gt;Janson; Janson, p. 544&lt;/ref&gt; In 1529 – the year of the painting's commissioning – the Ottoman forces under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] [[Siege of Vienna|laid siege]] to the [[Austria]]n city of [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]]&lt;ref name="Janson544" /&gt;, then also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and called 'the golden apple' by the Sultans. Although far inferior in number, the Austrian, German, Czech, and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe. It is probable the painting's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege of Vienna, given its similarities to Alexander's victory at Issus. Some critics go further, suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer's commission.&lt;ref name="Hagen131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleiner510" /&gt;

In his ''Futures Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time'', historian [[Reinhart Koselleck]] discusses Altdorfer's representation of time in a more philosophical light. After differentiating between the superficial anachronism found in the casualty figures on the army banners and the deeper anachronism ingrained in the painting's contemporary context, he posits that the latter type is less a superimposition of one historical event over another and more an acknowledgement of the recursive nature of history. With reference to Koselleck, Kathleen Davis argues: "...&amp;nbsp;for [Altdorfer], 4th-century Persians look like 16th-century Turks not because he does not know the difference, but because the difference does not matter&amp;nbsp;... The ''Alexanderschlacht'', in other words, exemplifies a premodern, ''untemporalized'' sense of time and a lack of historical consciousness&amp;nbsp;... Altdorfer's historical overlays evince an [[eschatology|eschatological]] vision of history, evidence that the 16th century (and by degrees also the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) remained locked in a static, constant temporality that proleptically saturates the future as always a repetition of the same&amp;nbsp;... In such a system there can be no ''event'' as such: anticipation and arrival are together sucked into the black hole of sacred history, which is not temporalized because its time is essentially undifferentiated&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Featured alongside the anachronism in ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' is a genuine lack of historicity. Altdorfer demonstrates minimal hesitance in neglecting the painting's historical integrity for the sake of its heroic style, in spite of the pains he took to research the battle. That the Persian army was up to twice the size of the Macedonian army is not clear, and the relative positioning of the soldiers as reported by ancient sources has been disregarded. According to art critic Rose-Marie Hagen, "The artist was faithful to the historical truth only when it suited him, when historical facts were compatible with the demands of his composition."&lt;ref name="Hagen130"&gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Hagen also notes the historically baseless inclusion of women on the battlefield, attributing it to Altdorfer's "passion for invention" and saying they "look like German courtly ladies, dressed for a hunting party" in their feathered [[toque]]s.&lt;ref name="Hagen130" /&gt;

Altdorfer's primary point of reference in his research was probably [[Hartmann Schedel]]'s ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (''Schedelsche Weltchronik''), an illustrated world history published in [[Nuremberg]] in 1493. Schedel was a physician, humanist, historian and cartographer, and his ''Chronicle'' was one of the first books produced on the [[printing press]]. With a heavy reliance on the Bible, it recounts the [[Six ages of the world|seven ages]] of human history,&lt;ref name="Oman116"&gt;Oman, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]] to the birth of Christ and ending with the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt; Kobialka, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Altdorfer's statistics for the battle of Issus mirror those of Schedel. Furthermore, the errors in Schedel's maps of the Mediterranean and Northern Africa are also present in ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'': the island of Cyprus is noticeably oversized, and both the mountain rise in the painting's centre and the range adjacent to the Nile do not exist.&lt;ref name="Hagen132" /&gt; Since the ''Chronicle'' describes Alexander's victory over the Persians in terms of its proximity to Tarsus and omits mention of Issus, it is likely that the cityscape by the sea is intended to be the former city rather than the latter. Issus in the 16th century was minor and relatively unknown, whereas Tarsus was renowned for its having been a major centre of learning and philosophy in Roman times. Tarsus was also said to be the birthplace of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]] [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], which may explain the presence of the church towers in Altdorfer's portrayal.&lt;ref name="Hagen132" /&gt; Another source may have been the writings of [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], a 1st-century Roman historian who presents inflated figures for the number of killed and taken prisoner and the sizes of the armies.&lt;ref name="Hagen130" /&gt;

The sky bears overt metaphorical significance and is the centrepiece of the painting's symbolism. Alexander, identified by the Egyptians and others as a god of the sun, finds his victory in the sun's rays; and the Persians are routed into the darkness beneath the crescent moon, a symbol of the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner 2009, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; Considered in terms of the painting's contemporary context, the sun's triumph over the moon represents [[Christendom]]'s victory over the [[Islamism]] of the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Silver204.5" /&gt; [[eschatology|Eschatological]] meaning, probably inspired by prophecies in the [[Book of Daniel]], is imbued in the heavenly setting. In particular, [[Daniel 7]] predicts the rise and fall of four kingdoms before the [[Second Coming]]; these were thought to be [[Babylon]], [[Persia]], Greece, and Rome at the time of the painting's creation. Altdorfer saw the Battle of Issus as a principal indicator of the transition of power from Persia to Greece, and thus as an event of cosmic significance.&lt;ref name="Silver204.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagen133" /&gt; The battle also marked a progression toward the [[Eschatology|end of the world]] – an important theological concern in the 16th century, given that the last traces of Rome were diminishing with the [[papacy]]. As a member of the Regensburg council and a practising Catholic, Altdorfer frequently interacted with the Church and was surely aware of this trend of eschatological thought. Schedel, too, had calculated that the final age of the seven he identified was nigh.&lt;ref name="Oman116" /&gt; It may therefore be inferred that the sky's expression of the momentous event at Issus was intended to be of contemporary relevance as well.&lt;ref name="Hagen133" /&gt;

''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' remained part of the royal collection of the Dukes of Bavaria for centuries. By the late 18th century, it was regularly featured in public galleries at the [[Schleissheim Palace]]. The painting was one of 72 taken to Paris in 1800 by the invading armies of [[Napoleon I]]  (1769–1821),&lt;ref name="Alte"&gt;Alte Pinakothek, pp. 24–29&lt;/ref&gt; who was a noted admirer of Alexander the Great.&lt;ref name="Hagen130" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Louvre]] held it until 1804, when Napoleon declared himself Emperor of France and took it for his own use. When the [[Prussian]]s captured the [[Château de Saint-Cloud]] in 1814 as part of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], they supposedly found the painting hanging in Napoleon's bathroom.&lt;ref name="Wood22"&gt;Wood, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' and 26 others taken in the 1800 invasion were subsequently restored to the [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King of Bavaria]] in 1815.&lt;ref name="Alte" /&gt; Five of the paintings in William IV's original set of eight – including ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' – later passed from the royal collection to the [[Alte Pinakothek]] art museum in [[Munich, Germany]], where they remain; the other three are in the [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Stockholm]], having been looted by the Swedish army in the [[Thirty Years War]] of 1618–1648.&lt;ref name="Svanberg"&gt;Svanberg, pp. 70–86&lt;/ref&gt; ''Susannah and the Elders'' is the only other work by Altdorfer in the Alte Pinakothek.

[[File:Horatius Cocles Stopping King Porsenna's Army outside Rome (Ludwig Refinger) - Nationalmuseum - 17244.tif|thumb|left|''[[Horatius Cocles]] Stopping King [[Lars Porsenna|Porsenna]]'s Army outside Rome'', by [[Ludwig Refinger]]. One of the other paintings in the historical cycle that ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' originally belonged to, currently in the [[National Museum of Sweden]]]]Contextually, the painting forms part of the [[Northern Renaissance]], a resurgence of classical humanism and culture in northern Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. The Renaissance induced a new kind of social individualism which Altdorfer expressed through the heroic emphasis on Alexander and Darius, and which is reflected in the specifics of the painting's commission and by the subjects of its companion pieces: "During the Renaissance people no longer saw themselves solely as members of a social group, as the citizens of a town, or as sinners before God in whose eyes all were equal. They had become aware of the unique qualities that distinguished one person from another. Unlike the Middle Ages, the Renaissance celebrated the individual. Altdorfer may have painted row after row of apparently identical warriors, but the spectators themselves would identify with Alexander and Darius, figures who had names, whose significance was indicated by the cord which hung down from the tablet above them."&lt;ref name="Hagen131" /&gt;

Altdorfer was not only a pioneer of landscape, but also a practitioner of early incarnations of the [[Romanticism]] and [[expressionism]] which impacted the arts so greatly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Kenneth Clark]] writes of Altdorfer and contemporaries Grünewald and [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], "They are what we now call 'expressionist' artists, a term which is not as worthless as it sounds, because, in fact, the symbols of expressionism are remarkably consistent, and we find in the work of these early 16th-century landscape painters not only the same spirit but the same shapes and iconographical motives which recur in the work of such recent expressionists as [[van Gogh]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Graham Sutherland]] and [[Walt Disney]]."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; According to art critic Pia F. Cuneo, "Altdorfer's construction of landscape on a cosmic scale" in the ''Battle of Alexander at Issus'', and his "spiritual and aesthetic affinities with [[Romanticism]] and Modern art (in particular, [[German Expressionism]])", "have been especially singled out for praise".&lt;ref name="Cuneo186"&gt;Cuneo, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' is typically considered to be Altdorfer's [[masterpiece]]. Cuneo states that the painting is usually "considered in splendid isolation from its fifteen other companion pieces, based on the assumption that it either metonymically stands in for the entire cycle, or that its perceived aesthetic predominance merits exclusive focus."&lt;ref name="Cuneo186" /&gt; German writer [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]] (1772–1829) was one of many who saw the painting in the Louvre and marvelled, calling it a "small painted [[Iliad]]".&lt;ref name="Wood22" /&gt; Reinhart Koselleck comments that Altdorfer's depiction of the thousands of soldiers was executed with "a mastery previously unknown",&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt; and Kathleen Davis describes the painting as "epochal in every sense".&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

'''''The Journal of Sir Walter Scott''''' is a diary which the novelist and poet [[Walter Scott]] kept between 1825 and 1832.  It records the financial disaster which overtook him at the beginning of 1826, and the efforts he made over the next seven years to pay off his debts by writing bestselling books.  Since its first complete publication in 1890 it has attracted high praise, being considered by many critics one of the finest diaries in the language.

== Manuscript ==

The manuscript of the ''Journal'', "a handsome lockd volume" as Scott called it, is of quarto size and bound in vellum.  The handwriting displayed in it, especially after his final series of strokes, is so atrociously difficult that, according to the ''Journal'''s most recent editor, a perfectly accurate transcription is quite impossible.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Journal of Sir Walter Scott |editor1-first=W.

A hard word so spelld on the Authority of Miss Scott now Mrs. Lockhart}}

The manuscript was kept at [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]] after Scott's death, but was bought by the financier [[J. P. Morgan]] around 1900, and is now in the [[The Morgan Library &amp; Museum|Morgan Library]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/online/TheDiary/diary.asp?id=9 |title=The Diary: Three Centuries of Private Lives |publisher=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

In July 1825 Scott acquired a copy of the ''Diary of [[Samuel Pepys]]'', which had just been published for the first time, and according to his son-in-law [[John Gibson Lockhart|J. G. Lockhart]], "I never observed him more delighted with any book whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart (1896) p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year he read a manuscript copy of [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s 1821 journal and was impressed by Byron's plan of writing a desultory, unsystematic record of his actions, thoughts and memories, which combined the maximum of interest for the reader with the minimum of effort for the writer.  Inspired by these two models, he opened his own new diary on November 20, 1825 and wrote the first entry.&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart (1896) p. 572&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1998) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (1981) p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Siege of Malta Rediscovered |last=Sultana |first=Donald E. |year=1977 |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |isbn=0707301319 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only two days later he noted doubts as to the financial stability of the publisher [[Archibald Constable]] &amp; Co., which concerned him greatly since he had a large stake in the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1998) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  His worst fears were realized the following year when Constable failed, bringing [[James Ballantyne]] &amp; Co., in which Scott was a partner, down with him.  Scott found himself personally liable for debts totalling more than £125,000.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Walter Scott: His Life and Personality |last=Pearson |first=Hesketh |year=1987 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |pages=220–228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He resolved to pay off the debts by his own labours as a novelist rather than accept bankruptcy, and the ''Journal'' records his unceasing efforts to do this as he writes a series of novels and histories, including ''[[Woodstock (novel)|Woodstock]]'', ''The Surgeon's Daughter'', ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]'', ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]'', ''[[Count Robert of Paris]]'', ''[[The Siege of Malta (novel)|The Siege of Malta]]'', ''[[Bizarro (Walter Scott)|Bizarro]]'', ''The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte'' and ''[[Tales of a Grandfather]]''.  Other disasters are recorded in the ''Journal'', such as the death of his wife in 1826, and a series of strokes which increasingly undermined his physical and mental powers.  In July 1828 he allowed the habit of keeping his journal to lapse for several months, but returned to the task from January 1829 to July 1829 and from May 1830 to May 1831.  In October 1831 he again resumed the ''Journal'', having been offered £1000 or £1500 by his publisher [[Robert Cadell]] for some record of his forthcoming voyage to [[Malta]] and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Letters of Sir Walter Scott 1831-1832 |editor1-first=H. J. C. |editor1-last=Grierson |year=1937 |publisher=Constable |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He finally abandoned work on it in [[Naples]] in April 1832, the last entry ending in the middle of a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1998) p. 800&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==

From the time of the ''Journal''’s first publication extraordinary claims have been made for it.  In 1891 [[Algernon Swinburne]] wrote that "The too long delayed publication of his ''Journal'' is in every way an almost priceless benefit; but as a final illustration and attestation of a character almost incomparably lovable, admirable, and noble, it is a gift altogether beyond price."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Prose and Poetry |last=Swinburne |first=Algernon |year=1897 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The biographer [[Hesketh Pearson]] called it "Perhaps the most valuable, certainly the most moving, of all his productions; and, since it displays a man whose goodness of heart balanced his greatness of mind, incomparably the most interesting work of its kind ever written."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson (1987) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[Virginia Woolf]], "Scott's Journals are the best life of Scott in existence...they contain Scott in his glory and Scott in his gloom...in a few passages Scott throws more light upon his genius and its limitations than all his critics in their innumerable volumes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woolf |first1=Virginia |year=1974 |title=The Moment and Other Essays |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |page=56 |isbn=0156619008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scott scholar David Hewitt agreed, writing that "There is no greater or more moving diary in English"; however he also made the point that its fine artistic shape cannot be credited to Scott, since he quite fortuitously took up the ''Journal'' as the tragedy of his last years was about to begin.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (1981) p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;  The literary historian [[Oliver Elton]] believed that the ''Journal''’s high place in English literature was secure: "Whatever else of Scott's may lose its colour with time, the ''Journal'' cannot do so, with its accurate, unexaggerated language of pain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Survey of English Literature, 1780-1830 |last=Elton |first=Oliver |volume=1 |year=1965 |publisher=E. Arnold |page=357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lockhart believed that Scott knew his ''Journal'' would eventually be published, but he nevertheless called it "The most candid Diary that ever man penned".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1998) pp. xxiii-xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart (1896) p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of the ''Journal'''s candour has been taken up by many later critics.  [[C. S. Lewis]] considered that it was "One of the sincerest books in the world, and (what is not exactly the same thing) full of self-knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Selected Literary Essays |last=Lewis |first=C. S. |editor1-first=Walter |editor1-last=Hooper |year=1969 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521296803 |page=211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novelist [[John Buchan]] wrote that "It is one of the most complete expressions of a human soul that we possess… There is no reticence and no posturing, because he is speaking to his own soul…The greatest figure he ever drew is in the ''Journal'', and it is the man Walter Scott."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sir Walter Scott |last=Buchan |first=John |year=1961 |publisher=Cassell |pages=277–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eric Anderson (educator)|W. E. K. Anderson]] added the other side of the coin: "It is candid about Scott himself.  It is neither informative nor candid about other people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=W. E. K. |date=1973 |chapter=The ''Journal'' |editor1-last=Bell |editor1-first=Alan |title=Scott Bicentenary Essays: Selected Papers Read at the Sir Walter Scott Bicentenary Conference |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XTtbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=candid+about+Scott+himself.++It+is+neither+informative&amp;dq=candid+about+Scott+himself.++It+is+neither+informative&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cOQbVfjgGe_g7QbduIHoBA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA |location=Edinburgh and London |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |page=84 |isbn=070111987X |access-date=1 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novelist and critic [[A. N. Wilson]] judged it to be a truthful record of an unusual kind:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing in it which can be contradicted by other biographical evidence…Yet there is something extremely ''conscious'' about it.  It is far more than a work of art.  Scott was not making himself out to be someone that he was not; rather, the Journal is his record of how he made himself conform to the heroic standards of his own fictions…Scott was intent on facing [his difficulties and sorrows] with the bravado of [[Balfour of Burley|Burley]] and the stubbornness of [[Jeanie Deans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Laird of Abbotsford: A View of Sir Walter Scott |last=Wilson |first=A. N. |year=1980 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192117564 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] offered a dissenting view of the ''Journal'''s sincerity.  He thought that Scott, foreseeing eventual publication, took the opportunity to influence history's view of his financial crisis: "In these appallingly humiliating circumstances it evidently became more important than ever that he should preserve a noble image of himself ''in extremis'' for posterity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life of Sir Walter Scott: A Critical Biography |last=Sutherland|first=John |year=1997 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=0631203176 |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions ==

* J. G. Lockhart ''Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.'' in 7 volumes (Edinburgh: Robert Cadell, 1837).  The last two volumes include substantial extracts from the ''Journal'', the text being based on a transcript by Lockhart's wife Sophia, Scott's daughter.  Many subsequent editions of Lockhart's biography have appeared.
* David Douglas (ed.) ''The Journal of Sir Walter Scott'' in 2 volumes (Edinburgh: David Douglas, 1890).  The task of establishing the text was left to Professor Hume Brown.  A revised edition in 1927 expands the notes.
* [[John Guthrie Tait]] and W. M. Parker (eds.)  ''The Journal of Sir Walter Scott'' in 3 volumes (Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1939-1946).  The text was produced by collating the Douglas edition against a photocopy, held in the [[National Library of Scotland]], of the original manuscript.
* W. E. K. Anderson (ed.) ''The Journal of Sir Walter Scott'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972).  This was reissued as a paperback by Canongate Classics in 1998, with minor corrections and additions.  Anderson’s edition is amply annotated, but like the previous one was based on a photocopy.
* David Hewitt (ed.) ''Scott on Himself'' (Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1981). Includes extracts from the ''Journal'' comprising most of the entries from December 1825 to May 1826, edited from the original manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1998) pp. v-vi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.ac.uk/search?au=Walter+Scott&amp;ti=Journal+Walter+Scott&amp;sort-order=date |title=Copac catalogue entry |publisher=Copac |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theatre Rice''' is an ASUC sponsored theater group that conducts dedicated shows on the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus regularly, performs externally throughout the [[San Francisco Bay area]], and tours throughout [[California]]. Shows traditionally include [[improvisation]], [[sketch comedy]], [[drama]], [[film]]s, live [[music]], [[adaptations]], [[musicals]], [[dances]], and [[Duo Interpretation|duologues]]. Other forms of performance have been featured as well.

==History==
Theatre Rice, the first modern [[Asian American theatre]] group at Berkeley, was started in the autumn of 1998. Since its conception, Theatre Rice has grown considerably, both artistically and physically. In the past several years, the group has begun to attract an increasingly larger audience and a greater membership. Theatre Rice has emerged from a relatively unknown group to a group whose performances have become an anticipated community event.

==Mission==
Theatre Rice was conceived to provide people (particularly, but not exclusively, Asian Americans) who might not otherwise have a chance to participate in theatrical arts the opportunity to [[acting|act]], [[writing|write]], [[singing|sing]], [[theatre director|direct]], [[dance]], and learn [[Theatre|behind-the-stage]] techniques. What sets Theatre Rice apart from other dramatic groups is its open and unintimidating environment, and the basic ethic that effort and commitment are more important than experience or innate talent. Because the group contains both seasoned and fledgling actors, there exists a healthy dynamic within which members can share their experiences and learn from each other.

The Asian American aspect of Theatre Rice is important because it is a step towards combating the misrepresentation, as well as the lack of representation, of the Asian American community in popular culture. By its mere existence, Theatre Rice is fulfilling its purpose of putting forth ideas that stem from the minds of Asian Americans, and therefore addressing the Asian American population as well as the greater community within Berkeley and beyond.

==Charity work==
A percentage of every show's profits goes to a charity or nonprofit organization, selected out of a pool of organizations usually submitted by the cast and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tr.berkeley.edu/charity&amp;menu=about_menu Theatre Rice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations have traditionally been associated with Asian American and performing arts communities, such as the [[Asian American Theater Company]], the API Youth Promoting Advocacy and Leadership, Youth For Asian Theatre, and the National Asian Women's Health Organization. More recent donations include [[Theatre Rhinoceros]], the Japanese Red Cross in the aftermath of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], [[Direct Relief International]] to help [[Hurricane Sandy]] survivors, and [[St. Baldrick's Foundation]].

==Awards and recognitions==
Theatre Rice was voted Best On-Campus Acting Group by the [[Daily Cal]]'s Best of Berkeley 2009 and Best Performance Group in the Best of Berkeley 2011.

The '''Treasure of Guarrazar''', [[Guadamur]], [[Province of Toledo]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Spain]], is an  [[Archaeology|archeological]] find composed of twenty-six [[votive crown]]s and gold [[cross]]es that had originally been offered to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] by the [[Visigoth|Kings of the Visigoths]] in the seventh century in [[Hispania]], as a gesture of the orthodoxy of their faith and their submission to the ecclesiastical hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm Musée National du Moyen Âge, Hôtel de Cluny] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317142133/http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm |date=2010-03-17 }}: the Musée de Cluny conserves one of the votive crowns.&lt;/ref&gt; The most valuable of all is the votive crown of king [[Reccesuinth]] with its blue [[sapphire]]s from [[Sri Lanka]] and [[pendilia]].  Though the treasure is now divided and much has disappeared, it represents the best surviving group of Early Medieval Christian votive offerings.

The treasure, which represents the high point of Visigothic goldsmith's work,&lt;ref&gt;M.F. Guerra, T. Galligaro, A. Perea, "The treasure of Guarrazar : Tracing the gold supplies in the Visigothic Iberian peninsula", ''Archeometry'' '''49'''.1 (2007) pp. 53-74.&lt;/ref&gt; was dug between 1858 and 1861 in an orchard called ''Guarrazar'', in [[Guadamur]], very close to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Spain]]. The treasure was divided, with some objects going to the [[Musée de Cluny]] in [[Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |last=Fallow |first=Thomas Macall |wstitle=Crown and Coronet |volume=7 |page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rest to the armouries of the [[Palacio Real]] in [[Madrid]] (today in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]). In 1921 and 1936, some items of the Treasure of Guarrazar were stolen and have disappeared.

Some comparable Visigothic [[filigree]] gold was found in 1926 at [[Torredonjimeno]] in the province of Jaén, consisting of fragments of votive crowns and crosses.&lt;ref&gt;Described and compared in Alicia Perea, "Visigothic filigree in the Guarrazar (Toledo) and Torredonjimeno (Jaén) treasures," ''Historic Metallurgy'' '''40'''.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The jewellery found at Guarrazar is part of a continuous tradition of Iberian metalworking that goes back to prehistoric times. These Visigothic works were influenced heavily by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], but the techniques of gem encrustation found at Guarrazar were practised throughout the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic world]] and the style of the lettering was Germanic too. The crowns, however, were purely Byzantine in form and never meant to be worn. They were gifts to the church, to be hung above the altar.

The most valuable remaining pieces of the find are the two royal votive crowns: one of King [[Reccesuinth]] and one of King [[Suinthila]]. Both are made of gold, encrusted with sapphires, pearls, and other precious stones. Suinthila's was stolen in 1921 and never recovered. There are several other small crowns and many votive crosses. There were belts in the original find as well, but these have since vanished.

These findings, together with other of some neighbors and with the archaeological excavation of the Ministry of Public Works and the Royal Academy of History (April 1859), formed a group consisting of:

*  [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]: six crowns, five crosses, a pendant and remnants of foil and channels (almost all of gold).
*  [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]: a crown and a gold cross and a stone engraved with the Annunciation. A crown, and other fragments of a tiller with a crystal ball were stolen from the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1921 and its whereabouts are still unknown.
*  [[Musée de Cluny|National Museum of the Middle Ages]], [[Paris]]: three crowns, two crosses, links and gold pendants.

There were also many fragments of sculptures and the remains of a building, perhaps a Roman [[sanctuary]] or place of purification. After its dedication to Christian worship as a church or oratory, it housed a number of graves. A skeleton lying on a bed of lime and sand was found in the best preserved grave. Its well-preserved stone slate has a  Latin inscription that  mentions a priest named Crispín, dating from 693 (51st year of the reign of [[Égica]], year of the [[Sixteenth Council of Toledo]]). This slate is now in the National Archeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. The inscription on the Sónnica cross, a piece preserved in Paris, gives an indication about the name of this church.

According to some hypothesis, the monastery of Sancta Maria in Sorbaces of Guarrazar served as a hideout for the real treasure of the court, Toledo churches and monasteries to prevent their capture by the Muslims' invasion of Spain.

The '''Tržan Castle''' ({{IPA-sh|ˈtr̩̂ʒan|hr}};  {{lang-hr|Tržan-grad}} or ''Utvrda Tržan'') is a ruined [[medieval]] [[castle]] above the village of [[Modruš]] in the northern part of historical [[Lika region]], central [[Croatia]]. Before (from the 11th century) the administrative seat of the former Modruš County (later renamed [[Modruš-Rijeka County]]), it is today just a ruin in the [[Josipdol]] Municipality in the southern part of the [[Karlovac County]]. 

Having been built on a [[ridge]] of a steep hill {{convert|670|m|ft}} above sea level on the eastern slopes of the [[Velika Kapela]] mountain, the castle was at a strategic place overlooking the road that connected the [[Adriatic Sea]] and the [[Pannonian Basin]] since ancient times. The road in question connected the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] towns of Senia (present-day [[Senj]]) and [[Siscia]] (present-day [[Sisak]]). It was later, during the 18th century, reconstructed, improved and renamed as [[Josephina (road)|Josephina road]].

==History==

According to the famous Croatian historian [[Vjekoslav Klaić]] (1849–1928), a kind of a castle or [[fortification|stronghold]] most probably existed above Modruš already at the beginning of the 9th century, during a war between [[Borna of Croatia|Borna]], Duke of [[Dalmatian Croatia]], and [[Ljudevit Posavski]], Duke of [[Principality of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]].

Almost ideal position, dominating over the surrounding area, made Tržan Castle never to be conquered by anyone in its history, although the town of Modruš below the castle was plundered and burned by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1493, just before the [[battle of Krbava Field]].

From 1193 the castle was property of the [[Knez (title)|Knezes (Princes)]] of [[Krk]], (later, from around 1430, known as the [[House of Frankopan|Frankopans]]), a distinguished Croatian noble family. Bartol II Krčki /Bartholomew II of Krk/ was given the whole vast Modruš estate, including the castle, by the [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croato-Hungarian]] king [[Béla III of Hungary|Bella II (III)]] for his merits in the wars he fought. The next more than 350 years Tržan was owned by the Frankopans, not only as one among the many castles in their property, but as the main seat and stronghold of the family in the whole continental part of Croatia. From thence ruled, among others, [[Ivan V Krčki (Frankopan)|Ivan V Krčki]] /John V of Krk/ (born before 1343, died 1393) and his son [[Nikola Frankopan|Nikola IV]] /Nicholas IV/ (born around 1360, died 1432), the most powerful man in Croatia at the beginning of the 15th century, both [[Ban (title)|Bans (Viceroys)]] of [[Croatia]]. They reconstructed and enlarged the old, irregular shaped castle, which was from around 1437 called Tržan or Tržan-grad, because of an increased trade that was going on there ({{lang-hr|tržiti means to trade or to sell}}).

The [[wall]]s, [[bastion]]s and [[tower]]s were built of hewn stone ([[ashlar]]) in the „fishbone“ style and represented a kind of masterpiece of the contemporary building skill. There are some signs which indicate that the foreign building masters took part in the works, most probably those from the [[Republic of Venice]]. The castle itself consisted of central part with a large [[guard tower]] and a [[palace]] as residence for members of the princely family with its supporting staff, northern part with outbuildings for economic services, various [[workshop]]s, [[warehouse]]s, [[water tank]]s and rectangular defending tower, and southern part containing mostly facilities for [[retail trade]], accommodation for traders and travellers etc. Following the walls and bastions of the castle, there were [[defensive wall]]s, about {{convert|1200|m|ft}} long, around the town of Modruš, descending the slope of the hill.

In 1449 a well-known partition of the huge Frankopan estates, spread throughout central and western Croatia, took place, as the eight sons of Nikola IV Frankopan agreed to split and share their father`s property (legally valid) among themselves. In the course of this, the whole Modruš estate belonged to [[Stjepan III Frankopan Modruški|Stjepan III]] /Stephen III/ (born before 1416, died around 1481–84); in the sharing [[inheritance]] document it was written: „...to Stjepan belongs the market town Modruš with the Tržan ''Castrum''“...   It was a time of constant and steady rise, a „[[golden age]]“ of Modruš, that reached its peak in 1460, as the town became a seat of a [[bishop]].

[[Bernardin Frankopan]] (1453–1529), the only son of Stjepan III, successfully managed the whole of his property further from the Tržan Castle, although there was increasing threat of the Ottoman raids from the already conquered [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] territory, east of Modruš County. This led to decrease of importance of Tržan by the end of the 15th century, and the population of the whole area started to move away more and more from its old places of residence to the other, safer parts of Croatia and neighbouring countries, not willing to live in endangered territory.

In the first half of the 16th century the castle was always less [[wikt:maintenance|maintained]] and repaired than needed, and after 1553 came under control of the military authorities of the [[Croatian Military Frontier]]. A relatively small military deployment unit was permanently stationed there. After several unsuccessful attempts to renovate or rebuild the more and more severely damaged parts of the castle during the 17th and 18th century, the military authorities decided in 1791 to abandon it. Following the negligible Ottoman danger at that time, they presumed that it was not necessary to keep soldiers in Tržan and it was left to its own destiny, becoming a badly damaged castle [[ruin]] today.

'''UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects''' (Rome, 1995) is the international treaty on the subject of cultural property protection. It attempts to strengthen the main weaknesses of the 1970 UNESCO ''Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property''. The [[UNIDROIT]] Convention seeks to fight the illicit trafficking of cultural property by modifying the buyer's behaviour, obliging him/her to check the legitimacy of their purchase.

==Due diligence and Burden of Proof==
[[File:Claude monet - marina (MCM-RJ) 01.JPG|thumb|[[Claude Monet]]. ''Marina''. Painting stolen from the {{Interlanguage link multi|Museu da Chácara do Céu|pt}}, Rio de Janeiro, in 2006]]

The Convention states that if a cultural property was stolen it must be returned (Chapter II, Art. 3.1).&lt;ref name="Convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention|title=''UNIDROIT Convention on stolen or illegally exported  cultural objects''|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNIDROIT official website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Any possessor deprived of his/her property will be compensated only if he/she can prove due diligence at the time of the purchase (Chapter II, Art. 4.1). The criteria for due diligence is listed under Article 4.4. of the Convention.

To assess the legitimacy of the object's origin, art market players can use international and national databases dedicated to cultural property protection, for instance, the INTERPOL Stolen Works of Art Database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Works-of-art/Database|title=Works of art / Works of art / Crime areas / Internet / Home - INTERPOL|last=|first=|date=2017-07-26|website=|publisher=Interpol.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; collects information about stolen cultural property and issues identification numbers to cultural objects.

Whereas Chapter II of the Convention deals with stolen cultural objects, Chapter III contemplates the export of cultural property in violation of national export restrictions. A State Party can request the competent Court of another Contracting State to order the return of a cultural object illegally exported from its territory if the removal of the object caused detriment in one of the ways listed under Article 5.3. Again, the burden of proof is on the possessor to demonstrate that he/she "neither knew nor ought reasonably to have known at the time of acquisition that the object had been illegally exported" (Art. 6.1).

These rules apply equally to cultural objects inherited or received as gifts. Either an heir or a beneficiary has the same responsibility as a buyer. Therefore, museums and other public institutions must carry out checks over the origin of donated objects.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-overview-e.pdf | title=The 1995 UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects. An overview | publisher= UNIDROIT official website| accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1970 UNESCO Convention and the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention==

The UNESCO ''Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property'' (1970 UNESCO Convention) and the UNIDROIT Convention are compatible and complementary. 
As distinct from the UNESCO Convention, the UNIDROIT Convention focuses on the recovery of cultural property. The UNIDROIT Convention establishes conditions for claims of restitution/return of stolen or illegally exported cultural objects respectively.

Although the UNIDROIT Convention follows key terminology of 1970 UNESCO Convention, cultural goods do not need to be defined as such by the State.

Furthermore, the term  "cultural property" is replaced by a more comprehensive "cultural object", but the list of their categories remains the same. The concept of "illicit export" is replaced by "illegal export",  which references a prohibitive law rather than a general forbiddance.

==Time Restrictions to Claims for Repatriation==

The Convention regulates the time period that an affected party may bring a claim for the restitution of stolen cultural property or the return of those illegally exported. 
Such a claim may be brought in three years from the time when the claimant knew the location of the cultural property and the identity of the possessor and in 50 years since the time of the theft (Art. 3.3). However, there are exceptions to this rule for stolen objects. 
Cultural objects that form an integral part of an identified monument or archaeological site, or which belong to a public collection are not subject to time limitation other than a period of three years (Art. 3.4). In addition, a Contracting State may declare that a claim warrants an extended time limit of 75 years or longer if so stated in its national law (Art. 3.5).&lt;ref name="convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.pdf | title=UNIDROIT Convention on stolen or illegally exported  cultural objects | publisher= UNIDROIT official website| accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNIDROIT Convention is not a retroactive treaty. Its provisions only apply to cultural property stolen or illegally exported after the Convention entered into force (Art. 10).&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt; However the UNIDROIT Convention "does not in any way legitimise any illegal transaction of whatever which has taken place before the entry into force of this Convention" and does not "limit any right of a State or other person to make a claim under remedies available outside the framework" of the Convention (Art. 10.3).&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt;

'''Variable-data publishing (VDP)''' (also known as [[database publishing]]) is a term referring to the output of a variable composition system.  While these systems can produce both electronically viewable and hard-copy (print) output, the "variable-data publishing" term today often distinguishes output destined for electronic viewing, rather than that which is destined for hard-copy print (e.g. [[variable data printing]]).

Essentially the same techniques are employed to perform variable-data publishing, as those utilized with variable data printing.  The difference is in the interpretation for output.  While variable-data printing may be interpreted to produce various print streams or page-description files (e.g. [[Advanced Function Presentation|AFP]]/[[IPDS]], [[PostScript]], [[Printer Command Language|PCL]]), variable-data publishing produces electronically viewable files, most commonly seen in the forms of [[PDF]], [[HTML]], or [[XML]].

Variable-data composition involves the use of data to conditionally:
* exhibit text (static blocks and/or variable content)
* exhibit images
* select fonts
* select colors
* format page layouts &amp; flows

Variable-data may be as simple as an address block or salutation. However, it can be any or all of the document's textual content—including words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, or the entire document.  In other words, it can make up as little or as much of the document as the composer desires.  Variable data may also be used to exhibit various images, such as logos, products, or membership photos.  Further, variable-data can be used to build rule-based design schemes, including fonts, colors, and page formats.  The possibilities are vast.

The variable-data tools available today, make it possible to perform variable-data composition at nearly every stage of document production.  However, the level of control that can be achieved varies, based upon how far into the document production process a variable-data tool is deployed.  For example, if variable-data insertion occurs just prior to output...it's not likely that the text flow or layout can be altered with nearly as much control as would be available at the time of initial document composition.

Many organizations will produce multiple forms of output (aka: multi-channel output), for the same document.  This ensures that the published content is available to recipients via any form of access method they might require.  When multi-channel output is utilized, integrity between those output channels often becomes important.

Variable-data publishing may be performed on everything from a [[personal computer]] to a [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] system.  However, the speed and practical output volumes which can be achieved are directly affected by the computer power utilized.

==Origin of the concept==

The term variable-data publishing was likely an offshoot of the term "variable-data printing", first introduced to the printing industry by Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the [[College of Imaging Arts and Sciences]] at [[Rochester Institute of Technology]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} However, the concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop '[[mail merge]]', to complex [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in the past 3 years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">[[File:Mann Von Hirschlanden.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A copy of the Hirschlanden warrior, on display at the findspot.]]
The '''''Warrior of Hirschlanden''''' (''Krieger von Hirschlanden'' in German) is a [[statue]] of a nude [[phallic symbol|ithyphallic]] [[warrior]] made of [[sandstone]], the oldest known [[Iron Age]] life-size anthropomorphic statue north of the Alps. It was a production of the [[Hallstatt culture]], probably dating to the 6th century BC. It is now in the [[Landesmuseum Württemberg|Württembergisches Landesmuseum]] in [[Stuttgart]], with a copy at the Hirschlanden site (now [[Ditzingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]), where it was found. The preserved height is 1.50 m, but the feet have been broken off.

==Description==
The warrior wears a [[torc]] (neck-ring), a belt with a typical late Hallstatt dagger, and a pointed hat, possibly made (as with the real hat in the princely grave of [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf]]) of birchbark.

While the legs are modelled with some realism, the upper body is rather schematic and the face is extremely sketchy, leading to speculation that the man might be intended to be seen as wearing a mask, as is known from burials in Klein-Klein, Styria, Austria, [[Trebeništa]] (Macedonia) and the much earlier shaft-graves of [[Mycenae]], ca. 1500 BC.

The statue shows significant weathering, suggesting that it stood exposed to the elements for a long time before being buried.  Other anthropomorphic statues of the early Iron Age have been found in Rottenburg, Tübingen, Stammheim and Stockach (all Baden-Württemberg, Germany), but they are far more stylised, more carving than statue.  In the following [[La Tène period]], anthropomorphic statues are still very rare, but examples include the finds from [[Glauberg]] (Hessen, Germany), Holzgerlingen (Baden-Württemberg, Germany), the [[Mšecké Žehrovice Head]] (Bohemia), and the sculptures at [[Roquepertuse]].

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] influence (''[[Kouros|kouroi]]'') has been discussed. Numerous black figure vessels from fortified settlements of the period attest trading contacts with the Mediterranean, probably via the [[Rhône River]] and the Greek colony of [[Marseilles|Massilia]] ([[Marseille]]). Much closer stylistic connections exist with the far more elaborate statues from [[Capestrano]], Picenium, [[Italy]] (650-550 BC) and Casale Marittimo (middle of the 7th century).

==History==
The statue was found in Hirschlanden (now [[Ditzingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]) in 1963 when a low [[tumulus|barrow]] was excavated. The barrow was surrounded by a [[stone circle]] and a [[dry stone wall]]. It contained 16 burials, ranging from the very beginning of the Iron Age (Hallstatt D1, ca. 600 BC) to the beginning of the Late Iron Age ([[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period, ca. 450 BC). The statue was found north of the barrow, but is supposed to have been originally placed on the top.
