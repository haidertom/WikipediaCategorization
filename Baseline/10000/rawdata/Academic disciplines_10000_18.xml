      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5146">{{Advanced Placement}}
In the United States, '''Advanced Placement Computer Science''' is a suite of [[Advanced Placement]] courses and examinations covering areas of [[computer science]]. They are offered by the [[College Board]] to [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]] students as an opportunity to earn college credit for [[college]]-level courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement | title = Credit &amp; Placement | work = AP Students | publisher = The [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suite consists of two current classes and one discontinued class.

AP Computer Science was taught in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] for the 1984–1998 exams, in [[C++]] for 1999–2003, and in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsi.thecubscientist.com/05_DailySchedule/historyAPCS.pdf|title=AP Computer Science: A Brief History|last=Lew|first=Michael|date=|website=Thecubscientist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Computer Science Principles==
[[AP Computer Science Principles]] is an introductory course to computer science, "with a focus on how computing powers the world".&lt;ref name=CSPcoursedetails&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles/course-details | title = AP Computer Science Principles: Course Details | work = AP Students | publisher = The College Board | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed as a parallel to AP Computer Science A, to emphasize [[computational thinking]] and fluency. It is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science.

AP Computer Science Principles was introduced in the 2016–2017 school year.

==AP Computer Science A==
[[AP Computer Science A]] is a programming class.&lt;ref name=CSAcoursedetails&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/course-details | title = AP Computer Science A: Course Details | work = AP Students | publisher = The College Board  | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The course emphasizes [[object-oriented programming]] methodology, especially problem solving and [[algorithm]] development, plus an overview of data structures and abstraction. The [[AP Computer Science A]] exam tests students on their knowledge of [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

It is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science. 

The [[Microsoft]]-sponsored program [[Technology Education and Literacy in Schools]] (TEALS) aims to increase the number of students taking AP Computer Science classes.&lt;ref name="Bishop2012-07-27"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bishop |first=Todd |date=2012-07-27 |title=Geek of the Week: Kevin Wang is putting computer scientists into high schools |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/kevin-wang/ |newspaper=[[GeekWire]] |accessdate=2015-07-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Zo1zm7iP?url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/kevin-wang/ |archivedate=2015-07-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Computer Science AB (discontinued)==
[[AP Computer Science AB]] included all the topics of AP Computer Science A, as well as a more formal and a more in-depth study of [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], and [[data abstraction]]. For example, [[binary trees]] were studied in AP Computer Science AB but not in AP Computer Science A. The use of [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] data structures and [[dynamic allocation|dynamically allocated]] structures were fundamental to AP Computer Science AB. 

AP Computer Science AB was equivalent to a full-year college course.&lt;ref name=CSABhomepage&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/8153.html | title = AP Computer Science AB Course Home Page | work = AP Central | publisher = The College Board | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516202349/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/8153.html | archive-date = May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to low numbers of students taking the exam, AP Computer Science AB was discontinued following the May 2009 exam administration.&lt;ref name=CSABdiscontinued&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html | title = Important Announcement about AP Computer Science AB | work = AP Central | publisher = The College Board | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409195847/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html | archive-date = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cech | first = Scott J. | url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2008/04/09/32ap.h27.html | title = College Board Intends to Drop AP Programs in Four Subjects | work = Education Week | date = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''analog delay line''' is a [[Electrical network|network]] of [[electronic component|electrical component]]s connected in [[cascade connection|cascade]], where each individual element creates a time difference or ''[[phase change (waves)|phase change]]'' between its input signal and its output signal. It operates on analog [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]s whose [[amplitude]] varies continuously. An example is a [[bucket-brigade device]].&lt;ref name=calvert /&gt;

Other types of delay line include acoustic (usually [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]]), [[Magnetostriction|magnetostrictive]], and [[surface acoustic wave]] devices. A series of resistor–capacitor circuits ([[RC circuit]]s) can be cascaded to form a delay. A long [[transmission line]] can also provide a delay element. The delay time of an analog delay line may be only a few nanoseconds or several milliseconds, limited by the practical size of the physical medium used to delay the signal and the propagation speed of impulses in the medium.

Analog delay lines are applied in many types of signal processing circuits; for example the [[PAL]] television standard uses an analog delay line to store an entire video [[scanline]]. Acoustic and [[electromechanical]] delay lines are used to provide a "[[reverberation]]" effect in musical instrument amplifiers, or to simulate an echo. High-speed [[oscilloscope]]s used an analog delay line to allow observation of waveforms just before some triggering event.

With the growing use of digital signal processing techniques, digital forms of delay are practical and eliminate some of the problems with dissipation and noise in analog systems.

==History==

[[Inductor]]–[[capacitor]] [[Ladder topology|ladder networks]] were used as analog delay lines in the 1920s. For example, Francis Hubbard's sonar direction finder patent filed in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Francis A. Hubbard, System for Determining the Direction of Propagation of Wave Energy, {{US patent|1,641,432}}, Granted Sept. 6, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard referred to this as an [[Artificial transmission line]].  In 1941, Gerald Tawney of [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] filed for a patent on a compact packaging of an inductor–capacitor ladder network that he explicitly referred to as a ''time delay line''.&lt;ref&gt;Gereld L. Tawney, Electrical Time Delay Line, {{US patent|2390563}}, Granted Dec. 11, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Robert Mathes of [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] filed a broad patent covering essentially all electromechanical delay lines, but focusing on acoustic delay lines where an air column confined to a pipe served as the mechanical medium, and a telephone receiver at one end and a telephone transmitter at the other end served as the electromechanical transducers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Mathes, Wave Transmission System, {{US patent|1696315}}, granted Dec. 25, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathes was motivated by the problem of [[echo suppression]] on long-distance telephone lines, and his patent clearly explained the fundamental relationship between inductor–capacitor ladder networks and mechanical elastic delay lines such as his acoustic line.

In 1938, William Spencer Percival of Electrical &amp; Musical Industries (later [[EMI]]) applied for a patent on an acoustical delay line using [[piezoelectric transducer]]s and a liquid medium.  He used water or [[kerosene]], with a 10&amp;nbsp;MHz carrier frequency, with multiple baffles and reflectors in the delay tank to create a long acoustic path in a relatively small tank.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Percival, Delay Device for use in Transmission of Oscillations, {{US patent|2263902}}, Nov. 25, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, [[Laurens Hammond]] applied electromechanical delay lines to the problem of creating artificial reverberation for his [[Hammond organ]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurens Hammond, Electrical Musical Instrument, {{US patent|2230836}}, granted Feb. 4, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hammond used coil springs to transmit mechanical waves between [[Voice coil|voice-coil]] transducers.

The problem of suppressing [[multipath interference]] in [[television reception]] motivated Clarence Hansell of [[RCA]] to use delay lines in his 1939 patent application.  He used "delay cables" for this, relatively short pieces of coaxial cable used as delay lines, but he recognized the possibility of using [[magnetostrictive]] or [[piezoelectric]] delay lines.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence W. Hansell, Method and Means for Reducing Multiple Signals, {{US patent|2310692}}, granted Feb. 9, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1943, compact delay lines with distributed capacitance and inductance were devised. Typical early designs involved winding an enamel insulated wire on an insulating core and then surrounding that with a grounded conductive jacket.  Richard Nelson of [[General Electric]] filed a patent for such a line that year.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Nelson, Artificial Transmission Line, {{US patent|2420559}}, granted May 13, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other GE employees, John Rubel and Roy Troell, concluded that the insulated wire could be wound around a conducting core to achieve the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Rubel and Roy E. Troell, Adjustable Delay Line, {{US patent|2467857}}, Granted Apr. 19, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the development of delay lines during World War II was motivated by the problems encountered in [[radar]] systems.

In 1944, Madison G. Nicholson applied for a general patent on [[magnetostrictive]] delay lines.  He recommended their use for applications requiring delays or measurement of intervals in the  10 to 1000 microseconds time range.&lt;ref&gt;Madison G. Nicholson, Jr., Time Delay Apparatus, {{US patent|2,401,094}}, granted May 28, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Gordon D. Forbes and Herbert Shapiro filed a patent for the a mercury delay line with [[piezoelectric transducer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Forbes and Herbert Shapiro, Transmission Line, {{US patent|2423306}}, granted July 1, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;  This delay line technology would play an important role, serving as the basis of the [[delay line memory]] used in several [[first-generation computer]]s.

In 1946, David Arenberg filed patents covering the use of [[piezoelectric]] transducers attached to single crystal solid delay lines.  He tried using [[quartz]] as a delay medium and reported that [[anisotropy]] in the quartz crystals caused problems.  He reported success with single crystals of [[lithium bromide]], [[sodium chloride]] and [[aluminum]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Arenberg, Delay Means, {{US patent|2512130}}, granted June 20, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David L. Arlenberg, Compressional Wave Delay Means, {{US patent|2505515}}, granted Apr. 25, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;  Arlenberg developed the idea of complex 2- and 3-dimensional folding of the acoustic path in the solid medium in order to package long delays into a compact crystal.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Arenberg, Solid Delay Line, {{US patent|2624804}}, granted Jan. 6, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;  The delay lines used to decode [[PAL]] television signals follow the outline of this patent, using [[quartz glass]] as a medium instead of a single crystal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15119">'''Behavioral operations research''' ('''BOR''') examines and takes into consideration human behavior and emotions when facing complex decision problems. BOR is part of [[Operations research|Operational Research]]. BOR relates to the behavioural aspects of the use of [[operations research]] in problem solving and decision support. Specifically, it focuses on understanding behaviour in, with and beyond models&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952973172|title=Behavioral operational research : theory, methodology and practice|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Kunc, Martin,, Malpass, Jonathan,, White, Leroy,|isbn=9781137535511|location=[London]|oclc=952973172}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The general purpose is to make better use and improve the use of operations research theories and practice, so that the benefits received from the potential improvements to operations research approaches in practice, that arise from recent findings in behavioural sciences, are realised .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behavioural Operational Research (BOR)|url = http://bor.aalto.fi/ejor.html|website = bor.aalto.fi|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; BOR approaches have heavily influenced [[supply chain management]] research&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, T., Wallenburg, C.M., &amp; Wieland, A. (2017): The human factor in SCM: Introducing a meta-theory of behavioral supply chain management, International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management, 47(4), 238-262, https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJPDLM-10-2015-0268&lt;/ref&gt;, amongst others.

==Overview==
[[Operations research]] (or operational research) involves a wide range of problem–solving skills aiming to help individuals or organizations to make more rational decisions as well as improving their efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Operations Research?|url=https://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/What-is-Operations-Research|website=Informs|publisher=Informs.org|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, operations research often assumes that agents involved in the process or operating system, such as employees, consumers and suppliers, make fully rational decisions. Their decisions are not affected by their emotions as well as their surroundings and that they are able to react and distinguish between different types of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Bendoly|first1 = Elliot|title = Behavioral Operations Management|url = https://www.linkedin.com/grps/Behavioral-Operations-Management-3704620|website = Linkedin|publisher = Linkedin.com|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, this is not always true; human behavior has an important role in decision making and worker motivation, and therefore should be considered in the study of operations. This has led to the rise of behavioral operations research, which is defined as the study of impacts that human behavior has on operations, design and business interactions in different organizations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toward a Theory of Behavioral Operations|url = http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0205|journal = Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management|date = 2008-03-11|issn = 1523-4614|pages = 676–691|volume = 10|issue = 4|doi = 10.1287/msom.1070.0205|first = Francesca|last = Gino|first2 = Gary|last2 = Pisano}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral operations research aims to understand the decision making of managers and tries to make improvements to the supply chain using the insight obtained. Behavioral operations research includes knowledge from a number of fields, such as economics, behavioral science, psychology and other social sciences. Traditional operations research and behavioral operations research have a common intellectual goal, aiming to make differences in operations outcomes, such as flexibility, efficiency and productivity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behavioral Operations - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Behavioral_Operations|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical influence==
Humans have limitations in their ability to collect and react to relevant information. When a decision or conclusion has to be made through complex information, human decision-makers often fail to comply with normative decision theories. Moreover, a person's lifestyle, social interaction and collective behaviors has clear influence on people's decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:CognitivePsychology.svg|thumb|The breakdown of Cognitive Psychology Study which refers to the study of human mental processes and their role in thinking,feeling and behaving.|194x194px]]

===Cognitive psychology===
This is a relatively new branch of psychology which focuses on humans' ability to make decisions, solve problems, learning, attention, memory and forgetting, these are only a few of the practical applications of this science, to some extent it is also related to motivation and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cognitive Psychology: The Science of How We Think|url = http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/f/cogpsych.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychology is interested in what is happening within the mind when new information is received, how people respond to this information, and how this response affects their behavior and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Cognitive Psychology? - Definition &amp; Theories - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|url = http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-cognitive-psychology-definition-theories-quiz.html|website = Study.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychology is considered to be one of the dominant theoretical force in behavioral science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cognitive psychology and instruction|last = Alan|first = Lesgold|publisher = Plenum Press, in coordination with NATO Scientific Affairs Division|year = 1977|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology===
[[File:Asch experiment.png|thumb|191x191px|The Asch experiment shows that participants tend to adhere to the group norms.]]
People often react and behave differently when they are put into different social situations. The aim of social psychology is to understand the nature and causes of individual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/social-psychology.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212175704/http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-psychology.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-02-12 |title=Social Psychology |date=2007 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |website=SimplyPsychology |publisher=SimplyPsychology |last=McLeod |first=Saul |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It questions or provides an insight of how human behavior relies on the physical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Argyle, M., Collett, P. and Furnham, A. (1995). Social psychology at work. London: Routledge, p.271.&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychology theories explain why there are competition between individuals, why it is often the case that individuals or organisations seek to protect and maintain their status, and why it has been observed that individuals and organisations are willing to sacrifice efficiency to achieve their goal of staying at a higher hierarchical position. In addition to status, social psychology also includes people's behavior towards goal setting, feedback and controls, interdependence, and reciprocity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Organizational behavior===
The use of psychology in behavioral operations research links to the idea of judging the relationship between people's mental health and wellbeing and their behavior at work. Psychology experts often set up indicators to evaluate how an employee's surroundings, such as working environment and noise, can affect their productivity at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is the Role of Psychology in Organizational Behavior?|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-role-of-psychology-in-organizational-behavior.htm|website = wiseGEEK|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational behavior is the study of ways people react or behave when they are organized in groups. The purpose of this study is to improve business productivity, trying to create a more efficient business organization. Organizational behavior theories are applied towards human resource trying to maximize the output from individual group members. The study of organization behavior can be broken down into different sections, including Personality, Job Satisfaction and Reward Management, Leadership, Authority, Power and Politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organizational Behavior (OB) Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/organizational-behavior.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-01|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main streams of research==
There are four main streams of research that can be considered a part of behavior operations research. These give us an idea of the weakness of the current operations research model and the effectiveness of behavioral operations research in predicting human decisions and reactions when facing different situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Socio-technical view of technology management===
Physical technologies can be defined as a socio-technology system, which consists of humans, human activity, spaces, artifacts, tools, and communications media. This theory suggests that social interaction at the workplace is determined by the technology and techniques used at work. Therefore, a change in technology used at work can lead to unexpected consequences. This may include differences in motivation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Human factor engineering===
Human factor engineering can be applied to improve workplaces, working systems and products aiming to reduce human errors during operations as well as improving human efficiency, productivity and operational performance. It often involves improvements of large machineries to reduce accidents during work. It is believed that behavior operations research can be related to human factor engineering as systematic errors, which happens very often technology and different machineries, can affect people's decision making and their interaction with the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ogp.org.uk/pubs/454.pdf|title = Human factors engineering in projects|last = |first = |date = August 2011|journal = International Association of Oil &amp; Gas Producers|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 October 2015|volume = 454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The bullwhip effect===
The bullwhip effect happens along the supply chain of an organisation. This is when agents along the supply chain fail to pass on relevant and accurate information to their superior, leading to a large variation in the demand of goods and services from the customers and the supply from the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect|url = http://www.quickmba.com/ops/bullwhip-effect/|website = www.quickmba.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human behavior is a very important aspect to be considered, as decision making and emotions in the market will make a big difference to the final result of the bullwhip effect. This is because managers who can calmly make decisions while others competitors panic and deliver inaccurate messages often perform better within the industry. When the market is in poor condition, 'fear' can be an important factor affecting managers' decisions. Therefore, human behavior is closely related to people's decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect and Your Supply Chain|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232953|website = Entrepreneur|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===System dynamics models in operations contexts===
System dynamics models in operations contexts focuses on the importance of how components in a system interact with each other as well as providing an overview of the processes that takes place within the system. Behavioral operations research often benefits from the development of comprehensive systems models as they are able to analyse and provide an insight of the operational system. This allows the study of behavioral operations to understand how people in these settings or work conditions think about the context in which they operate. In an operations system, it often involves levers for managers to manipulate the components involved in the system. The uses of these levers are determined by human behaviors and these behaviors include feelings of stress and fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Behavioral Operations Management: Social and Psychological Dynamics in Production and Service Settings|last = Bendoly|first = Elliot|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 25 June 2015|isbn = 0199357226|location = United States|pages = 6–8|last2 = van Wezel|first2 = Wout|last3 = Banchrach|first3 = Daniel G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related problems==

===Newsvendor problem===
The [[newsvendor model]] (or newsboy or single-period or perishable) is a mathematical model used in operations management and applied economics to determine optimal level products or services to keep in stock when the demand is unknown. This model is also known as the newsvendor problem by analogy with the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must make on time stocking decision of how many copies of newspaper to keep in stock when facing uncertain demand. If the newspaper vendor stocks too much, these newspaper may end up worthless by the end of the day as they are no longer up-to-date. However, if the newspaper vendor stocks too little, he misses the opportunity too make more profit and suffer loss of goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Newsvendor Model|last = Adelman|first = Dan|date = 1999|journal = The Operations Quadrangle: Business Process Fundamentals|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Barnes-Schuster|first2 = Dawn|first3 = Don|last3 = Eisenstein|publisher = The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business|pages = |page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assignment problem===
The assignment problem is a complex optimization problem. The problem involves number of agents and a number of tasks. The purpose is to assign each agent with a task. All agents are expected or aimed to be allocated in a way that will maximize productivity and efficiency and minimize the total cost of the assignment.

===Secretary problem===

The secretary problem can also be called the optimal stopping theory. It focuses heavily on applied probability, statistics and decision theory. The idea behind the secretary problem is that to make the best decisions when there is a pool of different options, other options are unknown, details of other options will only be given if the currently existing option is given up. The problem comes down to the idea of optimal strategy, maximizing the probability of selecting the best option.

'''Campanology''' (from [[Late Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:campana|campana]]'', "bell"; and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the study of [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s. It encompasses the technology of bells – how they are [[casting (metalworking)|cast]], [[musical tuning|tuned]], rung, and sounded – as well as the history, methods, and traditions of bell-ringing as an art.&lt;ref&gt;From Glossary of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers 2016; "Campanology - Study of the history, art and science of making and ringing bells.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common to collect together a set of tuned bells and treat the whole as one [[musical instrument]]. Such collections – such as a Flemish carillon, a Russian ''zvon'', or an English "[[ring of bells]]" used for [[change ringing]] – have their own practices and challenges; and campanology is likewise the study of perfecting such instruments and  composing and performing music for them.

In this sense, however, the word ''campanology'' is most often used in reference to relatively large bells, often hung in a tower. It is not usually applied to assemblages of smaller bells, such as a [[glockenspiel]], a collection of [[tubular bell]]s, or an Indonesian [[gamelan]].

A campanologist is one who studies campanology, though it is popularly mis-used to refer to a [[bell ringer]].&lt;ref&gt;From Glossary of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers 2016; " Campanologist - One who studies campanology, (popularly mis-used to refer to a ringer).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carillons==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Carillon]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Carillon}}

[[File:Carillon of PeterAndPaulCathedral 1.JPG|thumb|Carillon - showing the large number of tuned bells normally used]]

The carillon is a collection of tuned bells for playing conventional melodic music. The bells are stationary and struck by hammers linked to a clavier keyboard.
[[File:JeffDaehn.jpg|thumb|Carillonneur in action]]
The instrument is played sitting on a bench by hitting the top keyboard that allows expression through variation of touch, with the underside of the half-clenched fists, and the bottom keyboard with the feet, since the lower notes in particular require more physical strength than an organ, the latter not attaining the tonal range of the better carillons: for some of these, their bell producing the lowest tone, the 'bourdon', may weigh well over 8 [[tonne]]s; other fine bells settle for 5 to 6 tonnes. A carillon renders at least two octaves for which it needs 23 bells, though the finest have 47 to 56 bells or extravagantly even more, arranged in [[chromatic]] sequence, so tuned as to produce concordant harmony when many bells are sounded together.

Professional Carillonneurs like Belgian [[Jef Denyn]] have widespread fame&lt;ref name="Discography of Jef Denyn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jef Denyn Discography at Discogs|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jef+Denyn|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest are found in church towers in continental northern Europe, especially in cathedral towers in Belgium and present-day northern France, where some (like the [[St. Rumbolds Cathedral]] in [[Mechelen]], the [[Cathedral of Our Lady]] in [[Antwerp]]) became [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] &amp;ndash; classified with the Belfry of Bruges and its municipal Carillon under '[[Belfries of Belgium and France]]'.&lt;br&gt;The carillon of [[Kirk in the Hills]], [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], [[United States]], along with the one at Hyechon College in [[Daejeon|Daejoen, South Korea]], have the highest number of bells in the world: 77.&lt;br&gt;Modern large carillon edifices have been erected as stand-alone instruments across the world, for instance the [[Netherlands Carillon]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].
The carillon in the Church of St Peter, [[Aberdyfi]], Gwynedd, Wales is often used to play the famous '[[The Bells of Aberdovey (song)|Bells of Aberdovey]]' tune.

==Chimes==
{{Main article|Chime (bell instrument)}}
A carillon-like instrument with fewer than 23 bells is called a ''chime''. American chimes usually have one to one and a half [[diatonic]] octaves. Many chimes play an automated piece of music, such as [[clock chimes]]. Chime bells generally used to lack dynamic variation and [[inner tuning]], or the mathematical balance of a bell's complex sound, to permit use of harmony. Since the 20th century, in Belgium and The Netherlands, clock chime bells have inner tuning and produce complex fully harmonized music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinmdb.com/bells.html Bell Facts &amp;ndash; Bell Chimes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813004017/http://www.martinmdb.com/bells.html |date=2006-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These chimes should not be confused with another musical instrument also called ''chimes'' (or ''[[tubular bell]]s'') nor with a ''[[wind chime]]''.

==Russian Orthodox bells==
{{Main article|Russian Orthodox bell ringing}}
[[File:Bell-ringer yaroslavl 2012.ogv|thumb|Bell-ringer demonstrating Russian chiming on a portable belfry]]
The bells in Russian tradition are sounded by their clappers, attached to ropes; a special system of ropes is developed individually for every belltower. All the ropes are gathered in one place, where the bell-ringer stands. The ropes (usually all ropes) are not pulled, but rather pressed with hands or legs. Since one end of every rope is fixed, and the ropes are kept in tension, a press or even a punch on a rope makes a clapper move.

The Russian [[Tsar Bell]] is the largest extant bell in the world.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Full circle change ringing==
{{Main article|Change ringing}}
[[File:Bells.devon.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|Change ringing in a church in [[Devon]], England]]
[[File:St Bees bells in up position.jpg|thumb|The bells of [[St Bees Priory]], England shown in the "up" position. When being rung they swing through a full circle from mouth upwards round to mouth upwards, and then back again.]]

In English style (see below) [[full circle ringing]] the bells in a church tower are hung so that on each stroke the bell swings through a complete circle; actually a little more than 360 degrees. Between strokes, it briefly sits poised 'upside-down', with the mouth pointed upwards; pulling on a rope connected to a large diameter wheel attached to the bell swings it down and the assembly's own momentum propels the bell back up again on the other side of the swing. Each alternate pull or stroke is identified as either ''handstroke'' or ''backstroke'' - handstroke where the "sally" (the fluffy area covered with wool) is pulled followed by a pull on the plain "tail". At [[East Bergholt]] in the English county of [[Suffolk]], there is a unique set of bells that are not in a tower and are rung full circle by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = East Bergholt and Constable Country: The Bell Cage | url = http://www.eastbergholt-bells.org.uk/ | access-date = 27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the heaviest ring of five bells listed in [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers | publisher = Central Council of Church Bell Ringers | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/home.php | access-date = 27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a tenor of {{long ton||26|0|8}} and a combined weight of {{long ton|4|5|2|24}}

These [[ring of bells|rings of bells]] have relatively few bells, compared with a carillon; six or eight-bell towers are common, with the largest rings in numbering up to sixteen bells. The bells are usually tuned to fall in a [[diatonic scale]] without [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] notes; they are traditionally numbered from the top downwards so that the highest bell (called the ''treble'') is numbered 1 and the lowest bell (the ''tenor'') has the highest number; it is usually the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] note of the bells' scale.

To swing the heavy bells requires a ringer for each bell. Furthermore, the great [[inertia]]s involved mean that a ringer has only a limited ability to retard or accelerate his/her bell's cycle. Along with the relatively limited palette of notes available, the upshot is that such rings of bells do not easily lend themselves to ringing [[melody|melodies]].

[[File:Plain-bob-minor 2.png|180px|right|thumb|This is a diagram of one type of method ringing. Each bell strikes once in every sequence, or change, and repetition is avoided. Here 1 is the highest-pitched, and 6 is the lowest]] 
Instead, a system of ''change ringing'' evolved, probably early in the seventeenth century, which centres on [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[permutations]]. The ringers begin with ''rounds'', which is simply ringing down the scale in numerical order. (On six bells this would be ''123456''.) The ringing then proceeds in a series of ''rows'' or ''changes'', each of which is some permutation of rounds  (for example ''214365'') where no bell changes by more than one position from the preceding row (this is also known as the [[Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm]]).

In ''call change ringing'', one of the ringers (known as the ''Conductor'') calls out to tell the other ringers how to vary their order. The timing of the calls and changes of pattern accompanying them are made at the discretion of the Conductor and so do not necessarily involve a change of ringing sequence at each successive stroke as is characteristic of ''method ringing''. Some ringers, notably in the West of England where there is a strong call-change tradition, ring call changes exclusively but for others, the essence of change ringing is the substantially different method ringing. As of 2015 there are 7,140 English style rings.  The Netherlands, Pakistan, India, and Spain have one each.  The Windward Isles and the Isle of Man have 2 each.  Canada and New Zealand 8 each.  The Channel Isles 10.  Africa as a continent has 13.  Scotland 24, Ireland 37, USA 48, Australia 59 and Wales 227.  The remaining 6,798 (95.2%) are in England (including three mobile rings).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = County Lists from Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers | publisher = Central Council of Church Bell Ringers | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/home.php | accessdate = 12 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method ringing===
{{Main article|Method ringing}}

In ''method'' or ''scientific ringing'' each ringer has memorized a pattern describing his or her bell's course from row to row; taken together, these patterns (along with only occasional ''calls'' made by a conductor) form an [[algorithm]] which cycles through the various available permutations dictated by the number of bells available. There are hundreds of these methods which have been composed over the centuries and all have names, some being very fanciful. Better-known examples such as Plain Bob, Reverse Canterbury, Grandsire and Double Oxford are familiar to most ringers.

Serious ringing always starts and ends with rounds; and it must always be ''true'' — each row must be unique, never repeated. A performance of a few hundred rows or so is called a ''touch''.  A performance of all the possible permutations possible on a set of bells is called an ''extent'', with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bells there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;[[factorial|!]] possible permutations.  With five bells 5! = 120 which takes about 5 minutes.  With seven bells 7! = 5,040 which takes about three hours to ring.  This is the definition of a full peal on 7 (5,000 or more for other numbers of bells.)  Less demanding is the quarter peal of 1,260 changes.  When ringing peals and quarter peals on fewer bells several complete extents are rung consecutively.  When ringing on higher numbers of bells less than a complete extent is rung.  On eight bells the extent is 8!=40,320 which has only been accomplished once, taking nearly nineteen hours.

Ringing in English belltowers became a popular hobby in the late 17th century, in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era; the scientific approach which led to modern method ringing can be traced to two books of that era, ''Tintinnalogia or the Art of Ringing'' (published in 1668 by Richard Duckworth and [[Fabian Stedman]]) and ''Campanalogia'' (also by Stedman; first released 1677; see [[Campanology#Bibliography|Bibliography]]). Today change ringing remains most popular in England but is practiced worldwide; over four thousand peals are rung each year.

[[Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s mystery story, ''[[The Nine Tailors]]'' (1934) centres around change ringing of bells in a [[The Fens|Fenland]] church; her father was a clergyman.

==Ellacombe apparatus==
{{Main article|Ellacombe apparatus}}
[[File:Ellacombe apparatus for 6 bells.jpg|right|thumb|Ellacombe apparatus for 6 bells]]
The '''Ellacombe apparatus''' is an English mechanism devised for chiming by striking stationary bells with external hammers. However it does not have the same sound as [[full circle ringing]] due to the absence of the doppler effect derived from bell rotation and the lack of a damping effect of the clapper after each strike.

It requires only one person to operate. Each hammer is connected by a rope to a fixed frame in the bell-ringing room. When in use the ropes are taut, and pulling one of the ropes towards the player will strike the hammer against the bell. To enable normal full circle ringing on the same bells, the ropes are slackened to allow the hammers to drop away from the moving bells.

The system was devised by Reverend [[Henry Thomas Ellacombe]] of Gloucestershire, who first had such a system installed in [[Bitton]] in 1821. He created the system to make conventional bell-ringers redundant, so churches did not have to tolerate the behaviour of what he thought were unruly bell-ringers.

However, in reality, it required very rare expertise for one person to ring changes. The sound of a chime was a poor substitute for the rich sound of swinging bells, and the apparatus fell out of fashion. Consequently, the Ellacombe apparatus has been disconnected or removed from many towers in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In towers where the apparatus remains intact, it is generally used like a [[Carillon]], but to play  simple tunes, or if expertise exists, to play changes.

==Gamelan==
{{Main article|Gamelan}}
Perhaps the best-known example from outside Europe of an organized system of bells is the [[gamelan]], an [[Indonesia]]n orchestra-like ensemble in which a prominent part is played by a variety of tuned bells, gongs, and metallophones.

It is a resultant of the various F harmonic series partials that can be clearly seen in the spectrum (5, [6], 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, etc.) beside the C-related partials."&lt;/ref&gt; "The bell produces a secondary pitch (f') which lies outside that 'inharmonic series though it is clearly audible when the bell is struck, 'to curiously thrilling and disturbing effect.'"&lt;ref&gt;Downes, Michael (2009). ''Jonathan Harvey: Song offerings and White as jasmine'', p.22. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-6022-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Jonathan Harvey - Winchester Cathedral bell spectrum.mid|Play approximation}} The strike tone is [[middle C]], the hum tone an octave below.]]

The tuning of a bell is completely dependent on its shape. When first cast it is approximately correct, but it is then machined on a tuning lathe to remove metal until it is in tune. This is a very complex exercise which took centuries of empirical practice, and latterly modern acoustic science, to understand.

If a bell is part of a set to be rung or played together, then the initial dominant perceived sound, called the strike note, must be tuned to a designated note of a common scale. In addition each bell will emit harmonics, or partials, which must also be tuned so that these are not discordant with the bell's strike note. This is what Fuller-Maitland writing in ''Grove's dictionary of music and musicians'' meant when he said : "Good tone means that a bell must be in tune with itself."&lt;ref name="Groves"/&gt;

The principal partials are;
* hum note -an octave below the strike note,  
* strike note
* tierce - minor third above the strike note 
* quint - perfect fifth above the strike note
* nominal - octave above the strike note

Further, less dominant, partials include the major, third and perfect fifth in the octave above these.

"Whether a founder tunes the nominal or the strike note makes little difference, however, because the nominal is one of the main partials that determines the tuning of the strike note."&lt;ref name="Physics"&gt;Neville Horner Fletcher, Thomas D. Rossing (1998). ''The Physics of Musical Instruments'', p.685. {{ISBN|978-0-387-98374-5}}. Cites Schoofs et al., 1987 for major-third bell.&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy clapper brings out lower partials (clappers often being about 3% of a bell's mass), while a higher clapper velocity strengthens higher partials (0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s being moderate).  The relative depth of the "bowl" or "cup" part of the bell also determines the number and strength of the partials in order to achieve a desired timbre.

Bells are generally around 80% copper and 20% tin ([[bell metal]]), with the tone varying according to material.

Tone and pitch is also affected by the method in which a bell is struck. Asian large bells are often bowl shaped but lack the lip and are often not free-swinging. Also note the special shape of [[Bianzhong]] bells, allowing two tones. The scaling or size of most bells to each other may be approximated by the equation for circular cylinders:

''f=Ch/D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'',

where ''h'' is thickness, ''D'' is diameter, and ''C'' is a constant determined by the material and the profile.&lt;ref name="Rossing139"&gt;Rossing, Thomas D. (2000). ''Science of Percussion Instruments'', p.139. {{ISBN|978-981-02-4158-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The major third bell===
On the theory that pieces in major keys may better be accommodated, after many unsatisfactory attempts, in the 1980s, using computer modeling for assistance in design by scientists at the Technical University in Eindhoven, bells with a major-third profile were created by the Eijsbouts Bellfoundry in the Netherlands,&lt;ref name="Physics"/&gt; being described as resembling old Coke bottles&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.yale.edu/~douglas-craig/bells/Basic/what-is-a-carillon.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in that they have a bulge around the middle;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.andrelehr.nl/woboek/f_56.htm Major third bell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018230102/http://www.andrelehr.nl/woboek/f_56.htm |date=2007-10-18 }}", ''Andrelehr.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 a design without the bulge was announced.&lt;ref name="Rossing139"/&gt;

==Terminology in physics, philosophy, and fiction==
Backwards time travel would allow for causal loops involving events, information, people or objects whose histories form a closed loop, and thus seem to "come from nowhere."&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The notion of objects or information which are "self-existing" in this way is often viewed as paradoxical,&lt;ref name="Lobo" /&gt; with several authors referring to a causal loop involving information or objects without origin as a  ''bootstrap paradox'',&lt;ref name="Everett"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Everett|first1=Allen|last2=Roman|first2=Thomas|title=Time Travel and Warp Drives|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-22498-5|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dm5xt_XbFyoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA136 136–139]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Visser|first=Matt|title=Lorentzian Wormholes: From Einstein to Hawking|date=1996|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=1-56396-653-0|p=213}} "A second class of logical paradoxes associated with time travel are the bootstrap paradoxes related to information (or objects, or even people?) being created from nothing."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486|edition=1st Scribner hardcover|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZurDFJtAWwC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60 60–62]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toomey2012"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Toomey|first=David|title=The New Time Travelers|date=2012|publisher=W.

An example of a causal loop paradox involving information is given by Everett: suppose a time traveler copies a mathematical proof from a textbook, then travels back in time to meet the mathematician who first published the proof, at a date prior to publication, and allows the mathematician to simply copy the proof. In this case, the information in the proof has no origin.&lt;ref name="Everett"/&gt; A similar example is given in the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' of a time-traveler who copies Beethoven's music from the future and publishes it in Beethoven's time in Beethoven's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Holmes|first=Jonathan|work=Radio Times|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-10/doctor-who-what-is-the-bootstrap-paradox|title=Doctor Who: what is the Bootstrap Paradox?|date=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everett gives the movie ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]'' as an example involving an object with no origin: an old woman gives a watch to a playwright who later travels back in time and meets the same woman when she was young, and gives her the same watch that she will later give to him.&lt;ref name="Everett" /&gt;

Krasnikov writes that these bootstrap paradoxes - information or an object looping through time - are the same; the primary apparent paradox is a physical system evolving into a state in a way that is not governed by its laws.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001"&gt;{{cite|last=Krasnikov|first=S.|year=2001|title=The time travel paradox|journal=Phys.

A 1992 paper by physicists Andrei Lossev and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]] labeled such items without origin as ''Jinn'', with the singular term ''Jinnee''.&lt;ref name="Lossev1992"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Lossev|first=Andrei |last2=Novikov|first2=Igor|date=15 May 1992|title=The Jinn of the time machine: non-trivial self-consistent solutions|journal=Class.

The term ''predestination paradox'' is used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise to mean "a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Okuda|first1=Michael|last2=Okuda|first2=Denise|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia|date=1999|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the phrase was created for a sequence in a 1996 episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' titled "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry J.|last2=Hutzel|first2=Gary|title=Star Trek: The Magic of Tribbles|date=2001|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-7434-4623-2|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W6bvoGUg7G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the phrase had been used previously to refer to belief systems such as [[Calvinism]] and some forms of [[Marxism]] which encouraged followers to strive to produce certain outcomes while at the same time teaching that the outcomes were predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Daniels|first=Robert V.|date=May–June 1960|title=Soviet Power and Marxist Determinism|journal=Problems of Communism|volume=9|p=[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015059418874;view=1up;seq=159 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smeenk and Morgenstern use the term "predestination paradox" to refer specifically to situations in which a time traveler goes back in time to try to prevent some event in the past, but ends up helping to cause that same event.&lt;ref name="smeenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgenstern"&gt;{{cite|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Research/TechReports/TR2013-950/TR2013-950.pdf |title=Foundations of a Formal Theory of Time Travel |last=Morgenstern|first=Leora|year=2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-fulfilling prophecy==
A [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dodds|first=E.R.|year=1966|title=Greece &amp; Rome}} 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 37–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Popper|first1=Karl|title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography|date=1985|publisher=Open Court|location=La Salle, Ill.|isbn=978-0-87548-343-6|edition=Rev.|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' heavily deals with themes of predestination and the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]], where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past.&lt;ref name="Klosterman" /&gt;

''Evolution of the Universe'', p. 169: "The close of time curves does not necessarily imply a violation of causality, since the events along such a closed line may be all 'self-adjusted'—they all affect one another through the closed cycle and follow one another in a self-consistent way."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, "Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves",&lt;ref name="Friedman1990" /&gt; the authors suggested the ''principle of self-consistency,'' which states that ''the only solutions to the laws of physics that can occur locally in the real Universe are those which are globally self-consistent.'' The authors later concluded that time travel need not lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of what type of object was sent to the past.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Physicist [[Joseph Polchinski]] argued that one could avoid questions of free will by considering a potentially paradoxical situation involving a [[billiard ball]] sent back in time. In this situation, the ball is fired into a [[wormhole]] at an angle such that, if it continues along its course, it will exit in the past at just the right angle to hit its earlier self, knocking it off course, which would stop it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne referred to this problem as "Polchinski's paradox".&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt; Two students at Caltech, Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar Klinkhammer, went on to find a solution that avoided any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball would emerge from the future at a different angle than the one that had generated the paradox, and delivers its past self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow changes its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case. Later analysis by Thorne and [[Robert Forward]] showed that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions.&lt;ref name="Thorne" /&gt;

Echeverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Echeverria|1991}}| first=Fernando | last=Echeverria |author2=Gunnar Klinkhammer |author3=Kip Thorne | url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/6469/ | title=Billiard balls in wormhole spacetimes with closed timelike curves: Classical theory | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 44 | year=1991 | issue=4 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.44.1077 | pages=1077|bibcode = 1991PhRvD..44.1077E }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find ''any'' initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Earman | first = John | title = Bangs, Crunches, Whimpers, and Shrieks: Singularities and Acausalities in Relativistic Spacetimes | publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1995 | isbn = 0-19-509591-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|184}} The lack of constraints on initial conditions only applies to spacetime outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime; the constraints on the chronology-violating region might prove to be paradoxical, but this is not yet known.&lt;ref name="Earman1995187188" /&gt;{{Rp|187–188}}

Novikov's views are not widely accepted. Visser views causal loops and Novikov's self-consistency principle as an ad hoc solution, and supposes that there are far more damaging implications of time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| last = Nahin | first =Paul J. | title = Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction | publisher =American Institute of Physics |year= 1999 | isbn = 0-387-98571-9|pp=345–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krasnikov similarly finds no inherent fault in causal loops, but finds other problems with time travel in general relativity.&lt;ref name="Krasnikov2001" /&gt;{{Rp|14–16}}

==Quantum computation with negative delay==

The '''Chord Board''' is a color-coded [[slide rule]] that displays the [[Musical note|note]]s necessary to form or [[Transposition (music)|transpose]] [[Chord (music)|chords]] in [[music]].
The multi-colored chart is a 2-octave [[piano keyboard]] with numbered note positions ~ and a center slide that displays the notes.
Created on the island of [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]] and registered in 1979 by Martin H. Samuel, the original  Chord Board was printed by Datalizer of [[Addison, IL]]. As a practical means of reference, the Chord Board is popular with musicians, singers, songwriters, choirs, composers and arrangers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Pierre Bernard, of Houdah Software in [[Luxembourg]], programmed and published the Chord Board Slide Rule iPhone / iPod Touch App. (that displays and plays the notes and chords) in [[English language|English]] in 2010 and in [[German language|German]] in 2011.

The Chord Board App. may be used as a [[guitar]], [[banjo]], [[ukulele]], [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[violin]], [[viola]] or [[cello]] [[electronic tuner]].

'''Comparative negligence''', or non-absolute [[contributory negligence]] outside the United States, is a partial legal defense that reduces the amount of damages that a plaintiff can recover in a negligence-based claim, based upon the degree to which the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to cause the injury.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the defense is asserted, the factfinder, usually a jury, must decide the degree to which the [[plaintiff]]'s negligence and the combined negligence of all other relevant actors all contributed to cause the plaintiff's damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Victor E.|title=Strict Liability and Comparative Negligence|journal=Tennessee Law Review|date=1974|volume=42|page=171|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/tenn42&amp;div=17&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence that disallows any recovery by a plaintiff whose negligence contributed even minimally to causing the damages.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

== Explanation ==
Prior to the late 1960s, only a few states had adopted the system. When comparative negligence was adopted, three main versions were used. The first was called "pure" comparative negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooter|first1=Robert D.|last2=Ulen|first2=Thomas S.|title=An Economic Case for Comparative Negligence|journal=New York University Law Review|date=1986|volume=61|page=1067|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2289&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff who was 90% to blame for an accident could recover 10% of his losses. (Of course, defendants who suffered injuries in such a case could counter claim and recover 90% of losses from the other party.)

The second and third versions are lumped together in what is called "modified" comparative negligence. One variant allows plaintiffs to recover "only" if the plaintiff's negligence is "not greater than" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must not be more than 50% of the combined negligence of both parties).

The other variant allows plaintiffs to recover "only if" the plaintiff's negligence is "not as great as" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must be less than 50% of the combined negligence). The apparently minor difference between the two modified forms of comparative negligence is thought by lawyers handling such cases to be significant, as juries who ordinarily assign degrees of fault are much less willing to award damages to a plaintiff who is equally at fault than to one who is less at fault than the defendant.

== Contributory negligence doctrine ==
Some states, though, still use the [[contributory negligence]] doctrine to evaluate negligence in a tort. For instance, [[Alabama]], [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]] continue to use contributory negligence.

Neither comparative negligence nor contributory negligence should be confused with [[joint and several liability]], which generally holds each of two or more culpable [[defendants]] responsible for all the damages sustained by a plaintiff. For practical reasons, a plaintiff who faces the defense of comparative negligence may wish to join all potentially culpable defendants in his action since the plaintiff's negligence will be balanced against the combined negligence of all defendants in apportioning damages even if the plaintiff may not be able actually to get compensation from some of them: for example, if an insolvent individual and a major corporation were both negligent in causing plaintiff's harm.

==History==
The Copperbelt University is a Public University established through the Act of Parliament No. 19 of 1987. Prior to 1987, the University existed as a campus of the University of Zambia Federal System with two schools; namely: School of Business and Industrial Studies (SBIS) and School of Environmental Studies (SES). The campus was referred to as the University of Zambia at Ndola (UNZANDO) until 1 December 1987. As of 1 January 1989 the Zambia Institute of Technology (ZIT) was incorporated into the Copperbelt University to form the School of Technology. Since 1987, the University has significantly grown from only two faculties to ten by the end of 2013; it now provides very unique programmes that have not been replicated elsewhere. The total number of students in 2017 was 11,900 and having had over 54,000 students in the past 25 years. The University too is proud of its graduates who are holding key responsibilities in various sectors of the economy within the country and beyond. At its first graduation ceremony in 1992, the University had only 100 students then graduating from the various disciplines but graduating average of 1,500 as at 2017.

In 2014, the School of Medicine received US$1 million in donation from the [[Council of Zambian Jewry]],  of the [[African Jewish Congress]] and the [[World Jewish Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/14643/zambian_jews_support_one_of_zambia_s_medical_schools_with_a_generous_donation Zambian Jews support one of Zambia's medical schools with a generous donation], World Jewish Congress, April 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7762">'''Development studies''' is an interdisciplinary branch of [[social science]]. Development studies is offered as a specialized master's degree in a number of universities, and, less commonly, as an undergraduate degree. It has grown in popularity as a subject of study since the early 1990s, and has been most widely taught and researched in the [[third world]] and in countries with a colonial history, such as the [[UK]], where development studies originated.&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, U. (ed), ''A Radical History of Development Studies: Individuals, Institutions and Ideologies'' – but see ''The Journal of Peasant Studies'' 34/1 (2007) for an alternative view.&lt;/ref&gt; Students of development studies often choose careers in international organisations such as the [[United Nations]], [[World Bank]], [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs), private sector development consultancy firms, [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) bodies and research centers.

==Professional bodies==

Throughout the world, a number of professional bodies for development studies have been founded:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccda.net/about.html About ICCDA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Europe]]: European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI)
* [[Latin America]]: Consejo Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales (CLACSO)
* [[Asia]]: Asian Political and International Studies Association (APISA)
* [[Africa]]: Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) and  Organization for Social Science Research in Eastern and Southern Africa (OSSREA)
* [[Arabic world]]: Arab Institutes and Centers for Economic and Social Development Research (AICARDES)

The common umbrella organisation of these association is the Inter-regional Coordinating Committee of Development Associations (ICCDA). In the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]], the [[Development Studies Association]] is a major source of information for research on and studying in development studies. Its mission is to connect and promote those working on development research.

==History==
The emergence of development studies as an academic discipline in the second half of the twentieth century is in large part due to increasing concern about economic prospects for the [[third world]] after [[decolonisation]]. In the immediate post-war period, [[development economics]], a branch of [[economics]], arose out of previous studies in colonial economics. By the 1960s, an increasing number of development economists felt that economics alone could not fully address issues such as political effectiveness and educational provision.&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, U. (ed), ''A Radical History of Development Studies: Individuals, Institutions and Ideologies''&lt;/ref&gt; Development studies arose as a result of this, initially aiming to integrate ideas of [[politics]] and economics. Since then, it has become an increasingly inter- and multi-disciplinary subject, encompassing [[Development studies#Disciplines of development studies|a variety of social scientific fields]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Lewis F. (2003) ''Theories of Industrial Modernization and Enterprise Development: A Review''. ISR/Google Books, Second revised edition {{ISBN|978-0-906321-26-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the use of political economy analysis- the application of the analytical techniques of economics- to try and assess and explain political and social factors that either enhance or limit development has become increasingly widespread as a way of explaining the success or failure of reform processes. The era of modern development is commonly deemed to have commenced with the [[Harry S. Truman's 1949 inaugural address|inauguration speech]] of [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Rist, G., ''The History of Development: From Western Origins to Global Faith''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Point Four of his speech, with reference to Latin America and other poor nations, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/swearing-in/address/address-by-harry-s-truman-1949|title=Address by Harry S. Truman, 1949|last=|first=|date=|website=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But development studies has since also taken an interest in lessons of past development experiences of Western countries. More recently, the emergency of [[human security]] – a new, people-oriented approach to understanding and addressing global security threats – has led to a growing precognitions of a relationship between security and development. Humans security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues. This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies.

'''Dietary fiber''' or '''roughage''' is the portion of plant-derived food that cannot be completely broken down by [[digestive enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name=bnf&gt;{{cite web |title=Dietary fibre |url=https://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritionscience/nutrients-food-and-ingredients/dietary-fibre.html?limitstart=0 |publisher=British Nutrition Foundation |accessdate=26 July 2018 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two main components:&lt;ref name=USDA-IOM&gt;{{cite web | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, fibre, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients) (2005), Chapter 7: Dietary, Functional and Total fibre| publisher = US Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Library and National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board| url = https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Dietary fiber is defined to be plant components that are not broken down by human digestive enzymes.&lt;ref name=bnf/&gt; In the late 20th century, only [[lignin]] and some [[polysaccharide]]s were known to satisfy this definition, but in the early 21st century, [[resistant starch]] and [[oligosaccharide]]s were included as dietary fiber components.&lt;ref name=bnf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

Official definition of dietary fiber varies among different institutions:

Dietary fiber is found in plants, typically eaten whole, raw or cooked, although fiber can be added to make [[dietary supplement]]s and fiber-rich [[processed foods]]. Grain bran products have the highest fiber contents, such as crude corn bran (79 g per 100 g) and crude wheat bran (43 g per 100 g), which are ingredients for manufactured foods.&lt;ref name=usda28/&gt; Medical authorities, such as the [[Mayo Clinic]], recommend adding fiber-rich products to the [[Standard American Diet]] (SAD) which is rich in processed and artificially sweetened foods, with minimal intake of vegetables and legumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloomfield|first1=HE|last2=Kane|first2=R|last3=Koeller|first3=E|last4=Greer|first4=N|last5=MacDonald|first5=R|last6=Wilt|first6=T|title=Benefits and Harms of the Mediterranean Diet Compared to Other Diets|journal=VA Evidence-based Synthesis Program Reports.|date=November 2015|pmid=27559560|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0089086/pdf/PubMedHealth_PMH0089086.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition and healthy eating: Fiber|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983?pg=2|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=18 November 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plant sources of fiber ===

Some plants contain significant amounts of soluble and insoluble fiber. For example, [[plum]]s and [[prune]]s have a thick skin covering a juicy pulp. The skin is a source of insoluble fiber, whereas soluble fiber is in the pulp. Grapes also contain a fair amount of fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stacewicz-Sapuntzakis M, Bowen PE, Hussain EA, Damayanti-Wood BI, Farnsworth NR |title=Chemical composition and potential health effects of prunes: a functional food? |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=251–86 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11401245 |doi=10.1080/20014091091814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soluble fiber''' is found in varying quantities in all plant foods, including:
* [[legume]]s ([[pea]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[lupin]]s and other [[bean]]s)
* [[oat]]s, [[rye]], [[Salvia hispanica|chia]], and [[barley]]
* some [[fruit]]s (including [[ficus|figs]], [[avocado]]s, [[plum]]s, [[prune]]s, [[berry|berries]], ripe [[banana]]s, and the skin of [[apple]]s, [[quince]]s and [[pear]]s)
* certain [[vegetable]]s such as [[broccoli]], [[carrot]]s, and [[Jerusalem artichoke]]s
* [[root tuber]]s and [[root vegetable]]s such as [[sweet potato]]es and [[onion]]s (skins of these are sources of insoluble fiber also)
* [[psyllium seed husks]] (a [[mucilage]] soluble fiber) and [[Flax#Flax seeds|flax seeds]]
* [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], with [[almonds]] being the highest in dietary fiber

Sources of '''insoluble fiber''' include:
* [[whole grain]] foods
* [[wheat]] and [[Maize|corn]] [[bran]]
* [[legume]]s such as beans and peas
* nuts and [[seed]]s
* [[potato]] skins
* [[lignan]]s
* vegetables such as [[green bean]]s, [[cauliflower]], [[zucchini]] (courgette), [[celery]], and [[nopal]]
* some fruits including [[avocado]], and unripe [[banana]]s
* the skins of some fruits, including [[kiwifruit]], [[grape]]s and [[tomato]]es&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarado A, Pacheco-Delahaye E, Hevia P |title=Value of a tomato byproduct as a source of dietary fiber in rats |journal=Plant Foods Hum Nutr. |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=335–48 |year=2001 |pmid=11678439 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0921-9668&amp;volume=56&amp;page=335 |doi=10.1023/A:1011855316778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiber supplements===
These are a few example forms of fiber that have been sold as supplements or food additives. These may be marketed to consumers for nutritional purposes,  treatment of various [[gastrointestinal disorder]]s, and for such possible health benefits as lowering [[cholesterol]] levels, reducing risk of [[colon cancer]], and losing weight.

====Inulins====
{{Main|Inulin}}

Chemically defined as [[oligosaccharide]]s occurring naturally in most plants, inulins have nutritional value as [[carbohydrates]], or more specifically as [[fructan]]s, a [[polymer]] of the natural plant sugar, [[fructose]]. Inulin is typically extracted by manufacturers from enriched plant sources such as [[chicory]] roots or [[Jerusalem artichoke]]s for use in prepared foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaur N, Gupta AK |title=Applications of inulin and oligofructose in health and nutrition |journal=J Biosci |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=703–14 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12571376 |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/dec2002/703.pdf |format=PDF|doi=10.1007/BF02708379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subtly sweet, it can be used to replace sugar, fat, and flour, is often used to improve the flow and mixing qualities of powdered [[nutritional supplements]], and has significant potential health value as a [[prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] fermentable fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roberfroid MB |title=Inulin-type fructans: functional food ingredients |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=137 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=2493S–2502S |pmid=17951492 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17951492 |date= 1 November 2007 |doi=10.1093/jn/137.11.2493S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inulin is advantageous because it contains 25–30% the [[food energy]] of sugar or other carbohydrates and 10–15% the food energy of fat. As a prebiotic fermentable fiber, its metabolism by [[gut flora]] yields short-chain fatty acids ([[#Short-chain fatty acids|see below]]) which increase absorption of [[calcium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abrams S, Griffin I, Hawthorne K, Liang L, Gunn S, Darlington G, Ellis K | title = A combination of prebiotic short- and long-chain inulin-type fructans enhances calcium absorption and bone mineralization in young adolescents | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 471–76 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16087995 | doi=10.1093/ajcn.82.2.471}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[magnesium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coudray C, Demigné C, Rayssiguier Y | title = Effects of dietary fibers on magnesium absorption in animals and humans | journal = J Nutr | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12514257| doi = 10.1093/jn/133.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tako E, Glahn RP, Welch RM, Lei X, Yasuda K, Miller DD | title = Dietary inulin affects the expression of intestinal enterocyte iron transporters, receptors and storage protein and alters the microbiota in the pig intestine | journal = Br J Nutr | issue = Sep | pages = 1–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17868492 | volume = 99 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114507825128}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting from upregulation of mineral-transporting [[gene]]s and their [[membrane transport proteins]] within the colon wall. Among other potential beneficial effects noted above, inulin promotes an increase in the mass and health of intestinal ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' and ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'' populations.

Inulin's primary disadvantage is its tolerance. As a soluble fermentable fiber, it is quickly and easily fermented within the intestinal tract, which may cause gas and digestive distress at doses higher than 15 grams/day in most people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grabitske|first1=Hollie A. |last2=Slavin |first2=Joanne L. |title=Gastrointestinal Effects of Low-Digestible Carbohydrates|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition |date=2009 |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=327–60 |doi=10.1080/10408390802067126 |pmid=19234944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with digestive diseases have benefited from removing [[fructose]] and inulin from their diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepherd |first1=Susan J. |last2=Gibson |first2=Peter R. |title=Fructose Malabsorption and Symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Guidelines for Effective Dietary Management |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |date=2006 |volume=106 |issue=10 |pages=1631–39 |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2006.07.010 |pmid=17000196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While clinical studies have shown changes in the [[microbiota]] at lower levels of [[inulin]] intake, some of the health effects require higher than 15 grams per day to achieve the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liber |first1=A. |last2=Szajewska |first2=H. |title=Effects of inulin-type fructans on appetite, energy intake, and body weight in children and adults: systematic review of randomized controlled trials|journal=Ann Nutr Metab |date=2013 |volume=63 |issue=1–2 |pages=42–54 |doi=10.1159/000350312 |pmid=23887189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vegetable gums====

[[Natural gum|Vegetable gum]] fiber supplements are relatively new to the market. Often sold as a powder, vegetable gum fibers dissolve easily with no aftertaste. In preliminary clinical trials, they have proven effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parisi GC, Zilli M, Miani MP, Carrara M, Bottona E, Verdianelli G, Battaglia G, Desideri S, Faedo A, Marzolino C, Tonon A, Ermani M, Leandro G | title = High-fiber diet supplementation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): a multicenter, randomized, open trial comparison between wheat bran diet and partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) | journal = Dig Dis Sci | volume = 47 | issue = 8 | pages = 1697–704 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12184518 | doi = 10.1023/A:1016419906546}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of vegetable gum fibers are [[guar gum]] and [[gum arabic]].

==Activity in the gut==

Many molecules that are considered to be "dietary fiber" are so because humans lack the necessary enzymes to split the [[glycosidic bond]] and they reach the large intestine. Many foods contain varying types of dietary fibers, all of which contribute to health in different ways.

Dietary fibers make three primary contributions: bulking, viscosity and fermentation.&lt;ref name=Gallaher&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallaher|first=Daniel D. |title=Dietary Fiber |year=2006 |publisher=ILSI Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-57881-199-1 |pages=102–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different fibers have different effects, suggesting that a variety of dietary fibers contribute to overall health. Some fibers contribute through one primary mechanism. For instance, cellulose and wheat bran provide excellent bulking effects, but are minimally fermented. Alternatively, many dietary fibers can contribute to health through more than one of these mechanisms. For instance, psyllium provides bulking as well as viscosity.

Bulking fibers can be soluble (i.e., psyllium) or insoluble (i.e., cellulose and hemicellulose). They absorb water and can significantly increase stool weight and regularity. Most bulking fibers are not fermented or are minimally fermented throughout the intestinal tract.&lt;ref name=Gallaher/&gt;

Viscous fibers thicken the contents of the intestinal tract and may attenuate the absorption of sugar, reduce sugar response after eating, and reduce lipid absorption (notably shown with cholesterol absorption). Their use in food formulations is often limited to low levels, due to their viscosity and thickening effects. Some viscous fibers may also be partially or fully fermented within the intestinal tract (guar gum, beta-glucan, glucomannan and pectins), but some viscous fibers are minimally or not fermented (modified cellulose such as methylcellulose and psyllium).&lt;ref name=Gallaher/&gt;

Fermentable fibers are consumed by the [[gut flora|microbiota]] within the large intestines, mildly increasing fecal bulk and producing [[short-chain fatty acids]] as byproducts with wide-ranging physiological activities (discussion below). [[Resistant starch]], [[inulin]], [[fructooligosaccharide]] and [[galactooligosaccharide]] are dietary fibers which are fully fermented. These include insoluble as well as soluble fibers. This fermentation influences the expression of many genes within the large intestine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keenan |first1=M. J. |last2=Martin |first2=R. J.|last3=Raggio |first3=A.

Dietary fibers can change the nature of the contents of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and can change how other nutrients and chemicals are absorbed through bulking and viscosity.&lt;ref name=USDA-IOM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastwood/&gt; Some types of soluble fibers bind to [[bile acids]] in the small intestine, making them less likely to re-enter the body; this in turn lowers [[cholesterol]] levels in the blood from the actions of [[cytochrome P450]]-mediated oxidation of cholesterol.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

Insoluble fiber is associated with reduced risk of diabetes, but the mechanism by which this is achieved is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weickert MO, Pfeiffer AF |title=Metabolic effects of dietary fiber consumption and prevention of diabetes |journal=J Nutr |volume=138 |issue=3 |pages=439–42 |year=2008 |pmid=18287346 |doi=10.1093/jn/138.3.439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One type of insoluble dietary fiber, [[resistant starch]], may increase insulin sensitivity in healthy people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=M.

===Physicochemical properties===
Dietary fiber has distinct [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties. Most semi-solid foods, fiber and fat are a combination of gel matrices which are hydrated or collapsed with microstructural elements, globules, solutions or encapsulating walls. Fresh fruit and vegetables are cellular materials.&lt;ref&gt;Hermansson AM.

* The cells of cooked potatoes and legumes are gels filled with gelatinized starch granules. The cellular structures of fruits and vegetables are foams with a closed cell geometry filled with a gel, surrounded by cell walls which are composites with an amorphous matrix strengthened by complex carbohydrate fibers.

===Dietary fiber in the upper gastrointestinal tract===

Following a meal, the stomach and upper gastrointestinal contents consist of
* food compounds
* complex lipids/[[micelles|micellar]]/[[aqueous]]/[[hydrocolloid]] and [[hydrophobic]] phases
* [[hydrophilic]] phases
* solid, liquid, colloidal and gas bubble phases.&lt;ref name=Eastwood_a&gt;Eastwood MA. The physiological effect of dietary fiber: an update. Annual Review Nutrition. 1992. 12:19–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Micelle]]s are colloid-sized clusters of molecules which form in conditions as those above, similar to the critical micelle concentration of detergents.&lt;ref name=Carey&gt;Carey MC, Small DM and Bliss CM. Lipid digestion and Absorption. Annual Review of Physiology. 1983. 45:651–77.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the upper gastrointestinal tract, these compounds consist of bile acids and di- and monoacyl [[glycerol]]s which solubilize [[triacylglycerol]]s and cholesterol.&lt;ref name=Carey/&gt;

Two mechanisms bring nutrients into contact with the epithelium:
# intestinal contractions create turbulence; and
# convection currents direct contents from the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] to the epithelial surface.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite journal | author = Edwards CA, Johnson IT, Read NW | year = 1988 | title = Do viscous polysaccharides reduce absorption by inhibiting diffusion or convection? | url = | journal = Eur J Clin Nutr | volume = 42 | issue = 4| pages = 307–12 | pmid = 2840277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The multiple physical phases in the intestinal tract slow the rate of absorption compared to that of the suspension solvent alone.
# Nutrients diffuse through the thin, relatively unstirred layer of fluid adjacent to the epithelium.
# Immobilizing of nutrients and other chemicals within complex polysaccharide molecules affects their release and subsequent absorption from the small intestine, an effect influential on the [[glycemic index]].&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt;
# Molecules begin to interact as their concentration increases. During absorption, water must be absorbed at a rate commensurate with the absorption of solutes. The transport of actively and passively absorbed nutrients across epithelium is affected by the unstirred water layer covering the [[microvillus]] membrane.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt;
# The presence of mucus or fiber, e.g., pectin or guar, in the unstirred layer may alter the viscosity and solute diffusion coefficient.&lt;ref name=Eastwood_a/&gt;

Adding viscous polysaccharides to carbohydrate meals can reduce [[post-prandial]] blood glucose concentrations. Wheat and maize but not oats modify glucose absorption, the rate being dependent upon the particle size. The reduction in absorption rate with guar gum may be due to the increased resistance by viscous solutions to the convective flows created by intestinal contractions.

Dietary fiber interacts with pancreatic and enteric enzymes and their substrates. Human pancreatic enzyme activity is reduced when incubated with most fiber sources. Fiber may affect [[amylase]] activity and hence the rate of hydrolysis of starch. The more viscous polysaccharides extend the mouth-to-[[cecum]] transit time; guar, [[tragacanth]] and pectin being slower than wheat bran.&lt;ref&gt;Schneeman BO, Gallacher D. Effects of dietary fibre on digestive enzyme activity and bile acids in the small intestine. Proc Soc Exp Biol Med 1985; 180 409–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiber in the colon===
The colon may be regarded as two organs,
# the right side ([[cecum]] and [[Large intestine#Ascending colon|ascending colon]]), a [[Fermentation|fermenter]].&lt;ref&gt;Hellendoorn EW 1983 Fermentation as the principal cause of the physiological activity of indigestible food residue. In: Spiller GA (ed) ''Topics in dietary fiber research''. Plenum Press, New York, pp. 127–68&lt;/ref&gt; The right side of the colon is involved in nutrient salvage so that dietary fiber, resistant starch, fat and protein are utilized by bacteria and the end-products absorbed for use by the body
# the left side ([[Large intestine#Transverse colon|transverse]], [[Large intestine#Descending colon|descending]], and [[Large intestine#Sigmoid colon|sigmoid colon]]), affecting continence.
The presence of bacteria in the colon produces an ‘organ’ of intense, mainly reductive, metabolic activity, whereas the liver is oxidative.
The substrates utilized by the cecum have either passed along the entire intestine or are biliary excretion products.
The effects of dietary fiber in the colon are on
# bacterial fermentation of some dietary fibers
# thereby an increase in bacterial mass
# an increase in bacterial enzyme activity
# changes in the water-holding capacity of the fiber residue after fermentation
Enlargement of the cecum is a common finding when some dietary fibers are fed and this is now believed to be normal physiological adjustment. Such an increase may be due to a number of factors, prolonged cecal residence of the fiber, increased bacterial mass, or increased bacterial end-products.
Some non-absorbed carbohydrates, e.g. pectin, gum arabic, oligosaccharides and resistant starch, are fermented to short-chain fatty acids (chiefly acetic, propionic and n-butyric), and carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Almost all of these short-chain fatty acids will be absorbed from the colon. This means that fecal short-chain fatty acid estimations do not reflect cecal and colonic fermentation, only the efficiency of absorption, the ability of the fiber residue to sequestrate short-chain fatty acids, and the continued fermentation of fiber around the colon, which presumably will continue until the substrate is exhausted.
The production of short-chain fatty acids has several possible actions on the gut mucosa. All of the short-chain fatty acids are readily absorbed by the colonic mucosa, but only acetic acid reaches the systemic circulation in appreciable amounts. Butyric acid appears to be used as a fuel by the colonic mucosa as the preferred energy source for colonic cells.

===Dietary fiber and cholesterol metabolism===
Dietary fiber may act on each phase of ingestion, digestion, absorption and excretion to affect cholesterol metabolism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown L, Rosner B, Willett WW, Sacks FM | year = 1999 | title = Cholesterol-lowering effects of dietary fiber: a meta-analysis | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 69 | pages = 30–42 | pmid = 9925120 | issue = 1|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/69/1/30.full| doi = 10.1093/ajcn/69.1.30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the following:

# Caloric energy of foods through a bulking effect
# Slowing of gastric emptying time
# A glycemic index type of action on absorption
# A slowing of bile acid absorption in the [[ileum]] so bile acids escape through to the [[cecum]]
# Altered or increased bile acid metabolism in the cecum
# Indirectly by absorbed short-chain fatty acids, especially propionic acid, resulting from fiber fermentation affecting the cholesterol metabolism in the liver.
# Binding of bile acids to fiber or bacteria in the cecum with increased fecal loss from the entero-hepatic circulation.
An important action of some fibers is to reduce the reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum and hence the amount and type of bile acid and fats reaching the colon. A reduction in the reabsorption of bile acid from the ileum has several direct effects.
# Bile acids may be trapped within the lumen of the ileum either because of a high luminal viscosity or because of binding to a dietary fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eastwood MA, Hamilton D | year = 1968 | title = Studies on the adsorption of bile salts to non-absorbed components of diet | journal = Biochim. Biophys. Acta | volume = 152 | pages = 159–66|doi=10.1016/0005-2760(68)90018-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Lignin in fiber adsorbs bile acids, but the unconjugated form of the bile acids are adsorbed more than the conjugated form. In the ileum where bile acids are primarily absorbed the bile acids are predominantly conjugated.
# The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids may be altered and there is an increased flow of bile acids to the cecum, where they are deconjugated and 7alpha-dehydroxylated.
# These water-soluble form, bile acids e.g., deoxycholic and lithocholic are adsorbed to dietary fiber and an increased fecal loss of sterols, dependent in part on the amount and type of fiber.
# A further factor is an increase in the bacterial mass and activity of the ileum as some fibers e.g., pectin are digested by bacteria. The bacterial mass increases and cecal bacterial activity increases.
# The enteric loss of bile acids results in increased synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol which in turn reduces body cholesterol.
The fibers that are most effective in influencing sterol metabolism (e.g. pectin) are fermented in the colon. It is therefore unlikely that the reduction in body cholesterol is due to adsorption to this fermented fiber in the colon.
# There might be alterations in the end-products of bile acid bacterial metabolism or the release of short chain fatty acids which are absorbed from the colon,  return to the liver in the portal vein and modulate either the synthesis of cholesterol or its catabolism to bile acids.
# The prime mechanism whereby fiber influences cholesterol metabolism is through bacteria binding bile acids in the colon after the initial deconjugation and dehydroxylation. The sequestered bile acids are then excreted in feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Gillissen and Eastwood | year = 1995 | title = Taurocholic acid adsorption during non-starch polysaccharide fermentation: an in vitro study | journal = British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 74 | pages =  221–27 | doi = 10.1079/BJN19950125 | last2 = Eastwood | first2 = Martin A. | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Fermentable fibers e.g., pectin will increase the bacterial mass in the colon by virtue of their providing a medium for bacterial growth. 
# Other fibers, e.g., [[gum arabic]], act as [[Food additive#Categories|stabilizers]] and cause a significant decrease in serum cholesterol without increasing fecal bile acid excretion.

===Dietary fiber and fecal weight===
Feces consist of a plasticine-like material, made up of water, bacteria, lipids, sterols, mucus and fiber.

# Feces are 75% water; bacteria make a large contribution to the dry weight, the residue being unfermented fiber and excreted compounds.
# Fecal output may vary over a range of between 20 and 280 g over 24 hours. The amount of feces egested a day varies for any one individual over a period of time.
# Of dietary constituents, only dietary fiber increases fecal weight.
Water is distributed in the colon in three ways:
# Free water which can be absorbed from the colon.
# Water that is incorporated into bacterial mass.
# Water that is bound by fiber.
Fecal weight is dictated by:
# the holding of water by the residual dietary fiber after fermentation.
# the bacterial mass.
# There may also be an added osmotic effect of products of bacterial fermentation on fecal mass.
Wheat bran is minimally fermented and binds water and when added to the diet increases fecal weight in a predictable linear manner and decreases intestinal transit time. The particle size of the fiber is all-important, coarse wheat bran being more effective than fine wheat bran. The greater the water-holding capacity of the bran, the greater the effect on fecal weight. For most healthy individuals, an increase in wet fecal weight, depending on the particle size of the bran, is generally of the order of 3–5 g/g fiber.
The fermentation of some fibers results in an increase in the bacterial content and possibly fecal weight. Other fibers, e.g. pectin, are fermented and have no effect on stool weight.

==Effects of fiber intake==
Research has shown that fiber may benefit health in several different ways. Lignin and probably related materials that are resistant to enzymatic degradation, diminish the nutritional value of foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.54.031902.134938 | title = Ligninbiosynthesis | year = 2003 | last1 = Boerjan | first1 = Wout | last2 = Ralph | first2 = John | last3 = Baucher | first3 = Marie | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 54 | pages = 519–46 | pmid = 14503002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
A study of 388,000 adults ages 50 to 71 for nine years found that the highest consumers of fiber were 22% less likely to die over this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Arch Intern Med | date = 14 February 2011 |vauthors=Park Y, Subar AF, Hollenbeck A, Schatzkin A | title = Dietary fiber intake and mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study | pmid = 21321288 | doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.18| volume = 171| issue = 12| pages = 1061–68 | pmc=3513325}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to lower risk of death from heart disease, adequate consumption of fiber-containing foods, especially grains, was also associated with reduced incidence of infectious and respiratory illnesses, and, particularly among males, reduced risk of [[cancer]]-related death.

An experiment designed with a large sample and conducted by NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study studied the correlation between fiber intake and colorectal cancer. The analytic cohort consisted of 291,988 men and 197,623 women aged 50–71 years. Diet was assessed with a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire at baseline in 1995–1996; 2,974 incident colorectal cancer cases were identified during five years of follow-up. The result was that total fiber intake was not associated with colorectal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|year=2007|volume=85|issue=5|pages=1353–60|title=Dietary fiber and whole-grain consumption in relation to colorectal cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study|authors=Schatzkin A, Mouw T, Park Y, Subar AF, Kipnis V, Hollenbeck A, Leitzmann MF, Thompson FE|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/5/1353.long|pmid=17490973|doi=10.1093/ajcn/85.5.1353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many researchers believe that dietary fiber intake reduces risk of colon cancer, one study conducted by researchers at the [[Harvard School of Medicine]] of over 88,000 women did not show a statistically significant relationship between higher fiber consumption and lower rates of colorectal cancer or adenomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Fuchs CS, Giovannucci EL, Colditz GA, etal |title=Dietary fiber and the risk of colorectal cancer and adenoma in women |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=340 |issue=3 |pages=169–76 |date=January 1999 |pmid=9895396 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=9895396&amp;promo=ONFLNS19 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199901213400301}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, a 2010 study of 58,279 men found no relationship between dietary fiber and colorectal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simons CCJM |title=Bowel Movement and Constipation Frequencies and the Risk of Colorectal Cancer Among Men in the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer |journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=172 |issue=12 |pages=1404–14 |date=October 2010 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/10/27/aje.kwq307.full |doi=10.1093/aje/kwq307 |pmid=20980354|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary fiber and obesity==
Dietary fiber has many functions in diet, one of which may be to aid in energy intake control and reduced risk for development of obesity. The role of dietary fiber in energy intake regulation and obesity development is related to its unique physical and chemical properties that aid in early signals of [[satiety|satiation]] and enhanced or prolonged signals of [[satiety]]. Early signals of satiation may be induced through cephalic- and gastric-phase responses related to the bulking effects of dietary fiber on energy density and palatability, whereas the viscosity-producing effects of certain fibers may enhance satiety through intestinal-phase events related to modified gastrointestinal function and subsequent delay in fat absorption. In general, fiber-rich diets, whether achieved through fiber supplementation or incorporation of high fiber foods into meals, have a reduced energy density compared with high fat diets. This is related to fiber’s ability to add bulk and weight to the diet. There are also indications that women may be more sensitive to dietary manipulation with fiber than men. The relationship of body weight status and fiber effect on energy intake suggests that obese individuals may be more likely to reduce food intake with dietary fiber inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Britt Burton-Freeman, Amgen, Incorporated, Thousand Oaks, CA. "Symposium: Dietary Composition and Obesity: Do We Need to Look beyond Dietary Fat?"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guidelines on fiber intake==

Current recommendations from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], [[Institute of Medicine]], state that for Adequate Intake, adult men ages 14–50 consume 38 grams of dietary fiber per day, men 51 and older 30 grams, women ages 19–50 to consume 25 grams per day, women 51 and older 21 grams.&lt;ref name=USDA-IOM/&gt;&lt;ref name=OregonState&gt;[http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/phytochemicals/fiber/ Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The AND ([[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]], previously ADA) recommends a minimum of 20–35 g/day for a healthy adult depending on calorie intake (e.g., a 2000 Cal/8400 kJ diet should include 25 g of fiber per day). The AND's recommendation for children is that intake should equal age in years plus 5 g/day (e.g., a 4 year old should consume 9 g/day). No guidelines have yet been established for the elderly or very ill. Patients with current [[constipation]], [[vomiting]], and [[abdominal pain]] should see a physician. Certain bulking agents are not commonly recommended with the prescription of [[opioid]]s because the slow transit time mixed with larger stools may lead to severe constipation, pain, or obstruction.

As of 2018, the [[British Nutrition Foundation]] has recommended a minimum fiber intake of 30 grams per day for healthy adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/nbu.12141|title=30 g of fibre a day: An achievable recommendation?|journal=Nutrition Bulletin|volume=40|issue=2|pages=118–129|year=2015|last1=Hooper|first1=B|last2=Spiro|first2=A|last3=Stanner|first3=S|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nbu.12141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiber recommendations===

====United States====

On average, North Americans consume less than 50% of the dietary fiber levels recommended for good health. In the preferred food choices of today's youth, this value may be as low as 20%, a factor considered by experts as contributing to the [[obesity]] levels seen in many [[developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Suter PM |title=Carbohydrates and dietary fiber |journal=Handb Exp Pharmacol. |issue=170 |pages=231–61 |year=2005 |pmid=16596802 |doi=10.1007/3-540-27661-0_8 |volume=170 |series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology |isbn=978-3-540-22569-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the growing scientific evidence for physiological benefits of increased fiber intake, regulatory agencies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) of the United States have given approvals to food products making health claims for fiber. The FDA classifies which ingredients qualify as being "fiber", and requires for product labeling that a physiological benefit is gained by adding the fiber ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/10/23/558761819/the-fda-will-decide-if-these-26-ingredients-count-as-fiber|title=The FDA Will Decide Whether 26 Ingredients Count As Fiber|publisher=National Public Radio|author=Aubrey, Allison|date=23 October 2017|accessdate=2017-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, the FDA  approved [[health claim]]s for qualified fiber products to display labeling that regular consumption may reduce [[blood cholesterol]] levels &amp;ndash; which can lower the risk of [[coronary heart disease]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.77 Health claims: fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease.] Electronic Code of Federal Regulations: US Government Printing Office, current as of 20 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; and also reduce the risk of some types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.78 Health claims: fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer.] Electronic Code of Federal Regulations: US Government Printing Office, current as of 20 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Viscous fiber sources gaining FDA approval are:
* [[Psyllium]] seed husk (7&amp;nbsp;grams per day)
* [[Beta-glucan]] from [[oat bran]], whole [[oat]]s, [[oatrim]], or [[rolled oats]] (3&amp;nbsp;grams per day)
* Beta-glucan from whole grain or dry-milled [[barley]] (3&amp;nbsp;grams per day)

Other examples of bulking fiber sources used in functional foods and supplements include [[cellulose]], [[guar gum]] and [[xanthan gum]]. Other examples of fermentable fiber sources (from plant foods or biotechnology) used in functional foods and supplements include [[resistant starch]], [[inulin]], [[fructan]]s, fructooligosaccharides, oligo- or polysaccharides, and resistant [[dextrin]]s, which may be partially or fully fermented.

====United Kingdom====
In 2018, the British Nutrition Foundation issued a statement to define dietary fiber more concisely and list the potential health benefits established to date, while increasing its recommended daily intake to 30 grams for healthy adults.&lt;ref name=bnf/&gt; Statement: 'Dietary fibre' has been used as a collective term for a complex mixture of substances with different chemical and physical properties which exert different types of physiological effects.

The use of certain analytical methods to quantify dietary fiber by nature of its indigestibility results in many other indigestible components being isolated along with the [[carbohydrate]] components of dietary fiber. These components include resistant starches and [[oligosaccharide]]s along with other substances that exist within the plant cell structure and contribute to the material that passes through the digestive tract. Such components are likely to have physiological effects.

Diets naturally high in fiber can be considered to bring about several main physiological consequences:&lt;ref name=bnf/&gt;
* increases [[fecal]] bulk and helps prevent [[constipation]] by decreasing fecal transit time in the [[large intestine]]
* improves [[human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] health
* improves [[glucose tolerance]] and the [[insulin]] response following a meal
* increases [[colonic]] [[fermentation]] and [[short-chain fatty acid]] production
* positively modulates colonic [[microflora]]
* reduces [[hyperlipidemia]], [[hypertension]], and other [[coronary heart disease]] risk factors
* increases [[satiety]] and hence may contribute to weight management

Fiber is defined by its physiological impact, with many heterogenous types of fibers. Some fibers may primarily impact one of these benefits (i.e., cellulose increases fecal bulking and prevents constipation), but many fibers impact more than one of these benefits (i.e., [[resistant starch]] increases bulking, increases colonic fermentation, positively modulates colonic microflora and increases satiety and insulin sensitivity).&lt;ref name=lockyer/&gt;&lt;ref name=keenan/&gt; The beneficial effects of high fiber diets are the summation of the effects of the different types of fiber present in the diet and also other components of such diets.

Defining fiber physiologically allows recognition of indigestible carbohydrates with structures and physiological properties similar to those of naturally occurring dietary fibers.&lt;ref name=bnf/&gt;

==Fiber and fermentation==
The [[American Association of Cereal Chemists]] has defined soluble fiber this way:
''"the edible parts of plants or similar carbohydrates resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaccnet.org/DietaryFiber/pdfs/dietfiber.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040750/http://www.aaccnet.org/DietaryFiber/pdfs/dietfiber.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this definition:

;Edible parts of plants
:indicates that some parts of a plant we eat—skin, pulp, seeds, stems, leaves, roots—contain fiber. Both insoluble and soluble sources are in those plant components.
;Carbohydrates
: complex carbohydrates, such as long-chained sugars also called [[starch]], [[oligosaccharide]]s, or [[polysaccharide]]s, are sources of soluble fermentable fiber.
;Resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine
:foods providing nutrients are digested by [[gastric acid]] and [[digestive enzymes]] in the stomach and small intestine where the nutrients are released then absorbed through the intestinal wall for transport via the blood throughout the body. A food resistant to this process is undigested, as insoluble and soluble fibers are. They pass to the large intestine only affected by their absorption of water (insoluble fiber) or dissolution in water (soluble fiber).
;Complete or partial '''fermentation''' in the large intestine
: the large intestine comprises a segment called the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] within which additional nutrient absorption occurs through the process of fermentation. Fermentation occurs by the action of colonic bacteria on the food mass, producing gases and short-chain fatty acids. It is these short-chain fatty acids—[[butyric acid|butyric]], [[acetic acid|acetic]] (ethanoic), [[propionic acid|propionic]], and [[valeric acid|valeric]] acids—that scientific evidence is revealing to have significant health properties.&lt;ref name=Wong&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wong JM, de Souza R, Kendall CW, Emam A, Jenkins DJ |title=Colonic health: fermentation and short chain fatty acids |journal=J Clin Gastroenterol. |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=235–43 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16633129 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00004836-200603000-00015 |doi=10.1097/00004836-200603000-00015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of fermentation, shorter-chain carbohydrates (a type of fiber found in legumes) cannot be digested, but are changed via fermentation in the colon into short-chain [[fatty acid]]s and gases (which are typically expelled as [[flatulence]]).

According to a 2002 journal article,&lt;ref name=tungland&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tungland BC, Meyer D|title=Nondigestible oligo- and polysaccharides (dietary fiber): their physiology and role in human health and food|journal=Comp Rev Food Sci Food Safety|volume=3|issue=3|pages=73–92|year=2002|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2002.tb00009.x/epdf|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2002.tb00009.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
fiber compounds with partial or low fermentability include:
* [[cellulose]], a [[polysaccharide]]
* [[hemicellulose]], a polysaccharide
* [[lignan]]s, a group of [[phytoestrogen]]s
* plant [[wax]]es

fiber compounds with high fermentability include:
* [[resistant starch]]es
* [[beta-glucans]], a group of polysaccharides
* [[pectin]]s, a group of [[heteropolysaccharide]]s
* [[natural gum]]s, a group of polysaccharides
* [[inulin]]s, a group of polysaccharides
* [[oligosaccharide]]s

==Short-chain fatty acids==

When fermentable fiber is fermented, [[short-chain fatty acid]]s (SCFA) are produced. SCFAs are involved in numerous physiological processes promoting health, including:&lt;ref name=Wong/&gt;
* stabilize blood [[glucose]] levels by acting on pancreatic [[insulin]] release and liver control of [[glycogen]] breakdown
* stimulate [[gene expression]] of [[glucose transporter]]s in the [[intestinal mucosa]], regulating glucose absorption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Drozdowski LA, Dixon WT, McBurney MI, Thomson AB |title=Short-chain fatty acids and total parenteral nutrition affect intestinal gene expression |journal=J Parenter Enteral Nutr. |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=145–50 |year=2002 |pmid=12005453 |url=http://pen.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12005453 |doi=10.1177/0148607102026003145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* provide nourishment of colonocytes, particularly by the SCFA butyrate
* suppress [[cholesterol]] synthesis by the liver and reduce blood levels of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]] and [[triglyceride]]s responsible for [[atherosclerosis]]
* lower colonic [[pH]] (i.e., raises the acidity level in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]) which protects the lining from formation of [[colonic polyp]]s and increases absorption of [[dietary mineral]]s
* stimulate production of [[T helper cell]]s, [[Antibody|antibodies]], [[leukocyte]]s, [[cytokine]]s, and [[lymph]] mechanisms having crucial roles in [[immune]] protection
* improve barrier properties of the colonic [[mucosal]] layer, inhibiting [[inflammation|inflammatory]] and [[adhesion]] irritants, contributing to immune functions

SCFAs that are absorbed by the colonic mucosa pass through the colonic wall into the [[portal circulation]] (supplying the [[liver]]), and the liver transports them into the general [[circulatory system]].

Overall, SCFAs affect major regulatory systems, such as blood glucose and lipid levels, the colonic environment, and intestinal immune functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roy CC, Kien CL, Bouthillier L, Levy E |title=Short-chain fatty acids: ready for prime time? |journal=Nutr Clin Pract. |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=351–66 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16870803 |url=http://ncp.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16870803 |doi=10.1177/0115426506021004351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Scholz-Ahrens KE, Ade P, Marten B, etal |title=Prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics affect mineral absorption, bone mineral content, and bone structure |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=137 |issue=3 Suppl 2 |pages=838S–46S |pmid=17311984 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17311984 |date= 1 March 2007 |doi=10.1093/jn/137.3.838S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major SCFAs in humans are [[butyric acid|butyrate]], [[propionic acid|propionate]], and [[acetic acid|acetate]], where butyrate is the major energy source for [[colon (anatomy)|colonocytes]], propionate is destined for uptake by the liver, and acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by peripheral tissues.

==FDA-approved health claims==

The United States FDA allows manufacturers of foods containing 1.7 g per serving of psyllium husk soluble fiber or 0.75 g of [[oat]] or [[barley]] soluble fiber as [[beta-glucans]] to [[health claim|claim]] that regular consumption may reduce the risk of [[heart disease]].&lt;ref name=FDAc&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/2lg-xc.html FDA/CFSAN A Food Labeling Guide: Appendix C Health Claims, April 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412090421/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/2lg-xc.html |date=12 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA statement template for making this claim is: ''Soluble fiber from foods such as [name of soluble fiber source, and, if desired, name of food product], as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A serving of [name of food product] supplies __ grams of the [necessary daily dietary intake for the benefit] soluble fiber from [name of soluble fiber source] necessary per day to have this effect.''&lt;ref name=FDAc/&gt;

Eligible sources of soluble fiber providing beta-glucan include:
* Oat bran
* Rolled oats
* Whole oat flour
* Oatrim
* Whole grain barley and dry milled barley
* Soluble fiber from psyllium husk with purity of no less than 95%

The allowed label may state that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain of the above foods "may" or "might" reduce the risk of heart disease.

As discussed in FDA regulation 21 CFR 101.81, the daily dietary intake levels of soluble fiber from sources listed above associated with reduced risk of [[coronary heart disease]] are:
* 3 g or more per day of beta-glucan soluble fiber from either whole oats or barley, or a combination of whole oats and barley
* 7 g or more per day of soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk.&lt;ref&gt;Soluble Fiber from Certain Foods and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease, U.S. Government Printing Office, Electronic Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21: Food and Drugs, part 101: Food Labeling, Subpart E, Specific Requirements for Health Claims, 101.81 [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=77ed7da9463357d9a09892213e5c74db&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=21:2.0.1.1.2.5.1.12&amp;idno=21] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601040856/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=77ed7da9463357d9a09892213e5c74db&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=21%3A2.0.1.1.2.5.1.12&amp;idno=21 |date=1 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soluble fiber from consuming grains is included in other allowed health claims for lowering risk of some types of cancer and heart disease by consuming fruit and vegetables (21 CFR 101.76, 101.77, and 101.78).&lt;ref name=FDAc/&gt;

In December 2016, FDA approved a qualified health claim that consuming resistant starch from high-[[amylose]] corn may reduce the risk of [[type 2 diabetes]] due to its effect of increasing [[insulin sensitivity]]. The allowed claim specified: "High-amylose maize [[resistant starch]] may reduce the risk of [[type 2 diabetes]]. FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence for this claim."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balentine|first1=Douglas|title=Petition for a Health Claim for High-Amylose Maize Starch (Containing Type-2 Resistant Starch) and Reduced Risk Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Docket Number FDA2015-Q-2352)|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/labelingnutrition/ucm546963.pdf|publisher=Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3021">'''Downlink CNR''' (Carrier to noise ratio in [[Communications satellite|satellite]] reception) is an important figure in system [[TVRO]] design. Below are certain parameters used in CNR computation.

==Figure of merit==

[[Figure of merit]] is given as 
:&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{g}{t}&lt;/math&gt;
Where t is the temperature and g is the gain of the receiver antenna.
For lossless case
:&lt;math&gt;t=t_a+(n-1)\cdot t_0&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{g}{ t_a+(n-1)\cdot t_0} &lt;/math&gt;
where n is the [[noise factor]], t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the noise temperature of the antenna and t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the environment (taken as 290&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;K). 
'''F''' in db is simply 
:&lt;math&gt;F= 10 \ \log_{10} (f)&lt;/math&gt;

==Path loss==

[[Path loss]] is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; l=  (\frac{4\cdot \pi \cdot d}{\lambda})^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of the carrier and the d is the distance in meters between the satellite and the receiver . For [[Geosynchronous satellites]] this distance is {{convert|35786|km}} at the projection on the earth (at the mean sea level). In actual cases the distance is slightly more than this figure depending on the geographic location. (But for geosynchronous satellites the variation is less than 1%). The Path loss in dB is

:&lt;math&gt;L = 20\ \log_{10}\left(\frac{4\cdot \pi \cdot d}{\lambda}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
The same relation can be given in terms of frequency.

:&lt;math&gt;L = 20\ \log_{10}\left(\frac{4\cdot \pi \cdot d \cdot f}{c}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Where c is the velocity of light.

With metric units 
:&lt;math&gt;L= -147.56+20\ \log_{10} (d) +20\ \log_{10} (f) &lt;/math&gt;
Using km for d and GHz for f 
:&lt;math&gt;L= 92.45 + 20\ \log_{10} (d) +20\ \log_{10} (f) &lt;/math&gt;
Using miles for d and GHz for f 
:&lt;math&gt;L= 96.58+20\ \log_{10} (d) +20\ \log_{10} (f) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Reference Data for radio Engineers , Howard W.sams Co.{{ISBN|0-672-21218-8}}, p.33-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elektrik Mühendisliği No 257, Haşmet Esen : Uydulardan Doğrudan yayın, Ankara,141-152&lt;/ref&gt;

== EIRP ==

'''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the [[Equivalent isotropically radiated power]] (also known as EIRP) in dBW. It depends on the output of the [[transponder]]s of the satellite and the antenna gain of the transmitting antenna. This figure is given by the service provider.

:&lt;math&gt;P_e= 10\ \log_{10} (p) + 10\ \log_{10} (g_{t})      &lt;/math&gt;

where  p is the output power of the transponder and g is the antenna gain.

== Baseband ==

'''B''' is the baseband of the channel given in dB

:&lt;math&gt;B= 10\ \log_{10} (b)&lt;/math&gt;
Where b is the base band given in metric units (Hz).

When b is given in MHz, than

:&lt;math&gt;B= 10\ \log_{10} (b)+60&lt;/math&gt;

== Boltzmann's constant ==
'''K''' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] given in dB units.
:&lt;math&gt;K= 10\ \log_{10} (1.380 \cdot 10^{-23})= -228.6 &lt;/math&gt;

== CNR in dB units ==
&lt;div style="border:2px solid #000000; border-collapse:collapse; width:40%; padding:1em;"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{CNR}= F+P-B-K-L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;/div&gt;

The '''Duke Islamic Studies Center''', also known as '''DISC''', is an inter-departmental, cross-cultural center at [[Duke University]] dedicated to the study of [[Islam]] and [[Muslims]]. DISC is one of the leading institutions in North America for Islamic studies, approaching Islam as a global religion with many distinctive historical and cultural expressions. Duke’s tradition of strong humanistic approaches to the study of Islam and Muslims scholarship is complimented by emerging strength in social science approaches to Islamic Studies.

Established in 2006 as a sequel to the Center for the Study of Muslim Networks, the Duke Islamic Studies Center (DISC) continues to foreground Muslim networks, especially educational networks, as essential instruments for advancing cross-cultural understanding.

==Faculty Leadership==
Duke Islamic Studies Center is led by Professor [[Omid Safi]], a prominent Islamic studies professor who received his bachelor of arts, master's and doctorate degrees from Duke. Prior to accepting this position, he was a professor of Islamic studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Safi has also been a frequent speaker on Islam in popular media, including in The New York Times, Al Jazeera, The Washington Post, BBC, NPR, NBC and international media. He also is active on social media and as a blogger, is a lead Islam writer for the Huffington Post, and his column “What Would Muhammad Do?” (http://omidsafi.religionnews.com) has been a regular Religion News Service feature.

Other prominent faculty leadership include Abdullah Antepli (Chief Representative for Muslim Affairs), and Jen'nan Read (Assistant Director of Special Initiatives).

==Projects and Initiatives==
In addition to putting on a full slate of programs and events each semester, the Duke Islamic Studies Center sponsors special initiatives that reflect emerging leadership priorities and faculty interests.

Our most recent and most ambitious initiative is the Transcultural Islam Project. This multi-year project was launched in July 2011 with funding support from the Carnegie Corporation. This initiative has two overarching goals: 1) to inform public discourse and policy by publicizing and promoting scholarly and research-based information about Islam and Muslims; 2) to support scholarship and scholarly collaborations to advance research about Islam and Muslims across the globe.

Both of these initiatives were funded by the Social Science Research Council.

An early life stage (ELS) test is a chronic toxicity test using sensitive early life stages like embryos or larvae to predict the effects of toxicants on organisms.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985"&gt;McKim JM. 1985. Early life stage toxicity tests. In Rand GM (1995). Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment (2nd ed.). Boca Raton: CRC Press. pp 974–1010. {{ISBN|1-56032-091-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ELS tests were developed to be quicker and more cost-efficient than full life-cycle tests, taking on average 1–5 months to complete compared to 6–12 months for a life-cycle test. They are commonly used in [[aquatic toxicology]], particularly with fish. Growth and survival are the typically measured endpoints, for which a [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration]] (MATC) can be estimated. ELS tests allow for the testing of fish species that otherwise could not be studied due to length of life, spawning requirements, or size. ELS tests are used as part of environmental risk assessments by regulatory agencies including the [[EPA|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and [[Environment Canada]], as well as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref name="EPAEEC"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/ecorisk_ders/toera_analysis_eco.htm Technical Overview of Ecological Risk Assessment Analysis Phase: Ecological Effects Characterization.] US EPA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECDFELS"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 1992. Guideline 210: Fish early-life stage toxicity test. ''OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals''. Paris, France.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
ELS tests were adapted from full life-cycle toxicity tests, chronic tests that expose an organism to a contaminant for its entire life-cycle.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; These are widely considered to be the best tests for estimating long-term "safe" concentrations of toxicants in aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; The first full life-cycle tests on fish were developed for the [[fathead minnow]] (''Pimephales promelas''),&lt;ref name="Mount Stephan"&gt;Mount DI, Stephan CE. 1967. A method for establishing acceptable limits for fish-Malathion and the butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D. ''Trans Am Fish Soc'' 96:185-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benoit DA, Puglisi FA, Olson DL. 1982. A fathead minnow (''Pimephales promelas'') early life stage toxicity test method evaluation and exposure to four organic chemicals. ''Environ Pollution Series A, Ecological and Biological'' 28:189-197.&lt;/ref&gt; and later for [[bluegill]] (''Lepomis macrochirus''), [[brook trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis''), [[flagfish]] (''Jordanella floridae''), and [[sheepshead minnow]] (''Cyprinodon variegatus'').&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen DJ, Parrish PR, Schimmel SC, Goodman LR. 1978. Life-cycle toxicity test using sheepshead minnows (''Cyprinodon variegatus''). ''Bioassay Procedures for the Ocean Disposal Permit Program'', EPA-600/9-78-010.&lt;/ref&gt; While useful, full life-cycle tests require a high number of test organisms and extensive exposure time in the lab, especially for vertebrates.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Typically, life-cycle tests take 6–12 months for [[fathead minnow]] and 30 months for [[brook trout]].

Following the passage of the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA) in the [[United States]] in 1976, there was an increased need for quicker, more efficient vertebrate toxicity tests.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; The [[EPA]] was now required to assess the environmental effects of new chemicals before they could be commercially produced. Less costly and time-intensive tests were needed to evaluate a multitude of new chemicals. Researchers began developing toxicity tests that focused on early life stages, since these have been shown to be more sensitive to environmental stressors than later life stages.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Many critical events occur in a short period of time in the early stages of development.&lt;ref name="McKim 1977"&gt;McKim JM. 1977. Evaluation of tests with early life stages of fish for predicting long-term toxicity. ''J Fish Res Board Can'' 34:1148–1154.&lt;/ref&gt; If a stressor disrupts developmental events (including their timing), it could result in adverse effects that reduce the organism's chances of survival. Meta-analysis has found that early life-cycle portions of full life-cycle tests usually estimate an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] within a factor of 2 of full life-cycle estimates in saltwater and freshwater fish.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McKim 1977" /&gt; In 83% of 72 tests, the ELS portion resulted in the same [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] as the full life-cycle estimate, and the remaining 17% were within a factor of 2.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;

==Limitations==
There remain some limitations with early life stage toxicity testing. Although ELS tests are quicker and more cost-efficient than full life cycle tests, they remain resource- and time-intensive. Fish early life stage (FELS) tests require hundreds of fish and 1 to 5 months to complete.&lt;ref name="villeneuve"&gt;Villeneuve D, Volz DC, Embry MR, Ankley GT, Belanger SE, Léonard M, Schirmer K, Tanguay R, Truong L, Wehmas L. 2014. Investigating alternatives to the fish early-life stage test: a strategy for discovering and annotating adverse outcome pathways for early fish development. ''Environ Toxicol Chem'' 33:158-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues include the lack of mechanistic information, differing sensitivities between species, and insensitivity to parental exposure. ELS tests don't provide information on the toxicant's [[mechanism of action]]. Sensitivity to specific toxicants varies with species, so the most sensitive or most important species should be tested in each case.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; ELS tests appear to be insensitive to parental exposure, and [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATCs]] are generally the same for embryos of both exposed and unexposed parents. This could be due to the [[mode of action]] of the toxicant or the variability and insensitivity of ELS test design.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Additionally, growth response has been found to be an insensitive endpoint in ELS tests with fish, having little bearing on the estimation of an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]].&lt;ref&gt;Woltering DM. 1984. The growth response in fish chronic and early life stage toxicity tests: A critical review. ''Aquat Toxicol'' 5:1–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth response could be omitted to reduce the duration and cost of screening tests.

==Methodology==
In a typical early life stage toxicity test, a flow-through dilutor system administers different concentrations of a toxicant to different test chambers.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; At least five different concentrations of a toxicant are tested, plus controls, with at least two exposure chambers for each treatment. The length of the exposure depends on the test species. For example, [[fathead minnow]] tests are 1–2 months long, while [[brook trout]] tests are around 5 months long. Growth and survival are the typical endpoints, for which an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] can be found.

Standard methods for ELS tests have been established by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]],&lt;ref name="OECDFELS" /&gt; [[ASTM International]],&lt;ref&gt;ASTM International. Standard Guide for Conducting Early Life-Stage Toxicity Tests with Fishes, designation E1241. Conshohochen (PA): Annual book of ASTM standards.

==Current developments==
An extended ELS test has been examined as a potential surrogate for a fish full life-cycle test to detect weak environmental estrogens.&lt;ref name="panter"&gt;Panter GH, Hutchinson TH, Hurd KS, Bamforth J, Stanley RD, Duffell S, Hargreaves A, Gimeno S, Tyler CR. 2006. Development of chronic tests for endocrine active chemicals: Part 1. An extended fish early-life stage test for oestrogenic active chemicals in the fathead minnow (''Pimephales promelas'') ''Aquat Toxicol'' 77:279-290.&lt;/ref&gt; Endocrine active chemicals (EACs) are ubiquitous in the environment, prompting the need for better screening assays to predict their effects, especially in aquatic species. Slightly longer ELS tests could be used instead of full life-cycle tests, taking into account sensitive windows of exposure like sexual differentiation and early gonadal development. Extended ELS tests have proven successful in detecting the effects of weak estrogens in [[fathead minnow]]s.&lt;ref name="panter" /&gt;

Additionally, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) are being used to develop an alternative to FELS testing.&lt;ref name="villeneuve" /&gt; Industry and regulatory agencies are increasingly interested in an animal-free, cost-efficient surrogate.&lt;ref&gt;Knapen D, Vergauwen L, Verstraelen S, Dardenne F, Witters H, Blust R, Villeneuve DL, Ankley GT. 2013. Development of an alternative testing strategy for the fish early life-stage for predicting chronic toxicity." ''Toxicology Letters'' 221: S104.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are developing FELS-related AOPs to create a high-throughput, less costly screening strategy for toxicants that takes the [[mechanism of action]] into account.&lt;ref name="villeneuve" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">'''Extended aeration''' is a method of sewage treatment using modified [[activated sludge]] procedures.  It is preferred for relatively small waste loads, where lower operating efficiency is offset by mechanical simplicity.

==Conventional sewage treatment==
Mechanized [[sewage treatment]] typically includes settling in a primary [[clarifier]], followed by biological treatment and a secondary clarifier.  Both clarifiers produce waste [[sludge]] requiring [[sewage sludge treatment]] and disposal.  Activated sludge agitates a portion of the secondary clarifier sludge in the primary clarifier effluent.  Remaining secondary sludge and all primary sludge typically require digestion prior to disposal.

==Process modification==
Extended aeration agitates all incoming waste in the sludge from a single clarifier.  The combined sludge starts with a higher concentration of inert solids than typical secondary sludge and the longer mixing time required for digestion of primary solids in addition to dissolved organics produces aged sludge requiring greater mixing energy input per unit of waste oxidized.

==Applications==
Extended aeration is typically used in prefabricated "package plants" intended to minimize design costs for waste disposal from small communities, tourist facilities, or schools.  In comparison to traditional activated sludge, longer mixing time with aged sludge offers a stable biological ecosystem better adapted for effectively treating waste load fluctuations from variable occupancy situations. Supplemental feeding with something like sugar is sometimes used to sustain sludge microbial populations during periods of low occupancy; but population response to variable food characteristics is unpredictable, and supplemental feeding increases waste sludge volumes. Sludge may be periodically removed by septic tank pumping trucks as sludge volume approaches storage capacity.

===Mardi Gras Shipwreck===

In May 2007, an expedition, led by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and funded by the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC) under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now [[BOEM]]), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study a wreck site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. The "Mardi Gras Shipwreck" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water. The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the OGGC. As part of the educational outreach [[Nautilus Productions]] in partnership with [[BOEM]], Texas A&amp;M University, the Florida Public Archaeology Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FPAN Home|url=http://www.flpublicarchaeology.org/|website=Florida Public Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Veolia Environmental produced a one-hour HD documentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the project, short videos for public viewing and provided video updates during the expedition. The [[Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation]] was tasked with the conservation and analysis of the material recovered from the wreck site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation Mardi Gras Project|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/mardigras/|website=http://nautarch.tamu.edu|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4039">'''Ground pressure''' is the [[pressure]] exerted on the ground by the [[tires]] or [[Caterpillar track|tracks]] of a motorized vehicle, and is one measure of its potential mobility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ground pressure is measured in [[pascals]] (Pa) which corresponds to the [[United States customary units]] unit of [[pounds per square inch]] (psi).  Average ground pressure can be calculated using the standard formula for average [[pressure]]: ''P'' = ''F''/''A''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The ground pressure of motorized vehicles is often compared to the ground pressure of a human [[foot]], which can be 60 - 80 kPa while walking or as much as 13 MPa for a person in spike heels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Increasing the size of the contact area on the ground (the ''footprint'') in relation to the weight decreases the ground pressure.  Ground pressure of 14&amp;nbsp;kPa (2&amp;nbsp;psi) or less is recommended for fragile ecosystems like marshes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/initiatives/media/bmp.pdf|title=Page 4 of Management of small dock and piers, best management practices, May 2005 NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decreasing the ground pressure increases the flotation, allowing easier passage of the body over soft terrain. This is often observed in activities like [[snowshoe]]ing.

'''Note:'''
The pressures for adult human male and horse are for standing still position. A walking human will exert more than double his standing pressure. A galloping horse will exert up to 3.5&amp;nbsp;MPa (500&amp;nbsp;psi). The ground pressure for a [[pneumatic tire]] is roughly equal to its inflation pressure.

'''Helen Singer Kaplan''' (February 6, 1929 – August 17, 1995) was an [[Austrian-American]] [[sex therapist]] and the founder of the first clinic in the United States for [[sexual disorder]]s established at a [[medical school]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Kaplan as someone who was "considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-05 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/19/obituaries/dr-helen-kaplan-66-dies-pioneer-in-sex-therapy-field.html |title=Dr. Helen Kaplan, 66, Dies; Pioneer in Sex Therapy Field |work=The New York Times |date=1995-08-19 |author=Saxon, Wolfgang }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also dubbed the "Sex Queen" because of her role as a pioneer in sex therapy during the [[sexual revolution in 1960s America]], and because of her advocacy of the idea that people should enjoy [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] as much as possible, as opposed to seeing it as something dirty or harmful. The main purpose of her dissertation is to evaluate the psychosexual dysfunctions because these syndromes are among the most prevalent, worrying and distressing medical complaints of modern times.&lt;ref name=pa /&gt;

==Life==
Kaplan was born in [[Vienna]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], on February 6, 1929. In 1940, she emigrated to The United States, becoming a citizen in 1947. She received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] from [[Syracuse University]] in 1951, graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]''. She was then educated at [[Columbia University]], where she received a [[master's degree]] in [[psychology]] in 1952, and then a [[PhD]] in psychology in 1955. At [[New York Medical College]], she earned a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] in 1959, and later completed a comprehensive course in [[psychoanalysis]] there in 1970. In 1964, she initiated a unique residency program for women MDs with children at New York Medical College, the "mother's program" enabled residents to be free during vacations and emergencies to care for their children.&lt;ref&gt;Medical World News, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; She was a long-time professor of psychiatry at [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] and the [[Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic]]. She died of cancer at the age of 66.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; At the time of her death, she was married to [[Toys "R" Us]] founder [[Charles Lazarus]].

==Sex research and therapy==
A psychologist and psychiatrist by training, Kaplan viewed [[Sexual arousal|human sexual response]] as a triphasic phenomenon, consisting of separate—but interlocking—phases: desire, arousal, and orgasm.&lt;ref name=MJK&gt;William H. Masters, Virginia E. Johnson, and Robert C. Kolodny, ''Human Sexuality'', 2nd ed.  Little, Brown, &amp; Co., Boston, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  She concluded that "desire" phase disorders are the most difficult to treat, being associated with deep-seated psychological difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kaplan, ''Disorders of Sexual Desire''.  Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan wrote extensively on the treatment of sexual dysfunctions, integrating other methods with principles of psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=MJK /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Kaplan, ''The Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy''.  Quadrangle/New York Times, New York, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  As did many other experts in her field, Kaplan believed that sexual difficulties typically had superficial origins.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; She suggested that premature ejaculation occurred if the subject did not have voluntary control over when he ejaculated, and that coitally anorgasmic women should not necessarily be thought of as having a problem.&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Kaplan, ''The New Sex Therapy''.  Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan always encouraged people to enjoy having sex as much as possible. However, since the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|epidemic of AIDS into the United States]] from 1981 into the 1990s, she has had to add the caveat: "If you aren't extremely careful, it can kill you." Kaplan commented that she "absolutely hate[s] having to say that. [...] I have spent my whole life devising solutions to people's problems, telling them that sex is not dirty or harmful, but a natural function. And now I have to tell them, 'Hey, look out. You could die.'"&lt;ref name=pa&gt;{{cite news |title=Warning Women About AIDS for Years |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=1987-11-08 |author=Hacker, Kathy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of her disciples are [[Ruth Westheimer]] and [[Hans-Werner Gessmann]] (in 1976, who added to sex therapy his own humanistic psychological and [[hypnosis]] approaches).

This '''history by period''' summarizes significant eras in the [[history of the world]], from the ancient world to the present day.

== Ancient history (60,000 BC – 650 AD) ==
{{main article|Ancient history}}
Ancient history refers to the time period in which scientists have found the earliest remains of human activity, approximately 60,000 BC. It ends with the fall of several significant empires, such as the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the Mediterranean, the [[Han Dynasty]] in China, and the [[Gupta Empire]] in India, collectively around 650 AD.

The [[Bronze Age]] is the time period in which humans around the world began to use [[bronze]] as a major metal in tools. It is generally accepted as starting around 3600 BC and ending with the advent of iron in 1000 BC.

The [[Iron Age]] is often called Antiquity or the Classical Era, but these periods more commonly refer to only one region. It begins around 1000 BC with the widespread use of [[iron]] in tools. It is often accepted to end at approximately 650 AD, with the fall of the aforementioned major civilizations.

Note that BC and BCE refer to the same time period. BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era, and BC for Before Christ. AD is Anno Domini, and CE is Common Era. This is done in order to standardize time periods across the world ([[ISO 8601]]).
*[[Stone Age]] Ended between 6,000 and 2,000 BC (depending on the area; until 1600s European contact in Australia)
*[[History of Mesopotamia]] 6000 BC - 1100 BC
*[[Indus Valley Civilization]] 3300 BC - 1300 BC
*[[Old Kingdom]] ([[Egypt]], 3000 BC - 2000 BC)

*[[Six Dynasties]] (China, 220 AD–581 AD)
**[[Three Kingdoms]] (China, 220–280)
*[[Late Antiquity]] (Europe, circa 300 AD - circa 476 AD)

== Postclassical Era (500 – 1500) ==
{{main article|Postclassical Era}}
The Postclassical Era, also referred to as the Medieval period or, for [[Europe]], the [[Middle Ages]], begins around 500 CE after the fall of major civilizations, covering the advent of [[Islam]]. The period ends around 1450–1500, with events like the rise of [[printing press|moveable-type printing]] in Europe, the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]], and the Ottoman Empire's [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]].

*[[Middle Ages]] (Europe, 5th century - 15th century)
**[[Early Middle Ages]] (Europe, 5th century - 11th century)
**[[High Middle Ages]] (Europe, 11th century - 14th century)
**[[Late Middle Ages]] (Europe, 14th century  - 15th century)
*[[Islamic Golden Age]] (Middle East, 750 – 1300)
*[[Viking Age]] ([[Scandinavia]], Europe, 793 - 1066)
*[[Nara period]] (Japan, 709 - 795)
*[[Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] (China, 907 - 960)
*[[Sengoku period]] (Japan, 1478–1605)
*[[Middle kingdoms of India]], (500 - 1206)

== Modern history (1500 – present) ==
{{main article|Modern history}}
{{see also|Great Divergence}}
The Modern Period covers human history from the creation of a more global network (i.e. the discovery of the Americas by Europeans) to present day.

=== Early Modern Period (1500 – 1750) ===
{{main article|Early modern period}}
The Early Modern Period is the first third of the Modern Period and is often used with the parent categorization. It starts with the invention of the printing press, covering the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 and, more generally, the establishment of a more global network. It ends in 1750 with the beginning of British industrialization.

*The [[Renaissance]] (Europe, 14th century - 17th century)
*[[Age of Discovery]] (or Exploration) (Europe, 16th century - 18th century)
*[[Age of Sail]] - referring to commercial and military impact of sailing technology, usually dated as 1571—1862.
*[[Elizabethan period]] (England, 1558–1603)
*The [[Protestant Reformation]] (Europe, 16th century)
*[[The Age of Enlightenment]] (Europe, 18th century)
=== Mid Modern Period (1750 – 1945) ===
{{main article|Long nineteenth century|Age of Revolution|Industrial Revolution}}
The Age of Revolution is a less commonly used period, but appropriately covers the time between the early modern and contemporary. It begins around 1750 with European industrialization and is marked by several political revolutions. It ends around 1945, with the relative advancement of industrialization in Europe, the United States, Japan, and Russia, and the beginning of [[World War II]].

*[[Industrial Revolution]] (Europe, United States, elsewhere 18th and 19th centuries)
*[[Napoleonic Era]], 1799–1815
*[[Victorian era]] (United Kingdom, 1837–1901)
*[[Gilded Age]] (United States, 1870-1900)
*[[Machine Age]] (Europe, United States, elsewhere 19th and 20th centuries)
*[[Edwardian period]] (United Kingdom, 1901–1910)
*[[Meiji era]] (Japan, 1868–1912)

=== Contemporary Period (1945 – present) ===
{{main article|Contemporary history}}
The Contemporary Period generally covers history still in living memory, approximately 100 years behind the current year. However, for all intents and purposes, the period will be used here as spanning from the second world war in 1945 to present day, as it is considered separate from the past eras and the newest stage of world history.

*[[World War I]] (Much of Earth, 1914–1918)
*[[Interwar period]] (Earth, 1918 - 1939)
*The [[Roaring Twenties]] (United States, 1920-1929)
*The [[Great Depression]] (United States, 1929-1939)
*[[World War II]] (Earth, 1939–1945)
*[[Cold War]] ([[Soviet Union]] and United States, as well their allied states, 1945–1991)
*[[Space Age]] (after 1957)
*[[Information Age]] (1971–present)
*[[History of post-Soviet Russia|Post-communist period]] ([[Russia]] and other former Soviet states, after 1991) / [[Post–Cold War era|Post-Cold War]] (Western world after 1991)

'''IEEE Std 1584-2002''' (''Guide for Performing Arc-Flash Hazard Calculations'') is a standard of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] that provides a method of calculating the incident energy of [[arc flash]] event.

==Purpose==
IEEE 1584-2002 was developed to help protect people from arc-flash hazard dangers. The predicted arc current and incident energy are used in selecting appropriate overcurrent protective devices and [[personal protective equipment]] (generally abbreviated as PPE), as well as defining safe working distance. Since the magnitude of the arc current is inherently linked with the degree of arc hazard, the arc is examined as a circuit parameter. Furthermore, since estimations are often useful, simple equations for predicting ballpark arc current, arc power, and incident energy values and probable ranges are presented in this work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/2943/30100/01380323.pdf?arnumber=1380323 IEEE Xplore - IEEE 1584-2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
Arc Flash Hazard calculations are currently implemented in most of the industry plants due to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecmweb.com/mag/electric_calculating_arc_flash here&lt;/ref&gt; The IEEE 1584 [[empirically]] derived model accurately accounts for a wide variety of setup parameters including:

* [[Voltage|Voltages]] in the range of 208 V–15 000 V, three-phase.
* [[Frequency|Frequencies]] of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.
* Bolted fault current in the range of 700 A – 106,000 A.
* Grounding of all types and ungrounded.
* Equipment enclosures of commonly available sizes.
* Gaps between [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] of 13&amp;nbsp;mm – 152&amp;nbsp;mm.
* Faults involving three phases.

For cases where voltage is over 15kV or gap is outside the range of the model, the theoretically derived Lee method can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcflashanalytic.com/arcflash/ieee1584_procedure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4745">[[Instrumentation]] is defined as the well defined branch of engineering from 1998.variables within a production or manufacturing area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nait.ca/program_home_78211.htm "Instrumentation "], ''The Northern Alberta Institute of Technology.'', Retrieved 17 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The process variables used in industries are Level, Pressure, Temperature, Humidity, Flow, pH, Force, Speed etc.
[[Control engineering]] or control systems engineering is the engineering discipline that applies control theory to design systems with desired behaviors. Control engineers are responsible for the research, design, development and control devices/systems, typically in manufacturing facilities and plants. The practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called automatic control (such as cruise control for regulating a car's speed). Multi-disciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by mathematical modeling of systems of a diverse range.

==Instrumentation and Control Engineering==
This term refers to the graduate discipline  many universities provide at [[graduate school|graduate]] and [[postgraduate]] level. Instrumentation and Control plays a significant role in both gathering information from the field and changing the field parameters, and as such are a key part of control loops.The Instrumentation Technology, being an inter-disciplinary branch of engineering, is heading towards development of new &amp; intelligent sensors, smart transducers, MEMS Technology, Blue tooth Technology. This discipline finds its origin in both electrical and electronics engineering, and it covers subjects related to electronics and electrical streams. In short, it deals with [[measurement]], [[automation]] and control processes.In today's scenario, there are many people who are willing to make a career in this stream. Almost all process and manufacturing industry such as steel, oil, petrochemical, power and defense production will have a separate instrumentation and control department, which is manned and managed by instrumentation and control engineers. “Automation is the buzz word in process industry, and automation is the core job of instrumentation and control engineers. Hence, the demand for instrumentation will always be there."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/education/instrumentation-engineering-in-demand/article3320296.ece "Instrumentation engineering in demand"], ''The Hindu'', April 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iterative design''' is a [[design]] methodology based on a cyclic process of [[prototyping]], [[Product testing|testing]], analyzing, and refining a product or process.  Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made.  This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design.  In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented.

==Iterative design process==
The iterative design process may be applied throughout the [[new product development]] process.  However, changes are easiest and less expensive to implement in the earliest stages of development.  The first step in the iterative design process is to develop a [[prototype]].  The prototype should be evaluated by a [[focus group]] or a group not associated with the product in order to deliver non-biased opinions.  Information from the focus group should be synthesized and incorporated into the next iteration of the design.  The process should be repeated until user issues have been reduced to an acceptable level.

===Application: Human computer interfaces===
Iterative design is commonly used in the development of human computer interfaces.  This allows designers to identify any usability issues that may arise in the user interface before it is put into wide use.  Even the best usability experts cannot design perfect user interfaces in a single attempt, so a usability engineering lifecycle should be built around the concept of iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Iterative User Interface Design | year = 1993 | author = Nielsen, J. | journal = IEEE Computer  vol.26 no.11 pp 32-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical steps of iterative design in user interfaces are as follows:

# Complete an initial interface design
# Present the design to several test users
# Note any problems had by the test user
# Refine interface to account for/fix the problems
# Repeat steps 2-4 until user interface problems are resolved

Iterative design in user interfaces can be implemented in many ways.  One common method of using iterative design in computer software is [[software testing]].  While this includes testing the product for functionality outside of the user interface, important feedback on the interface can be gained from subject testing early versions of a program.  This allows software companies to release a better quality product to the public, and prevents the need of product modification following its release.

Iterative design in online (website) interfaces is a more continual process, as website modification, after it has been released to the user, is far more viable than in software design.  Often websites use their users as test subjects for interface design, making modifications based on recommendations from visitors to their sites.

==Iterative design use==
Iterative design is a way of confronting the reality of unpredictable user needs and behaviors that can lead to sweeping and fundamental changes in a design. User testing will often show that even carefully evaluated ideas will be inadequate when confronted with a user test. Thus, it is important that the flexibility of the iterative design’s implementation approach extends as far into the system as possible. Designers must further recognize that user testing results may suggest radical change that requires the designers to be prepared to completely abandon old ideas in favor of new ideas that are more equipped to suit user needs. Iterative design applies in many fields, from making knives to rockets. As an example consider the design of an [[electronic circuit]] that must perform a certain task, and must ultimately fit in a small space on a [[circuit board]]. It is useful to split these independent tasks into two smaller and simpler tasks, the functionality task, and the space and weight task. A [[breadboard]] is a useful way of implementing the electronic circuit on an interim basis, without having to worry about space and weight.

Once the circuit works, improvements or incremental changes may be applied to the breadboard to increase or improve functionality over the original design.  When the design is finalized, one can set about designing a proper circuit board meeting the space and weight criteria.  Compacting the circuit on the circuit board requires that the wires and components be juggled around without changing their electrical characteristics.  This juggling follows simpler rules than the design of the circuit itself, and is often [[Place and route|automated]]. As far as possible [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off the shelf]] components are used, but where necessary for space or performance reasons, custom made components may be developed.

Several instances of iterative design are as follows:

*'''Wiki''': A [[wiki]] is a natural repository for iterative design.  The 'Page History' facility allows tracking back to prior versions.  Modifications are mostly incremental, and leave substantial parts of the text unchanged.
*'''Common law''': The principle of [[legal precedent]] builds on past experience.  This makes law a form of iterative design where there should be a clear [[audit trail]] of the development of legal thought.
*'''Evolution''': There is a parallel between iterative and the theory of [[natural Selection]].  Both involve a trial and error process in which the most suitable design advances to the next generation, while less suitable designs perish by the wayside.  Subsequent versions of a product should also get progressively better as its producers learn what works and what doesn't in a process of refinement and [[Continual improvement process|continual improvement]].

==Fast prototyping tools==
One approach to iterative design is to use the highest level of abstraction for developing an early generation product. The principle here is that rapid development may not produce efficient code, but obtaining feedback is more important that technology optimization. Examples of this approach include use of non-functional code, object databases, or low code platforms - these allow quick testing of designs before issues of optimization are addressed.

==Benefits==
When properly applied, iterative design will ensure a product or process is the best solution possible.  When applied early in the development stage, significant cost savings are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Cost/Benefit Analysis for incorporating human factors in the software lifecycle | date = April 1988 | author = Marilyn Mantei; Toby Teorey  | journal = Publications of the ACM  vol.31 no.4 pp 428-439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other benefits to iterative design include:
# Serious misunderstandings are made evident early in the lifecycle, when it's possible to react to them.
# It enables and encourages user feedback, so as to elicit the system's real requirements.
# Where the work is contracted, Iterative Design provides an incremental method for more effectively involving the client in the complexities that often surround the design process.
# The development team is forced to focus on those issues that are most critical to the project, and team members are shielded from those issues that distract and divert them from the project's real risks.
# Continual testing enables an objective assessment of the project's status.
# Inconsistencies among requirements, designs, and implementations are detected early.
# The workload of the team, especially the testing team, is spread out more evenly throughout the lifecycle.
# This approach enables the team to leverage lessons learned, and therefore to continually improve the process.
# Stakeholders in the project can be given concrete evidence of the project's status throughout the lifecycle.

==Marshmallow Challenge==
[[File:Marshmallow_Challenge.jpg|thumb|Marshmallow challenge winning work.]]
The Marshmallow Challenge is an instructive design challenge. It involves the task of constructing the highest possible free-standing structure with a marshmallow on top. The structure must be completed within 18 minutes using only 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, and one yard of string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=The Marshmallow Challenge |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bpwrap1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpwrap.com/2010/04/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |location=CA |publisher=BPWrap |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observation and studies of participants show that kindergartners are regularly able to build higher structures, in comparison to groups of business school graduates. This is explained by the tendency for children to at once stick the marshmallow on top of a simple structure, test the prototype, and continue to improve upon it. Whereas, business school students tend to spend time vying for power, planning, and finally producing a structure to which the marshmallow is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jerz |first=Dennis G. |url=http://jerz.setonhill.edu/weblog/2010/05/the_marshmallow_challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge - Jerz's Literacy Weblog |publisher=Jerz.setonhill.edu |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge was invented by Peter Skillman of [[Palm, Inc.]] and popularized by Tom Wujec of [[Autodesk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cameron |first=Chris |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/04/marshmallows-and-spaghetti-how-kindergartners-think-like-lean-startups.php |title=Marshmallows and Spaghetti: How Kindergartners Think Like Lean Startups |publisher=Readwriteweb.com |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineeringrevision.com/302/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=Engineeringrevision.com |date=2010-05-02 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selfishprogramming.com/2010/04/28/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=Selfish Programming |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideasforideas.com/content/marshmallow-challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713002340/http://www.ideasforideas.com/content/marshmallow-challenge|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/science/node/1578 |title=Marshmallow challenge &amp;#124; Faculty of Science &amp;#124; University of Calgary |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Original Design Challenge|title=Peter Skillman Marshmallow Design Challenge|date=2014-01-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p5sBzMtB3Q|accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johnson–Nyquist noise''' ('''thermal noise''', '''Johnson noise''', or '''Nyquist noise''') is the [[electronic noise]] generated by the thermal agitation of the charge carriers (usually the [[electron]]s) inside an [[electrical conductor]] at equilibrium, which happens regardless of any applied [[voltage]].  Thermal noise is present in all [[electrical circuit]]s, and in sensitive electronic equipment such as [[radio receiver]]s can drown out weak signals, and can be the limiting factor on sensitivity of an electrical measuring instrument.  Thermal noise increases with temperature.  Some sensitive electronic equipment such as [[radio telescope]] receivers are cooled to [[cryogenic]] temperatures to reduce thermal noise in their circuits.   The generic, statistical physical derivation of this noise is called the [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]], where generalized [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] or generalized [[Electric susceptibility|susceptibility]] is used to characterize the medium.

Thermal noise in an ideal resistor is approximately [[white noise|white]], meaning that the power [[spectral density]] is nearly constant throughout the [[frequency spectrum]] (however see the section below on extremely high frequencies).  When limited to a finite bandwidth, thermal noise has a nearly [[Normal distribution|Gaussian amplitude distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John R. Barry |author2=Edward A.

== Noise voltage and power ==
Thermal noise is distinct from [[shot noise]], which consists of additional current fluctuations that occur when a voltage is applied and a macroscopic current starts to flow. For the general case, the above definition applies to charge carriers in any type of conducting [[Transmission medium|medium]] (e.g. [[ion]]s in an [[electrolyte]]), not just [[resistor]]s. It can be modeled by a voltage source representing the noise of the [[non-ideal resistor]] in series with an [[ideal noise free resistor]].

The one-sided [[Spectral density|power spectral density]], or voltage variance (mean square) per [[hertz]] of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline {v_{n}^2} = 4 k_\text{B} T R
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] in [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]], ''T'' is the resistor's absolute [[temperature]] in kelvins, and ''R'' is the resistor value in [[ohm]]s (Ω).
Use this equation for quick calculation, at room temperature:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{\overline {v_{n}^2}} = 0.13 \sqrt{R} ~\mathrm{nV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a 1&amp;nbsp;kΩ resistor at a temperature of 300&amp;nbsp;K has

:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{\overline {v_{n}^2}} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 1.38 \cdot 10^{-23}~\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{K} \cdot 300~\mathrm{K} \cdot 1~\mathrm{k}\Omega} = 4.07  ~\mathrm{nV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a given bandwidth,  the [[root mean square]] (RMS) of the voltage, &lt;math&gt;v_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
v_{n}  = \sqrt{\overline {v_{n}^2}}\sqrt{\Delta f } = \sqrt{ 4 k_\text{B} T R \Delta f }
&lt;/math&gt;

where Δ''f'' is the bandwidth in hertz over which the noise is measured. For a 1&amp;nbsp;kΩ resistor at room temperature and a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth, the RMS noise voltage is 400&amp;nbsp;nV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=sqrt(4*k*295+Kelvin*1+kiloOhm*(10+kHz))+in+nanovolt Google Calculator result] for 1&amp;nbsp;kΩ room temperature 10&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth&lt;/ref&gt; A useful rule of thumb to remember is that 50&amp;nbsp;Ω at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz bandwidth correspond to 1&amp;nbsp;nV noise at room temperature.

A resistor in a short circuit dissipates a noise power of
:&lt;math&gt;
P = {v_{n}^2}/R = 4 k_\text{B} \,T \Delta f.
&lt;/math&gt;

The noise generated at the resistor can transfer to the remaining circuit; the maximum noise power transfer happens with [[impedance matching]] when the [[Thévenin equivalent]] resistance of the remaining circuit is equal to the noise generating resistance. In this case each one of the two participating resistors dissipates noise in both itself and in the other resistor. Since only half of the source voltage drops across any one of these resistors, the resulting noise power is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
P = k_\text{B} \,T \Delta f
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the thermal noise power in watts. Notice that this is independent of the noise generating resistance.

The noise source can also be modeled by a current source in parallel with the resistor by taking the [[Norton equivalent]] that corresponds simply to dividing by ''R''. This gives the [[root mean square]] value of the current source as:

:&lt;math&gt;
i_n = \sqrt {{4 k_\text{B} T \Delta f } \over R}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thermal noise is intrinsic to all resistors and is not a sign of poor design or manufacture, although resistors may also have excess noise.

== Noise power in decibels ==
Signal power is often measured in [[dBm]] ([[decibels]] relative to 1 [[milliwatt]]). From the equation above, noise power in a resistor at [[room temperature]], in dBm, is then:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{dBm} = 10\ \log_{10}(k_\text{B} T \Delta f \times 1000)&lt;/math&gt;
where the factor of 1000 is present because the power is given in milliwatts, rather than watts. This equation can be simplified by separating the constant parts from the bandwidth:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{dBm} = 10\ \log_{10}(k_\text{B} T \times 1000) + 10\ \log_{10}(\Delta f)&lt;/math&gt;
which is more commonly seen approximated for room temperature (T = 300 K) as:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{dBm} = -174 + 10\ \log_{10}(\Delta f)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; is given in Hz; e.g., for a noise bandwidth of 40&amp;nbsp;MHz, &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; is 40,000,000.

Using this equation, noise power for different bandwidths is simple to calculate:

== Thermal noise on capacitors ==
Thermal noise on capacitors is referred to as ''kTC'' noise. Thermal noise in an [[RC circuit]] has an unusually simple expression, as the value of the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] (''R'') drops out of the equation. This is because higher ''R'' contributes to more filtering as well as to more noise.  The noise bandwidth of the RC circuit is 1/(4''RC''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kent H.|last=Lundberg|page=10|url=http://web.mit.edu/klund/www/papers/UNP_noise.pdf|title=Noise Sources in Bulk CMOS}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can substituted into the above formula to eliminate ''R''.  The mean-square and RMS noise voltage generated in such a filter are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.|last1=Sarpeshkar|first2=T.|last2=Delbruck|first3=C. A.|last3=Mead|doi=10.1109/101.261888|title=White noise in MOS transistors and resistors|journal=IEEE Circuits Devices Mag|pages=23-29|date=November 1993|url=http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~phasler/Courses/ECE6414/Unit1/Rahul_noise01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline {v_{n}^2} = k_\text{B} T / C
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v_{n} = \sqrt{ k_\text{B} T / C }.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thermal noise in the resistor accounts for 100% of ''kTC'' noise.

In the extreme case of the ''reset noise'' left on a capacitor by opening an ideal switch, the resistance is infinite, yet the formula still applies; however, now the RMS must be interpreted not as a time average, but as an average over many such reset events, since the voltage is constant when the bandwidth is zero.  In this sense, the Johnson noise of an RC circuit can be seen to be inherent, an effect of the thermodynamic distribution of the number of electrons on the capacitor, even without the involvement of a resistor.

The noise is not caused by the capacitor itself, but by the thermodynamic fluctuations of the amount of charge on the capacitor.  Once the capacitor is disconnected from a conducting circuit, the thermodynamic fluctuation is ''frozen'' at a random value with [[standard deviation]] as given above.

The reset noise of capacitive sensors is often a limiting noise source, for example in [[image sensor]]s.  As an alternative to the voltage noise, the reset noise on the capacitor can also be quantified as the [[electrical charge]] standard deviation, as

:&lt;math&gt;
Q_{n} = \sqrt{ k_\text{B} T C }.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the charge variance is &lt;math&gt;k_\text{B} T C&lt;/math&gt;, this noise is often called ''kTC noise''.

Any system in [[thermal equilibrium]] has [[state variable]]s with a mean [[energy]] of ''kT''/2 per [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]]. Using the formula for energy on a capacitor (''E''&amp;nbsp;= ½''CV''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), mean noise energy on a capacitor can be seen to also be ½''C''(''kT''/''C''), or also ''kT''/2.  Thermal noise on a capacitor can be derived from this relationship, without consideration of resistance.

The ''kTC'' noise is the dominant noise source at small capacitors.

== Generalized forms ==
The &lt;math&gt;4 k_\text{B} T R&lt;/math&gt; voltage noise described above is a special case for a purely resistive component for low frequencies.
In general, the thermal electrical noise continues to be related to resistive response in many more generalized electrical cases, as a consequence of the [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]]. Below a variety of generalizations are noted.
All of these generalizations share a common limitation, that they only apply in cases where the electrical component under consideration is purely [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] and linear.

=== Reactive impedances ===
Nyquist's original paper also provided the generalized noise for components having partly [[electrical reactance|reactive]] response, e.g., sources that contain capacitors or inductors.&lt;ref name=Nyquist/&gt; Such a component can be described by a frequency-dependent complex [[electrical impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z(f)&lt;/math&gt;. The formula for the [[power spectral density]] of the series noise voltage is
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{v_n v_n}(f) = 4 k_\text{B} T \eta(f) \operatorname{Re}[Z(f)].
&lt;/math&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;\eta(f)&lt;/math&gt; is simply equal to 1 except at very high frequencies, or near absolute zero (see below).

The real part of impedance, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}[Z(f)]&lt;/math&gt;, is in general frequency dependent and so the Johnson–Nyquist noise is not white noise.
The rms noise voltage over a span of frequencies &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; can be found by integration of the power spectral density:
:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\langle v_n^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\int_{f_1}^{f_2} S_{v_n v_n}(f) df}&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively, a parallel noise current can be used to describe Johnson noise, its [[power spectral density]] being
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{i_n i_n}(f) = 4 k_\text{B} T \eta(f) \operatorname{Re}[Y(f)].
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Y(f) = 1/Z(f)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electrical admittance]]; note that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}[Y(f)] = \operatorname{Re}[Z(f)]/|Z(f)|^2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Quantum effects at high frequencies or low temperatures ===
Nyquist also pointed out that quantum effects occur for very high frequencies or very low temperatures near absolute zero.&lt;ref name=Nyquist/&gt; The function &lt;math&gt;\eta(f)&lt;/math&gt; is in general given by
:&lt;math&gt;\eta(f) = \frac{hf/k_\text{B} T}{e^{hf/k_\text{B} T} - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]].

At very high frequencies &lt;math&gt;f \gtrsim k_\text{B} T/h&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;\eta(f)&lt;/math&gt; starts to exponentially decrease to zero. At room temperature this transition occurs in the terahertz, far beyond the capabilities of conventional electronics, and so it is valid to set &lt;math&gt;\eta(f)=1&lt;/math&gt; for conventional electronics work.

==== Relation to Planck's law ====
Nyquist's formula is essentially the same as that derived by Planck in 1901 for electromagnetic radiation of a blackbody in one dimension—i.e., it is the one-dimensional version of [[Planck's law|Planck's law of blackbody radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Microwave Photonics |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mg91BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |first1=V. J.|last1=Urick|first2=Keith J.|last2=Williams|first3=Jason D.|last3=McKinney}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a hot resistor will create electromagnetic waves on a [[transmission line]] just as a hot object will create electromagnetic waves in free space.

In 1946, [[Robert H. Dicke|Dicke]] elaborated on the relationship,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1063/1.1770483| volume = 17| issue = 7| pages = 268–275| last = Dicke| first = R. H.| title = The Measurement of Thermal Radiation at Microwave Frequencies| journal = Review of Scientific Instruments| date = 1946-07-01| pmid=20991753| bibcode = 1946RScI...17..268D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further connected it to properties of antennas, particularly the fact that the average [[antenna aperture]] over all different directions cannot be larger than &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2/(4\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, where λ is wavelength. This comes from the different frequency dependence of 3D versus 1D Planck's law.

=== Multiport electrical networks ===
[[Richard Q. Twiss]] extended Nyquist's formulas to multi-[[Port (circuit theory)|port]] passive electrical networks, including non-reciprocal devices such as [[circulator]]s and [[Isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1722048| title = Nyquist's and Thevenin's Theorems Generalized for Nonreciprocal Linear Networks| journal = Journal of Applied Physics| volume = 26| issue = 5| pages = 599| year = 1955| last1 = Twiss | first1 = R. Q.| bibcode = 1955JAP....26..599T}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thermal noise appears at every port, and can be described as random series voltage sources in series with each port. The random voltages at different ports may be correlated, and their amplitudes and correlations are fully described by a set of [[cross-spectral density]] functions relating the different noise voltages,
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{v_m v_n}(f) = 2 k_\text{B} T \eta(f) (Z_{mn}(f) + Z_{nm}(f)^*)
&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;Z_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; are the elements of the [[impedance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.
Again, an alternative description of the noise is instead in terms of parallel current sources applied at each port. Their cross-spectral density is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{i_m i_n}(f) = 2 k_\text{B} T \eta(f) (Y_{mn}(f) + Y_{nm}(f)^*)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{Z}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Admittance parameters|admittance matrix]].

=== Continuous electrodynamic media ===
&lt;!--
TODO in this section:
Mention foundational work by Kubo, Rytov
Mention applications such as generalized electrodynamic thermal transfer (nearfield, etc.)
Someone should write [[fluctuation electrodynamics]].
--&gt;
The full generalization of Nyquist noise is found in [[fluctuation electrodynamics]], which describes the noise [[current density]] inside continuous media with dissipative response in a continuous response function such as [[dielectric permittivity]] or [[magnetic permeability]].
The equations of fluctuation electrodynamics provide a common framework for describing both Johnson–Nyquist noise and free space [[blackbody radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:NintokuTomb.jpg|thumb|[[Daisen Kofun]], the largest of all kofun, one of many tumuli in the [[Mozu kofungun]], [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]], [[Osaka Prefecture]] (5th century)]]

{{Nihongo|'''''Kofun'''''|古墳|4=from [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] "ancient grave"}} are megalithic [[tomb]]s or [[tumulus|tumuli]] in [[Japan]], constructed between the early 3rd century and the early 7th century AD. The term Kofun is the origin of the name of the [[Kofun period]], which indicates the middle 3rd century to early-middle 6th century. Many Kofun have distinctive keyhole-shaped [[mound]]s ({{nihongo|3=zenpō-kōen fun|2=前方後円墳}}), which are unique to [[ancient Japan]]. The [[Mozu kofungun|Mozu]]-[[Furuichi kofungun|Furuichi]] kofungun or tumulus clusters have been proposed for inscription on the [[World Heritage Sites in Japan|UNESCO World Heritage List]], while [[Ishibutai Kofun]] is one of a number in [[Asuka-Fujiwara]] similarly residing on the [[World Heritage Sites in Japan#Tentative List|Tentative List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5570/ |title=Mozu-Furuichi Kofungun, Ancient Tumulus Clusters |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5097/ |title=Asuka-Fujiwara: Archaeological sites of Japan’s Ancient Capitals and Related Properties |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The kofun tumuli have assumed various shapes throughout history. The most common type of kofun is known as a {{nihongo|''zenpō-kōen-fun''|前方後円墳}}, which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above. There are also circular-type ({{nihongo|''empun''|円墳}}), "two conjoined rectangles" typed ({{nihongo|''zenpō-kōhō-fun''|前方後方墳}}), and square-type ({{nihongo|''hōfun''|方墳}}) kofun. Orientation of kofun is not specified. For example, in the Saki Kofun group, all of the circular parts are facing north, but there is no such formation in the Yanagimoto kofun group. [[Haniwa]], [[terracotta]] figures, were arrayed above and in the surroundings to delimit and protect the sacred areas.

Kofun range from several meters to over 400m long. The largest, which has been attributed to [[Emperor Nintoku]], is [[Daisen Kofun]] in [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture]].

The funeral chamber was located beneath the round part and comprised a group of megaliths. In 1972, the unlooted [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]] was found in [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka]], and some details of the discovery were revealed. Inside the tightly assembled rocks, white [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] plasters were pasted,  and colored pictures depict the 'Asuka Beauties' of the court as well as constellations. A stone coffin was placed in the chamber, and accessories, swords, and bronze mirrors were laid both inside and outside the coffin. The wall paintings have been designated [[List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)|national treasures]] and the grave goods as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|important cultural property]], while the tumulus is a [[List of Special Places of Scenic Beauty, Special Historic Sites and Special Natural Monuments|special historic site]].&lt;ref name="Agency for Cultural Affairs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=401&amp;item_id=2020 |title=Database of National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agency for Cultural Affairs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=9951 |title=Database of National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locations and number===

Kofun [[Tumulus|burial mounds]] and their remains have been found all over Japan, including remote islands such as [[Nishinoshima (Shimane)|Nishinoshima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iseki.ipc.shimane-u.ac.jp/search.php?&amp;search_kbn=city&amp;sitecitycode%5B%5D=58&amp;target=site&amp;order_item=siteshimpsiteno 島根県遺跡データベース　Archaeological Database of Shimane（Japanese）]&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 161,560 kofun tomb sites have been found as of 2001. [[Hyōgo Prefecture]] has the most of all prefectures (16,577 sites), and [[Chiba Prefecture]] has the second most (13,112 sites).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyogo-c.ed.jp/~shabun-bo/gyouseisituhp/top/kihonkousou/6(4).pdf 兵庫県教育委員会 兵庫県の遺跡・遺物数の全国的な位置（pdf file, Japanese）]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IshibutaiWithFigureSmallVersion2.jpg|thumb|The stone chamber of [[Ishibutai Kofun]], said to be the tomb of [[Soga no Umako]], [[Asuka-Fujiwara|Asuka]], [[Nara Prefecture]] (7th century)]]

===Yayoi period===
Most of the tombs of chiefs in the [[Yayoi period]] were square-shaped mounds surrounded by ditches. The most notable example in the late Yayoi period is Tatetsuki Mound Tomb in [[Kurashiki, Okayama]]. The mound is about 45 meters wide and 5 meters high and has a shaft chamber. Broken pieces of ''Tokushu-kidai'', cylindrical earthenware, were excavated around the mound.

Another prevalent type of Yayoi period tomb is the ''Yosumi tosshutsugata funkyūbo'', a square mound with protruding corners. These tombs were built in the [[San'in region]], a coastal area off the Sea of Japan. Unearthed articles indicate the existence of alliances between native tribes in the region.

===Early Kofun period===
One of the first keyhole-shaped kofun was built in the {{illm|Makimuku|ja|纒向型前方後円墳}} area,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/1654|title=たわらもと2013発掘速報展|last=Krako-kagi Archaeological Museum|first=|date=2013|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the southeastern part of the Nara Basin. {{illm|Hashihaka Kofun|ja|箸墓古墳}}, which was built in the middle of the 3rd century AD, is 280 meters long and 30 meters high. Its scale is obviously different from previous Yayoi tombs. During the next three decades, about 10 kofun were built in the area, which are now called as the ''Makimuku Kofun Group''. A wooden coffin was placed on the bottom of a shaft, and the surrounding walls were built up by flat stones. Finally, megalithic stones formed the roof. [[Bronze mirrors]], iron swords, [[magatama]], clay vessels and other artifacts were found in good condition in undisturbed tombs. Some scholars assume the buried person of ''Hashihaka kofun'' was the shadowy ancient Queen [[Himiko]] of [[Yamataikoku]], mentioned in the Chinese historical texts. According to the books, Japan was called [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]], which was the confederation of numerous small tribes or countries. The construction of gigantic kofun is the result of the relatively centralized governmental structure in the Nara Basin, possibly the origin of the Yamato polity and the Imperial lineage of Japan.

===Mid-Kofun period===
During the 5th century AD, the construction of keyhole kofun began in [[Yamato Province]]; continued in Kawachi, where gigantic kofun, such as Daisen Kofun of the Emperor Nintoku, were built; and then throughout the country (except for the [[Tōhoku region]]). 
The proliferation of keyhole kofun is generally assumed to be evidence of the Yamato court's expansion in this age. However, some argue that it simply shows the spreading of culture based on progress in distribution, and has little to do with a political breakthrough. In recent years, South Korea has begun to allocate more resources toward archaeology, and keyhole tombs have been found around the Yeongsan River basin, during the mid-Baekje Era. The keyhole tombs that have thus far been discovered on the Korean peninsula, were built between the 5th and the 6th centuries AD.&lt;ref name="yoshii"&gt;Yoshii, Hideo (Kyoto University). [http://www.international.ucla.edu/korea/pdfs/YoshiiPaperFinal.pdf "Keyhole-shaped tombs in Korean Peninsula"].&lt;/ref&gt; There remains question over whether the tombs were made for Japanese aristocrats loyal to Baekje, Japanese merchants who controlled the region, or a class independent from both Baekje and Yamato Japan.&lt;ref name="yoshii"/&gt;

Keyhole-shaped kofun disappeared in the late 6th century AD, probably due to the drastic reformation in the Yamato court, where ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' records the introduction of [[Buddhism]] during this era.

'''''Les Annales du Théâtre et de la Musique''''' ("The Annals of Theatre and Music") was an annual French periodical which covered French dramatic and lyric theatre for 42&amp;nbsp;years, from 1875 to 1916. The volumes also covered concert series and necrology. It was co-edited by Édouard Noël (1848–1926) and Edmond Stoullig (1845–1918) and was published in Paris by Charpentier from 1876 to 1895 and Berger-Levrault in 1896. Beginning in 1897 it was published annually by Paul Ollendorff (with Stoullig as the sole editor) up to 1914 with the penultimate volume published in 1916 (covering the years 1914–1915) and the final volume in 1918 (covering the year 1916). A total of 41 volumes were published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000678582 Holdings] at [[HathiTrust]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=Stoullig%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts "Stoullig"] at the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32694497t/date.r=.langEN Holdings] at [[Gallica]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/annales-du-theatre-et-de-la-musique/oclc/1772186/editions?sd=desc&amp;referer=br&amp;se=yr&amp;editionsView=true&amp;fq= Listings] at [[WorldCat]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial prefaces were contributed by, among others, [[Émile Zola]] (1878), [[Victorin de Joncières]] (1880), [[Émile Perrin]] (1882), [[Charles Garnier (architect)| Charles Garnier]] (1883), [[Charles Gounod]] (1885), [[Jules Barbier]] (1886), [[Henri Meilhac]] (1889), [[Ludovic Halévy]] (1890), [[Émile Faguet]] (1897), [[Albert Carré]] (1899), [[Catulle Mendès]] (1902), [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] (1904), [[Jean Richepin]] (1905), [[Maurice Donnay]] (1908), [[Robert de Flers]] (1911), and [[Léon Blum]] (1912).

In the [[historically informed performance]] movement, musicians perform [[classical music]] using restored or replicated versions of the instruments for which it was originally written.  Often performances by such musicians are said to be "on authentic instruments".

This article consists of a list of such instruments, including both instruments that are now obsolete and early versions of instruments that continued to be used in later classical music. This list only includes [[woodwind]], [[keyboard instruments|keyboard]], and [[Brass instruments|brass]] instruments.

'''Mechanical, electrical and plumbing''' ('''MEP''') refers to these aspects of building design and construction.  In commercial buildings these aspects are often designed by an engineering firm specializing in MEP. MEP design is important for design decision-making, accurate documentation, performance and cost-estimation, construction planning, managing and operating the resulting facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEP makes engineering projects faster and reduces cost|url=https://www.ny-engineers.com/blog/how-mep-integration-makes-engineering-projects-faster-and-less-expensive|website=ny-engineers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Design and documentation ==
As with other aspect of buildings, MEP [[Technical drawing|drafting]], design and documentation were traditionally done manually.  [[Computer-aided design]] had some advantages over this, in some instances including [[3D modeling]].  [[Building information modeling]] provides holistic design and parametric change management of the MEP design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setty.com/pdf_presentations/RC_Whitepaper_Revit_Systems_BIM_for_MEP_Engine.pdf|title=Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing|website=Setty.com|publisher=Revit MEP:BIM for MEP Engineering|date=12 February 2013|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814101043/http://www.setty.com/pdf_presentations/RC_Whitepaper_Revit_Systems_BIM_for_MEP_Engine.pdf|archivedate=14 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of religion}}
[[Millenarianism]] has been found through history among people who rally around often-apocalyptic religious prophecies that predict a return to power, the defeat of enemies, and/or the accumulation of wealth. These movements have been especially common among people living under [[colonialism]] or other forces that disrupt previous social arrangements.

The phrase "millennialist movement" has been used by scholars in anthropology and history to describe the common features of these religious phenomena when viewed as [[social movements]], and has most often been used to describe the social movements that have taken place in colonized societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burridge|first=Kenelm|title=New Heaven, New Earth: A study of Millenarian Activities|year=1969|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity itself can be seen as originating in a millenarian movement among [[Jewish people]] living under Roman rule, although its characteristics as a social movement quickly changed as it spread through the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Book of Revelation]] also predicts a thousand-year reign of [[Jesus]] prior to the defeat of [[Satan]]. 

Some millenarian movements include:
* The [[Ghost Dance]] movement among Native Americans.
* [[Tenskwatawa]] the "Shawnee Prophet" called for return to ancestral ways and defeat of European colonial power.
* The [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] cattle-killing movement of [[South Africa]], led by the prophetess [[Nongqawuse]].
* The [[Righteous Harmony Society]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] was a Chinese movement reacting against Western colonialism.
* The [[God Worshipping Society]] of the [[Taiping Rebellion]], which fused Anglo-American [[Protestant]] Christian and Chinese elements into a movement that focused the resentment of [[Han Chinese]] against the ruling [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]]. [[Hong Xiuquan]], their leader, proclaimed himself to be the second son of [[God]] and brother of [[Jesus Christ]], as well as the [[Son of Heaven|''Tian Zi'' (Son of Heaven)]], a sacred title of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]]. He would establish the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], which controlled much of southern China from 1851-1864.  
* The [[Maji Maji Rebellion]] was influenced by an African [[spirit medium]] who gave his followers war medicine that he said would turn German bullets into water.
* [[Bábism]] and [[Bahá'í faith|Bahá'ism]], two [[Perennial philosophy|perennialist]] movements founded in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persia]] by self-proclaimed prophets.
* The [[Mahdist State]] in [[Sudan]], which was established by [[Muhammad Ahmad]], who proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]] and led a [[Mahdist War|jihad]] against the [[History of Sudan (1821-1885)|Khedive of Egypt's rule over the Sudan]] and the [[British Empire]]. 
* [[Chilembwe uprising]] - a 1915 uprising in [[Nyasaland]] led by a millenarian priest
* The Melanesian [[John Frum]] [[cargo cult]] believed in a return of their ancestors brought by Western technology.
* [[Burkhanism]] was an [[Altay people|Altay]]an movement led by a visionary that reacted against [[Russification]].
* The [[Battle of Kuruyuki]] was the 1892 attempt of the [[Eastern Bolivian Guarani]] to combat Christianity and Bolivian settlers.   
* The [[Guaycuru|Guaycuruan]]-speaking [[Toba people|Toba]] attempted to regain control of the [[Gran Chaco]] in Argentina in 1904.
* The [[Tepehuán Revolt]] in 1620s Mexico was an attempt to expel Spanish colonists and priests and return to traditional ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1663">In [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, '''mineral absorption''', also called '''mineral uptake''' is the way in which [[mineral]]s enter the [[cell (biology)|cellular]] material, typically following the same pathway as [[water]]. In plants, the entrance portal for mineral uptake is usually through the [[root]]s.(Roots, 2005) Some mineral [[ion]]s diffuse in-between the [[cell (biology)|cells]]. In contrast to water, some minerals are actively taken up by plant cells. Mineral [[nutrient]] [[concentration]] in roots may be 10,000 times more than in surrounding [[soil]]. During transport throughout a plant, minerals can exit [[xylem]] and enter cells that require them. Mineral ions cross [[plasma membrane]]s by a [[chemiosmotic]] mechanism. Plants absorb minerals in ionic form: [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[phosphate]] (HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[potassium]] [[ions]] (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); all have difficulty crossing a charged plasma membrane.

It has long been known plants expend [[energy]] to actively take up and concentrate mineral ions. [[Proton pump]] [[hydrolyze]]s [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) to transport H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions out of cell; this sets up an [[electrochemical gradient]] that causes positive ions to flow into cells. 
Negative ions are carried across the plasma membrane in conjunction with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions diffuse down their concentration gradient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2601">[[File:Bust Serapis Chiaramonti.jpg|thumb|[[Serapis]] wearing the modius]]
The '''modius''' is a type of flat-topped cylindrical headdress or crown found in [[ancient Egyptian art]] and art of the [[Greco-Roman world]]. The name was given by modern scholars based on its resemblance to the jar used as a [[ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman unit of dry measure]],&lt;ref&gt;Judith Lynn Sebesta and [[Larissa Bonfante]], ''The World of Roman Costume'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 245; Irene Bald Romano, ''Classical Sculpture: Catalogue of the Cypriot, Greek, And Roman Stone Sculpture in the University Of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 2006), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; but it probably does represent a grain-measure, and symbolized powers over fecundity in those wearing it.

The modius is worn by certain deities, including [[Mut]],&lt;ref&gt;Betsy M. Bryan, "A Newly Discovered Statue of a Queen from the Reign of Amenhotep III," in ''Servant of Mut: Studies in Honor of Richard A. Fazzini'' (Brill, 2007), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusinian deities]] and their Roman counterparts, the [[Artemis of Ephesus|Ephesian Artemis]] and certain other forms of the goddess,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Didyma: Apollo's Oracle, Cult, and Companions'' pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hecate]], and [[Serapis]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, ''Hellenistic Sculpture: The Styles of ca. 331–200 B.C.'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; On some deities it represents fruitfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Fontenrose, ''Didyma'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought to be a form mostly restricted to supernatural beings in art, and by rarely worn in real life, with two probable exceptions.  A tall modius is part of the complex headdress used for portraits of Egyptian queens, ornamented variously with symbols, vegetative motifs, and the [[uraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, "A Newly Discovered Statue of a Queen," p 36ff.; Paul Edmund Stanwick, ''Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek Kings As Egyptian Pharaohs'' (University of Texas Press, 2002), p. 35 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the distinctive headdress of [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] priests.&lt;ref&gt;Romano, ''Classical Sculpture,'' p. 294; Lucinda Dirven, ''The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria'' (Brill, 1999), pp. 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12476">'''NAPLPS''' ('''N'''orth '''A'''merican '''P'''resentation '''L'''evel '''P'''rotocol '''S'''yntax) is a [[Vector graphics markup language|graphics language]] for use originally with [[videotex]] and [[teletext]] services. NAPLPS was developed from the [[Telidon]] system developed in Canada, with a small number of additions from [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]. The basics of NAPLPS were later used as the basis for several other [[microcomputer]]-based graphics systems.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Viewtron testing area.jpg|thumb|left|NAPLPS graphics on [[Viewtron]]]] --&gt;

The Canadian [[Communications Research Centre]] (CRC), based in [[Ottawa]], had been working on various graphics systems since the late 1960s, much of it led by Herb Bown.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;Cynthia Boyko, [http://www.friendsofcrc.ca/Projects/Telidon/Telidon.html "Telidon"], Friends of the CRC, 14 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1970s they turned their attention to building out a system of "picture description instructions", which encoded graphics commands as a text stream. Graphics were encoded as a series of instructions (graphics primitives) each represented by a single [[ASCII]] character. Graphic coordinates were encoded in multiple 6 bit strings of XY coordinate data, flagged to place them in the printable ASCII range so that they could be transmitted with conventional text transmission techniques. [[Shift Out and Shift In characters|ASCII SI/SO]] characters were used to differentiate the text from graphic portions of a transmitted "page". These instructions were decoded by separate programs to produce graphics output, on a [[plotter]] for instance. Other work produced a fully interactive version. In 1975, the CRC gave a contract to Norpak to develop an interactive graphics terminal that could decode the instructions and display them on a color display.

During this period, a number of companies were developing the first [[teletext]] systems, notably the [[BBC]]'s [[Ceefax]] system. Ceefax encoded character data into the lines in the [[vertical blanking interval]]  of normal [[television]] signals where they could not be seen on-screen, and then used a buffer and decoder in the user's television to convert these into "pages" of text on the display. The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] quickly introduced their own [[ORACLE (teletext)|ORACLE]] system, and the two organizations subsequently agreed to use a single standard, the "Broadcast Teletext Specification".

At about the same time, other organizations were developing [[videotex]] systems, similar to teletext except they used modems to transmit their data instead of television signals. This was potentially slower and used up a telephone line, but had the major advantage of allowing the user to transmit data back to the sender.  The UK's [[General Post Office]] developed a system using the Ceefax/ORACLE standard, launching it as [[Prestel]], while France prepared the first steps for its ultimately very successful [[Minitel]] system, using a rival display standard called [[Antiope (teletext)|Antiope]].

By 1977 the Norpak system was running, and from this work the CRC decided to create their own teletext/videotext system. Unlike the systems being rolled out in Europe, the CRC decided from the start that the system should be able to run on any combination of communications links. For instance, it could use the vertical blanking interval to send data to the user, and a modem to return selections to the servers. It could be used in a one-way or two-way system.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt;

In teletext mode, character codes were sent to users' televisions by encoding them as dot patterns in the vertical blanking interval of the video signal. Various technical "tweaks" and details of the [[NTSC]] signals used by North American televisions allowed the downstream videotex channel to increase to 600 bit/s, about twice that used in the European systems. In videotext mode, [[Bell 202]] modems were typical, offering a 1,200 bit/s download rate. A set top box attached to the TV decoded these signals back into text and graphic pages, which the user could select among. 

The system was publicly launched as '''Telidon''' on August 15, 1978. Compared to the European standards, the CRC system was faster, bi-directional, and offered real graphics as opposed to simple [[character graphic]]s. The downside of the system was that it required much more advanced decoders, typically featuring [[Zilog Z80]] or [[Motorola 6809]] processors with RGB and/or RF output. The [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada]] (then Department of Communications) launched a four-year plan to fund public roll-outs of the technology in an effort to spur the development of a commercial Telidon system.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt;

[[AT&amp;T Corporation]] was so impressed by Telidon that they decided to join the project. They added a number of useful extensions, notably the ability to define original graphics commands (''macro'') and character sets (''DRCS''). They also tabled algorithms for proportionally spaced text, which greatly improved the quality of the displayed pages. A joint [[Canadian Standards Association|CSA]]/[[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] working group (X3L2.1) revised the specifications, which were submitted for standardization. In 1983, they became CSA T500 and ANSI X3.110, or NAPLPS. The data encoding system was also standardized as the [[NABTS]] (North American Broadcast Teletext Specification) protocol.

Business models for Telidon services were poorly developed. Unlike the UK, where teletext was supported by one of only two large companies whose whole revenue model was based on a read-only medium (television), in [[North America]] Telidon was being offered by companies who worked on a subscriber basis.

== One-way systems ==

Telidon-based [[teletext]] was tested in a few North American trials in the early 1980s &amp;mdash; [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] IRIS, [[TVOntario]], [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS]]-sponsored [[Project IDA]], to name a few.

NAPLPS was also part of the [[NABTS]] teletext standard, for the encoding and display of teletext pages.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, [[SportsChannel]] ran a service called [[Sports Plus Network]], which ran sports news and scores while SportsChannel was not otherwise on the air. The screens, which frequently featured team logos or likenesses of players in addition to text, were drawn entirely with NAPLPS graphics and resembled the loading of [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] pages over a modem, though slightly faster.

== Two-way systems ==

Various two-way systems using NAPLPS appeared in North America in the early 1980s. The biggest North American examples were [[Knight Ridder]]'s [[Viewtron]] (based in [[Miami]]) and the [[Los Angeles Times]]' [[Gateway (online service)|Gateway]] service (based in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]). Both used the [[AT&amp;T Sceptre|Sceptre]] NAPLPS terminal from AT&amp;T. The Sceptre contained a slow modem that connected over the consumer's telephone line to host computers. The Sceptre was expensive whether purchased or rented. Despite huge investments by their parent companies, neither Viewtron nor Gateway lasted into the second half of the decade. Another system - Keycom - was developed by a joint venture of Honeywell, Centel (since acquired by Sprint) and the Chicago Sun Times newspaper. Keycom used a proprietary NAPLPS terminal device.

Other early-1980s NAPLPS technology was deployed in Canada, both as a way for rural Canadians to get news and weather information and as the platform for touchscreen information kiosks. In [[Vancouver]] these were featured at [[Expo 86]].  The kiosks became ubiquitous in [[Toronto]] under the name ''Teleguide,'' and were deployed in many shopping centres and at major tourist attractions. The latter city was the North American nexus of NAPLPS and the home of [[Norpak]], the most successful of NAPLPS-oriented developers. Norpak created and sold hardware and software for NAPLPS development and display. [[TVOntario]] also developed NAPLPS content creation software.

London, Ontario - based Cableshare used NAPLPS as the basis of touch-screen information kiosks for shopping malls, the flagship of which was deployed at Toronto's [[Eaton Centre]]. The system relied on an 8085-based microcomputer which drove several NAPLPS terminals fitted with touch screens, all communicating via [[Datapac]] to a back end database. The system offered news, weather and sports information along with shopping mall guides and coupons. Cableshare also developed and sold a leading NAPLPS page creation utility called the "Picture Painter."

In the late 1980s, [[Tribune Media Services]] (TMS) and the [[Associated Press]] operated a cable television channel called AP News Plus that provided NAPLPS-based news screens to [[cable television]] subscribers in many U.S. cities. The news pages were created and edited by TMS staffers working on an [[Atex (software)|Atex]] editing system in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]], and sent by satellite to NAPLPS decoder devices located at the local cable television companies. Among the firms providing technology to TMS and the Associated Press for the AP News Plus channel was [[Minneapolis]]-based Electronic Publishers Inc. (1985–1988).

In 1981, two amateur radio operators (VE3FTT and VE3GQW) received special permission from the Canadian Department of Communications to carry out on-air experiments using NAPLPS syntax which was technically not legal at the time because it was a "coded transmission".  Following their report on the success of the tests, the DOC then permitted general use of NAPLPS on amateur radioteletype.  This was reported in the ARRL Radio Handbook for several years following.

Between 1988 and 1994, [[Bell Canada]] offered a [[Modem|dial-up]] Telidon service called [[Alex (videotex service)|Alex]], similar in spirit to the French [[Minitel]], with the telephone directory its principal information offering.

== Decline ==
NAPLPS lived on into the early 1990s as the graphical basis for the [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] online service. Some [[bulletin board system|bulletin board]]s were able to serve NAPLPS content to callers on their 1200 and 2400 bit/s [[modem]]s. But the technology's chief advantage in an era of slow telecommunication - its ability to encode complex graphics in terse object commands - became moot as data communication speeds increased and [[raster graphics]] compression became popular.

== Legacy ==
In the 1980s the [[Graphical Kernel System]] (GKS) [[Library (computing)|library]], based on a 1970s specification with a similar basic geometry and command structure to NAPLPS, was widely implemented on microcomputers, and became the basis of [[Digital Research]]'s "GSX" graphics system used in their [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]. GKS was later extended into a 3D version, and additions to this resulted in [[PHIGS]] (Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System), a competitor to [[OpenGL]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24461">'''Nudge''' is a concept in [[behavioral science]], [[political theory]] and [[behavioral economics]] which proposes [[positive reinforcement]] and indirect suggestions as ways to [[Social influence|influence]] the behavior and [[decision making]] of groups or individuals. Nudging contrasts with other ways to achieve compliance, such as [[education]], [[legislation]] or [[enforcement]]. The concept has influenced British and American politicians. Several nudge units exist around the world at the national level (UK, Germany, Japan and others) as well as at the international level (e.g. [[OECD]], [[World Bank]], [[United Nations|UN]]).

==Definition of a nudge==
[[File:Nudge_Toilet_1.jpg|thumb|Example of a nudge: a housefly painted onto the ceramic of a [[urinal]] in a men's public toilet]]
The first formulation of the term and associated principles was developed in [[cybernetics]] by James Wilk before 1995 and described by Brunel University academic D. J. Stewart as "the art of the nudge" (sometimes referred to as micronudges&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Wilk, J. | year=1999 | chapter=Mind, nature and the emerging science of change: An introduction to metamorphology. | editor1=G. Cornelis|editor2=S. Smets|editor3=J. Van Bendegem | title=EINSTEIN MEETS MAGRITTE: An Interdisciplinary Reflection on Science, Nature, Art, Human Action and Society: Metadebates on science | volume=6 | pages=71–87 | publisher=Springer Netherlands | doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2245-2_6| isbn=978-90-481-5242-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It also drew on methodological influences from clinical [[psychotherapy]] tracing back to [[Gregory Bateson]], including contributions from [[Milton Erickson]], [[Paul Watzlawick|Watzlawick]], [[John Weakland|Weakland]] and Fisch, and [[Bill O'Hanlon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=O'Hanlon, B.|author2=Wilk, J. | year=1987 | title=Shifting contexts : The generation of effective psychotherapy. | publisher=New York, N.Y.: Guilford Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this variant, the nudge is a microtargetted design geared towards a specific group of people, irrespective of the scale of intended intervention.

In 2008, [[Richard Thaler]] and [[Cass Sunstein]]'s book ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]'' brought nudge theory to prominence. It also gained a following among US and UK politicians, in the private sector and in [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.shponline.co.uk/features-content/full/cpd-article-nudge-nudge-think-think Dr. Jennifer Lunt and Malcolm Staves]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors refer to influencing behaviour without coercion as [[libertarian paternalism]] and the influencers as choice architects.&lt;ref name=speak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lucidez.pe/economia/richard-thaler-y-el-auge-de-la-economia-conductual-por-marco-carrasco/|title=Richard Thaler y el auge de la Economía Conductual|last=Carrasco-Villanueva|first=Marco|date=2017-10-18|language=es|work=Lucidez|access-date=2018-10-31|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as:

{{quote|''A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the [[choice architecture]] that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not.''}}

In this form, drawing on [[behavioral economics]], the nudge is more generally applied to influence behaviour.

One of the most frequently cited examples of a nudge is the etching of the image of a housefly into the men's room [[Urinal|urinals]] at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which is intended to "improve the aim".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A nudge makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular choice, or behave in a particular way, by altering the environment so that automatic cognitive processes are triggered to favour the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual’s behaviour is not always in alignment with their intentions (termed a [[value-action gap]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common knowledge that humans are not fully rational beings; that is, people will often do something that is not in their own self interest, even when they are aware that their actions are not in their best interest.&lt;ref name="Kosters"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosters|first1=M|last2=Van der Heijden|first2=J|title=From mechanism to virtue: evaluating nudge theory|journal=Evaluation|date=2015|volume=21|issue=3|page=276–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, when hungry, dieters often under-estimate their ability to lose weight, and their intentions to eat healthy can be temporarily weakened until they are satiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordgren|first1=L.|last2=Van der Pligt|first2=J.|last3=van Harreveld|first3=F.|title=The instability of health cognitions: visceral states influence self-efficacy and related health beliefs|journal=Health Psychology|date=2008|volume=27|issue=6|page=722–727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaler and Sunstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; describe two distinct systems for processing information as to why people sometimes act against their own self-interest: System 1 is fast, automatic, and highly susceptible to environmental influences; System 2 processing is slow, reflective, and takes into account explicit goals and intentions.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt; When situations are overly complex or overwhelming for an individual’s cognitive capacity, or when an individual is faced with time-constraints or other pressures, System 1 processing takes over decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; System 1 processing relies on various judgmental heuristics to make decisions, resulting in faster decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this can also lead to sub-optimal decisions. In fact, Thaler and Sunstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; trace maladaptive behaviour to situations in which System 1 processing over-rides an individual’s explicit values and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well documented that habitual behaviour is resistant to change without a disruption to the environmental cues that trigger that behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudging techniques aim to use judgmental heuristics to our advantage. In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a nudge is switching the placement of junk food in a store, so that fruit and other healthy options are located next to the cash register, while junk food is relocated to another part of the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroese|first1=F.|last2=Marchiori|first2=D.|last3=de Ridder|first3=D.|title=Nudging healthy food choices: a field experiment at the train station|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=2016|volume=38|issue=2|page=e133–e137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of nudges==
Nudges are small changes in environment that are easy and inexpensive to implement.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several different techniques exist for nudging, including defaults, social proof heuristics, and increasing the salience of the desired option.

A default option is the option an individual automatically receives if he or she does nothing. People are more likely to choose a particular option if it is the default option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Pichert &amp; Katsikopoulos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pichert|first1=D.|last2=Katsikopoulos|first2=K.V.|title=Green defaults: information presentation and pro-environmental behavior|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|date=2008|volume=28|page=63–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a greater number of consumers chose the [[renewable energy]] option for electricity when it was offered as the default option.

A social proof heuristic refers to the tendency for individuals to look at the behavior of other people to help guide their own behavior. Studies have found some success in using social proof heuristics to nudge individuals to make healthier food choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheung|first1=T.|last2=Kroese|first2=F.|last3=Fennis|first3=B.|last4=de Ridder|first4=D.|title=The hunger games: using hunger to promote healthy choices in self-control conflicts|journal=Appetite|date=2017|volume=116|page=401–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an individual’s attention is drawn towards a particular option, that option will become more salient to the individual, and he or she will be more likely to choose to that option.  As an example, in [[snack]] shops at train stations in the Netherlands, consumers purchased more fruit and [[healthy diet|healthy snack]] options when they were relocated next to the cash register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroese|first1=F.|last2=Marchiori|first2=D.|last3=de Ridder|first3=D.|title=Nudging healthy food choices: a field experiment at the train station|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=2016|volume=38|issue=2|page=e133–e137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of theory==
In 2008, the United States appointed Sunstein, who helped develop the theory, as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]].&lt;ref name=speak&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favorite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|publisher=''[[The Spectator]]''|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable applications of nudge theory include the formation of the British [[Behavioural Insights Team]] in 2010.

In Australia, the government of New South Wales established a Behavioural Insights community of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bi.dpc.nsw.gov.au/|title=Behavioural Insights Unit - What's new in the Behavioural Insights Unit|first=corporateName=Department of Premier and Cabinet; address=1 Farrer Place, Sydney, NSW, 2000; contact=+61 2 9228|last=5555|website=bi.dpc.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudge theory has also been applied to [[business management]] and [[corporate culture]], such as in relation to [[Environment, health and safety|health, safety and environment]] (HSE) and human resources. Regarding its application to HSE, one of the primary goals of nudge is to achieve a "zero accident culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rydermarsh.co.uk/pdfs/SHP.0112.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cast No Shadow|website=Rydermarsh.co.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leading [[Silicon Valley]] companies are forerunners in applying nudge theory in corporate setting. These companies are using nudges in various forms to increase productivity and happiness of employees. Recently, further companies are gaining interest in using what is called "nudge management" to improve the productivity of their white-collar workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Philip|last2=Freibichler|first2=Wolfgang|year=2017|title=Nudge management: applying behavioural science to increase knowledge worker productivity|journal=Journal of Organization Design|volume=6:4|pages=|doi=10.1186/s41469-017-0014-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral insights and nudges are currently used in many countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carrasco-Villanueva |first=Marco |editor=上海社会科学院 [Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences]|title=2016上海青年汉学家研修计划论文集|language=zh|publisher=中国社会科学出版社 [China Social Sciences Press]|date=2016 |pages=368–392 |chapter=中国的环境公共政策：一个行为经济学的选择 [Environmental Public Policies in China: An Opportunity for Behavioral Economics]|isbn=978-1-234-56789-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Nudging has also been criticised. Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation [[The King's Fund]], has said: "We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behaviour changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/unhealthy-lifestyles-here-to-stay-in-spite-of-costly-campaigns-1055693.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Unhealthy lifestyles here to stay, in spite of costly campaigns | first=Nina | last=Lakhani | date=December 7, 2008 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cass Sunstein has responded to critiques at length in his ''The Ethics of Influence''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TlvWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=ethics+of+influence+sunstein#v=onepage&amp;q=ethics%20of%20influence%20sunstein&amp;f=false|title=The Ethics of Influence: Government in the Age of Behavioral Science|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|date=2016-08-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107140707|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the case in favor of nudging against charges that nudges diminish [[autonomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Christian|date=2015-10-12|title=On the Ethics of Public Nudging: Autonomy and Agency|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2672970|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;, threaten [[dignity]], violate liberties, or reduce [[welfare]]. He further defended nudge theory in his ''Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Rx3qAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300212693|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by arguing that [[choice architecture]] is inevitable and that some form of paternalism cannot be avoided.

Wilkinson for example charges nudges for being manipulative, while others such as Yeung question their scientific credibility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Karen|date=2012-01-01|title=Nudge as Fudge|journal=The Modern Law Review|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=122–148|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.2012.00893.x|issn=1468-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Public opinion on the ethicality of nudges has also been shown to be susceptible to “partisan nudge bias”.&lt;ref name="NT"&gt;[https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/todd_rogers/files/tannenbaum_fox_rogers.2017.pdf Tannenbaum, D., Fox, C. R., &amp; Rogers, T. (2017). On the misplaced politics of behavioural policy interventions. Nature Human Behaviour , 1 (10 July 2017), 1-7.]&lt;/ref&gt; Research from David Tannenbaum, Craig R. Fox, and Todd Rogers (2017) found that adults and policymakers in the United States found behavioral policies to be more ethical when they aligned with their own political leanings.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt; Conversely, people found these same mechanisms to be more unethical when they differed from their politics.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt; The researchers also found that nudges are not inherently partisan: when evaluating behavioral policies absent of political cues, people across the political spectrum were alike in their assessments.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt;

Some, such as Hausman &amp; Welch&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hausman|first=Daniel M.|last2=Welch|first2=Brynn|date=2010-03-01|title=Debate: To Nudge or Not to Nudge*|journal=Journal of Political Philosophy|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=123–136|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9760.2009.00351.x|issn=1467-9760}}&lt;/ref&gt; have inquired whether nudging should be permissible on grounds of (distributive{{clarify|date=February 2018}}) justice; Lepenies &amp; Malecka &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepenies|first=Robert|last2=Małecka|first2=Magdalena|date=2015-09-01|title=The Institutional Consequences of Nudging – Nudges, Politics, and the Law|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=427–437|doi=10.1007/s13164-015-0243-6|issn=1878-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned whether nudges are compatible with the rule of law. Similarly, legal scholars have discussed the role of nudges and the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alemanno|first=A.|last2=Spina|first2=A.|date=2014-04-01|title=Nudging legally: On the checks and balances of behavioral regulation|url=https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/12/2/429/710410/Nudging-legally-On-the-checks-and-balances-of|journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=429–456|doi=10.1093/icon/mou033|issn=1474-2640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kemmerer|first=Alexandra|last2=Möllers|first2=Christoph|last3=Steinbeis|first3=Maximilian|last4=Wagner|first4=Gerhard|date=2016-07-15|title=Choice Architecture in Democracies: Exploring the Legitimacy of Nudging - Preface|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2810229|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral economists such as Bob Sugden have pointed out that the underlying normative benchmark of nudging is still [[homo economicus]], despite the proponents' claim to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugden|first=Robert|date=2017-06-01|title=Do people really want to be nudged towards healthy lifestyles?|journal=International Review of Economics|language=en|volume=64|issue=2|pages=113–123|doi=10.1007/s12232-016-0264-1|issn=1865-1704}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been remarked that nudging is also a [[euphemism]] for [[psychological manipulation]] as practiced in [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/papers/pdf/Sunstein_809.pdf|format=PDF|title=NUDGING AND CHOICE ARCHITECTURE: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS|author=Cass R.

There exists an anticipation and, simultaneously, implicit criticism of the nudge theory in works of Hungarian social psychologists who emphasize the active participation in the nudge of its target (Ferenc Merei)&lt;ref&gt;MÉREI Ferenc (1987): A perem-helyzet egyik változata: a szociálpszichológiai kontúr (A variant of the edge-position: the contour socialpsychological); Pszichológia (1987), 1, pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;, Laszlo Garai&lt;ref&gt;Garai L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10448">The '''Orton-Gillingham''' Approach to [[Reading (activity)|reading]] instruction was developed in the early-20th century.

It is language-based, multisensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, [[cognitive]], and flexible.&lt;ref&gt;The structured flexibility of Orton-GillinghamBB Sheffield - Annals of Dyslexia, 1991 - Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orton-Gillingham Approach has been in use since the 1930s.  An intensive, sequential [[phonics]]-based system teaches the basics of word formation before whole meanings. The method accommodates and utilizes three learning modalities, or pathways, through which people learn&amp;mdash;visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Unlike some scripted and rigid reading programs, the Orton-Gillingham Approach is a system that allows for flexibility.

== Orton and Gillingham ==

[[Samuel Orton|Samuel Torrey Orton]] (1879&amp;ndash;1948), a neuropsychiatrist and [[pathologist]] at [[Columbia University]], brought together neuroscientific information and principles of remediation. As early as the 1920s, he had extensively studied children with the kind of language processing difficulties now commonly associated with [[dyslexia]] and had formulated a set of teaching principles and practices for such children.

[[Anna Gillingham]] (1878&amp;ndash;1963) was an [[educator]] and [[psychologist]] at Teachers College, [[Columbia University]].  Working with Dr. Orton, she trained teachers and compiled and published instructional materials. Gillingham combined Orton’s teaching methods with her analysis of the structure of the English/American language and with Bessie Stillman, she wrote what has become the Orton–Gillingham manual: Remedial Training for Children with Specific Disability in Reading, Spelling and Penmanship. First published in 1935/6, this work is updated and republished regularly.

== Features of the Approach ==

'''Language-based''': The Orton-Gillingham approach is based on a technique of studying and teaching language, understanding the nature of human language, the mechanisms involved in learning, and the language-learning processes in individuals.

'''Multisensory''': Orton-Gillingham teaching sessions are action-oriented and involve constant interaction between the teacher and the student and the simultaneous use of multiple sensory input channels reinforcing each other for optimal learning. Using auditory, visual, and kinesthetic elements, all language skills taught are reinforced by having the student listen, speak, read and write. For example, a dyslexic learner is taught to see the letter A, say its name and sound and write it in the air – all at the same time. The approach requires intense instruction with ample practice.
The use of multiple input channels is thought to enhance memory storage and retrieval by providing multiple "triggers" for memory.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Gordon. Can Neuroscience Help to Demystify Dyslexia?  Schwab Learning. Retrieved from http://www.schwablearning.org/articles.aspx?r=430 October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structured, Sequential, and Cumulative''': The Orton-Gillingham teacher introduces the elements of the language systematically. Sound-symbol associations along with linguistic rules and generalizations are introduced in a linguistically logical, understandable order.  Students begin by reading and writing sounds in isolation. Then they blend the sounds into syllables and words. Students learn the elements of language—consonants, vowels, [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], blends, and [[diphthongs]]&amp;mdash;in an orderly fashion. They then proceed to advanced structural elements such as syllable types, roots, and affixes. As students learn new material, they continue to review old material to the level of automaticity. The teacher addresses vocabulary, sentence structure, composition, and reading comprehension in a similar structured, sequential, and cumulative manner.

'''Cognitive''': Students learn about the history of the [[English language]] and study the many generalizations and rules that govern its structure. They also learn how best they can learn and apply the language knowledge necessary for achieving reading and writing competencies.

'''Flexible''': Orton-Gillingham teaching is diagnostic and prescriptive in nature. Teachers try to ensure the learner is not simply recognising a pattern and applying it without understanding. When confusion of a previously taught rule is discovered, it is re-taught from the beginning.

== Research support ==
In 2000, the National Reading Panel included the Orton-Gillingham method in their study, "Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langengerg, Ph.D|first1=Daniel|title=Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/documents/report.pdf|website=National Reading Panel|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel supported the significance of offering classroom instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=S.|title=The Orton-Gillingham Language Approach - A Research Review|date=10 February 2014|page=7|url=http://www.nessy.com/us/files/2014/06/Orton-Gillingham_Report-Final-Version.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida Center for Reading Research reported in 2006 that it was unable to identify any empirical studies examining the efficacy of the approach specifically as described in Orton-Gillingham training materials. Thus there was no direct research evidence to determine its effectiveness, although there are a variety of  studies of derivative methods that incorporate aspects of Orton-Gillingham in combination with other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An overview of all reported studies of Orton-Gillingham derivative methods, such as Alphabetic Phonics or Project Read, revealed only a dozen studies with inconsistent results and a variety of methodological flaws. Despite these conclusions, the article does provide a detailed overview of the available research, which viewed most favorably would show some evidence of benefit from [[classroom]] use of OG methods with first graders, and use in [[special education]] or [[resource room]] settings with older children with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Ritchey2006&gt;{{cite journal

'''Paul Henry Lang''' (August 28, 1901 in [[Budapest]] – September 21, 1991 in [[Lakeville, Connecticut]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[United States|American]] [[musicologist]] and [[music critic]].

Lang was born in Budapest, [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and was educated in Catholic schools. In 1918, as World War I was coming to an end, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army though he had not completed school, and sent to the Italian front.&lt;ref&gt;As told by PHL to family&lt;/ref&gt; When the war ended, he had to make his own way home, and then studied at the University of Budapest and the [[Budapest Music Academy]], under [[Zoltán Kodály]] and Erno Dohnanyi, among others. Kodály, learning that he only played piano, assigned him to learn to play the bassoon. After graduating in 1922, he was an assistant conductor at the Budapest Opera, but was encouraged to study musicology by Kodály and [[Béla Bartók]]. At that time serious study in musicology was only available in France and Germany. He began at the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he attended classes in philosophy and literature as well. He was not happy in Germany and moved on to the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris, where he studied with Andre Pirro. In the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] Lang participated as part of the French National rowing team. He supported himself by playing bassoon in various orchestras and also conducted an emigrant Hungarian chorus. While a student in Paris he began his career as a music critic, writing for the ''[[Revue Musicale]]''. He completed his dissertation on French lute music, but was not awarded his doctoral degree because he could not afford the large sum needed to engrave the unpublished scores he was discussing and print the dissertation, as required by the university.&lt;ref&gt;PHL oral history, 1981, at Columbia University Center for Oral History&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, knowing no English,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Paul Henry Lang's wife, Anne Pecheux Lang, in letter to the ''New York Review of Books'', http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/mar/23/paul-henry-lang/. Retrieved July 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lang moved to the United States as a junior scholar of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. He took a few English classes and then picked up more from motion pictures. He taught music, including harmony and counterpoint, for a year at [[Vassar College]] (1930–31), filling in for a professor on sabbatical. Then at [[Wells College]] (1932–34), he taught music history and analysis and led the chapel choir. At the same time he worked on a dissertation on the literary history of French opera,earning a [[doctorate degree]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1934. Having by now published a few articles in English, he was invited to teach at both Wellesley College and Columbia. For one year he taught at both colleges. Mr. Lang joined the music faculty of Columbia University in 1934 with the first professorship of musicology in America,&lt;ref&gt;Anne Pecheux Lang letter,&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly began changing the way music was taught there by adding courses, such as the esthetics of music, and by expanding the musicology department. In 1940, after Bartók fled Hungary during [[World War II]], Lang arranged for Columbia to hire him as an ethnomusicologist. As musicology was a nascent field at the time, Lang had a strong influence on its development, especially in the United States, and advised a number of students who would go on to become prominent musicologists, including [[James McKinnon]], [[Dika Newlin]], [[Joel Sachs]], [[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]], [[Richard Taruskin]], [[Piero Weiss]], and [[Neal Zaslaw]].

Lang became best known for his often provocative articles and books on both contemporary trends in music and music history. He was from 1954 to 1964 the music critic for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', succeeding [[Virgil Thomson]], and was editor of ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'' from 1945 to 1973. He published a number of books, the most famous of which is ''[[Music in Western Civilization]]'' (1941), called "[a] model of scholarship and style"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Age of Faith|last = Durant|first = Will|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster|year = 1950|isbn =|location = New York|pages = 1094}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Will Durant]]. He was an adviser to his publisher, W.W. Norton, and edited several books for them. He was a founding member of the American Musicological Society and in 1955 was elected for a term as president of the International Musicological Society.

In addition to his most famous work,  ''[[Music in Western Civilization]]'', Lang wrote  ''George Frideric Handel, '' collaborated with Otto Bettmann on ''A Pictorial History of Music,'' and edited several compilations, including  ''The Creative World of Mozart'' and  ''One Hundred Years of Music in America.''

In 1936 he married Anne Pecheux, a Barnard graduate who had taken his undergraduate music history course.  They had four children.

'''Personally information management''' ('''PIM''') is the activities people perform in order to acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve and use personal information items such as documents (paper-based and digital), web pages and email messages for everyday use to complete tasks (work-related or not) and fulfill a person's various roles (as parent, employee, friend, member of community, etc.).&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=William |date=2008 |title=Keeping Found Things Found |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers |isbn=978-0-12-370866-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, ''PIM is the art of getting things done in our lives through information.''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. (2012). [http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00411ED1V01Y201203ICR021 The Future of Personal Information Management, Part 1: Our Information, Always and Forever]. San Rafael, Calif.: Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers. page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically, PIM is concerned with how people organize and maintain personal information collections, and methods that can help people in doing so.  People may manage information in a variety of settings, for a variety of reasons, and with a variety of types of information.  For example, an office worker might manage physical documents in a filing cabinet by placing them in folders organized alphabetically by project name, or might manage digital documents in folders in a hierarchical file system.  A parent might collect and organize photographs of their children into a photo album using a temporal organization scheme, or might tag digital photos with the names of the children.

PIM considers not only the methods used to store and organize information, but also is concerned with how people retrieve information from their collections for re-use.  For example, the office worker might re-locate a physical document by remembering the name of the project and then finding the appropriate folder by an alphabetical search.  On a computer system with a hierarchical file system, a person might need to remember the top-level folder in which a document is located, and then browse through the folder contents to navigate to the desired document.  Email systems often support additional methods for re-finding such as fielded search (e.g., search by sender, subject, date).  The characteristics of the document types, the data that can be used to describe them (meta-data), and features of the systems used to store and organize them (e.g. fielded search) are all components that may influence how users accomplish personal information management.

Studying, understanding, and practicing PIM can help individuals and organizations work more effectively and efficiently, can help people deal with "information overload", and can highlight useful strategies for archiving, organizing, and facilitating access to saved information.

==Overview==
There are six ways in which information can be personal:&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; 
#Owned by "me"
#About "me"
#Directed toward "me"
#Sent/Posted by "me"
#Experienced by "me"
#Relevant to "me"

One ideal of PIM is that people should always have the right information in the right place, in the right form, and of sufficient completeness and quality to meet their current need. Technologies and tools such as [[personal information manager]]s  help people spend less time with time-consuming and error-prone activities of PIM (such as looking for and organising information). They then have more and better insight in making creative, intelligent use of their time, or to simply enjoy the information itself.

== History and background ==
PIM is a new field with ancient roots. When the oral rather than the written word dominated, human memory was the primary means for information preservation.&lt;ref name="yates1966"&gt;F. A. Yates, The art of memory. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; As information was increasingly rendered in paper form, tools were developed over time to meet the growing challenges of management. For example, the vertical filing cabinet, now such a standard feature of home and workplace offices, was first commercially available in 1893.&lt;ref name="yates1989"&gt;J. Yates, Control through communication: The rise of system in American management. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing availability of computers in the 1950s came an interest in the computer as a source of metaphors and a test bed for efforts to understand the human ability to process information and to solve
problems. [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]] pioneered the computer's use as a tool to model human thought.&lt;ref name="newell1972"&gt;A. Newell and H. A. Simon, Human problem solving. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1972.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simon1958"&gt;H. A. Simon and A. Newell, "[https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.6.1.1 Heuristic problem solving: The next advance in operations research]," Oper. Res., vol. 6, pp. 1–10., 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; They produced "The [[Logic Theorist]]," generally thought to be the first running artificial intelligence (AI) program. The computer of the 1950s was also an inspiration for the development of an information processing approach to human behavior and performance.&lt;ref name="broadbent1958"&gt;D. E. Broadbent, Perception and communication. London, U.K.: Pergamon Press, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1950s research showed that the computer, as a symbol processor, could "think" (to varying degrees of fidelity) like people do, the 1960s saw an increasing interest in the use of the computer to help people to think better and to process information more effectively. Working with [[Andries van Dam]] and others, [[Ted Nelson]], who coined the word "[[hypertext]]",&lt;ref name="nelson1965"&gt;T. H. Nelson, "[http://rogerclarke.com/II/Nelson-1965.pdf File structure for the complex, the changing, and the indeterminate]," in Proceedings
of the 1965 20th ACM/CSC-ER national conference, Cleveland, OH, 1965, pp. 84–100.&lt;/ref&gt; developed one of the first hypertext systems, The Hypertext Editing System, in 1968.&lt;ref name="carmody1969"&gt;S. Carmody, W. Gross, T. Nelson, D. Rice, and A. Van Dam, "A hypertext editing system for the /360," in Pertinent concepts in computer graphics, Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1969, pp. 291–330.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Douglas Engelbart]] also completed work on a hypertext system called NLS (oN-Line System).&lt;ref name="engelbart1968"&gt;D. C. Engelbart and W. K. English, "[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/BBAIKM.pdf A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect]," in
Proceedings of the December 9–11, 1968, Fall Joint Computer Conference, Part I, New York, NY, USA, 1968, pp. 395–410.&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbart advanced the notion that the computer could be used to augment the human intellect.&lt;ref name="engelbart1962"&gt;D. Engelbart, "[http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=AD0289565 Augmenting human intellect: A conceptual framework].," SRI Rep., 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engelbart1961"&gt;D. C. Engelbart, "Special considerations of the individual as a user, generator and retriever of information," Am. Doc., vol. 12, no. 2, pp. 121–125, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; As heralded by the publication of [[Ulric Neisser]]'s book Cognitive Psychology,&lt;ref name="neisser1967"&gt;U. Neisser, Cognitive psychology. New York: Appleton-Century Crofts, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1960s also saw the emergence of cognitive psychology as a discipline that focused primarily on a better understanding of the human ability to think, learn, and remember.

The computer as aid to the individual, rather than remote number cruncher in a refrigerated room, gained further validity from work in the late 1970s and through the 1980s to produce personal computers of increasing power and portability. These trends continue: computational power roughly equivalent to that of a desktop computer of a decade ago can now be found in devices that fit into the palm of a hand.
The phrase "Personal Information Management" was itself apparently first used in the 1980s in the midst of general excitement over the potential of the personal computer to greatly enhance the human ability to process and manage information.&lt;ref name="lansdale1988"&gt;M. Lansdale, "The psychology of personal information management," Appl Ergon, vol. 19, no. 1,
pp. 55–66, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s also saw the advent of so-called "PIM tools" that provided limited support for the management of such things as appointments and scheduling, to-do lists, phone numbers, and addresses. A community dedicated to the study and improvement of human–computer interaction also emerged in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="card1983"&gt;S. K. Card, T. P. Moran, and A. Newell, The psychology of human-computer interaction. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="norman1988"&gt;D. A. Norman, The psychology of everyday things. New York: Basic Books, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

As befits the "information" focus of PIM, PIM-relevant research of the 1980s and 1990s extended beyond the study of a particular device or application towards larger ecosystems of information management to
include, for example, the organization of the physical office and the management of paperwork.&lt;ref name="cole1982"&gt;Cole, "Human aspects of office filing: implications for the electronic office," in Human Factors

PIM, as a contemporary field of inquiry with a self-identified community of researchers, traces its origins to a Special Interest Group (SIG) session on PIM at the CHI 2004 conference and to a special National Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored workshop held in Seattle in 2005.&lt;ref name="sig2004"&gt;O. Bergman, R. Boardman, J. Gwizdka, and W. Jones, "A special interest group session on personal information management," 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sig2005"&gt;W. Jones and H. Bruce, "A Report on the NSF-Sponsored Workshop on Personal Information Management, Seattle, WA, 2005," in Personal Information Management 2005: A Special Workshop Sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Seattle, WA, USA, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study ==
Interest in the study of PIM has increased in recent years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} One goal in the study of PIM is to identify ways to introduce new tool support without inadvertently increasing the complexity of a person's information management challenge. The study of PIM means understanding better how people manage information across tools and over time. It is not enough simply to study, for example, [[e-mail]] use in isolation. A related point is that the value of a new tool must be assessed over time and in a broader context of a person's various PIM activities.

PIM research can be organized according to the three main PIM activities:

===Finding/re-finding===
Finding and re-finding information can take place in a public space (e.g. the Internet) or private (e.g. a person's hard drive).
Research on finding is largely focused on finding public information (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Looking for Information / Case (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;) and on how people search and use information (human information behavior).&lt;ref&gt;Information Behavior Research: Where Have We been, Where are We Going / Julien &amp; O'Brien (2014&lt;/ref&gt; For re-finding a person has to a) remember (to look), recall and recognize, and repeat.&lt;ref&gt;The Psychology of Personal Information Management / Lansdale (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering to look is difficult even when using online bookmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Saving and Using Encountered Information / Marshall &amp; Bly (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Recall and recognize is what typically happens when people do a (desktop) search by typing in [[search term]]s and then scanning the list of results until they recognize what they are looking for. The whole process of remembering, recalling and recognizing is repeated in case the information sought consists of multiple parts.

===Keeping===
When people encounter information it can be consumed immediately (e.g. a game score) or keep it for later use in which case a decision needs to be made of how and where to keep it so it can be found again. This process is error prone. Filing and tagging information is difficult&lt;ref&gt;Information Behavior That Keeps Found Things Found / Bruce, Jones, &amp; Dumais (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; because people often fail to remember existing folders and tags and create new instances leading to information dispersion.

===Meta activities===
Meta activities are strategic activities that consider a person's information collections, how their information is organized and how well this organization is working, and whether the [[information security|information is secure]] and [[backup|backed up]]. Making sense of and using information after it has been found is also part of these activities. Generally people struggle to organize their information,&lt;ref&gt;Getting Lost in Email: How and Why Users Spend More Time in Email Than Intended / Hanrahan (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and usually don't have reliable backup routines.&lt;ref&gt;The Long Term Fate of Digital Belongings: Toward A Service Model for Personal Archives / Marshall, Bly, &amp; Brun-Cottan (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
A challenge in PIM research is to develop more practical methods for study of current PIM practices with more practical implications for the development of improved tools, techniques and training in support of better PIM. PIM requires the study of people, with a diversity of backgrounds and needs, over time as they work in many different situations, with different forms of information and different tools of information management.  This scope of PIM inquiry brings a need for practical, cost-effective methodologies that can scale. Further, there is a need  not only for descriptive studies aimed at better understanding how people currently practice PIM but also for prescriptive studies aimed both at evaluation and also towards the recommendation of proposed solutions in the form of new, improved tools, techniques and strategies of PIM.

It has been noted that the nature of PIM makes its study challenging in the extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = W | year = 2015 | title = Building a Better World with our Information: The Future of Personal Information Management, Part 3 | url = | journal = Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 1–203 | doi = 10.2200/S00653ED1V01Y201506ICR042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers seek to understand how people manage information using tools of information management. But it is important that the information managed be "personal".  Traditional laboratory tasks risk abstracting away the "personal" from PIM. Furthermore, people don't just keep information; they keep information within the established organizations of their personal spaces of information (PSIs) – the folder structure of their laptop, or the drawers and layout of their physical desktop or a Facebook timeline.

== Tools ==
There are a number of tools available for managing personal information, but these tools can become a part of the problem leading to "information fragmentation". Different devices and applications often come with their separate ways of storing and organizing information. ''NOTE:'' Many people confuse PIM tools with the study and practice of personal information management itself. See [[personal information manager]] for information about tools for personal information management.

== Related activities and areas ==
PIM shares considerable, potentially synergistic overlap with disciplines such as [[cognitive science]], [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction]], [[information science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[Database Management|database management]] and [[information retrieval]]. PIM relates to but differs from other fields of inquiry that study the interactions between people, information and technology, personal network management.

===Cognitive psychology and cognitive science===
[[Cognitive psychology]], as the study of how people learn and remember, problem solve, and make decisions, necessarily also includes the study of how people make smart use of available information. The related field of [[cognitive science]], in its efforts to apply these questions more broadly to the study and simulation of intelligent behavior, is also related to PIM.  Cognitive science has strong connections to, some would say subsumes, the field of [[artificial intelligence]].

There is great potential for a mutually beneficial interplay between cognitive science and PIM. Sub-areas of cognitive science of clear relevance to PIM include [[problem solving]] and [[decision making]]. For example, folders created to hold information for a big project such as "plan my wedding" may sometimes resemble a [[Decomposition (computer science)|problem-decomposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W., Phuwanartnurak, A. J., Gill, R., &amp; Bruce, H. (2005, April 2–7). [https://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace/handle/1773/2031 Don't take my folders away!  Organizing personal information to get things done]. Paper presented at the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2005), Portland, OR.&lt;/ref&gt; To take another example, [[Detection theory|signal detection task]]&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, W. W., Birdsall, T. G., &amp; Fox, W. C. (1954). [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1057460/ The theory of signal detectability]. Institute of Radio Engineers Transactions, PGIT-4, 171-212.&lt;/ref&gt; has long been used to frame and explain human behavior and has recently been used as a basis for analyzing our choices concerning what information to keep and how – a key activity of PIM.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. (2004).[http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1123 Finders, keepers? The present and future perfect in support of personal information management]. First Monday.&lt;/ref&gt;

Or consider [[categorization]] and [[concept formation]]. How are categories and concepts learned and used? Categories and concepts cannot be seen directly but may be reflected in the tags and folders people use to organize their information. Or consider the activities of [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]]. Both are areas of study in cognitive psychology with clear relevance to the study of PIM.

Now large portions of a document may be the product of [[cut, copy, and paste|"copy-and-paste" operations]] (from our previous writings) rather than a product of original writing. Certainly, management of text pieces pasted for re-use is a PIM activity, and this raises several interesting questions. How do we go about deciding when to re-use and when to write from scratch? We may sometimes spend more time chasing down a paragraph we have previously written than it would have taken to simply write a new paragraph expressing the same thoughts. Beyond this, we can wonder at what point a reliance on an increasing (and increasingly available) supply of previously written material begins to impact our creativity.

As people do PIM they work in an external environment that includes other people, available technology and organizational setting. This means that  [[situated cognition]], [[distributed cognition]], and [[social cognition]] all relate to the study of PIM.

=== Human–computer and human–information interaction ===
The study of PIM is also related to the field of [[human–computer interaction|human–computer interaction (HCI)]]. But PIM research puts emphasis on the broader study of how people manage their information over time using a variety of tools – some computer-based, some not.

The [[user-subjective approach]] is the first approach dedicated specifically to PIM systems design. Its theoretical foundations were first published in a ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]'' paper in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/asi.10283 | volume=54 | title=The user-subjective approach to personal information management systems | year=2003 | journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | pages=872–878 | last1 = Bergman | first1 = Ofer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another JASIST paper with evidence and implementation for the approach was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/asi.20738 | volume=59 | title=The user-subjective approach to personal information management systems design: Evidence and implementations | year=2007 | journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | pages=235–246 | last1 = Bergman | first1 = Ofer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper had won the Best JASIST Paper award in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asis.org/awards/jasis_paper.html Best JASIST Paper Award]. Asis.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The first user-subjective design scheme was developed and positively evaluated in a [[Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems]] paper published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518745 It's not that important]. Portal.acm.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group information management===
[[Group information management]] (GIM, usually pronounced with a soft "G") has been written about elsewhere in the context  of PIM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1107458.1107495&amp;coll=DL&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=559941162&amp;CFTOKEN=82585874 From PIM to GIM: personal information management in group contexts]&lt;/ref&gt; The study of GIM, in turn, has clear relevance to the study of [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). As a useful way to relate acronyms we can say that GIM is to CSCW as PIM is to HCI (human–computer interaction). Concerns of PIM substantially overlap with but are not fully subsumed by concerns of HCI (nor vice versa). Indeed, some of the more influential papers on PIM over the years have been published in HCI journals and conference  proceedings .

However, the "I" in PIM is for information – how can we as individuals (the "P"), better manage (the "M") our information (in all 6 senses as listed above) regardless of the form it takes – papers and books, digital documents and emails or even the letter magnets on a refrigerator in the kitchen. The "I" in HCI stands for "interaction" as this relates to the "C" – computers. 
A similar distinction can be made with respect to GIM and CSCW.

=== Management of data, information, knowledge, time and tasks ===
The study of [[information management]] and [[knowledge management]] in organizations relates to the study of PIM. Jones notes that issues seen first at an organizational level often migrate to the PIM domain.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. (2007). Personal information management. In B. Cronin (Ed.), [http://www.asis.org/Publications/ARIST/vol41.php Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST) (Vol. 41)]. Medford, NJ: Information Today.&lt;/ref&gt;

PIM can help to motivate and will also benefit from work in [[information retrieval]] and [[database management system|database management]]. For example, [[data mining|data mining techniques]] might be applied to mine and structure personal information.

=== Relation to time management and productivity ===
By similar argument, a discussion of [[time management]] or [[task management]] on a personal level quickly takes us back to a discussion of PIM. Both time and task management make heavy use of information tools and external forms of information such as to-do lists, calendars, timelines, Gantt charts, etc.; this information, to be managed like other information.

=== Personal network management ===
[[Personal network]] management (PNM) is a crucial aspect of PIM and can be understood as the practice of managing the links and connections for social and professional benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42659">A '''Petri net''', also known as a '''place/transition (PT) net''', is one of several [[mathematical]] [[modeling language]]s for the description of [[distributed systems]].  It is a class of [[discrete event dynamic system]]. A Petri net is a directed [[bipartite graph]], in which the nodes represent transitions (i.e. events that may occur, represented by bars) and places (i.e. conditions, represented by circles). The directed arcs describe which places are pre- and/or postconditions for which transitions (signified by arrows).  Some sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Carl Adam | last1 = Petri | first2 = Wolfgang | last2 = Reisig | date = 2008 | title = Petri net | journal = [[Scholarpedia]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | page = 6477 | url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Petri_net | doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.6477}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that Petri nets were invented in August 1939 by [[Carl Adam Petri]]—at the age of 13—for the purpose of describing chemical processes.

Like industry standards such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s, [[Business Process Model and Notation]] and [[Event-driven process chain|EPC]]s, Petri nets offer a [[diagram|graphical notation]] for stepwise processes that include choice, [[iteration]], and [[Concurrent computing|concurrent execution]]. Unlike these standards, Petri nets have an exact mathematical definition of their execution semantics, with a well-developed mathematical theory for process analysis.

[[Image:Animated Petri net commons.gif|thumb|(a) Petri net trajectory example]]

== Petri net basics ==
A Petri net consists of ''places'', ''transitions'', and ''[[graph theory|arc]]s''.  Arcs run from a place to a transition or vice versa, never between places or between transitions.  The places from which an arc runs to a transition are called the ''input places'' of the transition; the places to which arcs run from a transition are called the ''output places'' of the transition.

Graphically, places in a Petri net may contain a discrete number of marks called ''tokens''.  Any distribution of tokens over the places will represent a configuration of the net called a ''marking''.  In an abstract sense relating to a Petri net diagram, a transition of a Petri net may ''fire'' if it is ''enabled'', i.e. there are sufficient tokens in all of its input places; when the transition fires, it consumes the required input tokens, and creates tokens in its output places.  A firing is atomic, i.e. a single non-interruptible step.

Unless an ''execution policy'' {{Example needed|date=September 2018}} is defined, the execution of Petri nets is [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]]: when multiple transitions are enabled at the same time, they will fire in any order.

Since firing is nondeterministic, and multiple tokens may be present anywhere in the net (even in the same place),  Petri nets are well suited for modeling the [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] behavior of distributed systems.

== Formal definition and basic terminology ==
Petri nets are [[State transition system|state-transition systems]] that extend a class of nets called elementary nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = G. | last1 = Rozenburg | first2 = J. | last2 = Engelfriet | chapter = Elementary Net Systems | editor1-first = W. | editor1-last = Reisig | editor2-first = G. | editor2-last = Rozenberg | title = Lectures on Petri Nets I: Basic Models – Advances in Petri Nets | volume = 1491 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | publisher = Springer | date = 1998 | pages = 12–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Definition 1.''' A ''net'' is a [[Tuple|triple]] &lt;math&gt;N = (P, T, F)&lt;/math&gt; where:
# &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are ''disjoint'' finite sets of ''places'' and ''transitions'', respectively.
# &lt;math&gt;F \subset (P \times T) \cup (T \times P)&lt;/math&gt; is a set of ''arcs'' (or flow relations).

'''Definition 2.''' Given a net ''N'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F''), a ''configuration'' is a set ''C'' so that ''C'' &lt;big&gt;⊆&lt;/big&gt; ''P''.

[[File:Petri Net A.jpg|thumb|A Petri net with an enabled transition.]][[File:Petri Net B.jpg|thumb|The Petri net that follows after the transition fires (Initial Petri net in the figure above).]]
'''Definition 3.''' An ''elementary net'' is a net of the form ''EN'' = (''N'', ''C'') where:
# ''N'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F'') is a net.
# ''C'' is such that ''C'' &lt;big&gt;⊆&lt;/big&gt; ''P'' is a ''configuration''.

'''Definition 4.''' A ''Petri net'' is a net of the form ''PN'' = (''N'', ''M'', ''W''), which extends the elementary net so that:
# ''N'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F'' ) is a net.
# ''M'' : ''P'' &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; ''Z'' is a place [[multiset]], where ''Z'' is a [[countable set]]. ''M'' extends the concept of ''configuration'' and is commonly described with reference to Petri net diagrams as a ''marking''.
# ''W'' : ''F'' &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; ''Z'' is an arc [[multiset]], so that the count (or weight) for each arc is a measure of the arc ''multiplicity''.

If a Petri net is equivalent to an elementary net, then ''Z'' can be the countable set {0,1} and those elements in ''P'' that map to 1 under ''M'' form a configuration. Similarly, if a Petri net is not an elementary net, then the [[multiset]] ''M'' can be interpreted as representing a non-singleton set of configurations. In this respect, ''M'' extends the concept of configuration for elementary nets to Petri nets.

In the diagram of a Petri net (see top figure right), places are conventionally depicted with circles, transitions with long narrow rectangles and arcs as one-way arrows that show connections of places to transitions or transitions to places. If the diagram were of an elementary net, then those places in a configuration would be conventionally depicted as circles, where each circle encompasses a single dot called a ''token''. In the given diagram of a Petri net (see right), the place circles may encompass more than one token to show the number of times a place appears in a configuration. The configuration of tokens distributed over an entire Petri net diagram is called a ''marking''.

In the top figure (see right), the place ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an input place of transition ''t''; whereas, the place ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an output place to the same transition. Let ''PN&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' (Fig. top) be a Petri net with a marking configured ''M&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''PN&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (Fig. bottom) be a Petri net with a marking configured ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. The configuration of ''PN&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''enable'' transition ''t'' through the property that all input places have sufficient number of tokens (shown in the figures as dots) "equal to or greater" than the multiplicities on their respective arcs to ''t''. Once and only once a transition is enabled will the transition fire. In this example, the ''firing'' of transition ''t'' generates a map that has the marking configured ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the image of ''M&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and results in Petri net ''PN&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', seen in the bottom figure. In the diagram, the firing rule for a transition can be characterised by subtracting a number of tokens from its input places equal to the multiplicity of the respective input arcs and accumulating a new number of tokens at the output places equal to the multiplicity of the respective output arcs.

'''Remark 1.''' The precise meaning of "equal to or greater" will depend on the precise algebraic properties of addition being applied on ''Z'' in the firing rule, where subtle variations on the algebraic properties can lead to other classes of Petri nets; for example, Algebraic Petri nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reisig | first1 = Wolfgang | date = 1991 | title = Petri Nets and Algebraic Specifications | url = | journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 80 | issue = 1| pages = 1–34 | doi=10.1016/0304-3975(91)90203-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following formal definition is loosely based on {{harv|Peterson|1981}}.  Many alternative definitions exist.

=== Syntax ===

A '''Petri net graph''' (called ''Petri net'' by some, but see below) is a 3-[[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* ''S'' is a [[finite set]] of ''places''
* ''T'' is a finite set of ''transitions''
* ''S'' and ''T'' are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]], i.e. no object can be both a place and a transition
* &lt;math&gt;W: (S \times T) \cup (T \times S) \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[multiset]] of [[directed edge|arc]]s, i.e. it assigns to each arc a non-negative integer ''arc multiplicity'' (or weight); note that no arc may connect two places or two transitions.

The ''flow relation'' is the set of arcs: &lt;math&gt; F = \{ (x,y) \mid W(x,y) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.  In many textbooks, arcs can only have multiplicity 1. These texts often define Petri nets using ''F'' instead of ''W''.  When using this convention, a Petri net graph is a [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] [[multigraph]] &lt;math&gt;(S \cup T, F)&lt;/math&gt; with node partitions ''S'' and ''T''.

The ''preset'' of a transition ''t'' is the set of its ''input places'': &lt;math&gt;{}^{\bullet}t = \{ s \in S \mid W(s,t) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;;
its ''postset'' is the set of its ''output places'': &lt;math&gt;t^{\bullet} = \{ s \in S \mid W(t,s) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. Definitions of pre- and postsets of places are analogous.

A ''marking'' of a Petri net (graph) is a multiset of its places, i.e., a mapping &lt;math&gt;M: S \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.  We say the marking assigns to each place a number of ''tokens''.

A '''Petri net''' (called ''marked Petri net'' by some, see above) is a 4-tuple &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W)&lt;/math&gt; is a Petri net graph;
* &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ''initial marking'', a marking of the Petri net graph.

=== Execution semantics ===

In words:
* firing a transition {{mvar|t}} in a marking {{mvar|M}} consumes &lt;math&gt;W(s,t)&lt;/math&gt; tokens from each of its input places {{mvar|s}}, and produces &lt;math&gt;W(t,s)&lt;/math&gt; tokens in each of its output places {{mvar|s}}
* a transition is ''enabled'' (it may ''fire'') in {{mvar|M}} if there are enough tokens in its input places for the consumptions to be possible, i.e. iff &lt;math&gt;\forall s: M(s) \geq W(s,t)&lt;/math&gt;.

We are generally interested in what may happen when transitions may continually fire in arbitrary order.

We say that a marking {{mvar|M'}} ''is reachable from'' a marking {{mvar|M}} ''in one step'' if &lt;math&gt;M \underset{G}{\longrightarrow} M'&lt;/math&gt;; we say that it ''is reachable from {{mvar|M}}'' if &lt;math&gt;M \overset{*}{\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}} M'&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;; that is, if it is reachable in 0 or more steps.

For a (marked) Petri net &lt;math&gt;N=(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;, we are interested in the firings that can be performed starting with the initial marking &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;.  Its set of ''reachable markings'' is the set
&lt;math&gt;R(N) \ \stackrel{D}{=}\ \left\{ M' \Bigg| M_0 \xrightarrow[(S,T,W)]{*} M' \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

The ''reachability graph'' of {{mvar|N}} is the transition relation &lt;math&gt;\underset{G}{\longrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; restricted to its reachable markings &lt;math&gt;R(N)&lt;/math&gt;.  It is the [[state space]] of the net.

A ''firing sequence'' for a Petri net with graph {{mvar|G}} and initial marking &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of transitions &lt;math&gt;\vec \sigma = \langle t_{i_1} \cdots t_{i_n} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;M_0 \xrightarrow[G,t_{i_1}]{} M_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge M_{n-1} \xrightarrow[G,t_{i_n}]{} M_n&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of firing sequences is denoted as &lt;math&gt;L(N)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Variations on the definition ==

As already remarked, a common variation is to disallow arc multiplicities and replace the [[multiset|bag]] of arcs ''W'' with a simple set, called the ''flow relation'', &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq (S \times T) \cup (T \times S)&lt;/math&gt;.
This doesn't limit [[expressive power (computer science)|expressive power]] as both can represent each other.

Another common variation, e.g. in, Desel and Juhás (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/a6lmwqye66ll5w56/ | last1 = Desel | first1 = Jörg | last2 = Juhás | first2 = Gabriel | chapter = What Is a Petri Net? Informal Answers for the Informed Reader | editor1-first = Hartmut | editor1-last = Ehrig | title = Unifying Petri Nets | series = LNCS | volume = 2128 | pages = 1–25 | date = 2001 |publisher=Springer |accessdate=2014-05-14|display-editors=etal| isbn = 9783540430674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is to allow ''capacities'' to be defined on places.  This is discussed under ''extensions'' below.

== Formulation in terms of vectors and matrices ==

The markings of a Petri net &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]]s of nonnegative integers of length &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;.

Its transition relation can be described as a pair of &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;|T|&lt;/math&gt; [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]:
* &lt;math&gt;W^-&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;\forall s,t: W^-[s,t] = W(s,t)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;W^+&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;\forall s,t: W^+[s,t] = W(t,s).&lt;/math&gt;
Then their difference
* &lt;math&gt; W^T = W^+ - W^-&lt;/math&gt;
can be used to describe the reachable markings in terms of matrix multiplication, as follows.
For any sequence of transitions {{mvar|w}}, write &lt;math&gt;o(w)&lt;/math&gt; for the vector that maps every transition to its number of occurrences in {{mvar|w}}.  Then, we have
* &lt;math&gt;R(N) = \{ M \mid \exists w: M = M_0 + W^T \cdot o(w) \wedge w \text{ is a firing sequence of } N \}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- the \!s make the \{ and \} the same size. --&gt;

Note that it must be required that {{mvar|w}} is a firing sequence; allowing arbitrary sequences of transitions will generally produce a larger set.

[[Image:detailed petri net.png|frame|(b) Petri net Example]] 
:&lt;math&gt;W^{+}=\begin{bmatrix} * &amp; t1 &amp; t2 \\ p1 &amp; 0  &amp; 1 \\ p2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ p3 &amp; 1&amp; 0 \\ p4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}, \ 
W^{-}=\begin{bmatrix} * &amp; t1 &amp; t2 \\ p1 &amp; 1  &amp; 0 \\ p2 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ p3 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ p4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}, \ 
W^T=\begin{bmatrix} * &amp; t1 &amp; t2 \\ p1 &amp; -1  &amp; 1 \\ p2 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\ p3 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 \\ p4 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{0}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Mathematical properties of Petri nets ==

One thing that makes Petri nets interesting is that they provide a balance between modeling power and analyzability: many things one would like to know about concurrent systems can be automatically determined for Petri nets, although some of those things are very expensive to determine in the general case.  Several subclasses of Petri nets have been studied that can still model interesting classes of concurrent systems, while these problems become easier.

An overview of such [[decision problem]]s, with decidability and complexity results for Petri nets and some subclasses, can be found in
Esparza and Nielsen (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/226920.html | title = Decidability issues for Petri nets – a survey | first1 = Javier | last1 = Esparza | first2 = Mogens | last2 = Nielsen | journal = Bulletin of the EATCS | origyear = 1994 | edition = Revised | date = 1995 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reachability ===
The [[reachability problem]] for Petri nets is to decide, given a Petri net ''N'' and a marking ''M'', whether &lt;math&gt;M \in  R(N)&lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly, this is a matter of walking the reachability graph defined above, until either we reach the requested marking or we know it can no longer be found.  This is harder than it may seem at first: the reachability graph is generally infinite, and it is not easy to determine when it is safe to stop.

In fact, this problem was shown to be [[EXPSPACE]]-hard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lipton | first = R. | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/contextsummary/115623/0 | title = The Reachability Problem Requires Exponential Space | journal = Technical Report 62 | date = 1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; years before it was shown to be decidable at all (Mayr, 1981).  Papers continue to be published on how to do it efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = P. | last = Küngas | url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/%7Epeep/papers/SARA2005Kung.ps | title = Petri Net Reachability Checking Is Polynomial with Optimal Abstraction Hierarchies | conference = Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Abstraction, Reformulation and Approximation—SARA 2005 | location = Airth Castle, Scotland, UK | date = July 26–29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently (2018) Czerwinski et al improved the lower bound and showed that the problem is not [[ELEMENTARY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1809.07115|last1=Czerwinski|first1=Wojciech|title=The Reachability Problem for Petri Nets is Not Elementary (Extended Abstract)|last2=Lasota|first2=Slawomir|last3=Lazic|first3=Ranko|last4=Leroux|first4=Jerome|last5=Mazowiecki|first5=Filip|class=cs.FL|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While reachability seems to be a good tool to find erroneous states, for practical problems the constructed graph usually has far too many states to calculate. To alleviate this problem, [[linear temporal logic]] is usually used in conjunction with the [[Method of analytic tableaux|tableau method]] to prove that such states cannot be reached. LTL uses the [[semi-decision procedure|semi-decision technique]] to find if indeed a state can be reached, by finding a set of necessary conditions for the state to be reached then proving that those conditions cannot be satisfied.

=== Liveness ===

[[Image:liveness-levels.gif|thumb|right|A Petri net in which transition &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is dead, while for all &lt;math&gt;j&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt;-live]]

Petri nets can be described as having different degrees of liveness &lt;math&gt;L_1 - L_4&lt;/math&gt;. A Petri net &lt;math&gt;(N, M_0)&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;L_k&lt;/math&gt;-live [[if and only if|iff]] all of its transitions are &lt;math&gt;L_k&lt;/math&gt;-live, where a transition is
* ''dead'', if it can never fire, i.e. it is not in any firing sequence in &lt;math&gt;L(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;-live (''potentially fireable''), iff it may fire, i.e. it is in some firing sequence in &lt;math&gt;L(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;-live iff it can fire arbitrarily often, i.e. if for every positive integer {{mvar|k}}, it occurs at least {{mvar|k}} times in some firing sequence in &lt;math&gt;L(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_3&lt;/math&gt;-live iff it can fire infinitely often, i.e. if for every positive integer {{mvar|k}}, it occurs at least {{mvar|k}} times in {{mvar|V}}, for some prefix-closed set of firing sequences &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textstyle{V \subseteq L(N,M_0)}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;L_4&lt;/math&gt;-live (''live'') iff it may always fire, i.e. it is &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;-live in every reachable marking in &lt;math&gt;R(N,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that these are increasingly stringent requirements: &lt;math&gt;L_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt;-liveness implies &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt;-liveness, for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textstyle{j \in {1,2,3}}&lt;/math&gt;.

These definitions are in accordance with Murata's overview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.cs.uic.edu/bin/view/Murata/Publications | title = Petri Nets: Properties, Analysis and Applications | first = Tadao | last = Murata | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–558 | date = April 1989 | accessdate = 2014-10-13 | doi=10.1109/5.24143}}&lt;/ref&gt; which additionally uses &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;''-live'' as a term for ''dead''.

=== Boundedness ===
[[File:Reachability graph for petri net.png|right|frame|width=50px|The reachability graph of ''N2''.]]

A place in a Petri net is called ''k-bounded'' if it does not contain more than ''k'' tokens in all reachable markings, including the initial marking; it is said to be ''safe'' if it is 1-bounded; it is ''[[bounded set|bounded]]'' if it is ''k-bounded'' for some ''k''.

A (marked) Petri net is called ''k''-bounded, ''safe'', or ''bounded'' when all of its places are.
A Petri net (graph) is called ''(structurally) bounded'' if it is bounded for every possible initial marking.

Note that a Petri net is bounded if and only if its reachability graph is finite.

Boundedness is decidable by looking at [[covering problem|covering]], by constructing the [[Richard Karp|Karp]]–Miller Tree.

It can be useful to explicitly impose a bound on places in a given net.
This can be used to model limited system resources.

Some definitions of Petri nets explicitly allow this as a syntactic feature.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~mchen/BioPNML/Intro/pnfaq.html
  |ref=harv
  |title=Petri Nets
  |website = www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Formally, ''Petri nets with place capacities'' can be defined as tuples &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,C,M_0)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(S,T,W,M_0)&lt;/math&gt; is a Petri net, &lt;math&gt;C: P \rightarrow\!\!\!\shortmid I\!N&lt;/math&gt; an assignment of capacities to (some or all) places, and the transition relation is the usual one restricted to the markings in which each place with a capacity has at most that many tokens.

[[File:Two-boundedness-ub.png|right|frame|An unbounded Petri net, ''N''.]]

For example, if in the net ''N'', both places are assigned capacity 2, we obtain a Petri net with place capacities, say ''N2''; its reachability graph is displayed on the right.

[[File:Two-boundedness-cb.png|right|frame|A two-bounded Petri net, obtained by extending ''N'' with "counter-places".]]

Alternatively, places can be made bounded by extending the net.  To be exact,
a place can be made ''k''-bounded by adding a "counter-place" with flow opposite to that of the place, and adding tokens to make the total in both places ''k''.

==Discrete, continuous, and hybrid Petri nets==

As well as for discrete events, there are Petri nets for continuous and hybrid discrete-continuous processes that are useful in discrete, continuous and hybrid [[control theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VsS0JkMcXGwC | title = Discrete, continuous, and hybrid Petri Nets | first1 = René | last1 = David | first2 = Hassane | last2 = Alla | publisher = Springer | date = 2005 | isbn = 978-3-540-22480-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and related to discrete, continuous and hybrid [[automata theory|automata]].

==Extensions==
There are many extensions to Petri nets. Some of them are completely backwards-compatible (e.g. [[coloured Petri nets]]) with the original Petri net, some add properties that cannot be modelled in the original Petri net formalism (e.g. timed Petri nets). Although backwards-compatible models do not extend the computational power of Petri nets, they may have more succinct representations and may be more convenient for modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jensen|first1=Kurt|title=A brief introduction to colored Petri nets|url=http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~andersmo/petrinet/papers/cpn/brief.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions that cannot be transformed into Petri nets are sometimes very powerful, but usually lack the full range of mathematical tools available to analyse ordinary Petri nets.

The term  [[high-level Petri net]] is used for many Petri net formalisms that extend the basic P/T net formalism; this includes coloured Petri nets, hierarchical Petri nets such as [[Nets within Nets]], and all other extensions sketched in this section.  The term is also used specifically for the type of coloured nets supported by [[CPN Tools]].

A short list of possible extensions:

*Additional types of arcs; two common types are:
**a ''reset arc'' does not impose a precondition on firing, and empties the place when the transition fires; this makes reachability undecidable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = T. | last1 = Araki | first2 = T. | last2 = Kasami | title = Some Decision Problems Related to the Reachability Problem for Petri Nets | journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–104 | date = 1977 | doi=10.1016/0304-3975(76)90067-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some other properties, such as termination, remain decidable;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = C. | last1 = Dufourd | first2 = A. | last2 = Finkel | first3 = Ph. | last3 =Schnoebelen | chapter = Reset Nets Between Decidability and Undecidability | title = Proceedings of the 25th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]] | volume = 1443 | pages = 103–115 | date = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**an ''inhibitor arc'' imposes the precondition that the transition may only fire when the place is empty; this allows arbitrary computations on numbers of tokens to be expressed, which makes the formalism [[Turing complete]] and implies existence of a universal net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zaitsev | first = D. A. | title = Toward the Minimal Universal Petri Net | journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems | date = 2013 | pages = 1–12 | doi = 10.1109/TSMC.2012.2237549 | volume=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a standard Petri net, tokens are indistinguishable.  In a [[Coloured Petri net]], every token has a value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.daimi.au.dk/CPnets/intro/verybrief.html | title = Very Brief Introduction to CP-nets | publisher = Department of Computer Science, University of Aarhus, Denmark }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In popular tools for coloured Petri nets such as [[CPN Tools]], the values of tokens are typed, and can be tested (using ''guard'' expressions) and manipulated with a [[functional programming language]]. A subsidiary of coloured Petri nets are the [[well-formed Petri net]]s, where the arc and guard expressions are restricted to make it easier to analyse the net.
*Another popular extension of Petri nets is hierarchy; this in the form of different views supporting levels of refinement and abstraction was studied by Fehling. Another form of hierarchy is found in so-called object Petri nets or object systems  where a Petri net can contain Petri nets as its tokens inducing a hierarchy of nested Petri nets that communicate by synchronisation of transitions on different levels. See&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://llpn.com/OPNs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103131745/http://www.llpn.com/OPNs.html |archivedate=2005-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for an informal introduction to object Petri nets.
*A [[Vector addition system|vector addition system with states (VASS)]] is an equivalent formalism to Petri nets.  However, it can be superficially viewed as a generalisation of Petri nets. Consider a [[finite state automaton]] where each transition is labelled by a transition from the Petri net. The Petri net is then synchronised with the finite state automaton, i.e., a transition in the automaton is taken at the same time as the corresponding transition in the Petri net. It is only possible to take a transition in the automaton if the corresponding transition in the Petri net is enabled, and it is only possible to fire a transition in the Petri net if there is a transition from the current state in the automaton labelled by it. (The definition of VASS is usually formulated slightly differently.)
*[[Prioritised Petri net]]s add priorities to transitions, whereby a transition cannot fire, if a higher-priority transition is enabled (i.e. can fire). Thus, transitions are in priority groups, and e.g. priority group 3 can only fire if all transitions are disabled in groups 1 and 2. Within a priority group, firing is ''still'' non-deterministic.
*The non-deterministic property has been a very valuable one, as it lets the user abstract a large number of properties (depending on what the net is used for). In certain cases, however, the need arises to also model the timing, not only the structure of a model. For these cases, [[timed Petri nets]] have evolved, where there are transitions that are timed, and possibly transitions which are not timed (if there are, transitions that are not timed have a higher priority than timed ones). A subsidiary of timed Petri nets are the [[stochastic Petri net]]s that add [[nondeterministic time]] through adjustable randomness of the transitions. The [[Exponential distribution|exponential random distribution]] is usually used to 'time' these nets. In this case, the nets' reachability graph can be used as a continuous time [[Markov chain]] (CTMC).
*[[Dualistic Petri Nets]] (dP-Nets) is a Petri Net extension developed by E. Dawis, et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Dawis | first1 = E. P. | first2 = J. F. | last2 = Dawis | first3 = Wei-Pin | last3 = Koo | date = 2001 | title = Architecture of Computer-based Systems using Dualistic Petri Nets | conference = 2001 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics | volume = 3 | pages = 1554–1558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to better represent real-world process.  dP-Nets balance the duality of change/no-change, action/passivity, (transformation) time/space, etc., between the bipartite Petri Net constructs of transformation and place resulting in the unique characteristic of ''transformation marking'', i.e., when the transformation is "working" it is marked.  This allows for the transformation to fire (or be marked) multiple times representing the real-world behavior of process throughput.  Marking of the transformation assumes that transformation time must be greater than zero.  A zero transformation time used in many typical Petri Nets may be mathematically appealing but impractical in representing real-world processes.  dP-Nets also exploit the power of Petri Nets' hierarchical abstraction to depict [[Process architecture]].  Complex process systems are modeled as a series of simpler nets interconnected through various levels of hierarchical abstraction.  The process architecture of a packet switch is demonstrated in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Dawis | first = E. P. | date = 2001 | title = Architecture of an SS7 Protocol Stack on a Broadband Switch Platform using Dualistic Petri Nets | conference = 2001 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and signal Processing | volume = 1 | pages = 323–326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where development requirements are organized around the structure of the designed system.

There are many more extensions to Petri nets, however, it is important to keep in mind, that as the complexity of the net increases in terms of extended properties, the harder it is to use standard tools to evaluate certain properties of the net. For this reason, it is a good idea to use the most simple net type possible for a given modelling task.

== Restrictions ==
[[Image:petri net types.svg|thumb|Petri net types graphically]]

Instead of extending the Petri net formalism, we can also look at restricting it, and look at particular types of Petri nets, obtained by restricting the syntax in a particular way.  Ordinary Petri nets are the nets where all arc weights are 1.  Restricting further, the following types of ordinary Petri nets are commonly used and studied:

# In a [[state machine]] (SM), every transition has one incoming arc, and one outgoing arc, and all markings have exactly one token. As a consequence, there can ''not'' be ''concurrency'', but there can be ''conflict'' (i.e. [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation|nondeterminism]]). Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall t\in T: |t^\bullet|=|{}^\bullet t|=1&lt;/math&gt;
# In a [[marked graph]] (MG), every place has one incoming arc, and one outgoing arc. This means, that there can ''not'' be ''conflict'', but there can be ''concurrency''. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall s\in S: |s^\bullet|=|{}^\bullet s|=1&lt;/math&gt;
# In a ''free choice'' net (FC), – every arc from a place to a transition is either the only arc from that place or the only arc to that transition. I.e. there can be ''both concurrency and conflict, but not at the same time''. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall s\in S: (|s^\bullet|\leq 1) \vee ({}^\bullet (s^\bullet)=\{s\})&lt;/math&gt;
# Extended free choice (EFC) – a Petri net that can be ''transformed into an FC''.
# In an ''asymmetric choice'' net (AC), concurrency and conflict (in sum, ''confusion'') may occur, but ''not symmetrically''. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall s_1,s_2\in S: (s_1{}^\bullet \cap s_2{}^\bullet\neq \emptyset) \to [(s_1{}^\bullet\subseteq s_2{}^\bullet) \vee (s_2{}^\bullet\subseteq s_1{}^\bullet)]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- the next definition needs to be cleaned up by someone who understands what is meant here
# In a ''multiple asymmetric choice'' net (MAC), multiple concurrency and conflict (in sum, ''multiple confusion'') may occur, but no ''confusion''. Mathematically: ''for a set |P|=k,'' &lt;math&gt;\forall t\in T &lt;/math&gt; exist a subset &lt;math&gt; {}^\bullet t,&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; {}^\bullet T &lt;/math&gt; contains all subsets and is the powerset 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; without the empty subset
--&gt;

==Work flow nets==
[[Workflow net]]s (WF-nets) are a subclass of Petri nets intending to model the [[workflow]] of process activities.&lt;ref name="Aalst,1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last = van der Aalst | first = W. M. P. | date = 1998 | url = http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~wvdaalst/publications/p53.pdf | title = The application of Petri nets to workflow management | journal = Journal of Circuits, Systems and Computers | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–66 | doi=10.1142/s0218126698000043| citeseerx = 10.1.1.30.3125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The WF-net transitions are assigned to tasks or activities, and places are assigned to the pre/post conditions.
The WF-nets have additional structural and operational requirements, mainly the addition of a single input (source) place with no previous transitions, and output place (sink) with no following transitions. Accordingly, start and termination markings can be defined that represent the process status.

WF-nets have the '''soundness''' property,&lt;ref name="Aalst,1998" /&gt; indicating that a process with a start marking of k tokens in its source place, can reach the termination state marking with k tokens in its sink place (defined as K-sound WF-net). Additionally, all the transitions in the process could fire (i.e., for each transition there is a reachable state in which the transition is enabled). 
A general sound (G-sound) WF-net is defined as being K-sound for every k&gt;0.&lt;ref name="Hee et al., 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = van Hee | first1 = K. | last2 = Sidorova | first2 = N. | last3 = Voorhoeve | first3 = M. | date = 2003 | chapter-url = http://www.win.tue.nl/~sidorova/03/van_Hee_Sidorova_Voorhoeve.pdf | chapter = Soundness and separability of workflow nets in the stepwise refinement approach | editor1-last = van der Aalst | editor1-first = W.

A directed '''[[Path (graph theory)|path]]''' in the Petri net is defined as the sequence of nodes (places and transitions) linked by the directed arcs. An '''elementary path''' includes every node in the sequence only once.

A '''Well-handled''' Petri net is a net in which there are no fully distinct elementary paths between a place and a transition (or transition and a place), i.e., if there are two paths between the pair of node then these paths share a node.
An acyclic well-handled WF-net is sound (G-sound).&lt;ref name="Ping et al., 2004"&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Ping | first1 = L. | last2 = Hao | first2 = H. | last3 = Jian | first3 =L. | date = 2004 | title = On 1-soundness and soundness of workflow nets | editor-first = Daniel | editor-last = Moldt | conference = Proc of the 3rd Workshop on Modelling of Objects, Components, and Agents | location = Aarhus, Denmark | publisher = DAIMI PB | volume = 571 | pages = 21–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extended WF-net is a Petri net that is composed of a WF-net with additional transition t (feedback transition). The sink place is connected as the input place of transition t and the source place as its output place. Firing of the transition causes iteration of the process (Note: the extended WF-net is not a WF-net).&lt;ref name="Aalst,1998" /&gt; 
 
WRI (Well-handled with Regular Iteration) WF-net, is an extended acyclic well-handled WF-net.  
WRI-WF-net can be built as composition of nets, i.e., replacing a transition within a WRI-WF-net with a subnet which is a WRI-WF-net. The result is also WRI-WF-net. WRI-WF-nets are G-sound,&lt;ref name="Ping et al., 2004" /&gt; therefore by using only WRI-WF-net building blocks, one can get WF-nets that are G-sound by construction.

The [[Design structure matrix]] (DSM) can model process relations, and be utilized for process planning. The '''DSM-nets''' are realization of DSM-based plans into workflow processes by Petri nets, and are equivalent to WRI-WF-nets. The DSM-net construction process ensures the soundness property of the resulting net.

==Other models of concurrency==

Other ways of modelling concurrent computation have been proposed, including [[process algebra]], the [[actor model]], and [[trace theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Antoni | last = Mazurkiewicz | chapter = Introduction to Trace Theory | title = The Book of Traces | editor1-first = V. | editor1-last = Diekert | editor2-first = G. | editor2-last = Rozenberg | publisher = World Scientific | location = Singapore | date = 1995 | pages = 3–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different models provide tradeoffs of concepts such as [[compositionality]], [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]], and locality.

An approach to relating some of these models of concurrency is proposed in the chapter by Winskel and Nielsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = G. | last1 = Winskel | first2 = M. | last2 = Nielsen | chapter-url = http://www.daimi.au.dk/PB/463/PB-463.pdf | chapter = Models for Concurrency | title = Handbook of Logic and the Foundations of Computer Science | volume = 4 | pages = 1–148 | publisher = OUP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12022">The '''phenomenology of religion''' concerns the [[Experience|experiential]] aspect of [[religion]], describing religious phenomena in terms consistent with the orientation of worshippers. It views religion as made up of different components, and studies these components across religious traditions in order to gain some understanding of them.

== Chantepie de la Saussaye ==
The first explicit use of the phrase "phenomenology of religion" occurs in the ''Lehrbuch der Religionsgeschichte'' (Handbook of the History of Religions), written by Pierre Daniël Chantepie de la Saussaye in 1887, wherein he articulates the task of the science of religion and gives an "Outline of the phenomenology of religion".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 694; cf. James: 42-45)&lt;/ref&gt; Employing the terminology of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], Chantepie divides his science of religion into two areas of investigation, essence and manifestations, which are approached through investigations in philosophy and history, respectively.  However, Chantepie’s phenomenology "belongs neither to the history nor the philosophy of religion as Hegel envisioned them".&lt;ref&gt;45&lt;/ref&gt; For Chantepie, it is the task of phenomenology to prepare historical data for philosophical analysis through "a collection, a grouping, an arrangement, and a classifying of the principal groups of religious conceptions".&lt;ref&gt;43&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of phenomenology as a grouping of manifestations is similar to the conception of phenomenology articulated by Robison and the British; however, insofar as Chantepie conceives of phenomenology as a preparation for the philosophical elucidation of essences, his phenomenology is not completely opposed to that of Hegel.

== Kristensen ==
Chantepie’s ''Lehrbuch'' was highly influential, and many researchers began similar efforts after its publication and its subsequent translation into English and French.&lt;ref&gt;141&lt;/ref&gt; One such researcher was [[William Brede Kristensen]].  In 1901, Kristensen was appointed the first professorship relating to the phenomenology of religion at the University of Leiden.&lt;ref&gt;[[ibid]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the material from Kristensen’s lectures on the phenomenology of religion was edited posthumously, and the English translation was published in 1960 as ''The Meaning of Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: xiii&lt;/ref&gt; James notes that Kristensen’s phenomenology "adopts many of the features of Chantepie’s grouping of religious phenomena," and penetrates further into the intricacies of Chantepie’s phenomenological approach.&lt;ref&gt;James: 141-43&lt;/ref&gt;
  
For Chantepie, phenomenology is affected by the philosophy and [[history of religion]], but for Kristensen, it is also the medium whereby the philosophy and history of religion interact with and affect one another.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 9&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Kristensen’s account of the relationship between historical manifestations and philosophy is more similar to that of Hegel than it is to Chantepie.  In defining the religious essence of which he explores historical manifestations, Kristensen appropriates [[Rudolf Otto]]’s conception of ''das Heilige'' ("the holy" or "the sacred").  Otto describes ''das Heilige'' with the expression ''mysterium tremendum et fascinans''—a numinous power revealed in a moment of "awe" that admits of both the horrible shuddering of "religious dread" (''tremendum'') and fascinating wonder (''fascinans'') with the overpowering majesty (''majestas'') of the ineffable, "wholly other" mystery (''mysterium'').&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 15-18; Otto: 5-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Chantepie, Kristensen argues that phenomenology seeks the “meaning” of religious phenomena.  Kristensen clarifies this supposition by defining the meaning that his phenomenology is seeking as “the meaning that the religious phenomena have for the believers themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;James: 144&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kristensen argues that phenomenology is not complete in grouping or classifying the phenomena according to their meaning, but in the act of understanding.  “Phenomenology has as its objects to come as far as possible into contact with and to understand the extremely varied and divergent religious data”.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a phenomenologist, Kristensen was less interested in philosophical presuppositions than in his concrete depth-research in the incidental religious phenomena. These subjects concerned mythological material (such as Creation, the Flood etc.) as well as human action (such as baptism, Olympic Games etc.), and objects of nature and handicrafts.
In all of this he only made use of the authentic sources: writings and images by the believers themselves. This procedure compelled him to reduce the field of his research - he had to profoundly master all relating languages and writings in order to be able to understand his sources in a way as they would have wanted to be understood themselves.
Consequently, he reduced his field of research to the phenomena in religions living around the origin of Christianity: during the millennia before and the centuries after Christ, in Iran (Avesta), Babylonia and Assyria, Israel, Egypt, Greece and Rome.
The required knowledge of speeches, also, is one of the causes that only few (Van der Leeuw, Bleeker) of his pupils did carry on in his line, although many scholars showed interests in the results of his research.
Apart from his synopsis ''The Meaning of Religion'', and a just simple ''Introduction in History of Religion'', his publications are mostly restricted to the results of his incidental partial researches, published in the shape of a Communication of the Royal Academy of the Netherlands.

== van der Leeuw ==
The phenomenological approach to religion developed in [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]]’s ''Phänomenologie der Religion'' (1933) follows Kristensen in many respects, while also appropriating the phenomenology of [[Martin Heidegger]] and the [[hermeneutics]] of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].

For van der Leeuw, understanding is the subjective aspect of phenomena, which is inherently intertwined with the objectivity of that which is manifest.  Van der Leeuw articulates the relation of understanding to understood phenomena according to the schema outlined in Dilthey’s definition of the human sciences (''Geisteswissenschaften'') as sciences that are “based on the relations between experience, expression and understanding” (“''Verhältnis von Erlebnis, Ausdruck, und Verstehen''”).&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1956: 776; 1963a: 676&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Leeuw correlates subjective experience, expression, and understanding with three objective levels of appearing—relative concealment (''Verborgenheit''), relative transparency (''Durchsichtigkeit''), and gradually becoming manifest or revealed (''Offenbarwerden''), wherein the understanding of what is becoming revealed is the primordial level of appearing from which the experienced concealment and expressed transparency of appearing are derived.&lt;ref&gt;1956: 769; 1963a: 671&lt;/ref&gt;

Because van der Leeuw, like Kristensen, appropriates Otto’s concept of ''das Heilige'' in defining the essential category of religion, the transcendence becoming revealed in all human understanding can be further described as sacred — an overpowering “wholly other,” which becomes revealed in astonishing moments of dreadful [[awe]] (''Scheu'') and wonderful fascination.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 23, 681; Otto: 14-32&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Leeuw argues that this concept of religious dread is also present in Kierkegaard’s work on ''[[Angst]]'' and in Heidegger’s statement that “what arouses dread is ‘being in the world’ itself”.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 463; cf. Kierkegaard; Heidegger 1962; 230&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, van der Leeuw recognizes that, although dreadful, Being-in-the-world is fundamentally characterized as [[wikt:cura|care]] (''Sorge''), the existential structure whereby ''[[Dasein]]'' is concerned with meaningful relationships in the world alongside other beings.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 339, 543; cf. Heidegger 1962: 364-70&lt;/ref&gt;

Because all experiences disclose concealed (wholly other) transcendence to the understanding, all experiences of Being-in-the-world are ultimately religious experiences of the sacred, whether explicitly recognized as such or not.  Human being as such is ''[[homo religiosus]]'', the opposite of ''homo negligens''.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 50, 680&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the task of the phenomenology of religion to interpret the various ways in which the sacred appears to human beings in the world, the ways in which humans understand and care for that which is revealed to them, for that which is ultimately wholly other mystery.
Among other great phenomenologists who worked and influenced phenomenology of religion are [[Henry Corbin]],  [[Ninian Smart]], [[Mircea Eliade]].

In [[music]], a '''pitch class''' ('''p.c.''' or '''pc''') is a [[set (music)|set]] of all [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] that are a whole number of [[octave]]s apart, e.g., the pitch class C consists of the Cs in all octaves. "The pitch class C stands for all possible Cs, in whatever octave position."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Whittall]], ''The Cambridge Introduction to Serialism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008): 276. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68200-8}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; Important to [[musical set theory]], a pitch class is, "all pitches related to each other by octave, [[Enharmonic|enharmonic equivalence]], or both."&lt;ref&gt;Don Michael Randel, ed. (2003). "Set theory", ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', p.776. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674011632}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, using [[scientific pitch notation]], the pitch class "C" is the set

:{C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''n'' is an [[integer]]} = {..., C&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ...};

although there is no formal upper or lower limit to this sequence, only a limited number of these pitches are audible to the human ear. 
Pitch class is important because human [[Pitch (psychophysics)|pitch-perception]] is [[Periodic function|periodic]]: pitches belonging to the same pitch class are perceived as having a similar quality or color, a property called "[[octave equivalence]]".

Psychologists refer to the quality of a pitch as its "chroma".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Tymoczko|Tymoczko, Dmitri]] (2011). ''A Geometry of Music: Harmony and Counterpoint in the Extended Common Practice'', p.30. Oxford Studies in Music Theory. {{ISBN|9780199714353}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''chroma'' is an attribute of pitches (as opposed to ''tone height''), just like [[hue]] is an attribute of [[color]]. A ''pitch class'' is a set of all pitches that share the same chroma, just like "the set of all white things" is the collection of all white objects.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Meinard (2007). ''Information Retrieval for Music and Motion'', p.60. {{ISBN|9783540740483}}. "A pitch class is defined to be the set of all pitches that share the same chroma."&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that in standard Western [[equal temperament]], distinct spellings can refer to the same sounding object: B{{music|sharp}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and D{{music|bb}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; all refer to the same pitch, hence share the same chroma, and therefore belong to the same pitch class; a phenomenon called [[enharmonic|enharmonic equivalence]].

==Integer notation==
To avoid the problem of enharmonic spellings, theorists typically represent pitch classes using numbers beginning from zero, with each successively larger integer representing a pitch class that would be one semitone higher than the preceding one, if they were all realised as actual pitches in the same octave. Because octave-related pitches belong to the same class, when an octave is reached, the numbers begin again at zero. This cyclical system is referred to as [[modular arithmetic]] and, in the usual case of chromatic twelve-tone scales, pitch-class numbering is regarded as "modulo 12" (customarily abbreviated "mod 12" in the music-theory literature)—that is, every twelfth member is identical. One can map a pitch's fundamental frequency ''f'' (measured in [[hertz]]) to a real number ''p'' using the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;p = 9 + 12\log_2 \frac{f}{440\text{ Hz}}&lt;/math&gt;

This creates a linear [[pitch space]] in which octaves have size 12, [[semitone]]s (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and [[middle C]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is assigned the number 0 (thus, the pitches on [[piano]] are −39 to +48). Indeed, the mapping from pitch to real numbers defined in this manner forms the basis of the [[MIDI Tuning Standard]], which uses the real numbers from 0 to 127 to represent the pitches C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; to G&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (thus, middle C is 60). To represent pitch ''classes'', we need to identify or "glue together" all pitches belonging to the same pitch class&amp;mdash;i.e.&amp;nbsp;all numbers ''p'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;12. The result is a cyclical [[quotient group]] that musicians call [[pitch class space]] and mathematicians call '''R'''/12'''Z'''. Points in this space can be labelled using [[real number]]s in the range 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;12. These numbers provide numerical alternatives to the letter names of elementary music theory: 

:0 = C, 1 = C{{music|#}}/D{{music|b}}, 2 = D, 2.5 = D{{music|t}} ([[quarter tone]] sharp), 3 = D{{music|#}}/E{{music|b}},

and so on. In this system, pitch classes represented by integers are classes of [[12 equal temperament|twelve-tone equal temperament]] (assuming standard concert A).

[[Image:Integer notation.png|thumb|right|350px|Integer notation.]]

In [[music]], '''integer notation''' is the translation of pitch classes and/or [[interval class]]es into [[integer|whole numbers]].&lt;ref name="Whittall"&gt;Whittall (2008), p.273.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if C&amp;nbsp;= 0, then C{{music|#}}&amp;nbsp;= 1 ... A{{music|#}}&amp;nbsp;= 10, B&amp;nbsp;= 11, with "10" and "11" substituted by "t" and "e" in some sources,&lt;ref name="Whittall"/&gt; ''A'' and ''B'' in others&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Morris, "Generalizing Rotational Arrays", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 32, no. 1 (Spring 1988): 75–132, citation on 83.&lt;/ref&gt; (like the [[duodecimal]] numeral system, which also uses "t" and "e", or ''A'' and ''B'', for "10" and "11"). This allows the most economical presentation of information regarding [[post-tonal]] materials.&lt;ref name="Whittall"/&gt;

In the integer model of pitch, all pitch classes and [[interval (music)|interval]]s between pitch classes are designated using the numbers 0 through 11. It is not used to notate music for performance, but is a common [[musical analysis|analytical]] and [[musical composition|compositional]] tool when working with chromatic music, including [[twelve tone technique|twelve tone]], [[serialism|serial]], or otherwise [[atonality|atonal]] music.

Pitch classes can be notated in this way by assigning the number 0 to some note and assigning consecutive integers to consecutive [[semitone]]s; so if 0 is C natural, 1 is C{{Music|sharp}}, 2 is D{{Music|natural}} and so on up to 11, which is B{{Music|natural}}. The C above this is not 12, but 0 again (12&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0). Thus arithmetic [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 12 is used to represent [[octave]] [[Equivalence class (music)|equivalence]]. One advantage of this system is that it ignores the "spelling" of notes (B{{Music|sharp}}, C{{Music|natural}} and D{{Music|doubleflat}} are all 0) according to their [[diatonic functionality]].

===Disadvantages===
&lt;!--1st disadvantage--&gt;There are a few disadvantages with integer notation. First, theorists have traditionally used the same integers to indicate elements of different tuning systems. Thus, the numbers 0, 1, 2,&amp;nbsp;... 5, are used to notate pitch classes in 6-tone equal temperament. This means that the meaning of a given integer changes with the underlying tuning system: "1" can refer to C{{music|#}} in 12-tone equal temperament, but D in 6-tone equal temperament.

&lt;!--2nd disadvantage--&gt;Also, the same numbers are used to represent both [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and [[interval (music)|intervals]]. For example, the number 4 serves both as a label for the pitch class E (if C&amp;nbsp;= 0) and as a label for the ''distance'' between the pitch classes D and F{{music|#}}. (In much the same way, the term "10 degrees" can label both a temperature and the distance between two temperatures.) Only one of these labelings is sensitive to the (arbitrary) choice of pitch class 0. For example, if one makes a different choice about which pitch class is labeled 0, then the pitch class E will no longer be labeled "4". However, the distance between D and F{{music|#}} will still be assigned the number 4. Both this and the issue in the paragraph directly above may be viewed as disadvantages (though mathematically, an element "4" should not be confused with the function "+4").

The system described above is flexible enough to describe any pitch class in any tuning system: for example, one can use the numbers {0, 2.4, 4.8, 7.2, 9.6} to refer to the five-tone scale that divides the octave evenly. However, in some contexts, it is convenient to use alternative labeling systems.  For example, in [[just intonation]], we may express pitches in terms of positive rational numbers {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}}, expressed by reference to a 1 (often written "{{sfrac|1|1}}"), which represents a fixed pitch. If ''a'' and ''b'' are two positive rational numbers, they belong to the same pitch class if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;

for some [[integer]] ''n''. Therefore, we can represent pitch classes in this system using ratios {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} where neither ''p'' nor ''q'' is divisible by 2, that is, as ratios of odd integers. Alternatively, we can represent just intonation pitch classes by reducing to the octave, 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''p''|''q''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2.

It is also very common to label pitch classes with reference to some [[Scale (music)|scale]].  For example, one can label the pitch classes of ''n''-tone [[equal temperament]] using the integers 0 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. In much the same way, one could label the pitch classes of the C major scale, C–D–E–F–G–A–B, using the numbers from 0 to 6.  This system has two advantages over the continuous labeling system described above.  First, it eliminates any suggestion that there is something natural about a twelvefold division of the octave.  Second, it avoids pitch-class universes with unwieldy decimal expansions when considered relative to 12; for example, in the continuous system, the pitch-classes of [[19 equal temperament]] are labeled 0.63158..., 1.26316..., etc. Labeling these pitch classes {0, 1, 2, 3 ..., 18} simplifies the arithmetic used in pitch-class set manipulations.

The disadvantage of the scale-based system is that it assigns an infinite number of different names to chords that sound identical.  For example, in twelve-tone equal-temperament the C major triad is notated {0, 4, 7}.  In twenty-four-tone equal-temperament, this same triad is labeled {0, 8, 14}.  Moreover, the scale-based system appears to suggest that different tuning systems use steps of the same size ("1") but have octaves of differing size ("12" in 12-tone equal-temperament, "19" in 19-tone equal temperament, and so on), whereas in fact the opposite is true: different tuning systems divide the same octave into different-sized steps.

In general, it is often more useful to use the traditional integer system when one is working within a single temperament; when one is comparing chords in different temperaments, the continuous system can be more useful.

'''Pregnancy in art''' covers any [[artistic work]] that portrays [[pregnancy]] in women.  In art as in life, it is often unclear whether an actual state of pregnancy is intended to be shown.  A common visual indication is the gesture of the woman placing a protective open hand on her abdomen.  Historically, married women were at some stage of pregnancy for much of their life until the [[menopause]], but the depiction of this in art is relatively uncommon,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79792 MOMA, New York, Note on Klimt's ''Hope II'']&lt;/ref&gt; and generally restricted to some specific contexts.  This probably persists even in contemporary culture; despite several recent artworks depicting heavily pregnant women, one writer was "astonished at the shortage of visual images&amp;nbsp;... of pregnant women in public visual culture".&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;  A research study conducted by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] in 1963 found that the great majority of 693 French subjects thought that a photo of a pregnant woman could not, by definition, be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two subjects often depicted in Western narrative art, or [[history painting]], where pregnancy is an important part of the story.  These are the unhappy scene usually called ''Diana and Callisto'', showing the moment of discovery of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]'s forbidden pregnancy, and the biblical scene of the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 251; the entry on "Pregnancy" mentions only these two.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually, portraits of pregnant women began to appear, with a particular fashion for "pregnancy portraits" in elite portraiture of the years around 1600.

As well as being a subject for depiction in art, pregnant women were also consumers of art, with some special types of work developed for them, including ''Madonna del Parto'' images of Mary.

==Traditional cultures==
Images of pregnant women, especially small [[figurine]]s, were made in traditional cultures in many places and periods, though it is rarely one of the most common types  of image.  These include ceramic figures from some [[Pre-Columbian]] cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with [[fertility in art|fertility]].  Identifying whether such figures are actually meant to show pregnancy is often a problem, as well as understanding their role in the culture concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay, Lauren E., "Archaeological Ms.conceptions: Contemplating Gender and the Greek Neolithic", in ''Representations of Gender From Prehistory To the Present'', 5-9, 2000, Springer, {{ISBN|1349623318}}, 9781349623310.  For an international survey of the subject in general, see ''The Oxford Handbook of Prehistoric Figurines'', ed. Timothy Insoll, 2017, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199675619}}, 9780199675616, which has few mentions of pregnancy in its 900 pages. For Pre-Classic examples from the Highlands of [[Guatemala]], see [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5QJlCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 ''Handbook of Middle American Indians'', Volumes 2 and 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the oldest surviving examples of the depiction of pregnancy are prehistoric [[figurines]] found across much of [[Eurasia]] and collectively known as [[Venus figurines]].  The best known is the [[Venus of Willendorf]], an [[Jurassic|oolitic]] [[limestone]] figurine of a woman whose breasts and hips have been exaggerated to emphasise her fertility. These figurines exaggerate the [[abdomen]], [[hips]], [[breasts]], [[thighs]], or [[vulva]] of the subject, but the degree to which the figures appear to be pregnant varies considerably, and most are not noticeably pregnant at all.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 747; Cook&lt;/ref&gt;  An inevitably subjective survey of the corpus of about 140 figurines concluded that only 17% of them represented pregnant women, extending to 39% "which could possibly represent pregnancy".&lt;ref&gt;Taiz, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western art==
[[Image:TitianDianaCallistoEdinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', 1559, shows the moment when [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]'s pregnancy is discovered]]
In Europe, depictions of pregnancy were largely avoided in [[classical art]] (apart from small [[Votive offering|votive figure]]s), but later Western art had two subjects that were frequently depicted where pregnancy was integral to the narrative.

===Callisto===
In [[Greek mythology]] the nymph [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] became pregnant by [[Zeus]] (Jupiter to the Romans) in disguise. Her pregnancy was spotted when she was bathing, and her furious mistress [[Artemis]] (Diana) sent her away; Jupiter's wife [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] then turned her into a bear.  The few classical depictions tended to show this transformation, but in later art the traumatic moment of discovery was most often depicted, especially from the Renaissance onwards, using the Roman poet [[Ovid]] as the source.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 102–103, 251; Roberts, 752&lt;/ref&gt;

What became the typical composition was first seen in [[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' (1559), where Callisto's abdomen is exposed as Artemis/Diana points accusingly at her and her other followers display a variety of reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 102–103, 251; Roberts, 752&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Ovid places the discovery in the ninth month of Callisto's pregnancy ([[Metamorphoses]] II, [http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph2.htm#476707506 441–465]), in paintings she is generally shown with a rather modest bump for late pregnancy.  But this is appropriate as the scene shows the moment when her intimate companions first realized that she was pregnant.  It is clear that the main attraction of the subject was the opportunity to depict a group of female nudes,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 752&lt;/ref&gt; though it could be claimed that it illustrated the serious consequences of an unwanted pregnancy.

===Virgin Mary===
Depictions of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] were by far the most frequent images featuring a pregnant woman in post-classical Western art, and probably remain so to the modern day.  The moment of Mary's conception of Jesus, called the [[Annunciation]], is [[Annunciation in Christian art|one of the most common]] subjects in traditional Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 35–52&lt;/ref&gt; but depictions from later in her pregnancy are also common.  Unlike many other kinds of depictions of pregnancy, there is usually no ambiguity as to whether Mary is intended to be shown while pregnant, even where the pregnancy is not clearly visualized.  
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Visitation - WGA25716.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'' by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (1430s, now [[Leipzig]]) with open laces on Elizabeth.]]
The [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], a meeting between two pregnant women, Mary and [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], as recorded in the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleref2|Luke|1:39–56|64}}, was very often depicted,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 55&lt;/ref&gt; but their pregnancy is usually not emphasized visually, at least until [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1; Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval thinking held that Elizabeth was about seven months pregnant at the meeting, and Mary about one.&lt;ref&gt;Following {{bibleref|Luke|1:26|9}}, where Elizabeth is six months pregnant at the [[Annunciation]].  The relevant medieval Western feasts were [[Feast of the Annunciation]] on 25 March, [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on 25 June, and Christmas on 25 December.  The feast of the Visitation itself was on 2 July, rather illogically, as it was then after the birth of John.&lt;/ref&gt;

The loose full clothes used in religious art, as in normal medieval life, make it hard to detect in any case.  In late medieval paintings they may be shown with vertical gaps in their clothes; female medieval dress had openings that were normally closed by laces when dressing, but could be left open during pregnancy.  These may be either at the front or the sides, and are used in art to indicate pregnancy, although from about 1450 such gaps, revealing a contrasting colour of undergarment, became a fashion and can be seen in art on slim, unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases one or other places a hand on the bump of the other, as in [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s [[Leipzig]] version (illustrated).  A few images, mostly Byzantine or Late Medieval German, show their unborn children in the womb, as though in a modern [[cutaway drawing]]. In German images they are naked (though usually with halos)  and [[John the Baptist]] bows or kneels to Jesus, who raises a hand in blessing.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 56; Hall, 251, 337; Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be emphasized that in all periods the majority of depictions have little visual indication that either woman is pregnant; the story was well-known to its audience.

Some other images showed the pregnant Virgin with [[Saint Joseph]] or other relatives, including some of the ''Journey to Bethlehem'' for the birth.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt;  This last was a standard part of [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] cycles, but rare in the Western church.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 58&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a few images of Joseph and Mary looking for shelter or being turned away at the inn in [[Bethlehem]], mostly from north of the Alps after 1500; in these Mary is usually clearly pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;The subject is not covered by Schiller. It is called the ''Herbergssuche'' ("Search for shelter") in German. See [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mary_and_Joseph_seeking_refuge the category on Wikimedia Commons].&lt;/ref&gt;

The rare subject of the ''Doubting of Joseph'' also needed to establish Mary's pregnancy, and some versions indicated this by unlaced openings in her dress or a "cutaway" unborn Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1, after fig 1.5, illustrates both types; Schiller, 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scene, based on {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:18–25|64}} and [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] elaborations, Joseph is unsettled by the pregnancy of his virgin bride, but is later reassured by an angel who comes to him in a dream, the first of his [[Saint Joseph's dreams|four dreams]] in Matthew.  Mary is often shown spinning while pregnant; the spinning figure with "cutaway" illustrated has Joseph's head appearing through the tracery at left.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 57, figs 141 and 142&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar painting in [[Budapest]], where Mary spun while Joseph slept and the angel appeared to him, the unborn Jesus is not visible in the painting now, but can be seen in the [[underdrawing]] with [[infrared reflectography]].  Either the artist or patron had a change of mind at the time, or it was overpainted later, perhaps as the motif came to be felt indecorous or primitive.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Maria gravida, or Mary at the Spinning Wheel from Németújvár (c.1410, Hungarian gallery).jpg|Image, with note from the Hungarian National gallery]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other similar images are of Mary alone, especially as statues; these are called ''Maria gravida'' ("Pregnant Mary") and are covered below.
[[File:Piero Madonna del parto.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna del Parto]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]], c. 1460, with unlacing at the front and side.]]

A number of Early Netherlandish paintings show [[Mary Magdalene]] with the same unlaced opening in her dress.  Penny Howell Jolly has proposed that this motif represents her "spiritual pregnancy", although in his account of the most famous example, ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|The Descent from the Cross]]'' by van der Weyden (c. 1435, now [[Prado]]) [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] notes the unlacing, but attributes it merely to Mary Magdalene's distressed condition.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madonna del Parto]] is a term for figures of the [[Virgin Mary]] especially associated with pregnancy and childbirth, or showing the Virgin pregnant.  These are not very common; the best known is the [[fresco]] by [[Piero della Francesca]], where a heavily pregnant Mary has a prominent unlaced opening at the front of her dress, and another at the side.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these depictions fell from fashion during the Renaissance, and the Piero is the latest known from [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferrie&lt;/ref&gt;  These attracted the devotions of pregnant women or those concerned for them, as well as those wanting a pregnancy.  Queen [[Claude of France]], who had seven children before dying at the age of 24, had the painting of the ''Visitation'' by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] (now [[Louvre]]) in her chamber.&lt;ref&gt;"Claude de France", 80–81, ''Encyclopedia of Women in the Renaissance: Italy, France, and England'', edited by Diana Maury Robin, Anne R. Larsen, Carole Levin, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OQ8mdTjxungC&amp;pg=PA81 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of these images of Mary feature a "cutaway" view of Jesus ''in utero'' within, as found in some images of the ''Visitation'' (see above),&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt; and many have the same protective gesture of the hand on the stomach, which also features in portraits of pregnant women when these begin to appear.  After the [[Counter-Reformation]] a visualized ''in utero'' Jesus becomes rare, and instead Mary may be shown with the [[Christogram]] "IHS" on her stomach.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mary_with_Jesus_shown_%27%27in_utero%27%27 the Wikimedia Commons category]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Orthodox]] icons, the ''in utero'' Jesus, which is normally fully clothed, remains part of the tradition for certain representations to the present day. It is found in one of the most famous [[Russian icon]]s, the 12th-century [[Ustyug Annunciation]] in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow, which has the birth-size Child shown inside the chest area, and in the icons of Mary of the type known as ''Pomozhenie rodam'' in Russian, translated as "Help in childbirth"  (or "Succour in travail").

===Portraits===
[[File:Attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts II - Portrait of an Unknown Lady - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|English "pregnancy portrait" of an unknown lady, attributed to [[Marcus Gheeraerts II]], c. 1595&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gheeraerts-portrait-of-an-unknown-lady-t07699 Tate page], attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts II, ''Portrait of an Unknown Lady'', c.1595&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval Period]], portraits of pregnant-looking women began to be painted, though the fashion for dresses gathered at the front makes these difficult to interpret or identify with confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Chapter 1, after fig 1.5&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Arnolfini portrait]] by [[Jan van Eyck]] of 1434 might be an example of pregnancy, but the current views of art historians are mostly against this, as virgin saints were often shown in much the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Edwin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IJOwCF2xkc4C The Arnolfini Betrothal: Medieval Marriage and the Enigma of Van Eyck's Double Portrait]'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1015-106, 1994, {{ISBN|0-520-08251-6}}. The text is also available from the [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft1d5nb0d9/ California Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  The virgin martyr and "princess" Saint [[Catherine of Alexandria]], usually dressed in the height of fashion in this period, was also the [[patron saint]] of childbirth, so there may be a degree of deliberate ambiguity in images of her.

Some Italian Renaissance portraits thought to be of pregnant women show them wearing a gauzy underdress called a ''guarnello'', often associated with pregnancy or the period after childbirth. These include [[Leonardo Da Vinci]]'s [[Mona Lisa]], where the garment first became visible under [[infrared and thermal testing|infra-red scans]] in 2006, suggesting that [[Lisa del Giocondo]], the sitter, was pregnant or just had a baby when she was painted.  Another painting with a ''guarnello'' is [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Lady Known as Smeralda Brandini]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15029288/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/was-mona-lisa-pregnant-when-she-posed/#.WQFLcNz_qM8 "Was Mona Lisa pregnant when she posed?"], [[Associated Press]], carried by NBC, 27 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; where the sitter also holds a hand over the top of her bump.  This is a feature seen in many images such as ''Visitation'' scenes where pregnancy is certain, and that probably indicates it in cases where it is much less clear, including some portraits by [[Anthony van Dyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 43, note 18&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[La Donna Gravida]]'' ("The Pregnant Lady") by [[Raphael]] is another example, with an apparently pregnant woman sitting with her left hand over her stomach, but such depictions remained infrequent in [[Renaissance art]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception to this is the "pregnancy portrait" (a term first used by Karen Hearn, a [[Tate Britain]] curator) of a woman shown as heavily pregnant, usually standing.  These are especially found in England, where the fashion may have been popularized in about the 1590s by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]], an English painter of Flemish parentage, who was the leading English painter of these portraits.  Part of the reason for them may have been the risk to the mother of childbirth and some may well be posthumous.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some earlier examples from court portraiture on the Continent,&lt;ref&gt;"'Only matrimony maketh children to be certain...': Two Elizabethan pregnancy portraits", 19, Pauline Croft and Karen Hearn, ''The British Art Journal'', Vol. 3, No. 3 (Autumn 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and in England,&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; but the main group of English portraits dates from roughly the late 1580s to about 1630.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 40&lt;/ref&gt;  At around the same time as the English examples [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain]] sent portraits of herself while pregnant to close female friends and relations.&lt;ref&gt;Anne J. Cruz, Maria Galli Stampino, eds., ''Early Modern Habsburg Women: Transnational Contexts, Cultural Conflicts, Dynastic Continuities'', 156, 2016, Routledge, {{ISBN|1317146921}}, 9781317146926, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=plkfDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  The example illustrated below by her court painter [[Bartolomé González y Serrano]], which was sent back home to the Austrian Habsburgs, only varies her standard official portrait by exchanging her daughter for the usual dog or chair at the left, and bringing out her dress at the front.  Probably no fresh posing for the artist was necessary.  Her daughter, [[Anne of Austria]], Queen of France, was herself painted when 8 months pregnant with the future [[Louis XIV of France]], born 23 years into her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;However, they had both been 14 at the marriage, which was probably not consummated for some time.&lt;/ref&gt;  The portrait of their unfortunate cousin, Holy Roman Empress [[Maria Leopoldine of Austria]], who died in childbirth at 16 in 1649, the year the portrait is dated, is perhaps a posthumous adaptation of her wedding portrait.

Later portraits of pregnant women tended to be family members or at least friends of the artists; relatively few women, or their husbands, chose to commission expensive portraits (often only done once in a lifetime) showing them pregnant, although many women spent most of at least the early years of their married life pregnant.  The most common moment for a woman to have her portrait painted was just after her marriage, when any suggestion of pregnancy would be unwanted.  In some well-documented cases, the subjects of portraits can be shown to be well into pregnancy when the portrait was painted, but this is "suppressed" or "concealed" in the image.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750("suppressed"); Hearn, 39 ("concealed")&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a relatively simple matter for a portraitist to remove or add a pregnant belly to a painting.  Several of the paintings (which are not portraits, though no doubt models from his circle were used) of [[Vermeer]] have been said to show pregnant women, but specialists mostly discount this.  One specialist was not aware of any portrait showing a pregnant woman from the whole of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 39, citing Marieke de Winkel.  Klepp, 138, says the same of 18th-century British America&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to 16th-century styles, "the fashion that had developed by the 1620s was especially helpful for a person trying to hide a swelling belly", even if only in a portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Luthman, Johanna, ''Love, Madness, and Scandal: The Life of Frances Coke Villiers, Viscountess Purbeck'', 76, 2017, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0198754655}}, 9780198754657, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WeE-DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 a portrait of his wife by [[Lovis Corinth]], dated five days before the birth, shows a profile view that emphasizes the pregnancy.  The prolific Corinth painted several pregnant women, many apparently not portraits.  [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]] painted herself as pregnant in 1906 before she had ever been so; in the following 18 months she had a daughter, dying three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moralizing genre or satire===
[[File:William Hogarth 009.jpg|thumb|[[William Hogarth]], ''A Woman Swearing a Child to a Grave Citizen'' c.1729]]
Some [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] depictions in [[genre painting]], or other media such as [[popular print]]s or book illustrations, addressed the social implications of pregnancy, either showing women who were seen as having more children than they could afford, or women, especially maids, who had become pregnant outside marriage, with dire social implications for them.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 750–752&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of narrative scenes which show unwanted pregnancies essentially from the father's point of view, including some where the woman has brought the matter before local magistrates to award financial support, as unmarried women were able to do in England (uniquely, according to [[Bernard Picart]], who poured scorn on the law).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.genguide.co.uk/source/bastardy-bonds-amp-documents-parish-amp-poor-law/140/ Bastardy Bonds &amp; Documents (Parish &amp; Poor Law)]; for Picart's comments, see [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1M9CAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA253 pp. 254–256]&lt;/ref&gt;  The English artist [[William Hogarth]] included many pregnant women in his works, usually with a satirical or comic intention, and generally more often giving a negative implication than a positive one.&lt;ref&gt;Klepp, 132–138; [http://english231ballads2014w.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/71584958/Mitchell.pdf Mitchell, PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hogarth's ''A Woman Swearing a Child to a Grave Citizen'' (or ''The Denunciation'', c.1729, [[National Gallery of Ireland]]) a young woman falsely accuses a rich old man of fathering her child, while the real father advises her.  The verses on the print version summarize the situation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3560226&amp;partId=1&amp;people=33462&amp;peoA=33462-1-7&amp;page=2 British Museum page on a print version].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Here pregnant Madam screens the real Sire,/And falsly swears her Bastard Child for Hire/Upon a Rich old Letcher, who denies/The Fact, and vows the naughty Hussif lies;/His Wife enrag'd, exclaims against her Spouse,/And swears she'l be reveng'd upon his Brows;/The Jade, the Justice and Church Ward'ns agree,/And force him to provide Security.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular Hogarth depicted a number of pregnant ballad-sellers, and ones with young children.  Since the job required little movement, it was perhaps often taken during pregnancy, but Hogarth seems to have reflected a set of contemporary ideas using pregnancy as a metaphor for printing as a means of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Gustav Klimt - Hope, II - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Hoffnung II'' ("[[Hope II]]"), [[Gustav Klimt]], 1907-08]]
As the modern era approached, some artists began to show pregnancy more explicitly, with heavily pregnant figures, and more pregnant nudes than before.  Two paintings (not portraits as such) by [[Gustav Klimt]], ''[[Hope I]]'' (1903) and ''[[Hope II]]''  (1907–08), show slim, heavily pregnant women in profile. In ''Hope I'' the figure is nude, and the pregnancy very evident,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''Hope II'' a huge and elaborate dress or cloak makes this less immediately clear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79792 MOMA, New York, Note on Klimt's ''Hope II'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egon Schiele]] made pregnant nudes the subject of many of his drawings with colour, favouring a frontal view.  ''The Pregnant Woman'' by [[Pablo Picasso]] was a [[sculpture]] dedicated to his then partner Francoise Gilot and was made out of [[plaster]], [[armature (sculpture)|metal armature]], [[wood]], [[ceramic art|ceramic vessels]] and [[jars]]. Picasso wanted to inspire Gilot to have a third child with him by making this sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/artwork/pablo-picasso-pregnant-woman-la-femme-enceinte|title=Pablo Picasso – Pregnant Woman (Femme Enceinte)|publisher=artsy.net|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pregnant woman'' was the most famous painting in a series of paintings of seven pregnant [[nude women]] painted by [[Alice Neel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jul/07/alice-neel|title=The weird world of Alice Neel|work=The Guardian|date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pregnant girl'' was a painting of 1960–61 by [[Lucian Freud]] that portrayed his then girlfriend Bernadine Coverley, when she was pregnant with their daughter Bella.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.khm.at/fileadmin/content/KHM/Presse/2013/Freud_Neu/KHM_Freud_booklet_ENG.pdf Lucian Freud exhibition], No. 10, Press release/exhibition booklet, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien]], Vienna, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been nude sculptures of heavily pregnant women by, among others, [[Damien Hirst]], with ''The Virgin Mother'' (now at [[Lever House]] in New York)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leverhouseartcollection.com/collectionsexhibitions/collection/virgin-mother ''The Virgin Mother'' Lever House Art Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Verity (statue)|Verity]]'', 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Medical illustration==
[[File:Brussels Koninklijke Bibliotheek van Belgie, Bibliothèque royale de Belgique ms. 3701-15 57.jpg|thumb|left|Page from the earliest manuscript of [[Muscio]] on midwifery, 9–11th century]] 
In contrast to the general rarity of artistic depictions of pregnancy, in the field of medical illustration it has been one of the earliest and commonest subjects, with the same "[[cutaway drawing]]" approach found in some medieval religious works typically used.  The foetus is generally the main focus of interest, rather than the mother.  Most early depictions used in manuals on midwifery were very inaccurate, but still useful for showing the positions for delivery in [[childbirth]].  They were based on the re-copying over many generations of images from medical texts going back to [[Soranus of Ephesus]] in antiquity and [[Muscio]] in about 500.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 747–748&lt;/ref&gt;

The accurate drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] may have been the first to be made, but professional medical texts took centuries to catch up.  The Scottish anatomist [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]], doctor to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], was an admirer of Leonardo's drawings in the [[Royal Collection]] and learnt from their clear depictions.  His own work, ''The Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus Exhibited in Figures'', was published in 1774 and based on extensive study of late pregnant corpses;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 748; Wells, ''The Heart of Leonardo'', 249, 2014, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, {{ISBN|1447145313}}, 9781447145318, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tuq5BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; how he obtained so many was the subject of suspicion at the time and subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/07/british-obstetrics-founders-murders-claim Founders of British obstetrics 'were callous murderers'], Denis Campbell, 7 February 1997, ''The Observer'', accessed April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art for pregnant women==
[[File:Bartolomeo Di Fruosino - Desco da parto (verso) - WGA01342.jpg|thumb|[[Bartolomeo di Fruosino]], 1420, a typical ''[[desco da parto]]'' (verso) with heraldry and a baby boy, to encourage positive thoughts during pregnancy, and even the birth of such a child.]]

Some kinds of art have been designed with pregnant women especially in mind, though these are perhaps less common than art intended for women wanting to become pregnant (discussed in art history using the term "[[fertility in art|fertility]]").  One of the many contexts and uses speculated for [[Venus figurine]]s is that they were held in the hand during childbirth, for which their rather consistent size and shape seems well suited. However, there are a variety of other explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Vandewettering, Kaylea R. (2015) "Upper Paleolithic Venus Figurines and Interpretations of Prehistoric Gender Representations", ''PURE Insights'': Vol. 4, Article 7, [http://digitalcommons.wou.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1051&amp;context=pure free online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madonna del Parto]] and other images of the pregnant Virgin Mary were often mainly designed to offer a focus for the devotions of pregnant women and those concerned for them. In 1954 the mayor of [[Monterchi]], home of the [[Piero della Francesca]] ''Madonna'', refused to lend it to an exhibition in Florence so as not to deprive the population of its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrie&lt;/ref&gt;

The painted ''[[desco da parto]]'' ("birth tray" or "birth salver") was an important symbolic gift for married women in late medieval and [[Early Modern]] [[Florence]] and [[Siena]].  Both sides were typically painted, but with different types of scenes.  The upper side (or [[recto]]) generally had a crowded figure scene, usually secular, such as a scene from [[classical myth]] or a suitable [[allegory]].  Scenes from the [[Old Testament]] or the Christian religious repertoire also appear in some cases.  Birthing scenes were popular.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A; Musacchio, Jacqueline Marie, "The Medici-Tornabuoni Desco da Parto in Context", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' '''33''' (1998:137–151)&lt;/ref&gt;

The underside or [[verso]] generally has a simpler and often less elevated subject, with fewer, larger figures, and usually includes [[heraldry]], with the arms of both parents shown.&lt;ref&gt;The Medici-Tornabuoni tray is painted with the feather device of [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and the coats of arms of the Medici and Tornabuoni families.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scenes with one or two naked boy toddlers, with the [[coats of arms]] of both parents at the sides, are especially popular.

In the Renaissance it was believed that the sights a pregnant woman saw affected her pregnancy and even what it produced – [[Martin Luther]] told the cautionary story of a woman frightened by a mouse in pregnancy, who then gave birth to a mouse. Manuals advised keeping images with a positive impact in the sight of pregnant women, and it is in this context that the recurrent naked boys, and the scenes showing the end of a successful childbirth, should be seen.  This was also a factor in the display of images of the [[Virgin and Child]], which were ubiquitous in bedrooms. Probably the desci were hung with the verso displayed during pregnancy, to promote the production of a similar healthy boy.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rotating Sphere.gif|thumb|Sphere rotating around one of its diameters]]

'''Rotation around a fixed axis''' or '''about a fixed axis of revolution''' or '''motion with respect to a fixed [[wiktionary:axis of rotation|axis of rotation]]''' is a special case of [[rotation]]al motion. The fixed axis hypothesis excludes the possibility of an axis changing its orientation, and cannot describe such phenomena as [[nutation|wobbling]] or [[precession]]. According to [[Euler's rotation theorem]], simultaneous rotation along a number of stationary axes at the same time is impossible. If two rotations are forced at the same time, a new axis of rotation will appear.

This article assumes that the rotation is also stable, such that no torque is required to keep it going. The [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of rotation around a fixed axis of a rigid body are mathematically much simpler than those for [[Rigid body dynamics#Rigid-body angular momentum|free rotation of a rigid body]]; they are entirely analogous to those of [[linear motion]] along a single fixed direction, which is not true for ''free rotation of a rigid body''.  The expressions for the [[kinetic energy]] of the object, and for the forces on the parts of the object, are also simpler for rotation around a fixed axis, than for general rotational motion. For these reasons, rotation around a fixed axis is typically taught in introductory physics courses after students have mastered [[linear motion]]; the full generality of rotational motion is not usually taught in introductory physics classes.

==Translation and rotation==
{{see also|Rigid body}}
[[File:Worm Gear.gif|thumb|An example of rotation. Each part of the [[worm drive]]—both the worm and the worm gear—is rotating on its own axis.]]

A ''rigid body'' is an object of finite extent in which all the distances between the component particles are constant.  No truly rigid body exists; external forces can deform any solid. For our purposes, then, a rigid body is a solid which requires large forces to deform it appreciably.

A change in the position of a particle in three-dimensional space can be completely specified by three coordinates.  A change in the position of a rigid body is more complicated to describe.  It can be regarded as a combination of two distinct types of motion: translational motion and circular motion.

Purely ''[[Translation (geometry)|translational motion]]'' occurs when every particle of the body has the same instantaneous velocity as every other particle; then the path traced out by any particle is exactly parallel to the path traced out by every other particle in the body.  Under translational motion, the change in the position of a rigid body is specified completely by three coordinates such as ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' giving the [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] of any point, such as the center of mass, fixed to the rigid body.

Purely ''rotational motion'' occurs if every particle in the body moves in a circle about a single line. This line is called the axis of rotation. Then the radius [[Vector (geometry)|vector]]s from the axis to all particles undergo the same angular displacement at the same time. The axis of rotation need not go through the body. In general, any rotation can be specified completely by the three angular displacements with respect to the rectangular-coordinate axes ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.  Any change in the position of the rigid body is thus completely described by three translational and three rotational coordinates.

Any displacement of a rigid body may be arrived at by first subjecting the body to a displacement followed by a rotation, or conversely, to a rotation followed by a displacement.  We already know that for any collection of particles—whether at rest with respect to one another, as in a rigid body, or in relative motion, like the exploding fragments of a shell, the acceleration of the center of mass is given by
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{net}} = M a_{\mathrm{cm}}\;\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''M'' is the total mass of the system and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt; is the acceleration of the center of mass.  There remains the matter of describing the rotation of the body about the center of mass and relating it to the external forces acting on the body. The kinematics and dynamics of ''rotational motion around a single axis'' resemble the kinematics and dynamics of translational motion; rotational motion around a single axis even has a work-energy theorem analogous to that of particle dynamics.

==Kinematics==

===Angular displacement===
{{main|Angular displacement}}A particle moves in a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Having moved an arc length &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, its angular position is &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; relative to its original position, where &lt;math&gt;\theta=\frac{s}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

In mathematics and physics it is usual to use the natural unit [[radian]]s rather than degrees or [[revolutions per minute|revolutions]]. Units are converted as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  1 \text{ revolution } &amp;= 360^\circ = 2\pi \text{ radians, and} \\
  1 \text{ rad} &amp;= \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \approx 57.27^\circ.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

An angular displacement is a change in angular position:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \theta = \theta_{2} - \theta_{1}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular displacement, &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; is the initial angular position and &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; is the final angular position.

===Angular speed and angular velocity===
{{main|Angular velocity}}

Change in angular displacement per unit time is called angular velocity with direction along the axis of rotation. The symbol for angular velocity is &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and the units are typically rad s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Angular speed is the magnitude of angular velocity.

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\omega} = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{\theta_2 - \theta_1}{t_2 - t_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The instantaneous angular velocity is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(t) = \frac{d\theta}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the formula for angular position and letting &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{ds}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;, we have also

:&lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt} =  \frac{v}{r},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the translational speed of the particle.

Angular velocity and [[frequency]] are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = {2 \pi f} \!&lt;/math&gt;.

===Angular acceleration===
{{main|Angular acceleration}}
A changing angular velocity indicates the presence of an angular acceleration in rigid body, typically measured in rad s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. The average angular acceleration &lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; over a time interval Δ''t'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha} = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \frac{\omega_2 - \omega_1}{t_2 - t_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The instantaneous acceleration ''α''(''t'') is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha(t) = \frac{d\omega}{dt} = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the angular acceleration is the rate of change of the angular velocity, just as acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

The translational acceleration of a point on the object rotating is given by
:&lt;math&gt;a = r\alpha,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the radius or distance from the axis of rotation. This is also the [[tangential component]] of acceleration: it is tangential to the direction of motion of the point. If this component is 0, the motion is [[uniform circular motion]], and the velocity changes in direction only.

The radial acceleration (perpendicular to direction of motion) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;a_{\mathrm{R}} = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r\!&lt;/math&gt;.
It is directed towards the center of the rotational motion, and is often called the ''centripetal acceleration''.

The angular acceleration is caused by the [[torque]], which can have a positive or negative value in accordance with the convention of positive and negative angular frequency. The ratio of torque and angular acceleration (how difficult it is to start, stop, or otherwise change rotation) is given by the [[moment of inertia]]: &lt;math&gt;T = I\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

===Equations of kinematics===
When the angular acceleration is constant, the five quantities angular displacement &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, initial angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega_i&lt;/math&gt;, final angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega_f&lt;/math&gt;, angular acceleration &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; can be related by four [[Kinematics#Rotational motion|equations of kinematics]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \omega_f &amp;= \omega_i + \alpha t \\
      \theta &amp;= \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2 \\
  \omega_f^2 &amp;= \omega_i^2 + 2 \alpha\theta \\
      \theta &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left(\omega_f + \omega_i\right) t
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Dynamics==

===Moment of inertia===
{{main|Moment of inertia}}

The moment of inertia of an object, symbolized by '''I''', is a measure of the object's resistance to changes to its rotation. The moment of inertia is measured in kilogram metre² (kg m²). It depends on the object's mass: increasing the mass of an object increases the moment of inertia. It also depends on the distribution of the mass: distributing the mass further from the center of rotation increases the moment of inertia by a greater degree. For a single particle of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the axis of rotation, the moment of inertia is given by

:&lt;math&gt;I = mr^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Torque===
{{main|Torque}}
Torque &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; is the twisting effect of a force '''F''' applied to a rotating object which is at position '''r''' from its axis of rotation. Mathematically,
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt;
where × denotes the [[cross product]]. A net torque acting upon an object will produce an angular acceleration of the object according to
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;
just as '''F''' = ''m'''''a''' in linear dynamics.

The work done by a torque acting on an object equals the magnitude of the torque times the angle through which the torque is applied:
:&lt;math&gt;W = \tau\theta. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The power of a torque is equal to the work done by the torque per unit time, hence:
:&lt;math&gt;P = \tau\omega. \!&lt;/math&gt;

===Angular momentum===
{{main|Angular momentum}}
The angular  momentum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the difficulty of bringing a rotating object to rest. It is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \sum\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; for all particles in the object.
Angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=I\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
just as '''p''' = ''m'''''v''' in linear dynamics.

The equivalent of linear momentum in rotational motion is angular momentum. The greater the angular momentum of the spinning object such as a top, the greater its tendency to continue to spin.

The Angular Momentum of a rotating body is proportional to its mass and to how rapidly it is turning. In addition, the angular momentum depends on how the mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation: the further away the mass is located from the axis of rotation, the greater the angular momentum. A flat disk such as a record turntable has less angular momentum than a hollow cylinder of the same mass and velocity of rotation.

Like linear momentum, angular momentum is vector quantity, and its conservation implies that the direction of the spin axis tends to remain unchanged. For this reason, the spinning top remains upright whereas a stationary one falls over immediately.

The angular momentum equation can be used to relate the moment of the resultant force on a body about an axis (sometimes called torque), and the rate of rotation about that axis.

Torque and angular momentum are related according to
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;
just as '''F''' = ''d'''''p'''/''dt'' in linear dynamics. In the absence of an external torque, the angular momentum of a body remains constant. The conservation of angular momentum is notably demonstrated in [[figure skating]]: when pulling the arms closer to the body during a spin, the moment of inertia is decreased, and so the angular velocity is increased.

===Kinetic energy===
{{main|Kinetic energy}}The kinetic energy ''K''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; due to the rotation of the body is given by
:&lt;math&gt;K_\text{rot} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2,&lt;/math&gt;
just as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt; = {{frac|1|2}}''mv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in linear dynamics.

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The amount of translational kinetic energy found in two variables: the mass of the object (m) and the speed of the object (v) as shown in the equation above.  Kinetic energy must always be either zero or a positive value. While velocity can have either a positive or negative value, velocity squared will always be positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-kinetic-energy|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vector expression==
{{See also|Vector (geometry)}}
The above development is a special case of general rotational motion.  In the general case, angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and torque are considered to be vectors.

An  angular displacement is considered to be a vector, pointing along the axis, of magnitude equal to that of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;.  A [[right-hand rule]] is used to find which way it points along the axis; if the fingers of the right hand are curled to point in the way that the object has rotated, then the thumb of the right hand points in the direction of the vector.

The [[angular velocity]] vector also points along the [[axis of rotation]] in the same way as the angular displacements it causes.  If a disk spins counterclockwise as seen from above, its angular velocity vector points upwards.  Similarly, the [[angular acceleration]] vector points along the axis of rotation in the same direction that the angular velocity would point if the angular acceleration were maintained for a long time.

The torque vector points along the axis around which the torque tends to cause rotation. To maintain rotation around a fixed axis, the total torque vector has to be along the axis, so that it only changes the magnitude and not the direction of the angular velocity vector. In the case of a hinge, only the component of the torque vector along the axis has an effect on the rotation, other forces and torques are compensated by the structure.

==Examples and applications==

===Constant angular speed===
{{main|Uniform circular motion}}
The simplest case of rotation around a fixed axis is that of constant angular speed. Then the total torque is zero.  For the example of the Earth rotating around its axis, there is very little friction.  For a  [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]], the motor applies a torque to compensate for friction. Similar to the fan, equipment found in the mass production manufacturing industry demonstrate rotation around a fixed axis effectively. For example, a multi-spindle lathe is used to rotate the material on its axis to effectively increase production of cutting, deformation and turning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.davenportmachine.com/multi-spindle-machines/|title=Multi Spindle Machines - An In-Depth Overview|work=Davenport Machine|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angle of rotation is a linear function of time, which modulo 360° is a periodic function.

An example of this is the [[two-body problem]] with [[circular orbit]]s.

===Centripetal force===
{{main|Centripetal force}}
{{See also|Fictitious force}}
Internal [[tensile stress]] provides the [[centripetal force]] that keeps a spinning object together.  A [[rigid body]] model neglects the accompanying [[Strain (materials science)|strain]].  If the body is not rigid this strain will cause it to change shape. This is expressed as the object changing shape due to the "[[centrifugal force]]".

Celestial bodies rotating about each other often have [[elliptic orbit]]s. The special case of [[circular orbit]]s is an example of a rotation around a fixed axis: this axis is the line through the [[center of mass]] perpendicular to the plane of motion. The centripetal force is provided by [[gravity]], see also [[two-body problem]]. This usually also applies for a spinning celestial body, so it need not be solid to keep together unless the angular speed is too high in relation to its density. (It will, however, tend to become [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]].)  For example, a spinning celestial body of water must take at least 3 hours and 18 minutes to rotate, regardless of size, or the water will separate{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. If the density of the fluid is higher the time can be less.

[[File:Sea foam at Ocean Beach in San Francisco -1 on 3-25-11.jpg|thumb|300px| {{center|Sea foam washed up or blown onto a beach}}]]

'''Sea foam''', ocean foam, beach foam, or spume is a type of [[foam]] created by the agitation of [[seawater]], particularly when it contains higher concentrations of [[dissolved organic matter]] (including [[Protein|proteins]], [[Lignin|lignins]], and [[Lipid|lipids]]) derived from sources such as the offshore breakdown of [[Algal bloom|algal blooms]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2011-10-01|title=Foam in the aquatic environment|url=|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=45|issue=15|pages=4355–4366|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2011.06.004|issn=0043-1354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds can act as [[Surfactant|surfactants]] or [[Foaming agent|foaming agents]]. As the seawater is churned by [[Breaking wave|breaking waves]] in the [[surf zone]] adjacent to the shore, the surfactants under these turbulent conditions trap air, forming persistent [[bubble (physics)|bubbles]] that stick to each other through [[surface tension]]. Sea foam is a global phenomenon&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and it varies depending on location and the potential influence of the surrounding marine, freshwater, and/or terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HAROLD|first=E.|last2=SCHLICHTING|first2=JR.|date=1971|title=A Preliminary Study of the Algae and Protozoa in Seafoam|url=|journal=Botanica Marina|volume=14|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1515/botm.1971.14.1.24|issn=0006-8055|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its low density and persistence, foam can be blown by strong on-shore winds from the beach face inland.

== Formation ==
[[File:Sea spray sea foam connection.png|thumb|600px| {{center|Connection between sea foam and [[sea spray]] formation. The dark orange line indicates processes common to the formation of both [[sea spray]] and sea foam.}}]]

Sea foam is formed under conditions that are similar to the formation of [[sea spray]]. One of the main distinctions from sea spray formation is the presence of higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter from [[macrophytes]] and [[phytoplankton]]. The dissolved organic matter in the surface water, which can be derived from the natural environment or human-made sources, provides stability to the resulting sea foam.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Velimirov|first=B.|date=1980|title=Formation and potential trophic significance of marine foam near kelp beds in the benguela upwelling system|url=|journal=Marine Biology|volume=58|issue=4|pages=311–318|doi=10.1007/bf00390779|issn=0025-3162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical processes that contribute to sea foam formation are breaking [[Surface wave|surface waves]], bubble entrainment, and whitecap formation. Breaking of surface waves injects air from the atmosphere into the water column, leading to bubble creation. These bubbles get transported around the top few meters of the surface ocean due to their [[buoyancy]]. The smallest bubbles entrained in the water column dissolve entirely leading to higher ratios of dissolved gases in the surface ocean. The bubbles that do not dissolve eventually make it back to the surface. As they rise, these bubbles accumulate [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] substances. Presence of dissolved organic matter stabilizes the bubbles, aggregating together as sea foam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some studies on sea foam report that breaking of algal cells in times of heavy swells makes sea foam production more likely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Falling rain drops on the sea surface can also contribute to sea foam formation and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veron|first=Fabrice|date=2015-01-03|title=Ocean Spray|url=|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=507–538|doi=10.1146/annurev-fluid-010814-014651|issn=0066-4189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some non-mechanistic studies demonstrating increased sea foam formation due to high rainfall events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Turbulence in the surface mixed layer can affect the concentration of dissolved organic matter and aids in the formation of nutrient-dense foam.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Douglas|last2=Ireland|first2=Robert J.|last3=Bärlocher|first3=Felix|date=1989-09|title=Seasonal variation in the organic composition of seafoam|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|volume=130|issue=1|pages=71–80|doi=10.1016/0022-0981(89)90019-1|issn=0022-0981|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
[[File:Brandung (MW 2015.02.27.).JPG|thumb|Sea foam usually contains a mixture of decomposed organic materials]]

The composition of sea foam is generally a mixture of decomposed organic materials, including [[zooplankton]], [[phytoplankton]], [[algae]] (including [[Diatom|diatoms]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzhkov|first=Nikolai V.|last2=Makarevich|first2=Pavel R.|last3=Bardan|first3=Sergei I.|date=1997-01-12|title=Sea foam as an object of sea-surface film studies|url=|journal=Polar Research|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=117–121|doi=10.3402/polar.v16i2.6630|issn=1751-8369|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[bacteria]], [[Fungus|fungi]], [[Protozoa|protozoans]], and vascular plant [[detritus]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; though each occurrence of sea foam varies in its specific contents. In some areas, sea foam is found to be made up of primarily [[protein]], dominant in both fresh and old foam, as well as [[Lipid|lipids]] and [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]]. The high protein and low carbohydrate concentration suggest that [[Sugar|sugars]] originally present in the surrounding mucilage created by algae or plant matter has been quickly consumed by bacteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additional research has shown that between a small fraction of sea foam measured by dry weight is [[organic carbon]], which contains [[Phenols|phenolics]], sugars, [[Amino sugar|amino sugars]], and [[Amino acid|amino acids]]. In the [[Bay of Fundy]], high mortality rates of an abundant tube-dwelling [[Amphipoda|amphipod]] (''Corophium volutator)'' by natural die-offs as well as predation by migrating seabirds contributed to amino sugars released in the surrounding environment and thus, in sea foam&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The organic matter in sea foam has been found to increase dramatically during [[Algal bloom|phytoplankton blooms]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Dowd|first=Colin|last2=Ceburnis|first2=Darius|last3=Ovadnevaite|first3=Jurgita|last4=Bialek|first4=Jakub|last5=Stengel|first5=Dagmar B.|last6=Zacharias|first6=Merry|last7=Nitschke|first7=Udo|last8=Connan|first8=Solene|last9=Rinaldi|first9=Matteo|date=2015-10-14|title=Connecting marine productivity to sea-spray via nanoscale biological processes: Phytoplankton Dance or Death Disco?|url=|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=5|pages=14883|doi=10.1038/srep14883|issn=2045-2322|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown very high concentrations of [[Plankton|microplankton]] in sea foam, with significantly higher numbers of [[Autotroph|autotrophic]] phytoplankton than [[Heterotroph|heterotrophs]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some foams are particularly rich in their diatom population which can make up the majority of the microalgal [[biomass]] in some cases&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A diversity of bacteria is also present in sea foam; old foam tends to have a higher density of bacteria. One study found that 95% of sea foam bacteria was rod-shaped, while the surrounding surface water contained mostly coccoid-form bacteria and only 5% - 10% rod-shaped bacteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is also seasonal variability of sea foam composition;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in some regions there is a seasonal occurrence of pollen in sea foam which can alter its chemistry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Though foam is not inherently toxic, it may contain high concentrations of contaminants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Foam bubbles can be coated with or contain these materials which can include [[petroleum]] compounds, [[Pesticide|pesticides]], and [[Herbicide|herbicides]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Longevity and stability ==
[[File:Sea Foam off Amphitrite Point near Ucluelet.webm|thumb|Sea foam off [[Vancouver Island]]]]

Structurally, sea foam is [[Thermodynamically stable|thermodynamically]] unstable, though some sea foam can persist in the environment for several days at most. There are two types of sea foam categorized based on their stability: 1) Unstable or transient foams have very short lifetimes of only seconds. The bubbles formed in sea foam may burst releasing aerosols into the air, contributing to [[sea spray]]. 2) Metastable foams can have a lifetime of several hours to several days; their duration is sometimes attributed to small particles of [[Silicate|silica]], [[calcium]], or [[iron]] which contribute to foam stability and longevity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, seawater that contains released dissolved organic material from phytoplankton and macrophytic algae that is then agitated in its environment is most likely to produce stable, longer-lasting foam when compared with seawater lacking one of those components. For example, filtered seawater with added with the fronds of the [[kelp]], ''Ecklonia maxima,'' produced foam but it lacked the stability that unfiltered seawater provided. Additionally, kelp fronds that were maintained in flowing water therefore reducing their [[mucus]] coating, were unable to help foam form.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Different types of salt are also found to have varying effects on bubble proximity within sea foam, therefore contributing to its stability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ecological role ==

=== Food source ===
[[File:Plankton creates sea foam 2.jpg|thumb| Bubbles of plankton-enriched foam left in a [[tide pool]] after [[high tide]]]]

The presence of sea foam in the marine environment plays a number of ecological roles including providing sources of food and creating habitat. As a food source, sea foam with a stable composition is more important ecologically, as it is able to persist longer and can transport nutrients within the marine environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Longer decay times result in a higher chance that energy contained in sea foam will move up the food web into higher [[trophic level]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;In the Bay of Fundy for example, a tube-dwelling [[Amphipoda|amphipod]], ''Corophium volutator,'' can potentially attain 70% of its nutritional requirements from the sugars and amino acids derived from sea foam in its environment. At times however, the sea foam was found to be toxic to this species. It is thought that high concentrations of [[Phenols|phenolics]] and/or the occasional presence of heavy metals or pesticides incorporated into the sea foam from the sea surface contributed to its toxicity&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On the west coast of [[Cape Peninsula]], [[South Africa]], sea foam often occurs in nearshore marine areas with large kelp beds during periods of strong westerly winds. It is thought that the foam generated in these conditions is an important food source for local organisms due to the presence of organic [[detritus]] in the sea foam.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Material transport ===
Sea foam also acts as a mode of transport for both organisms and nutrients within the marine environment and, at times, into the [[Intertidal zone|intertidal]] or terrestrial environments. Wave action can deposit foam into intertidal areas where it can remain when the tide recedes, bringing nutrients to the intertidal zone.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, sea foam can become airborne in windy conditions, transporting materials between marine and terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ability of sea foam to transport materials is also thought to benefit [[Seaweed|macroalgal]] organisms, as macroalgae propagules can be carried to different microenvironments, thus influencing the tidal landscape and contributing to new possible ecological interactions&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meneses|first=Isabel|date=1993-06|title=Foam as a dispersal agent in the rocky intertidal of central Chile|url=|journal=European Journal of Phycology|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=107–110|doi=10.1080/09670269300650171|issn=0967-0262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sea foam is a wet environment, it is conducive habitat to algal spores where [[Propagule|propagules]] can attach to the substrate and avoid risk of [[dissemination]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When sea foam contains fungi, it can also aid in the decomposition of plant and animal remains in coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Habitat ===
Additionally, sea foam is a habitat for a number of marine [[Microorganism|microorganisms]]. Some research has shown the presence of various microphytoplanktonic, nanophytoplanktonic, and diatom groups in seafoam; the phytoplankton groups appeared in significantly higher abundance than in sea surface film and the top [[pelagic zone]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Hazards==

=== Toxicity ===
Naturally occurring sea foam is not inherently [[Toxicity|toxic]]; however, it can be exposed to high concentrations of contaminants in the surface microlayer derived from the breakdown of algal blooms, fossil fuel production and transport, and stormwater runoff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These contaminants contribute to the formation of noxious sea foam through [[adsorption]] onto bubbles. Bubbles may burst and release toxins into the atmosphere in the form of sea spray or [[aerosol]], or they may persist in foams. Toxins released through aerosols and breaking bubbles can be inhaled by humans. The microorganisms that occupy sea foams as habitat have increased susceptibility for contaminant exposure.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Napolitano|first=Guillermo E.|last2=Richmond|first2=Jacqueline E.|date=1995-02|title=Enrichment of biogenic lipids, hydrocarbons and PCBs in stream-surface foams|url=|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=197–201|doi=10.1002/etc.5620140203|issn=0730-7268|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these toxic substances can be integrated into the trophic [[food web]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Harmful algal blooms ===
Foams can form following the degradation of [[Harmful algal bloom|harmful algal blooms]] (HABs). These are primarily composed of algal species, but can also consist of [[Dinoflagellate|dinoflagellates]] and [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blauw|first=A.N.|last2=Los|first2=F.J.|last3=Huisman|first3=J.|last4=Peperzak|first4=L.|date=2010-11|title=Nuisance foam events and Phaeocystis globosa blooms in Dutch coastal waters analyzed with fuzzy logic|url=|journal=Journal of Marine Systems|volume=83|issue=3-4|pages=115–126|doi=10.1016/j.jmarsys.2010.05.003|issn=0924-7963|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass from algae in the bloom is integrated into sea foam in the sea surface microlayer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When the impacted sea foam breaks down, toxins from the algae are released into the air causing respiratory issues and occasionally initiating asthma attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/why_habs.html|title=Why do harmful algal blooms occur?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phaeocystis globosa'' is one algal species that is considered problematic, as observed in a study in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Its high biomass accumulation allows it to create large quantities of toxic foam that often wash onto beaches. ''P. globosa'' blooms are initiated in areas of high nutrient availability, often affiliated with coastal locations with a lot of stormwater runoff and [[eutrophication]]. Studies suggest that the development of foam is directly correlated to blooms caused by ''P. globosa'', despite that foam formation typically occurs approximately two weeks after the appearance of an algal bloom offshore. Organic material from ''P. globosa'' was observed decomposing while suspended at the sea surface, but was not observed lower in the water column. ''P. globosa'' is also considered a nuisance species because its large foam formations impair the public's ability to enjoy the beach.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Human activities ===
While sea foam is a common result of the agitation of seawater mixing with organic material in the surface ocean, human activities can contribute to the production of excess and often toxic foam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to the organic oils, acids, and proteins that amass in the [[sea surface microlayer]], compounds derived from petroleum production and transport, synthetic surfactants, and pesticide use can enter the sea surface and be incorporated into foam. The pollutants present can also affect the persistence of the foam produced. Crude oil discharged from tankers, motor oil, sewage, and detergents from polluted runoff can create longer-lasting foams.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In one study, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), a persistent organic pollutant, were found to amass in sea foams.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Natural gas]] terminals have been cited as contributors to the production of modified foams due to the process of using seawater to convert natural gas to [[Liquefied natural gas|liquified natural gas]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franzo|first=Annalisa|last2=Karuza|first2=Ana|last3=Celussi|first3=Mauro|last4=Fornasaro|first4=Daniela|last5=Beran|first5=Alfred|last6=Di Poi|first6=Elena|last7=Del Negro|first7=Paola|date=2015-04-17|title=Foam production as a side effect of an offshore liquefied natural gas terminal: how do plankton deal with it?|url=|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research|language=en|volume=22|issue=11|pages=8763–8772|doi=10.1007/s11356-015-4499-2|issn=0944-1344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed a much greater abundance of heterotrophic [[Prokaryote|prokaryotes]] (archaea and bacteria) and cyanobacteria in foam that was generated near a liquified natural gas terminal. These prokaryotes were able to recycle chemical materials discharged from the terminal, which enhanced microbial growth. Additionally, higher levels of [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) and plankton biomass were recorded in foam generated in close proximity to the terminal. Organic carbon was transferred readily into the pelagic food web after uptake by prokaryotes and ingestion by grazers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6438">'''Space environment''' is a branch of [[astronautics]], [[aerospace engineering]] and [[space physics]] that seeks to understand and address conditions existing in space that affect the design and operation of spacecraft. A related subject, [[space weather]], deals with dynamic processes in the solar-terrestrial system that can give rise to effects on spacecraft, but that can also affect the atmosphere, [[ionosphere]] and [[geomagnetic field]], giving rise to several other kinds of effects on human technologies.

Effects on spacecraft can arise from [[radiation]], [[space debris]] and [[meteoroid]] impact, upper [[atmospheric drag]] and [[spacecraft charging|spacecraft electrostatic charging]].

Radiation in space usually comes from three main sources: (i) the [[Van Allen radiation belts]]; (ii) [[solar proton event]]s and [[solar energetic particle]]s; and (iii) galactic [[cosmic rays]]. For long duration missions, the high doses of radiation can damage electronic components and solar cells. A major concern is also radiation-induced "single-event effects" such as [[single event upset]]. Manned missions usually avoid the radiation belts and the [[international space station]] is at an altitude well below the most severe regions of the radiation belts. During solar energetic events ([[solar flares]] and [[coronal mass ejections]]) particles can be accelerated to very high energies and can reach the Earth in times as short as 30 minutes (but usually take some hours). These particles are mainly protons and heavier ions that can cause radiation damage, disruption to logic circuits and even hazards to astronauts. Manned missions to return to the Moon or to travel to Mars will have to deal with the major problems presented by solar particle events to radiation safety, in addition to the important contribution to doses from the low-level background [[cosmic rays]]. In near-Earth orbits, the Earth's [[geomagnetic field]] screens spacecraft from a large part of these hazards - a process called [[geomagnetic shielding]].
Space debris and meteoroids can impact spacecraft at high speeds, causing mechanical or electrical damage.  The average speed of space debris is 10&amp;nbsp;km/s &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awhir.com/design/nasa/Meteoroids%2520and%2520Orbital%2520Debris--%2520Effects%2520on%2520Spacecraft%2520rp1408.pdf Meteoroids and Orbital Debris: Effects on Spacecraft (NASA Reference Publication 1408)]&lt;/ref&gt; while the average speed of meteoroids is much greater.  For example, the meteoroids associated with the [[Perseids|Perseid meteor shower]] travel at an average speed of 58&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast09aug99_1/ Here Come the Perseids!]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mechanical damage from debris impacts have been studied through space missions including [[LDEF]], which had over 20,000 documented impacts through its 5.7 year mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/protect/impacts.html Orbital Debris Impacts on Spacecraft]&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrical anomalies associated with impact events include [[ESA]]'s Olympus spacecraft, which lost attitude control during the 1993 Perseid meteor shower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympus.html The sad story of Olympus 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011943/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympus.html |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar event occurred with the [[Landsat 5]] spacecraft&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=2281 Landsat 5 Experiences Malfunction]&lt;/ref&gt; during the 2009 Perseid meteor shower.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/31jul_perseids2009/ The 2009 Perseid Meteor Shower]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacecraft electrostatic charging is caused by the hot [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] environment around the Earth. The plasma encountered in the region of the [[geostationary]] orbit becomes heated during geomagnetic [[substorm]]s caused by disturbances in the solar wind. "Hot" electrons (with energies in the kilo-[[electron volt]] range) collect on surfaces of spacecraft and can establish electrostatic potentials of the order of kilovolts. As a result, discharges can occur and are known to be the source of many spacecraft anomalies.

Solutions devised by scientists and engineers include, but are not limited to, spacecraft shielding, special "hardening" of electronic systems, various collision detection systems. Evaluation of effects during spacecraft design includes application of various models of the environment, including radiation belt models, spacecraft-plasma interaction models and atmospheric models to predict drag effects encountered in lower orbits and during reentery.

The field often overlaps with the disciplines of [[astrophysics]], [[atmospheric science]], [[space physics]], and [[geophysics]], albeit usually with an emphasis on application.

The United States government maintains a [[Space Weather Prediction Center]] at [[Boulder, Colorado]].  The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) is part of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] ([[NOAA]]).  SWPC is one of the [[National Weather Service]]'s (NWS) [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]] (NCEP).

[[Space weather]] effects on Earth can include [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] storms, temporary decreases in [[ozone]] densities, disruption to radio communication, to [[GPS]] signals and submarine positioning. Some scientists also theorize links between [[sunspot]] activity and [[ice age]]s.

'''SuperCam''' is a suite of remote-sensing instruments for the [[Mars 2020]] rover mission that performs remote analyses of rocks and soils with a camera, two [[laser]]s and four [[spectrometer]]s to seek [[organic compound]]s that could hold [[biosignature]]s of past microbial [[life on Mars]], if it ever existed there.

==Development==
SuperCam is being developed in collaboration between [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology ([[Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology|IRAP]]) in France, the French Space Agency ([[CNES]]), the [[University of Hawaii]] and the [[University of Valladolid]] in Spain. The Principal Investigator is Roger Williams from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].
SuperCam is an improved version of the successful [[Chemistry and Camera complex|ChemCam]] instruments of the ''Curiosity'' rover that have been upgraded with two different lasers and detectors.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goenka 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Scientists"/&gt;

In April 2018, SuperCam entered the final stages of assembly and testing. The flight model is scheduled to be integrated in 2018 and installed to the rover later the same year. The rover mission is planned to launch in July 2020.

===LIBS===

Its remote [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] (LIBS) emits a 1064-nm red laser beam to investigate targets as small as a grain of rice from a distance of more than 7 meters, allowing the rover to study targets beyond the reach of its arm.&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Public"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysOrg2018"/&gt; The beam vaporizes a tiny amount of rock, creating a hot [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].

===Raman spectroscopy===

SuperCam's [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectrometer]] (at 532 nm) investigate targets up to 12 m from the rover. In the Raman spectroscopy technique, most of the green laser light reflects back at the same wavelength that was sent, but a small fraction of the light interacts with the target molecules, changing the wavelength in proportion to the vibrational energy of the molecular bonds. By spectrally observing the returned Raman light, the identity of the minerals can be determined.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{cite book| last = Gardiner| first = D.J. | title = Practical Raman spectroscopy| publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| series = | date = 1989| doi = | isbn = 978-0-387-50254-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.036.epdf|doi=10.1038/nprot.2016.036|pmid=26963630|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22|title=Using Raman spectroscopy to characterize biological materials|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=11|issue=4|pages=664–87|date=April 2016|last1=Martin|first1=Francis L.|last2=Stone|first2=Nicholas|last3=McAinsh|first3=Martin R.|last4=Walsh|first4=Michael J.|last5=Martin-Hirsch|first5=Pierre L.|last6=Gardner|first6=Benjamin|last7=Fullwood|first7=Nigel J.|last8=Esmonde-White|first8=Karen|last9=Dorney|first9=Jennifer|last10=Curtis|first10=Kelly|last11=Cinque|first11=Gianfelice|last12=Bird|first12=Benjamin|last13=Ashton|first13=Lorna|last14=Butler|first14=Holly J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IR spectrometer===

The [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrometer]], provided by France, operates in the [[near-infrared]] (1.3 to 2.6 micrometers) wavelengths and its [[photodiodes]], or detectors, are cooled by small thermoelectric coolers to ensure that they operate between -100°C and -50°C at all times.&lt;ref name="Page54"/&gt; This instrument will analyze many of the [[clay minerals]] and help unravel the history of liquid [[water on Mars]].&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt; The types of clay minerals and their abundances give clues about the nature of the water that was present, whether fresh or salty, acidic or neutral [[pH]], whether it might have been icy or warm, and whether the water was present for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt; These are key questions to understand  [[Planetary habitability|how habitable]] the surface environment was in the distant past.

===Camera/telescope===

SuperCam's optical camera acquires high-resolution color images of samples under study, which also help determine the surface geology. This camera can also study how [[Water on Mars|atmospheric water]] and dust absorb or reflect solar radiation, which may help to develop [[Climate of Mars|weather forecasts]].&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Public"/&gt; SuperCam is also equipped with a microphone to capture the first audio recordings from the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt; The microphone is the same model (Knowles Electret) as the ones that flew to Mars on the 1998 [[Mars Polar Lander]] and the 2007 [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]].&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt; However, neither mission was able to record sounds.&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt;

===Spectrometers - Table ===

The detectors of all four spectrometers are cooled to just below 0°C by thermoelectric coolers. The  [[photodiodes]] for the infrared (IR) spectrometer are further cooled to between -100°C and -50°C at all times.&lt;ref name="Page54"/&gt;

'''Telexistence'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Susumu Tachi]], Telexistence, World Scientific Publishing Company, {{ISBN|978-981-283-633-5}}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is fundamentally a concept named for the general [[technology]] that enables a [[human]] being to have a real-time sensation of being at a place other than where he or she actually exists, and being able to interact with the remote environment, which may be real, virtual, or a combination of both. It also refers to an advanced type of teleoperation system that enables an operator at the control to perform remote tasks dexterously with the feeling of existing in a surrogate [[robot]] working in a remote environment. Telexistence in the real environment through a virtual environment is also possible. This concept was first proposed by [[Susumu Tachi]] in Japan in 1980 &lt;ref&gt;S.Tachi, K.Tanie and K.Komoriya: Evaluation device of mobility aids for the blind,

{{Educational assignment}}
The '''Triangular fibrocartilage''' complex (TFCC) is formed by the triangular fibrocartilage discus (TFC), the radioulnar ligaments (RULs) and the ulnocarpal ligaments (UCLs).

==Structure==
[[File:Gray336.png|thumb|Vertical section through the articulations at the [[wrist]], showing the synovial cavities. (Articular disc labeled at center right.)]]
[[File:Anatomy TFCC 2.jpg|thumb|Anatomy of TFCC]]

===Triangular fibrocartilage disc===
The TFC is an articular discus that lies on the pole of the distal [[ulna]].  It has a triangular shape and a biconcave body; the periphery is thicker than its center.  The central portion of the TFC is thin and consists of chondroid fibrocartilage; this type of tissue is often seen in structures that can bear compressive loads. This central area is often so thin that it is translucent and in some cases it is even absent.&lt;ref name="Green's Operative Hand Surgery: Distal Radioulnar Joint"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Brian D. |last1=Adams |first2=Fraser J. |last2=Leversedge |chapter=Distal Radioulnar Joint |pages=479–515 |chapterurl={{Google books|cry-CwAAQBAJ|page=479|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Scott W. |editor1-last=Wolfe |editor2-first=William C. |editor2-last=Pederson |editor3-first=Robert N. |editor3-last=Hotchkiss |editor4-first=Scott H. |editor4-last=Kozin |editor5-first=Mark S |editor5-last=Cohen |year=2016 |title=Green's Operative Hand Surgery |edition=7th |isbn=978-0-323-29534-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral portion of the TFC is well vascularised, while the central portion has no blood supply.

This discus is attached by thick tissue to the base of the ulnar styloid and by thinner tissue to the edge of the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] just proximal to the radiocarpal articular surface.&lt;ref name="Green's Operative Hand Surgery: Distal Radioulnar Joint"/&gt;

===Radioulnar ligaments===
The RUL’s are the principal stabilizers of the [[Distal radioulnar articulation|distal radioulnar joint]] (DRUJ). There are two RUL's, the palmar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

These ligaments arise from the distal radius medial border and insert on the ulna at two separate and distinct sites: the ulna styloid and the fovea (a groove that separates the ulnar styloid from the ulnar head). Each ligament consists of a superficial component and a deep component. The superficial components insert directly onto the ulna styloid. The deep components insert more lateral, into the fovea adjacent to the articular surface of the pole of the distal ulna.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The ligaments are composed of longitudinally oriented lamellar collagen to resist tensile loads and have a rich vascular supply to allow healing.&lt;ref name=pmid17826566/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18780072&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11552-007-9034-6 |pmid=18780072 |pmc=2527144 |title=Reconstruction for DRUJ Instability |journal=HAND |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=123–6 |year=2007 |last1=Lawler |first1=Ericka |last2=Adams |first2=Brian D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18159918&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18159918 |url=http://new.medigraphic.com/cgi-bin/resumenMainIOrto.cgi?IDARTICULO=13526 |year=2007 |author1=Gutiérrez |first1=Alejandro Espinosa |title=Inestabilidad radiocubital distal: Reconstrucción del ligamento: dorsal del fibrocartílago triangular y su evolución |trans-title=Instability from the distal radioulnar joint: Reconstruction and evolution of dorsal triangular fibrocartilage complex ligament |language=es |journal=Acta Ortopedica Mexicana |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=282–8 |last2=Montero |first2=José A. Rivas |last3=Gutiérrez |first3=Luis Enrique Sánchez }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ulnocarpal ligaments===
The UCL’s consist of the ulnolunate and the ulnotriquetral ligaments. They originate from the ulnar styloid and insert into the carpal bones of the wrist: the ulnolunate ligament inserts into the [[lunate]] bone and the ulnotriquetral ligament into the [[triquetral bone|triquetrum]] bone. These ligaments prevent dorsal migration of the distal ulna. They are more taut during [[Anatomical terms of motion#Pronation and supination|supination]], because in supination ulnar styloid moves away from the carpal bones volar side.&lt;ref name="Green's Operative Hand Surgery: Distal Radioulnar Joint"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid9848546&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0363-5023(98)80003-8 |pmid=9848546 |title=An anatomic study of the ligamentous structure of the triangular fibrocartilage complex |journal=The Journal of Hand Surgery |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=977–85 |year=1998 |last1=Ishii |first1=Shoji |last2=Palmer |first2=Andrew K |last3=Werner |first3=Frederick W |last4=Short |first4=Walter H |last5=Fortino |first5=Maria D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The primary functions of the TFCC:
* To cover the ulna head by extending the articular surface of the distal radius
* Load transmission across the ulnocarpal joint and partially load absorbing
* Allows forearm rotation by giving a strong but flexible connection between the distal radius and ulna. It also supports the ulnar portion of the carpus

===Load transmission===
The TFCC is important in load transmission across the ulnar aspect of the wrist. The TFC transmits and absorbs compressive forces.

The ulnar variance influences the amount of load that is transmitted through the distal ulna. The load transmission is directly proportional to this ulnar variance. In neutral ulnar variance, approximately 20 percent of the load is transmitted. With negative ulnar variance, the load across the TFC is decreased. This occurs during supination, because the radius moves distally on the ulna and creates a negative ulnar variance. With positive ulnar variance it is reversed.  The load that is transmitted across the TFC is then increased. This positive ulnar variance occurs during pronation.&lt;ref name="Green's Operative Hand Surgery: Wrist Arthroscopy"&gt;{{cite book |first1=William B. |last1=Geissler |chapter=Wrist Arthroscopy |pages=653–96 |chapterurl={{Google books|cry-CwAAQBAJ|page=653|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Scott W. |editor1-last=Wolfe |editor2-first=William C. |editor2-last=Pederson |editor3-first=Robert N. |editor3-last=Hotchkiss |editor4-first=Scott H. |editor4-last=Kozin |editor5-first=Mark S |editor5-last=Cohen |year=2016 |title=Green's Operative Hand Surgery |edition=7th |isbn=978-0-323-29534-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotation===
[[File:Rul's by pro- and supination.jpg|thumb|Rul’s prosupination]]
The TFCC is a major stabilizer of the DRUJ. To control the forearm rotation the DRUJ acts in concert with the proximal radioulnar joint. The connection between the distal radius and the distal ulna, maintain the congruency of the DRUJ.  This attachment is mainly created by the RUL’s of the TFCC. These ligaments support the joint through its arc of rotation.&lt;ref name="Green's Operative Hand Surgery: Wrist Arthroscopy"/&gt;

The role of the TFCC in supination and in [[Anatomical terms of motion#Pronation and supination|pronation]] is a matter of dispute. Some authors (Schuind ''et al.'') concluded that the dorsal fibers of the TFCC tighten in pronation, and the palmar fibers in supination. These conclusions are opposite of those published by Af Ekenstam and Hagert.&lt;ref name=pmid17826566/&gt;

Both parties are in fact right, as the RUL's consists of two ligaments each made of another two components: the superficial and the deep ligaments. During supination, the superficial palmar and the deep dorsal ligaments are tightened{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}, preventing palmar translation of the ulna. In pronation this is reversed: the superficial dorsal and the deep palmar ligaments are tightened and prevent dorsal translation of the ulna{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

==Clinical significance==
The TFCC has a substantial risk for injury and degeneration because of its anatomic complexity and multiple functions.

Application of an extension-pronation force to an axial-load wrist, such as in a fall on an outstretched hand, causes most of the traumatic injuries of the TFCC.

Dorsal rotation injury, such as when a drill binds and rotates the wrist instead of the bit, can also cause traumatic injuries.

Injury may also occur from a distraction force applied to the volar forearm or wrist. Finally tears of the TFCC are frequently found by patients with distal radius fractures.&lt;ref name="Green's Operative Hand Surgery: Wrist Arthroscopy"/&gt;

Perforations and defects in the TFCC are not all traumatic. There is an age related correlation with lesions in the TFCC, but many of these defects are asymptomatic. These lesions common occur by patients with positive ulnar variance.&lt;ref name="Green's Operative Hand Surgery: Wrist Arthroscopy"/&gt;

Chronic and excessive loading through the ulnocarpal joint, causes degenerative TFCC tears. These tears are a component of ulnar impaction syndrome.

Even though natural degeneration of the ulnocarpal joint is very common, it is important to recognize.
In cadavaric examinations, 30% to 70% of the cases had TFCC perforations and chondromalacia of the ulnar head, lunate and triquetrum. Cases with ulnar-negative variance had fewer degenerative changes.&lt;ref name="Green's Operative Hand Surgery: Distal Radioulnar Joint"/&gt;

=== Palmer’s classifications of TFCC Lesions===
The Palmer classification is the most recognized scheme; it divides TFCC lesions into these two categories. This classification provides an accurate anatomic description of tears, it does not guide treatment or indicate prognosis.&lt;ref name="Green's Operative Hand Surgery: Distal Radioulnar Joint"/&gt;

;Class 1: Traumatic
:A. Central perforation
:B. Ulnar avulsion
:::- With styloid fracture
:::- Without styloid fracture
:C. Distal Avulsion (from carpus)
:D. Radial avulsion
::With sigmoid notch fracture
::Without sigmoid notch fracture

;Class 2: Degenerative (Ulnar Impaction Syndrome)
:A. TFCC wear
:B. TFCC wear
:::+ lunate and/or ulnar head chondromalacia
:C. TFCC perforation
:::+ lunate and/or ulnar head chondromalacia
:D. TFCC perforation
:::+ lunate and/or ulnar head chondromalacia
:::+ lunotriquetral ligament perforation
:E. TFCC perforation
:::+ lunate and/or ulnar head chondromalacia
:::+ lunotriquetral ligament perforation
:::+ Ulnocarpal arthritis

=== Symptoms ===
Patients with a TFCC injury usually experience pain or discomfort located at the ulnar side of the wrist, often just above the ulnar styloid. However, there are also some patients who report diffuse pain throughout the entire wrist.

Rest can reduce pain and activity can make it worse, especially with rotating movements (supination and pronation) of the wrist or movements of the hand sideways in ulnar direction.

Other symptoms patients with a TFCC injury frequently mention are: swelling, loss of grip strength, instability and grinding or clicking sounds ([[crepitus]]) that can occur during activity of the wrist.&lt;ref name=pmid17155920&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17155920 |url=http://hjdbulletin.org/files/archive/pdfs/584.pdf |year=2006 |author1=Ahn |first1=A.

M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diagnosis ===
;Anamnesis
Injuries to the TFCC may be preceded by a fall on a pronated outstretched arm; a rotational injury to the forearm; an axial load trauma to the wrist; or a distraction injury of the wrist in ulnar direction.&lt;ref name=pmid17155920/&gt; However, not all patients can recall a preceding trauma occurred.

;Physical examination
* Palpation: the best place to palpate the TFCC is between the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) and the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), distal to the ulnar styloid and proximal to the pisiform bone.&lt;ref name=pmid17155920/&gt; Tenderness in this area may be consistent with a TFCC lesion.
* Piano key sign: dorsal DRUJ instability can cause a protruding ulna head, which can be pressed down. When you release the pressure, it will spring back in position again, just like a piano key.
* DRUJ stress test: with this provocation manoeuver the wrist is held in pronated or supinated position, while the physician attempts to manipulate the distal ulna in dorsal and volar direction. Painful laxity indicates DRUJ instability and suggests RUL pathology.&lt;ref name=pmid17826566&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2007.06.014 |pmid=17826566 |title=Stability of the Distal Radioulna Joint: Biomechanics, Pathophysiology, Physical Diagnosis, and Restoration of Function What We Have Learned in 25 Years |journal=The Journal of Hand Surgery |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=1086–106 |year=2007 |last1=Kleinman |first1=William B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ulnar grind test: the forearm is fixated and the wrist is held in dorsiflexion. The physician then applies axial load, while he rotates and deviates the wrist in ulnar direction. Pain and crepitations during this provocation manoeuvre suggest DRUJ instability or arthritis.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
Wendy Medeiros, OTR, CHT(ret) has designed a weight-bearing test to objectively analyze the stability of the wrist.  This test has defined stability based on age, height and bone density.  She has also developed a conservative management protocol for the treatment of TFCC tears after 12 years of research around the globe.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

* X-ray:  X-rays of the wrist are made in two directions: posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral. Radiographs are useful to diagnose or rule out possible bone fractures, a positive ulnar variance or osteoarthritis. The TFCC is not visible on an X-ray, regardless of its condition.
* MRI: is, together with the findings of a careful physical examination, a helpful diagnostic tool to assess the condition of the TFCC. Nevertheless, the incidence of false-positive and false-negative MRI results is high.&lt;ref name=pmid17826566/&gt;
* Arthrography: a dye is injected into the wrist joint. If there is a TFCC lesion the dye will leak from one joint compartment to another.
* [[Wrist arthroscopy]]: is an invasive diagnostic tool, but it remains to this day the most accurate way to identify TFCC lesions.&lt;ref name=pmid17155924&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17155924 |url=http://hjdbulletin.org/files/archive/pdfs/588.pdf |year=2006 |author1=Elkowitz |first1=S. J |title=Wrist arthroscopy |journal=Bulletin of the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases |volume=64 |issue=3–4 |pages=156–65 |last2=Posner |first2=M. A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: Imaging techniques can only be relevant together with the clinical findings of a carefully performed physical examination.

Other than a TFCC injury, there are many possible causes for ulnar-sided wrist pain.

===Differentiate diagnosis of TFCC injuries===
:* Tendinopathy of the ECU
:* Ulnar styloid fracture
:* Distal radius fracture
:* DRUJ Arthritis
:* Pisiform bone fractures
:* Hamate bone fractures
:* Carpal instability
:* Midcarpal instability
:* [[Hypothenar hammer syndrome]] (ulnar artery thrombosis)

=== Treatment ===
The initial treatment for both traumatic and degenerative TFCC lesions, with a stable DRUJ, is conservative (nonsurgical) therapy. Patients may be advised to wear a temporary splint or cast to immobilize the wrist and forearm for four to six weeks.&lt;ref name=pmid18524983&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18524983 |year=2008 |author1=Henry |first1=M. H |title=Management of acute triangular fibrocartilage complex injury of the wrist |journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=320–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The immobilization allows scar tissue to develop which can help heal the TFCC.  In addition oral NSAID’s and corticosteroid joint injections can be prescribed for pain relief.  Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy can help patients recover after immobilization or surgery. Wrist support straps used in sports can also be used in mild cases to compress and minimize movement of the area.&lt;ref name=pmid27196674&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pri.1672 |pmid=27196674 |title=A Non-surgical Intervention for Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tears |journal=Physiotherapy Research International |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=271–276 |year=2016 |last1=Barlow |first1=Susan J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indications for acute TFCC surgery are: a clearly unstable DRUJ, or the existence of additional unstable or displaced fractures. TFCC surgery is also indicated when conservative treatment proves insufficient in about 8–12 weeks.

Fractures of the radius bone are often associated by TFCC damage.  If the fracture is treated surgically it is recommended to evaluate and if necessary repair the TFCC as well.&lt;ref name=pmid21107219&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/BTH.0b013e3181e34fee |pmid=21107219 |title=TFCC Reattachment After Traumatic DRUJ Instability |journal=Techniques in Hand &amp; Upper Extremity Surgery |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=226–9 |year=2010 |last1=Argintar |first1=Evan |last2=Mantovani |first2=Gustavo |last3=Pavan |first3=Alexandre }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Closed fractures (where the skin is still intact) of the radius bone are treated non-surgically with cast; the immobilization can also help heal the TFCC.

====Surgical====
;Arthroscopic debridement of TFC discus tissue
The central part of the TFC has no blood supply and therefore has no healing capacity. When a tear occurs in this area of the TFC, it typically creates an unstable flap of tissue that is likely to catch on other joint surfaces. Removing the damaged tissue (debridement) is then indicated.
Arthroscopic debridement as a treatment for degenerative TFC tears associated with positive ulnar variance, unfortunately, show poor results.&lt;ref name=pmid18524983/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17155924/&gt;

;Arthroscopic repair of TFCC ligaments
Suturing TFCC ligaments can sometimes be performed arthroscopically. But only if there is no serious damage to the ligaments or other surrounding structures. Even after a short period of time torn ligaments tend to retract and therefore lose length. Retracted ligament ends are impossible to suture together again and a reconstruction may be necessary.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

;Open surgical repair of the TFCC
Open surgery is usually required for degenerative or more complex TFCC injuries, or if additional damage to the wrist or forearm caused instability or displacement. It is a more invasive surgical technique compared to arthroscopic treatment, but the surgeon has better visibility and access to the TFCC.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

;Options for open surgery:
:* Suturing of the RUL’s this is, just like arthroscopic suturing of these ligaments, only possible when the damage is not too serious and if both ends of the ruptured ligament are not yet retracted.
:* Anatomic reconstruction of the RUL’s using a tendon graft (e.g., the palmaris longus). The tendon graft is tunnelled through drilled holes in the ulnar and radius bones. This procedure is indicated for DRUJ instability caused by an irreparable TFCC.&lt;ref name=pmid11901383&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1053/jhsu.2002.31731 |pmid=11901383 |title=An anatomic reconstruction of the distal radioulnar ligaments for posttraumatic distal radioulnar joint instability |journal=The Journal of Hand Surgery |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=243–51 |year=2002 |last1=Adams |first1=Brian D |last2=Berger |first2=Richard A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18780072/&gt;
:* Capsular or extensor retinaculum plication. This surgical technique aims to improve DRUJ stability by shortening the joint capsule or the extensor retinaculum. It is mostly used for minor DRUJ instability and is less invasive compared to a complete RUL reconstruction.&lt;ref name=pmid19399205&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19399205 |pmc=2663503 |year=2009 |author1=Johnston |first1=K |title=Chronic volar distal radioulnar joint instability: Joint capsular plication to restore function |journal=Canadian Journal of Surgery |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=112–8 |last2=Durand |first2=D |last3=Hildebrand |first3=K.

:* Shortening of the ulnar bone. Patients with a positive ulnar variance are more susceptible to TFCC damage. Shortening the ulnar bone may help relieve the excess pressure to the TFCC and prevent further degeneration.&lt;ref name=pmid12468868&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/230949900000800102 |pmid=12468868 |title=Chronic Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Tears with Distal Radioulna Joint Instability: A New Method of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Reconstruction |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2016 |last1=Jui-Tien |first1=Shih |last2=Yao-Tung |first2=Hou |last3=Hung-Maan |first3=Lee |last4=Chuan-Ming |first4=Tan |last5=Ming-Chun |first5=Chang }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wildlife crossings''' are structures that allow [[animal]]s to cross [[human]]-made barriers safely. Wildlife crossings may include: [[Tunnel|underpass tunnels]], [[viaduct]]s, and [[overpass]]es (mainly for large or herd-type animals); [[amphibia]]n tunnels; [[fish ladder]]s; [[Canopy bridge]] (especially for monkeys and squirrels), [[tunnel]]s and [[culvert]]s (for small mammals such as [[otter]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, and [[badger]]s); [[green roofs]] (for butterflies and birds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenroof.se/?pid=28&amp;sub=19 |title=About Green Roofs: Advantages |publisher=Scandinavian Green Roof Association |accessdate=20 July 2012 |quote=In the places where there isn’t enough ground space for green space, the green corridors, and the habitats for animals don’t have to be discontinued, if the flat roofs are used.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildlife crossings are a practice in [[habitat conservation]], allowing connections or reconnections between [[habitat]]s, combating [[habitat fragmentation]]. They also assist in avoiding [[Roadkill|collisions between vehicles and animals]], which in addition to killing or injuring wildlife may cause injury to humans and [[property damage]].

Similar structures can be used for domesticated animals, such as [[cattle creep]]s.

== Roads and habitat fragmentation==
[[File:Camels crossing.JPG|thumb|Camel Crossing in [[Kuwait]]]]
[[Habitat fragmentation]] occurs when human-made barriers such as [[road ecology|road]]s, [[railroad ecology|railroad]]s, [[canal]]s, [[Electric power transmission|electric power lines]], and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] penetrate and divide wildlife habitat {{harv|Primack|2006}}. Of these, roads have the most widespread and detrimental impacts {{harv|Spellerberg|1998}}. Scientists estimate that the system of roads in the [[United States]] impacts the ecology of at least one-fifth of the land area of the country {{harv|Forman|2000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forman|first=Richard T. T.|date=2000-02-01|title=Estimate of the Area Affected Ecologically by the Road System in the United States|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99299.x/abstract|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=31–35|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99299.x|issn=1523-1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years ecologists and conservationists have documented the adverse relationship between roads and wildlife. {{harvtxt|Jaeger et al.|2005}} identify four ways that roads and traffic detrimentally impact wildlife populations: (1) they decrease habitat amount and quality, (2) they increase mortality due to [[wildlife-vehicle collisions]] (road kill), (3) they prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and (4) they subdivide wildlife populations into smaller and more vulnerable sub-populations (fragmentation). Habitat fragmentation can lead to extinction or extirpation if a population's gene pool is restricted enough.

The first three impacts (loss of habitat, road kill, and isolation from resources) exert pressure on various animal populations by reducing available resources and directly killing individuals in a population. For instance, {{harvtxt|Bennett|1991}} found that road kills do not pose a significant threat to healthy populations but can be devastating to small, shrinking, or threatened populations.  Road mortality has significantly impacted a number of prominent species in the United States, including [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), [[Florida panther]]s (''Puma concolor coryi''), and [[American black bear|black bears]] (''Ursus americanus'') {{harv|Clevenger et al.|2001}}.  In addition, habitat loss can be direct, if habitat is destroyed to make room for a road, or indirect, if habitat quality close to roads is compromised due to emissions from the roads (e.g. noise, light, runoff, pollution, etc.) {{harv|Jaeger et al.|2005}}.  Finally, species that are unable to migrate across roads to reach resources such as food, shelter and mates will experience reduced reproductive and survival rates, which can compromise population viability (Noss et al., 1996).

In addition to the first three factors, numerous studies have shown that the construction and use of roads is a direct source of habitat fragmentation {{harv|Spellerberg|1998}}.  As mentioned above, populations surrounded by roads are less likely to receive immigrants from other habitats and as a result, they suffer from a lack of [[genetic diversity]].  These small populations are particularly vulnerable to [[extinction]] due to demographic, genetic, and environmental [[stochasticity]] because they do not contain enough [[alleles]] to adapt to new selective pressures such as changes in temperature, habitat, and food availability {{harv|Primack|2006}}.

The relationship between roads and habitat fragmentation is well documented.  One study found that roads contribute more to fragmentation in forest habitats than clear cuts {{harv|Reed et al.|1996}}.  Another study concluded that road fragmentation of formerly contiguous forest in eastern North America is the primary cause for the decline of forest bird species and has also significantly harmed small mammals, insects, and reptiles in the United States {{harv|Spellerberg|1998}}.  After years of research, biologists agree that roads and traffic lead to habitat fragmentation, isolation and road kill, all of which combine to significantly compromise the viability of wildlife populations throughout the world.

== Wildlife-vehicle collisions ==

In addition to conservation concerns, wildlife-vehicle collisions have a significant cost for human populations because collisions damage property and injure and kill passengers and drivers.  {{harvtxt|Bruinderink|Hazebroek|1996}} estimated the number of collisions with [[ungulate]]s in traffic in Europe at 507,000 per year, resulting in 300 people killed, 30,000 injured,&lt;ref name="conover"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Conover |first1=M. R. |author2=W. C. Pitt |author3=K. K. Kessler |author4=T. J. DuBow |author5=W. A. Sanborn  |year=1995 |title=Review of Human Injuries, Illnesses, and Economic Losses Caused by Wildlife in the United States |journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin |volume=23 |pages=407–414 |jstor=3782947}}&lt;/ref&gt; and property damage exceeding $1 billion. In parallel, 1.5 million traffic accidents involving deer in the United States cause an estimated $1.1 billion in vehicle damage each year {{harv|Donaldson|2005}}.&lt;ref name="conover" /&gt; On a larger scale, research indicates that wildlife-vehicle collisions in the United States result in 29,000 injuries and more than 200 fatalities per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-04-01|editor-last=van der Ree|editor-first=Rodney|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=Daniel J.|editor3-last=Grilo|editor3-first=Clara|title=Handbook of Road Ecology|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118568170|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118568170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation issues associated with roads (wildlife mortality and habitat fragmentation) coupled with the substantial human and economic costs resulting from wildlife-vehicle collisions have caused scientists, engineers, and transportation authorities to consider a number of mitigation tools for reducing the conflict between roads and wildlife.  Of the currently available options, structures known as wildlife crossings have been the most successful at reducing both habitat fragmentation and wildlife-vehicle collisions caused by roads ({{harvnb|Knapp|Yi|Oakasa|Thimm|2004}}, Clevenger, 2006).

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Wildlife crossings are structural passages beneath or above roadways that are designed to facilitate safe wildlife movement across roadways {{harv|Donaldson|2005}}.  In recent years, conservation biologists and wildlife managers have advocated wildlife crossings coupled with roadside fencing as a way to increase road permeability and habitat connectivity while decreasing wildlife-vehicle collisions.  Wildlife crossing is the umbrella term encompassing underpasses, overpasses, ecoducts, green bridges, amphibian/small mammal tunnels, and wildlife viaducts {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.  All of these structures are designed to provide semi-natural corridors above and below roads so that animals can safely cross without endangering themselves and motorists.

==History and location==
Written reports of rough fish ladders date to 17th-century France, where bundles of branches were used to create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions. A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], Canada, who designed a fishway to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions 1833–1950'', Goose Lane, 2001, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in [[Rhode Island]], United States, on the [[Pawtuxet Village|Pawtuxet Falls]] Dam. As the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]] advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading to the need for effective fish by-passes.&lt;ref&gt;Office Of Technology Assessment Washington DC (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ctBsJJ0oKHEC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Fish+passage+technologies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WPVWTaHnGtOdcZb1oe8M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Fish passage technologies : protection at hydropower facilities''] Diana Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4289-2016-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first overland wildlife crossings were constructed in France during the 1950s {{harv|Chilson|2003}}. European countries including the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, and France have been using various crossing structures to reduce the conflict between wildlife and roads for several decades and use a variety of overpasses and underpasses to protect  and re-establish [[wildlife]] such as: amphibians, badgers, ungulates, invertebrates, and other small mammals {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.&lt;ref name="HS"/&gt;

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] reports that the more than 600 tunnels installed under major and minor roads in the [[Netherlands]] have helped to substantially increase population levels of the endangered [[European badger]].&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220358/http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/issues_facing_wildlife/wildlife_crossings_wild_animals_and_roads/index.html Wildlife crossings - Wild animals and roads], [[The Humane Society of the United States]]. Archived from [http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/issues_facing_wildlife/wildlife_crossings_wild_animals_and_roads/index.html the original] on 27 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The longest "ecoduct" viaduct, near [[Crailo (Huizen)|Crailo]] in the Netherlands, runs 800 m and spans a highway, railway and [[golf course]].

Wildlife crossings are becoming increasingly common in [[Canada]] and the United States. Recognizable wildlife crossings are found in [[Banff National Park]] in [[Alberta]], where vegetated overpasses provide safe passage over the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] for bears, moose, deer, wolves, elk, and many other species {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}.  The 24 wildlife crossings in Banff were constructed as part of a road improvement project in 1978 {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}. In the United States, thousands of wildlife crossings have been built in the past 30 years, including culverts, bridges, and overpasses.  These have been used to protect [[mountain goat]]s in Montana, [[spotted salamander]]s in Massachusetts, [[bighorn sheep]] in Colorado, [[desert tortoise]]s in [[California]], and endangered [[Florida panther]]s in [[Florida]] {{harv|Chilson|2003}}.

The first wildlife crossing in the Canadian province of [[Ontario]] was built in 2010, along [[Ontario Highway 69]] between [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Killarney, Ontario|Killarney]], as part of the route's ongoing freeway conversion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/story/2012/03/20/sby-wildlife-overpass.html "Ontario builds first bridge for animals near Sudbury"]. [[CBC News]], March 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs and benefits ==
The benefits derived from constructing wildlife crossings to extend wildlife migration corridors over and under major roads appear to outweigh the costs of construction and maintenance.  One study estimates that adding wildlife crossings to a road project is a 7-8% increase in the total cost of the project {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.  Theoretically, the monetary costs associated with constructing and maintaining wildlife crossings in ecologically important areas are trumped by the benefits associated with protecting wildlife populations, reducing property damage to vehicles, and saving the lives of drivers and passengers by reducing the number of collisions caused by wildlife.

A study completed for the Virginia Department of Transportation estimated that underpasses for wildlife become cost effective, in terms of property damage, when they prevent between 2.6 and 9.2 deer-vehicle collisions per year, depending on the cost of the underpass.  Approximately 300 deer crossed through the underpasses in the year the study took place {{harv|Donaldson|2005}}.

== Effectiveness ==

A number of studies have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of [[wildlife corridor]]s at providing habitat connectivity (by providing viable migration corridors) and reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions.  The effectiveness of these structures appears to be highly site-specific (due to differences in location, structure, species, habitat, etc.) but crossings have been beneficial to a number of species in a variety of locations.  Some of the wildlife crossing success stories are detailed below.

=== Banff National Park ===

Banff National Park offers one of the best opportunities to study the effectiveness of wildlife crossings because the park contains a wide variety of species and is bisected by a large commercial road called the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH).  To reduce the effects of the four-lane TCH, 24 wildlife crossings (22 underpasses and two overpasses) were built to ensure habitat connectivity and protect motorists {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}.  In 1996, [[Parks Canada]] developed a contract with university researchers to assess the effectiveness of the crossings.  The past decade has produced a number of publications that analyze the crossings' impact on various species and overall wildlife mortality (see {{harvnb|Clevenger|Waltho|2000}}, {{harvnb|Clevenger et al.|2001}}, and {{harvnb|Clevenger|2007}}).

[[File:Wildlife overpass Trans-Canada Hwy between Banff and LakeLouise Alberta.jpg|thumb|Wildlife overpass in [[Banff National Park]], Canada]]
Using a variety of techniques to monitor the crossings over the last 25 years, scientists report that 10 species of large mammals (including deer, elk, black bear, [[grizzly bear]], mountain lion, wolf, moose, and [[coyote]]) have used the 24 crossings in Banff a total of 84,000 times as of January 2007 {{harv|Clevenger|2007}}. The research also identified a "[[learning curve]]" such that animals need time to acclimate to the structures before they feel comfortable using them. For example, grizzly bear crossings increased from seven in 1996 to more than 100 in 2006, although the actual number of individual bears using the structures remained constant over this time at between 2 and 4 bears (Parks Canada, unpublished results). A similar set of observations was made for wolves, with crossings increasing from two to approximately 140 over the same 10-year period. However, in this case the actual number of wolves in the packs using the crossings increased dramatically, from a low of two up to a high of over 20 individuals. In continuation with these positive results, {{harvtxt|Clevenger et al.|2001}} reported that the use of wildlife crossings and fencing reduced traffic-induced mortality of large ungulates on the TCH by more than 80 percent. Recent analysis for carnivores showed results were not as positive however, with bear mortality increasing by an average of 116 percent in direct parallel to an equal doubling of traffic volumes on the highway, clearly showing no effect of fencing to reduce bear mortality (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep). Research on the crossings in Banff has thus shown mixed value of wildlife crossings depending on the species in question.

Parks Canada is currently planning to build 17 additional crossing structures across the TCH to increase driver safety near the hamlet of [[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]]. Lack of effectiveness of standard fencing in reducing bear mortality demonstrates that additional measures such as wire 'T-caps' on the fence may be needed for fencing to mitigate effectively for bears (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep).

=== Collier and Lee counties in Florida ===
Twenty-four wildlife crossings (highway underpasses) and 12 bridges modified for wildlife have been constructed along a 40-mile stretch of [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] in [[Collier County, Florida|Collier]] and [[Lee County, Florida|Lee]] counties in [[Florida]] {{harv|Scott|2007}}.  These crossings are specifically designed to target and protect the endangered Florida panther, a subspecies of mountain lion found in the [[southeastern United States]]. Scientists estimate that there are only 80-100 Florida panthers alive in the wild, making them one of the most endangered large mammals in North America (Foster and Humphrey, 1995). The Florida panther is particularly vulnerable to wildlife-vehicle collisions, which claimed 11 panthers in 2006 and 14 panthers in 2007 {{harv|Scott|2007}}.

The [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission]] (FWC) has used a number of mitigation tools in an effort to protect Florida panthers and the combination of wildlife crossings and fences have proven the most effective {{harv|Scott|2007}}.  As of 2007, no panthers have been killed in areas equipped with continuous fencing and wildlife crossings and the FWC is planning to construct many more crossing structures in the future.  The underpasses on I-75 also appeared to benefit bobcats, deer, and raccoons and significantly reduced wildlife-vehicle collisions along the interstate (Foster and Humphrey, 1995).

=== Underpasses in southern California ===
Wildlife crossings have also been important for protecting [[biodiversity]] in several areas of [[southern California]].  In [[San Bernardino County]], biologists have erected fences along [[California State Route 58|State Route 58]] to complement underpasses (culverts) that are being used by the threatened [[desert tortoise]].  Tortoise deaths on the highway declined by 93% during the first four years after the introduction of the fences, proving that even makeshift wildlife crossings (storm-drainage culverts in this case) have the ability to increase highway permeability and protect sensitive species {{harv|Chilson|2003}}.  Additionally, studies by {{harvtxt|Haas|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Lyren|2001}} report that underpasses in Orange, Riverside, and Los Angeles Counties have drawn significant use from a variety of species including [[bobcat]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[gray fox]], [[mule deer]], and [[long-tailed weasel]]s.  These results could be extremely important for wildlife conservation efforts in the region's [[Puente Hills]] and [[Chino Hills]] links, which have been increasingly fragmented by road construction {{harv|Haas|2000}}.

=== Ecoducts, Netherlands ===
[[Image:Cerviduct.jpg|thumb|One of the two wildlife crossings spanning the A50 highway on the Veluwe in the Netherlands]]
The Netherlands has over 66 wildlife crossings (overpasses and ecoducts) that have been used to protect the endangered [[European badger]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mjpo.nl/nieuws-publicaties/publicaties/ MJPO annual report 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as populations of [[wild boar]], [[red deer]], and [[roe deer]].  As of 2012, the [[Veluwe]], 1000 square kilometers of woods, heathland and drifting sands, the largest lowland nature area in North Western Europe, contains nine ecoducts, 50 meters wide on average,  that are used to shuttle wildlife across highways that transect the Veluwe.  The first two ecoducts on the Veluwe were built in 1988 across the [[A50 motorway (Netherlands)|A50]] when the highway was constructed. Five of the other ecoducts on the Veluwe were built across existing highways, one was built across a two lane provincial road. The two ecoducts across the A50 were used by nearly 5,000 deer and wild boar during a one-year period {{harv|Bank et al.|2002}}.  The Netherlands also boasts the world's longest ecoduct-wildlife overpass called the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo (sand quarry nature bridge at Crailo) {{harv|Danby|2004}}.  The massive structure, completed in 2006, is 50 m wide and over 800 m long and spans a railway line, [[business park]], river, roadway, and sports complex {{harv|Danby|2004}}.  Monitoring is currently underway to examine the effectiveness of this innovative project combining wildlife protection with urban development. The oldest wildlife passage is Zeist West - A 28, opened in 1988.

=== Slaty Creek Wildlife Underpass, Calder Freeway, Black Forest, Australia ===
Another case study of the effectiveness of wildlife crossings comes from an underpass built to minimize the ecological impact of the [[Calder Freeway]] as it travels through the Black Forest in Victoria, Australia.  In 1997, the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Government]] Roads Corporation built Slaty Creek wildlife underpass at a cost of $3 million {{harv|Abson|Lawrence|2003}}.  Scientists used 14 different techniques to monitor the underpass for 12 months in order to determine the abundance and diversity of species using the underpass {{harv|Abson|Lawrence|2003}}.  During the 12-month period, 79 species of fauna were detected in the underpass (compared with 116 species detected in the surrounding forest) including amphibians, [[bat]]s, birds, [[koala]]s, [[wombat]]s, [[Gliding possum|gliders]], reptiles, and [[kangaroo]]s {{harv|Abson|Lawrence|2003}}.   The results indicate that the underpass could be useful to a wide array of species but the authors suggest that Slaty Creek could be improved by enhanced design and maintenance of fencing to minimise road kill along the Calder Freeway and by attempting to exclude introduced predators such as cats and foxes from the area.

==The ARC International Wildlife Crossing Infrastructure Design Competition==
In 2010, ARC Solutions - an interdisciplinary partnership - initiated the International Wildlife Crossing Infrastructure Design Competition for a wildlife crossing over [[Interstate 70]] near Denver, Colorado.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/wildlife_and_highways_new_ideas_sought_for_colorados_berlin_wall/C41/L41/ | title=Wildlife and Highways: New Ideas Sought for Colorado's 'Berlin Wall' | author=Allen Best | date=November 1, 2010 | publisher=New West|  accessdate=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designers had to account for many challenges unique to the area, including snow and severe weather, high elevation and steep grades, a six-lane roadway, a bike path, and high traffic volumes, as well as multiple species of wildlife, including lynx.

After receiving 36 submissions from nine countries, a jury of internationally acclaimed experts in landscape architecture, engineering, architecture, ecology and transportation selected five finalists in November 2010 to further develop their conceptual designs for a wildlife crossing structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://competition.arc-solutions.org/finalists.php | title=Finalists | publisher=Arc | accessdate=March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2011, the team led by HNTB with Michael Van Valkenburgh &amp; Associates (New York)  were selected as the winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://competition.arc-solutions.org/video.php | title=ARC International Wildlife Crossing Design Competition | accessdate=March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design features a single 100&amp;nbsp;m (328&amp;nbsp;ft) concrete span across the highway that is planted with a variety of vegetation types, including a pine-tree forest and meadow grasses, to attract different species to cross. A modular precast concrete design means that much of the bridge can be constructed offsite and moved into place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Designing the Next Generation of Wildlife Crossings | date=March 2011 | publisher=United States Department of Transportation - Federal Highway Administration | accessdate=March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canopy Bridge in Anamalai Tiger Reserve ===
Many endangered [[lion-tailed macaques]] used to get killed while crossing the highway at Puduthotam in [[Valparai]], South India. Thanks to the efforts of NGOs and the forest department, several canopy bridges were installed, connecting trees on either side of the road. This helped to lower the numbers of lion-tailed macaques killed in the region. The [[Environment Conservation Group]] had initiated a national mission to increase awareness on the importance of adopting roadkill mitigation methods through their mission PATH&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/stop-the-animals-are-crossing/article8029760.ece&lt;/ref&gt; traveling more than 17,000 kilometers across twenty-two states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanctuaryasia.com/magazines/conservation/10297-driven-to-protect-a-journey-across-india-to-document-wild-roadkills.html&lt;/ref&gt;
