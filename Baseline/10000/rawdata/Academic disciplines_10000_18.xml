      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1944">The '''[[Albania|Albanian]] Horticultural and Potato Institute''' ({{lang-sq|Instituti i Perimeve dhe Patates}}) was a scientific research institute, created in 1980 and discontinued in 2006. 

==History==
The Horticultural and Potato Institute was created in 1980 in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]], as a continuation of a former station of research on horticulture and potato that had been created in 1972. Its goal was the research on horticultural crops and new hybrids, the creation of variety structures, seed selection, and scientific cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akti.gov.al/kerkimishkencor/ministrite/doc_mbumk/TeDhenatInstituteve.pdf Tatjana Dishnica on the history of the scientific agricultural institutes of Albania]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute's research was key in the 1980s when many horticultural bio products of Albania were successfully exported into Western and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Dita"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borici|first1=Kujtim|title=Loni Çuko: Si u arrit që perimet ‘Made In Albania’ të pushtonin Evropën|url=http://www.gazetadita.al/loni-cuko-si-u-arrit-qe-perimet-made-in-albania-te-pushtonin-evropen/|accessdate=2 August 2017|agency=Gazeta Dita|date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the institute was dissolved by law (government decree Nr. 515, as of 19 July 2006) as a nation-wide reorganization occurred, following which new scientific institutions (called ''Transfer Centers of Agricultural Technology'' ({{lang-sq|Qendra e Transferimit të Teknologjive Bujqësore}})) were created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://80.78.70.231/pls/kuv/f?p=201:Vendim%20i%20KM:515:19.07.2006 Government decree to end the institution]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apple University''' is a [[training]] facility of [[Apple Inc.]], located in [[Cupertino, California]]. This [[corporate university]] was designed to instruct personnel employed by Apple in the various aspects of Apple's technology and corporate culture.

==History==
[[Steve Jobs]] established Apple University in 2008 as a way to inculcate employees into Apple’s business culture and educate them about its history, particularly as the company grew. The program was devised by Joel Podolny, then the dean of Yale School of Management. Jobs selected him when the program was founded, and Podolny remains head of the program and effectively serves as dean of the university. He also is a vice president at Apple.&lt;ref name="peterburrows"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/-inside-apples-internal-training-program-.html New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Courses are not required, only recommended. Employees sign up for courses tailored to their positions and backgrounds on an internal website available only to Apple staff members.

It is highly secretive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/11/apple-university-employees-staff-steve-jobs|title=Apple University: where employees are not born, but made|author=Samuel Gibbs|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rarely written about.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Employees are strongly discouraged from talking about the company in general, including Apple University. No pictures of the classrooms have surfaced publicly.

Apple has strenuously pursued the vision that function and beauty come from simplicity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-university-preaches-mantra-of-simplicity-to-employees/|title=Apple University preaches mantra of simplicity to employees|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teachers in its internal training program sometimes point to a collection of Picasso lithographs that illustrate the drive to boil down ideas to their most essential components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/10/5989837/at-apple-university-studying-picasso-helps-with-product-design|title=At Apple University, studying Picasso helps with product design|author=Sam Byford|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic staff and instructors==
The full-time members of the faculty design and teach the courses. Faculty members include professors from universities like [[Yale]]; [[Harvard]]; the [[University of California-Berkeley]]; [[Stanford]]; and [[M.I.T.]] Some of the faculty continue to hold positions at their universities while also working for Apple.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2013/02/13/apple-university-hires-another-high-profile-academic/|title=Apple University hires another high-profile academic|work=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instructors include:
*[[Tim Cook]], CEO.&lt;ref name="peterburrows"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-13/why-apple-university-matters-more-than-ever|title=Why Apple University Matters More Than Ever|author=Peter Burrows|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Joel Podolny]], formerly the dean of Yale School of Management &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stxavier.org/page.cfm?p=1&amp;newsid=2947|title=The Jesuit High School in Cincinnati: Keeper of the Apple Culture|work=stxavier.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Richard S. Tedlow|Richard Tedlow]], a Harvard University business historian.&lt;ref name="peterburrows"/&gt;
*Randy Nelson who came from the animation studios Pixar&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/-inside-apples-internal-training-program-.html&lt;/ref&gt; and DreamWorks Animation
*[[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], a Stanford professor&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;
*Morten Hansen, of Berkeley &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Courses==
Some of the courses teach case studies about important business decisions that Apple made. These strategic decisions include the one to make the iPod and its iTunes software compatible with Microsoft’s Windows system. This was a topic of fierce debate internally at Apple with Steve Jobs strongly opposing the notion of sharing the iPod with Windows. Jobs eventually gave in to his lieutenants. It turned out that opening the iPod to Windows users led to explosive growth of the music player and the iTunes Store, and this in turn would later be critical to the success of the iPhone.

''' “Communicating at Apple.” ''' This course focuses on clear communication for making products intuitive, sharing ideas within Apple, and marketing products.

''' “Project Management.” ''' No information provided, Course is confidential

''' “Vendor Management.” '''

'''“What Makes Apple, Apple.”''' Focuses on one of Jobs's goals: to make complex computer technologies feel understandable and natural. In the course an instructor showed a slide of the remote control for the Google TV. The remote had 78 buttons. Then the instructor, Nelson, showed a photo of the Apple TV remote, a thin rod with three buttons.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Campus==
The classes are taught on Apple’s corporate campus in Cupertino, California. Apple University is in a section of buildings called City Center. The rooms are built in a trapezoid shape. Occasionally, classes are offered in Apple’s offices overseas, and the professors travel there to teach.

In 2014, Apple planned an expansion of Apple University to China, to include a Dean to run Apple University China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2014/11/03/apple-plans-apple-university-in-china-bringing-jobs-vision-to-asia/|title=Apple plans Apple University in China, bringing Jobs’ vision to Asia|work=9to5Mac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barbary Coast''' was a [[red-light district]] during the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries in [[San Francisco]] which featured dance halls, concert saloons, bars, jazz clubs, variety shows, and brothels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Asbury, Herbert. ''The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld''. New York: Basic Books, 2002, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; Its nine block area was centered on a three block stretch of Pacific Street, now Pacific Avenue, between Montgomery and Stockton Streets. Pacific Street was the first street to cut through the hills of San Francisco, starting near [[Portsmouth Square]] and continuing east to the first shipping docks at Buena Vista Cove.

The Barbary Coast was born during the [[California Gold Rush|California Gold Rush of 1849]], when the population of San Francisco was growing at an exponential rate due to the rapid influx of tens of thousands of miners trying to find gold.  The early decades of the Barbary Coast would be marred by persistent lawlessness, [[gambling]], administrative graft, [[Frontier justice|vigilante justice]], and [[prostitution]];&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; however with the passage of time the city's government would gain strength and competence, and the Barbary Coast's maturing entertainment scene of [[dance hall]]s and [[jazz]] clubs would influence American culture.&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt; The Barbary Coast's century-long evolution would pass through many substantial incarnations due to the city's rapid cultural development during the transition to the 20th century. Its former location is now overlapped by [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], and [[Jackson Square, San Francisco|Jackson Square]].

== Gold Rush and a first decade ==
[[Image:SanFrancisco1851a.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|[[Portsmouth Square]], looking north to [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]], 1851.]]
San Francisco's Barbary Coast arose from the massive infusion of treasure hunters, called [[Gold Rush of 1849#Forty-niners|''49-ers'']], seeking their fortunes by panning for gold as they searched for a potential gold mine.

=== Gold Rush of 1849 ===
{{Main|Gold Rush of 1849}}
Before the [[Gold Rush of 1849]] there were only a few hundred people living in tents and wooden shanties within [[San Francisco]]. However, after the gold rush the population of San Francisco would increase fifty-fold in just two years—from 492 in 1847 to over 25,000 in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |title=San Francisco Population |accessdate=February 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004055802/http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }} ''San Francisco Population'', SFgenealogy, 2014, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; That extreme growth combined with a lack of strong government would create many opportunities for criminals, corrupt politicians, and brothel owners.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Secrest, William: Dark and Tangled Threads of Crime – San Francisco's Famous Police Detective, Isaiah W. Lees, Quill Driver Books, 2004, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; For many decades murderers and robbers could commit their crimes without punishment, sometimes boldly in public view. As a result, the Barbary Coast became a wild area representative of the [[Old west|Old West]], and had many problems with political corruption, gambling, crime, and violence.

Around 1848 a group of volunteers from the [[Mexican–American War]] were eventually discharged and settled in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them were from [[New York City]] gangs from the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] and [[Bowery]] districts. About sixty of them organized into a gang called the ''Hounds'', paraded around as if they were military, and even creating a headquarters named Tammany Hall within a tent on Kearney Street.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Lukas 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, these thugs began to call themselves the ''Regulators'' as they harassed Mexicans and those of Spanish origin, and extorted money from local businesses for protection services.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Anyone who would not pay was likely to lose a nose, ear, or suffer greater bodily injury. However, after a group of 230 men organized into a militia and confronted the Hounds with possible arrest, they quickly fled from San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sydney Town ===
The Hounds was not the only group of criminals to set up business on San Francisco's Barbary Coast. By the end of 1849, several ships from [[Australia]] brought former members of [[Great Britain]]'s penal colony – including ex-convicts, [[ticket of leave|ticket-of-leave]] men, and criminals – to San Francisco, where they would become known as the ''[[Sydney Ducks]]''.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Montanarelli 2005, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; These Australian immigrants had become so numerous that they dominated the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; They opened boarding houses and various types of groggeries which had prostitutes affiliated with their businesses.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Pryor 2002, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; People who entered these groggeries and brothels were frequently later beaten and robbed.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

A newspaper of the day, the San Francisco Herald, states of Sydney Town:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The upper part of Pacific Street, after dark, is crowded by thieves, gamblers, low women, drunken sailors, and similar characters...  Unsuspecting sailors and miners are entrapped by the dexterous thieves and swindlers that are always on the lookout, into these dens, where they are filled with liquor – drugged if necessary, until insensibility coming upon them, they fall an easy victim to their tempters... When the habitues of this quarter have a reason to believe a man has money, they will follow him for days, and employ every device to get him into their clutches... These dance-groggeries are outrageous nuisances and nurseries of crime.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When looting San Francisco's neighborhoods, the Sydney Ducks even set fire to San Francisco six times between 1849 and 1851 in order to distract citizens from their pillaging and murdering.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Whenever they planned to start a fire, they waited for south westerly winds so that Sydney Town would not also catch fire. The citizens of San Francisco became enraged and in 1851 they formed a first Vigilance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the Sydney Ducks, Samuel Whittaker and Robert McKenzie, were then arrested for arson, robbery, and burglary. The vigilantes then held a quick trial, and later hanged them.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor 2002, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vigilante]]s, unauthorized individuals who use trials and lynchings to punish criminals, were not uncommon in the [[Old west|Old West]] but San Francisco's Vigilance Committees were the largest and most organized of America's history.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Michael: Inside Secret Societies – What They Don't Want You to Know, Citadel Press Books, 2005, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The hangings scared the remaining Sydney Ducks into fleeing the city. Within two weeks after the hangings, Sidney Town had but only a few dance halls, saloons, and brothels remaining.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; That relative peace would only last for two years before criminals started to once again return to the Barbary Coast.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Lukas 2010, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

=== More vigilante justice ===
In the latter half of the 19th century, San Francisco saw administrative graft, boss politics, and a persistent lawlessness.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Boyd 1997, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; For a while after the hangings of Whittaker and McKenzie, San Francisco functioned as a law-abiding city.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The hangings frightened corrupt judges and government officials, who then began to do their duties with a rare diligence, not seen so far in San Francisco. This new competency in government would not last long, and by 1852 corrupt government officials developed a system of high salaries and expensive projects with political kickbacks that would drain the city's treasury to near bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; This financial crisis at city hall would create a great strain on commerce and also affect individual businesses.

The looting of the city's treasury could not have happened without the help of the most powerful man in San Francisco, [[David Broderick]], who was a state senator and held tight control over San Francisco from 1851 until his death in 1859.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Broderick's corruption was such that no man could be elected to public office unless he made a deal with Broderick to share half the profits from his office.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these backroom deals, Broderick accumulated a large amount of wealth which further strengthened his position as a powerful city boss. As news of the treasury's financial crisis became known, another even larger uprising of enraged citizenry would occur.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;

James King, a popular journalist and publisher, vehemently protested the administrative graft of Broderick which angered one of Broderick's biggest supporters, a supervisor named James Casey. While King was standing in front of his newspaper's building Casey shot King in the chest, causing a mortal wound which would ultimately launch the formation of a second Vigilance Committee in May 1856.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Within two hours after Casey's shooting of King, a mob of 10,000 people surrounded the jail where Casey was being held.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, pp. 86 - 87&lt;/ref&gt; The vigilantes then demanded that the jail release James Casey into their custody, and the badly out-numbered jail guards acquiesced to their demands.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, pp. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; King died six days after being shot, and subsequently Casey was put on trial by the Vigilance Committee. King's funeral attracted over 15,000 people, but by the time the funeral had ended Casey had already been convicted and hanged by the vigilantes.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Asbury 1933, pp. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; Now energized by wide public support, the Vigilance Committee set up shop in a large building near the wharf which included jail cells, court rooms, a surrounding wall to resist any military intervention, and was nicknamed Fort Gunnybags.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; During the two months that followed the hanging of Casey there was not a single murder in San Francisco, and less than a half dozen robberies.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1856 the vigilance committee decided to disband and give control back to the elected officials.

== District defined ==
It was not until the 1860s when sailors gave the district its name, and began to refer to it as the ''Barbary Coast''.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Malcolm: More San Francisco Memoirs,1852-1899  – The Ripening Years, Londonborn Publications, 1996, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Barbary Coast' is borrowed from the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary Coast of North Africa]] where [[Barbary pirates|local pirates]] and [[Slavery on the Barbary Coast|slave traders]] launched raids on nearby coastal towns and vessels. That African region was also notorious for the same kind of predatory [[Dive bar|dives]] which would target sailors, as had been done on San Francisco's Barbary Coast.&lt;ref&gt;WPA Guide 2011, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Miners, sailors, and sojourners hungry for female companionship and bawdy entertainment continued to stream into San Francisco in the 1850s and 1860s, becoming the Barbary Coast's primary clientele. During its early days [[San Francisco]] had become a "wide" open city where police had little to no control in stopping the activities of gambling, drinking, drugs, drag, and [[prostitution]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|title=Sexing the city: The sexual production of non-heterosexual space in Belfast, Manchester and San Francisco|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1360481022000011155?needAccess=true|journal=City|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=205–218|doi=10.1080/1360481022000011155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that [[San Francisco]] functioned as a port city meant that it was able to sustain large transient populations that were less likely to conform to social rules and regulations. 
  
{{quote|The Barbary Coast is the haunt of the low and the vile of every kind. The petty thief, the house burglar, the tramp, the [[pimp|whoremonger]], lewd women, cutthroats, murderers, all are found here.

And Hell, yawning to receive the putrid mass, is there also.|Asbury, in Benjamin Estelle Lloyd's ''Lights and Shades of San Francisco'' (1876)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Benjamin Estelle | last=Lloyd | title=Lights and Shades of San Francisco |year=1876 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Before the 1906 earthquake ===
During this time San Francisco went through much commercial growth and became an important shipping port, but matured to a level which would forbid any more uprisings by [[vigilante]]s.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Without the threat of vigilante justice, corruption and crime begin to return along with predatory [[Dive bar|dives]] similar to those of Sidney Town.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; The Barbary Coast would continue to build on its notorious reputation as a lawless city.&lt;ref&gt;Montanarelli 2005, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; With only one hundred policemen as of 1871, San Francisco had a severe shortage of law enforcement. At that time Police Chief Crowley said in his annual report that there was only one officer for every 1,445 inhabitants, while [[New York City]] had one in 464 and [[London]] had one for every 303 residents.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Entertaining the miners, entrepreneurs, and sailors would be a huge business and resulted in varied, inventive, and occasionally bizarre forms of entertainment.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; Except for a couple of restaurants, that three block stretch of Pacific Street was almost wall to wall with drinking establishments.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; They included dance halls, concert saloons which had entertainment and dancing, melodeons, cheap groggeries, and ''deadfalls'' which were dismal beer and wine dens. Initially the melodeons had mechanical [[Pump organ|reed organs]] which played music, however they quickly transformed into a kind of [[cabaret]] which had theatrical entertainment but no dance floor.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The only women allowed in the melodeons were the waitresses and performers. Their shows usually contained songs, bawdy skits, and often featured [[can-can]] dancers. The deadfalls were the lowest of the establishments and had hard benches, damp sawdust on the floors, the bar was rough boards laid atop of barrels, had no entertainment, and their wine was often raw alcohol with an added coloring.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Coast'' as it was called, also invented its own kind of dance hall, called a [[Taxi dance hall#Barbary Coast dance hall|Barbary Coast Dance Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Cressey 1932, p.179&lt;/ref&gt; It was different than most dance halls in that the only women there were the female employees who were paid to dance with the customers, and received commissions on the drinks that they could encourage their male customers to buy. Lawlessness was so bad in the Barbary Coast district that police did not patrol alone, but chose to walk their beats in pairs and sometimes in groups. There was usually a murder every night and scores of robberies.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; And even while inside drinking establishments, a customer's property and life were still never safe.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Prostitution was so common on the Barbary Coast that it was referred to as ''the Paris of America''. Drug addicts of the district could even buy [[cocaine]] or [[morphine]] at an all night [[Grant Avenue|Grant Street]] drugstore for only two or three times the price of a beer.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1890s, San Francisco hit its peak alcohol consumption in having over 3000 licensed bars, and another 2000 unlicensed bars.&lt;ref&gt;Lukas 2010, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

The waitresses were a major attraction for the saloons and were nicknamed the ''pretty waiter girls'', though they were not always attractive or young.&lt;ref&gt;Montanarelli 2005, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; They were scantily clothed in gaudy outfits while they sold drinks and danced with customers for money.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The saloons hired women to exploit the men, instructed to pick customers' pockets and then give half that money back to the management.&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;Boyd 1997, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; The pretty waiter girls earned about $20 per week plus a commission on any drinks and dances that they sold. Small grog houses and deadfalls hired only handful of pretty waiter girls, but the larger dance halls and concert saloons employed up to fifty women.&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; However some of the concert saloons, like the Eureka and Bella Union, made an effort to have notable Barbary Coast performers appear in their shows and actually had attractive women for their pretty waiter girls.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not unusual for the pretty waiter girls to put drugs into the customers' drinks, so they could later be more easily robbed and sometimes clubbed unconscious.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Sailors, who were frequently the targets of the pretty waiter girls, had cause to dread the area because the art of [[shanghaiing]] was perfected here. Many a sailor woke up after a night's leave to find himself unexpectedly on another ship bound for some faraway port. The verb to "[[Shanghaiing|shanghai]]" was first coined on the Barbary Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the 1906 earthquake ===
{{Main|Terrific Street}}
Most of the buildings on that stretch of Pacific Street were destroyed by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake and fire of 1906]]. However the city's financial boosters then saw an opportunity to clean up the tone of the Barbary Coast, and transform it into an entertainment area which would be acceptable for every-day San Franciscans. Possessing a new sense of civic pride, the boosters invested heavily in reconstruction and within three months over a dozen dance halls and a dozen bars were rebuilt and operating.&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;Boyd 1997, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; This new incarnation of Pacific Street would be gentrified and tame compared to the lawless pre-earthquake version of the Barbary Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Montanarelli 2005, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; However prostitution still persisted in the district and it was not until 1917 that Mayor James Rudolf made a declaration that he would close every brothel in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p.309&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex [[Prostitution]] and entertainment which featured [[female impersonators]] briefly existed in a bar on the Barbary Coast as early as the spring of 1908 when ''The Dash'' opened on Pacific Street. The Dash employed some female impersonators, and patrons could purchase homosexual sex in its booths.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; The Dash closed near the end of that same year.

The thriving district also got a new nickname, ''Terrific Street''. The term "Terrific Street" was first used by musicians in describing the quality of music at the Pacific Street clubs, and indeed the first [[jazz]] clubs of San Francisco would occur on Terrific Street and attract national talents like [[Sophie Tucker]], Sid LeProtti, and [[Jelly Roll Morton]].&lt;ref name="auto13"&gt;Fleming, E.J.: Carole Landis – A Tragic Life in Hollywood, McFarland &amp; Company, 2005, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that the Barbary Coast gained a wider appeal and its large dance halls drew tremendous crowds.&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt;

The principal attraction of Terrific Street was dancing and many nationally known dance steps like the [[Texas Tommy (dance)|Texas Tommy]] and the [[Turkey trot (dance)|Turkey Trot]], would be invented on Terrific Street.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; At night, its brightly lit block could be seen from across the bay in Oakland despite the fact that neon lights had not yet been invented.&lt;ref name="auto13"/&gt; From the seeds of cheap [[Mining town|mining-town]] amusements of the old Barbary Coast, Terrific Street would bloom as a vibrant and glamorous district which also nurtured the beginnings of arguably America's greatest cultural contribution, [[Jazz|jazz music]].&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt;

=== Demise ===
An extreme shift in political policy came about in 1911 when a new mayor, [[James Rolph|James "Sunny Jim" Rolph]], was elected to the first of ten terms. Rolph, along with a new group of city supervisors and the business sector, was committed to reforming the Barbary Coast district.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Just before election time in September 1913, [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s newspaper the [[The San Francisco Examiner|''Examiner'']], started a major crusade against the Barbary Coast and in a full page editorial suggested that it "should be wiped out."&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten days later the Police Commission adopted resolutions that no dancing would be allowed in any establishment of the district which served alcohol, that no women – employees or patrons – would be permitted in any saloon of the district, and that even electric signs would be forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some drinking establishments fired their female employees and became ''straight saloons'', while others closed their businesses. Some of the larger dance halls moved to other districts and managed to survive for several more years by masquerading as dance academies or [[Taxi dance hall#Closed dance hall|''closed dance halls'']], but they never regained their previous popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Cressey 1932, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WPA Guide 2011, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 the brothels were eventually closed down due to the [[Red Light Abatement Act]], but by that time all the excitement of Terrific Street had long since vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury 1933, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Red Light Abatement Act, prostitution zones and prostitutes were forced to outskirt areas such as the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]] and [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] as shopping centers took over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wide-Open Town: a history of queer San Francisco to 1965|last=Boyd|first=Nan Alamilla|publisher=Univ of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520244740|location=|pages=25–62|quote=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later eras of the Pacific Street District ==

=== International Settlement ===
[[Image:International_Settlement_1940s_San_Francisco_Pacific_Street_FaceWest_Crp1.jpg    |upright|thumb| 300px |right|International Settlement, 1940s, Pacific Street &lt;br&gt;from Montgomery Street towards Kearney Street. &lt;br&gt;(San Francisco History Center, [[San Francisco Public Library]])]]
{{Main|International Settlement (San Francisco)}}
When [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was adopted in 1920 and stopped the flow of alcohol to the bars, Terrific Street's block lost much excitement and its dance halls and concert saloons were gradually replaced by offices, hotels, and warehouses. However, after Prohibition was repealed in 1933 and liquor was again available, an attempt was made to revive its entertainment scene. The police commission quashed these efforts when, on February 27, 1934, it announced that no dance permits for the area would be issued. This action followed "the withdrawal by the California state board of equalization of state liquor permits for the district." Protests by women's groups and church organizations influenced these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Dull Future Faced By BarBary Coast", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 28 February 1934, Volume 40, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Still later, during World War II, in an attempt to revitalize the district, it was renamed [[International Settlement (San Francisco)|International Settlement]], and a pair of large promotional arched overhead signs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sflib1.sfpl.org:82/search?/dDistricts+--+International+Settlement./ddistricts+international+settlement/-3,-1,0,E/2exact&amp;FF=ddistricts+international+settlement&amp;1,6, Districts -- International Settlement. -- Historical Photographs - SF Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt; which read, ''International Settlement'', were constructed on either end of that Pacific Street block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v470/bananaphone5000/GoGoGorilla5/SF-1-24-43-InternationalSettlement.jpg SF-1-24-43-InternationalSettlement.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way that the post-Barbary Coast establishments of Terrific Street attempted to draw customers and tourists with a reference to the Coast's nefarious past before the earthquake, International Settlement also tried to also draw tourists with a reference to that lost era.

=== The Broadway Scene ===
[[File:Oscar Peterson - 1950.JPG|right|thumb| 150px | Jazz pianist, composer, and vocalist &lt;br&gt;Oscar Peterson]]
{{Main|North Beach, San Francisco}}
During the latter half of the 20th century, the entertainment scene and dancing would spread one block north to Broadway, which is parallel to Pacific Street. [[Jazz|Jazz clubs]] were everywhere on Broadway during the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="auto14"/&gt; Some of Broadway's more famous clubs of that era included Basin Street West, Ann's nightclub, Mr. D's, El Matador, Sugar Hill, [[Keystone Korner]], the [[hungry i]], and the [[Jazz Workshop]].&lt;ref name="auto14"&gt;Feinstein 2012, p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. D's club, so named because [[Sammy Davis, Jr.|Sammy Davis Jr.]] was a partial owner, presented performances by [[Tony Bennett]] and rhythm and blues legend [[James Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2008, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; At Ann's nightclub legendary shock comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] received his start in [[standup comedy]] and created a sensation which drew the attention of journalist [[Herb Caen]] and Beat poets like [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2008, p. 295-296&lt;/ref&gt; Basin Street West started out as a jazz club but later hosted [[Otis Redding]], [[Ike and Tina Turner]], and  Lenny Bruce.&lt;ref name="auto14"/&gt; The [[hungry i]] club was a premier showcase of new talent and presented early performances of comedians [[Phyllis Diller]] and [[Woody Allen]], as well as vocalist [[Barbra Streisand]] when she was 19 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2008, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; The El Matador club became very popular by booking pricey acts like [[Oscar Peterson]], and its audience occasionally included celebrities such as [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Marilyn Monroe]].&lt;ref name="auto14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2008, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jazz Workshop]] became the premier club to hear jazz during the 1950s and 1960s when legendary musicians like [[Miles Davis]], [[Cannonball Adderley]], and [[John Coltrane]] would perform there.&lt;ref name="auto15"&gt;Richards 2008, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] made headlines and would open a national discussion on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s freedom of speech rights when he was arrested at the Jazz Workshop for using profanity in his comedy act.&lt;ref name="auto15"/&gt; When [[strip club]]s started to arrive on Broadway, some local jazz musicians working in the strip clubs would sit in and perform after hours at the jazz clubs.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein 2012, p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT entertainments of female impersonators also appeared in North Beach at a nightclub called ''[[Finocchio's Club|Finocchio's]]'', which opened in 1929.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queer Sites: Gay Urban Histories Since 1600|last=Higgs|first=David|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-15897-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bar was opened by Joseph Finocchio and was on Stockton Street.

[[International Settlement (San Francisco)|International Settlement]]'s club acts, with their [[Can-can|can-can dancers]] and old-fashioned chorus girls, were unable to compete with the incredible talent and excitement of the emerging Broadway scene, and by the early 1960s their popularity had fallen below a critical level. But despite the brilliance and innovation of Broadway's entertainment scene of the 1950s and 1960s, its live entertainment clubs would also lose their popularity with time. As of the first decade in the 21st century, Broadway had lost its [[standup comedy]] clubs and its live music clubs, only to be replaced by cocktail lounges with recorded music. However, some live music clubs still operate in other areas of [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]].

{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist studies''', also known as '''[[Buddhology]]''', is the [[academic]] study of [[Buddhism]]. The term Buddhology was coined in the early 20th-century by Estlin Carpenter – a Unitarian minister, to mean the "study of Buddhahood, the nature of the Buddha, and doctrines of a Buddha", but the terms Buddhology and Buddhist studies are generally synonymous in the contemporary context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/buddhology Buddhology], Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amos Yong (2011), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41416537 On Doing Theology and Buddhology: A Spectrum of Christian Proposals], Buddhist-Christian Studies, Vol. 31, University of Hawai'i Press pp. 103-118&lt;/ref&gt; According to William M. Johnston, in some specific contexts, Buddhology may be viewed as a subset of Buddhist studies, with a focus on Buddhist [[hermeneutics]], [[exegesis]], [[ontology]] and Buddha's attributes.&lt;ref name=Johnston225&gt;{{cite book|author=William M. Johnston|title=Encyclopedia of Monasticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iepJAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78716-4|pages=225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of Buddhist studies focus on the [[history]], [[culture]], [[archaeology]], [[arts]], [[philology]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[theology]], [[philosophy]], practices, interreligious comparative studies and other subjects related to Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Johnston225/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minoru Kiyota (1984), ''Modern Japanese Buddhology: Its History and Problematics, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, volume 7, Number 1, pages 17–33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul David Numrich|title=North American Buddhists in Social Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAy1s626lE0C&amp;pg=PA4|year=2008|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-16826-5|pages=4–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the study of [[Judaism]] or [[Christianity]], the field of Buddhist studies has been dominated by "outsiders" to Buddhist cultures and traditions. However, [[Japan]]ese universities have also made major contributions, as have Asian immigrants to Western countries, and Western converts to Buddhism.

==University programs and institutes==
The first graduate program in Buddhist studies in North America started in 1961 at the University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madision.{{sfn|Lopez|1998|p=159}}&lt;!--Src doesn't explicitly state N. America, but the context indicates such.--&gt; According to Prebish, Buddhist studies in the United States prior to 1975 was dominated by the University of Wisconsin, Harvard University and the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=prebish2006/&gt; Prebish cites two surveys by Hart{{full|reason=Hart refs should be included with Prebish ref|date=January 2013}} in which the following university programs were found to have produced the most scholars with U.S. university posts: Chicago, Wisconsin, Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Virginia, Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, Temple, Northwestern, Michigan, Washington, and Tokyo.{{sfn|Prebish|1999|p=194}}

Other regionally-accredited U.S. institutions with programs in Buddhism include the [[University of the West]], [[Institute of Buddhist Studies]], [[Naropa University]], and the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]]. (A number of dharma centers offer semi-academic, unaccredited study; some of these seem likely eventually to win accreditation.)

Prominent European programs include [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]], [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], [[University of Hamburg]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]], [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]], [[University of Bonn]], [[University of Vienna]], [[Ghent University]], and the [[Sorbonne]]. In Asia, [[University of Tokyo]] and [[Rissho University]] have long been a major centers for Buddhist research, and [[Nalanda University]] launched a master program at 2016.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

==Scholars and scholar-practioners==
Charles Prebish, a scholar-practitioner and Chair of Religious Studies at [[Utah State University]], states that the Buddhist studies and academics in North American universities include those who are practicing Buddhists, the latter he terms as “scholar-practitioners.”.&lt;ref name=prebish2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prebish |first=Charles |title=The New Panditas |journal=Buddhadharma |date=Spring 2006 |url= http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2006/spring/scholar-practitioners.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130104104614/http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2006/spring/scholar-practitioners.html |archivedate=January 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Cascade Center at the Riverplex''' is an indoor and outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex located in downtown [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]]. It opened in 2006. Much of the complex sits on the former site of the Cascade, the first movie theater of the [[Warner Bros.]], hence the name. The complex is at the corner of East Washington Street and Mill Street. As of 2013, the complex is owned by Riverplex Partners, Inc. The top three stories are rented by Refresh Dental Management as their corporate headquarters.

==History==
The [[Warner Bros.|Warners]], residents of nearby [[Youngstown, Ohio]], were sons of [[Polish Jew]]s wanting to break into the then-fledgling film business. The brothers, after successfully showing a used copy of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' at ''[[Idora Park, Youngstown|Idora Park]]'' in Youngstown,&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1964), pp. 49&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; traveled to New Castle to screen the movie in a vacant store on the site of what would become the Cascade Center.&lt;ref name="Warner54-55"&gt;Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 54&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt; This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker.&lt;ref name="ohiomag-march83"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle near the Bijou, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace, taking its name from nearby [[Cascade Park (amusement park)|Cascade Park]]. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907.

Gradually over time, the building that housed the Bijou would host other business while the Cascade itself would eventually be demolished to make way for a [[parking lot]]. The buildings themselves would become abandoned by the 1980s when New Castle, like most other [[Rust Belt]] cities, saw the collapse of the [[steel]] industry having a ripple effect in the region with the population dropping as well as the general [[suburbanization]] effect that had been happening throughout the [[United States]] since the 1950s.

By the mid-1990s, only two businesses were open on the site that would become the Cascade Center. One of them, Main Street Clothiers &amp; Custom Tailors, is a men's [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] shop that was housed in the building that also housed the Bijou. The other would be the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O Railroad]] Federal Credit Union, a [[credit union]] that was in a separate purpose-built building on the site bordering Mill Street and the [[Neshannock Creek]] and had actually been built on the site of the Cascade after the site was used as a parking lot.

In 1996, parts of the wall of the building that housed the Bijou collapsed onto East Washington Street, one of the cities main thoroughfares. The portion that collapsed was next door to Main Street Clothiers, which had just opened three years before on the site. The city of New Castle was very close to issuing a [[Occupancy|condemnation]] notice to the building, but at the 11th hour the building's historical significance was discovered, saving the building. The city then announced redevelopment plans to make it what would eventually become the Cascade Center.

==Development==
The city took most of the property by [[eminent domain]] and stabilized the parts of the wall that had collapsed, closing off the [[sidewalk]] in front of the building to prevent accidents until the wall could be completely rebuilt. The city was later able to persuade the B&amp;O Credit Union—now the First Choice Federal Credit Union—to temporarily move into the nearby mall, the Cascade Galleria, so that the property could be bought and made into the Cascade Center. (The credit union eventually moved out of the mall back into their own building out in neighboring [[Union Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania|Union Township]].) Main Street Clothiers was allowed to stay in the building where they remain today, and although their portion of the building is not officially part of the Cascade Center they do advertise in the complex, and have even expanded their business by [[screen-printing]] [[T-shirt]]s as well as serving as the area's [[J. C. Penney]] Catalog Center after [[Rite Aid]] acquired [[Eckerd Corporation|Eckerd Pharmacy]] in 2007 and ended the J. C. Penney Catalog Center's in the former Eckerd locations after they were converted to Rite Aid. Coincidentally, Main Street sits next door to a former J. C. Penney (not the side that had the wall collapse) that is currently being remodeled and eventually having a [[coffeehouse|coffee shop]] open in the building.

Although the downtown streets &amp; sidewalks were rebuilt in the early 2000s to resemble the turn of the 19th century, the complex itself wouldn't begin reconstruction until 2003 and was completed in 2006. The interiors of the existing buildings were completely gutted out while the site of the Cascade itself was completely rebuilt into a close replication of the Cascade. Both the old sections and the newly built sections are like one building inside. The city was also able to acquire the former [[Mellon Financial|Mellon Bank]] parking lot and rebuild it as the parking lot for downtown in general and the Cascade Center specifically. The [[alley]] that ran along Neshannock Creek behind the buildings was permanently closed and added on to the property of the complex, which became a [[Esplanade|promenade]] that leads to an outdoor [[Amphitheatre|amphitheater]] between the former J. C. Penney building and the creek along East Washington Street. The northern terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 65]] (which runs along East Washington Street) was extended over a mile to near the complex on the other side of the creek.

Much like [[Station Square]] in [[Pittsburgh]], the complex is an example of [[adaptive reuse]], and focuses on the early years of [[Film|motion pictures]] much like Station Square focuses on [[train]]s. The complex largely remains vacant, although businesses have started to open up and events being held both inside the complex and at the amphitheater. The complex has also help draw businesses to downtown.

Despite the historical connection to the Warner Bros. studio, the complex has no association with [[Time Warner]], the current parent company of Warner Bros. Entertainment. Cass Warner, the granddaughter of [[Harry Warner]], did visit the complex just before it officially opened in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncnewsonline.com/archivesearch/local_story_112013504?start:int=30{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
Although at one point the complex had three tenants, in 2010 all three closed for unknown reasons and the complex was put up for sale. The outdoor promenade and amphitheater, which are publicly owned, are still used by the city for downtown events.
 
It should also be noted that Main Street Clothiers and Custom Tailors, while in the building where the Cascade Center is located, is not an official part of the complex, since it has outdoor access only instead of indoor access like the rest of the businesses and also was pre-existing before the creation of the complex.

Reinvestment in the center has picked up in recent years, with the Two Rivers Coffee Shop and The Commonwealth restaurant both opening in 2014.

'''Developmental psychology''' is the [[scientific]] study of how and why [[human]] beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with [[infants]] and [[child]]ren, the field has expanded to include [[adolescence]], [[adult development]], [[aging]], and the entire lifespan. Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life.  This field examines change across three major dimensions: [[physical development]], [[cognitive development]], and socioemotional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/action/science/developmental/index.aspx|title=Developmental Psychology Studies Human Development Across the Lifespan|last=|first=|date=|website=www.apa.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709054242/http://www.apa.org/action/science/developmental/index.aspx|archive-date=2014-07-09|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including [[motor skills]], [[executive functions]], [[morality|moral understanding]], [[language acquisition]], [[social change]], [[personality]], emotional development, [[self-concept]], and [[identity formation]].

Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature ''and'' nurture on the process of human development, and processes of change in context and across time. Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior, and [[environmental factor]]s, including the [[social context]] and the [[built environment]]. Ongoing debates include biological [[essentialism]] vs. [[neuroplasticity]] and [[Developmental stage theories|stages of development]] vs. dynamic systems of development.

Developmental psychology involves a range of fields, such as [[educational psychology]], [[child psychopathology]], [[forensic developmental psychology]], [[child development]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[ecological psychology]], and [[cultural psychology]]. Influential developmental psychologists from the 20th century include [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Barbara Rogoff]], [[Esther Thelen]], and [[Lev Vygotsky]].

==Historical antecedents==
[[John B. Watson]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] are typically cited as providing the foundations for modern developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogan|first=John D|authorlink=John D. Hogan|title=Encyclopedia of Psychology|location=Volume 3|isbn=978-1-55798-652-8|pages=9–13|chapter=Developmental psychology: History of the field|editor=Alan E. Kazdin|editor-link=Alan E. Kazdin|accessdate=|doi=10.1037/10518-003|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th century Jean Jacques Rousseau described three stages of development: ''infants'' (infancy), ''puer'' (childhood) and ''adolescence'' in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]''. Rousseau's ideas were taken up strongly by educators at the time.

It generally focuses on how and why certain modifications throughout an individual’s life-cycle (cognitive, social, intellectual, personality) and human growth change over time. There are many theorists that have made a profound contribution to this area of psychology. For example, [[Erik Erikson]] developed a model of eight stages of psychological development. He believed that humans developed in stages throughout their lifetimes and this would affect their behaviors (Similar ideas to [[Sigmund Freud]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erikson and Erikson|first1=E and J. M.|title=The Life-Cycle Completed|date=1998|publisher=Norton and Company|edition=Extended version}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, psychologists familiar with the [[evolutionary theory]] of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] began seeking an evolutionary description of psychological development;&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; prominent here was the pioneering psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]],&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; who attempted to correlate ages of childhood with previous ages of humanity. [[James Mark Baldwin]] who wrote essays on topics that included ''Imitation: A Chapter in the Natural History of Consciousness'' and ''Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes''. [[James Mark Baldwin]] was heavily involved in the theory of developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]], whose concepts were developmental, significantly affected public perceptions.&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt;

==Theories==

===Psychosexual development===
{{Main|Psychosexual development}}
[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that we all had a conscious, preconscious, and unconscious level. In the conscious, we are aware of our mental process. The preconscious involves information that, though not currently in our thoughts, can be brought into consciousness. Lastly, the unconscious includes mental processes we are unaware of.

He believed there is tension between the conscious and unconscious because the conscious tries to hold back what the unconscious tries to express. To explain this he developed three personality structures: the id, ego, and superego. The id, the most primitive of the three, functions according to the pleasure principle: seek pleasure and avoid pain.&lt;ref name="Theories2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Theories of personality: understanding persons|last=Cloninger|first=Susan C.|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-25624-2|edition=6th|location=Boston|pages=19–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the superego.&lt;ref name="Snowden2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Freud|last=Snowden|first=Ruth|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-147274-6|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this, he proposed five universal stages of development, that each is characterized by the erogenous zone that is the source of the child's psychosexual energy. The first is the ''oral stage'', which occurs from birth to 12 months of age. During the oral stage, "the libido is centered in a baby's mouth." The baby is able to suck. The second is the ''anal stage'', from one to three years of age. During the anal stage, the child defecates from the anus and is often fascinated with their defecation. The third is the ''[[phallic stage]]'', which occurs from three to five years of age (most of a person's personality forms by this age). During the phallic stage, the child is aware of their sexual organs. The fourth is the ''latency stage'', which occurs from age five until puberty. During the latency stage, the child's sexual interests are repressed. Stage five is the ''[[genital stage]]'', which takes place from puberty until adulthood. During the genital stage, puberty starts happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/psychosexual.html|title=Psychosexual Stages|website=SimplyPsychology|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of cognitive development===
{{Main|Piaget's theory of cognitive development}}
[[Jean Piaget]], a Swiss theorist, posited that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through hands-on experience.&lt;ref name="WoodWoodBoyd2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering the world of psychology|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|year=2006|edition=2|author1=Wood, S.E.|author2=Wood, C.E.|author3=Boyd D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the adult's role in helping the child learn was to provide appropriate materials that the child can interact with and use to construct. He used [[Socratic questioning]] to get children to reflect on what they were doing, and he tried to get them to see contradictions in their explanations.

Piaget believed that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages, which he described in his theory on cognitive development. Each stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next step. He believed that these stages are not separate from one another, but rather that each stage builds on the previous one in a continuous learning process. He proposed four stages: ''sensorimotor'', ''pre-operational'', ''concrete operational'', and ''formal operational''. Though he did not believe these stages occurred at any given age, many studies have determined when these cognitive abilities should take place.&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"&gt;{{cite book|title=Edpsych : modules|last=Reese-Weber|first=Lisa Bohlin, Cheryl Cisero Durwin, Marla|publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages|isbn=978-0-07-809786-7|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=30–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of moral development===
{{Main|Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development}}
Piaget claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.&lt;ref name="higheststage2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|year=1973|title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment|journal=Journal of Philosophy|publisher=The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 70, No. 18|volume=70|issue=18|pages=630–646|doi=10.2307/2025030|jstor=2025030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on Piaget's work, [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime.&lt;ref name="dissertation2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|year=1958|title=The Development of Modes of Thinking and Choices in Years 10 to 16|journal=Ph. D. Dissertation, University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He suggested three levels of moral reasoning; pre-conventional moral reasoning, conventional moral reasoning, and post-conventional moral reasoning.  The pre-conventional moral reasoning is typical of children and is characterized by reasoning that is based on rewards and punishments associated with different courses of action. Conventional moral reason occurs during late childhood and early adolescence and is characterized by reasoning based on rules and conventions of society. Lastly, post-conventional moral reasoning is a stage during which the individual sees society's rules and conventions as relative and subjective, rather than as authoritative.&lt;ref name="Adolescence3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Adolescence|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-340548-3|edition=8th|location=Boston|pages=60–365|authorlink=Laurence Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg used the Heinz Dilemma to apply to his stages of moral development. The Heinz Dilemma involves Heinz's wife dying from cancer and Heinz having the dilemma to save his wife by stealing a drug. Preconventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality applies to Heinz's situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/kohlberg.html|title=Kohlberg|website=SimplyPsychology|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of psychosocial development===
{{Main|Erikson's stages of psychosocial development}}
German-American psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] and his collaborator and wife, [[Joan Erikson]], conceptualized eight stages of psychosocial development that they theorized healthy individuals pass through as they develop from infancy to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Thomas|first=Robert McG., Jr.|title=Joan Erikson Is Dead at 95; Shaped Thought on Life Cycles|date=8 August 1997|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/us/joan-erikson-is-dead-at-95-shaped-thought-on-life-cycles.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is called "Trust vs. Mistrust" takes place in infancy. The best virtue for the first stage is hope, in the infant learning who to trust and having hope for a supportive group of people to be there for him/her. The second stage is "Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt" with the best virtue being will. This takes place in early childhood where the child learns to become more independent by discovering what they are capable of where if the child is overly controlled, they believe to feel inadequate on surviving by themselves, which can lead to low self-esteem and doubt. The third stage is "Initiative vs. Guilt". The basic virtue that would be gained is the purpose and takes place in the play age. This is the stage where the child will be curious and have many interactions with other kids. They will ask many questions as their curiosity grows. If too much guilt is present, the child may have a slower and harder time interacting with other children. The fourth stage is "Industry (competence) vs. Inferiority". The basic virtue for this stage is competency which happens at the school age. This stage is when the child will try to win the approval of others and fit in and understand the value of their accomplishments. The fifth stage is "Identity vs. Role Confusion". The basic virtue gained is fidelity which takes place in adolescence. This is where the child will start to find who he/she is as a person in society. What sex role he/she picks. The sixth stage is "Intimacy vs. Isolation", which happens in young adults and the virtue gained is love. This is where the person will start to share his/her life with someone else intimately and emotionally. In not doing so, it could lead to isolation. The seventh stage is "Generativity vs. Stagnation". This happens in adulthood and the virtue gained would be care. We become stable and start to give back by raising a family and becoming involved in the community. The eighth stage is "Ego Integrity vs. Despair". This happens during maturity and wisdom is gained. When one grows old and they contemplate and look back and see the success or failure of their life. This is also the stage where one can also have closure and accept death without fearing anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=Erik Erikson|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/Erik-Erikson.html|year=2013|accessdate=23 July 2016|orig-year=2008|website=Simply Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages based on the model of hierarchical complexity===
{{Main|Model of hierarchical complexity}}
[[Michael Commons]] enhanced and simplified [[Bärbel Inhelder]] and Piaget's developmental theory and offers a standard method of examining the universal pattern of development. The Model of Hierarchical Complexity  (MHC) is not based on the assessment of domain-specific information, It divides the Order of Hierarchical Complexity of tasks to be addressed from the Stage performance on those tasks.  A stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participant's successfully addresses. He expanded Piaget's original eight stage (counting the half stages) to fifteen stages. The stages are : 0 Calculatory; 1 Sensory &amp; Motor; 2 Circular sensory-motor; 3 Sensory-motor; 4 Nominal; 5 Sentential; 6 Preoperational; 7 Primary; 8 Concrete; 9 Abstract; 10 Formal; 11 Systematic; 12 Metasystematic; 13 Paradigmatic; 14 Cross-paradigmatic; 15 Meta-Cross-paradigmatic. The order of hierarchical complexity of tasks predicts how difficult the performance is with an R ranging from 0.9 to 0.98.

In the MHC, there are three main axioms for an order to meet in order for the higher order task to coordinate the next lower order task. Axioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchy. These axioms are: a) defined in terms of tasks at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity task action; b) defined as the higher order task action that organizes two or more less complex actions; that is, the more complex action specifies the way in which the less complex actions combine; c) defined as the lower order task actions have to be carried out non-arbitrarily.

===Ecological systems theory===
{{Main|Ecological systems theory}}
[[File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|right|thumb|180x180px|{{center|Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory}}]]
Ecological systems theory, originally formulated by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], specifies four types of nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the systems. The four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development. The microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school. Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem. Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role. Macrosystem refers to the cultural values, customs and laws of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://explorable.com/ecological-systems-theory|title=Ecological Systems Theory|website=Explorable Psychology Experiments|last1=Sincero|first1=Sarah Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The microsystem is the immediate environment surrounding and influencing the individual (example: school or the home setting). The mesosystem is the combination of two microsystems and how they influence each other (example: sibling relationships at home vs. peer relationships at school). The exosystem is the interaction among two or more settings that are indirectly linked (example: a father's job requiring more overtime ends up influencing his daughter's performance in school because he can no longer help with her homework). The macrosystem is broader taking into account social economic status, culture, beliefs, customs and morals (example: a child from a wealthier family sees a peer from a less wealthy family as inferior for that reason). Lastly, the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition (example: a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life).&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"/&gt;

Since its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory, ''The Ecology of Human Development''&lt;ref&gt;Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979). ''The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ({{ISBN|0-674-22457-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments. As a result of this conceptualization of development, these environments—from the family to economic and political structures—have come to be viewed as part of the life course from childhood through to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Smith et al.2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Children's Development|publisher=Blackwell|edition=4|series=Basic psychology|location=Oxford, England|author1=Smith, P.K.|author2=Cowie, H.|author3=Blades, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zone of proximal development===
{{Main|Zone of proximal development}}
[[Lev Vygotsky]] was a Russian theorist from the Soviet era, who posited that children learn through hands-on experience and social interactions with members of his/her culture.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, D. L., D. T. Gilbert, and D. M. Wegner. Psychology. 2. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike Piaget, he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task (called the "zone of proximal development") could help children learn new tasks. This adult role is often referred to as the skilled "master," whereas the child is considered the learning apprentice through an educational process often termed "[[cognitive apprenticeship]]" Martin Hill stated that "The world of reality does not apply to the mind of a child." This technique is called "scaffolding," because it builds upon knowledge children already have with new knowledge that adults can help the child learn.&lt;ref name="vygotsky782"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind in Society|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1978|location=Cambridge, MA|author=Vygotsky, L.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky was strongly focused on the role of culture in determining the child's pattern of development, arguing that development moves from the social level to the individual level.&lt;ref name="vygotsky782" /&gt; In other words, Vygotsky claimed that psychology should focus on the progress of human consciousness through the relationship of an individual and their environment.&lt;ref name="vygotsky20102"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Activity Systems Analysis Methods: Understanding Complex Learning Environments|publisher=Springer Science|year=2010|location=New York, NY|author=Yamagata-Lynch, L.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that if scholars continued to disregard this connection, then this disregard would inhibit the full comprehension of the human consciousness.&lt;ref name="vygotsky20102" /&gt;

===Constructivism===
{{Main|Constructivism (psychological school)}}
Constructivism is a paradigm in psychology that characterizes learning as a process of actively constructing knowledge. Individuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting, organizing, and integrating information with other knowledge, often in the context of social interactions.  Constructivism can occur in two ways: individual and social. Individual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others.  Social constructivism is when individuals construct knowledge through an interaction between the knowledge they bring to a situation and social or cultural exchanges within that content.&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"/&gt;

Jean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist, proposed that learning is an active process because children learn through experience and make mistakes and solve problems. Piaget proposed that learning should be whole by helping students understand that meaning is constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viking.coe.uh.edu/~ichen/ebook/et-it/cognitiv.htm|title=Overview of Cognitive Constructivism|website=Cognitive Constructivist Theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary developmental psychology===
{{Main|Evolutionary developmental psychology}}

Evolutionary developmental psychology is a research paradigm that applies the basic principles of Darwinian [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]], to understand the development of human behavior and cognition. It involves the study of both the [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental mechanisms that underlie the development of social and [[cognitive]] competencies, as well as the [[epigenetic]] ([[gene-environment interaction]]s) processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|last2=Blasi|first2=Carlos Hernández|last3=Ellis|first3=Bruce J|isbn=978-1-118-75580-8|editor-link=|location=Volume 2|pages=905|chapter=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology|doi=|last1=Bjorklund|first1=David F|editor=David M.

EDP considers both the reliably developing, species-typical features of ontogeny (developmental adaptations), as well as [[Differential psychology|individual differences]] in behavior, from an evolutionary perspective. While evolutionary views tend to regard most individual differences as the result of either random genetic noise (evolutionary byproducts)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tooby|first=John|date=1990|title=On the universality of human nature and the uniqueness of the individual: The role of genetics and adaptation|url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/papers/jpersonality.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=58|issue=1|pages=17–67|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00907.x|pmid=2198338}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or idiosyncrasies (for example, peer groups, education, neighborhoods, and chance encounters)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The blank slate|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Chapter 19: Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than products of natural selection, EDP asserts that natural selection can favor the emergence of individual differences via "adaptive developmental plasticity."&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developmental plasticity and evolution|last=West-Eberhard|first=Mary Jane|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, human development follows alternative life-history strategies in response to environmental variability, rather than following one species-typical pattern of development.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

EDP is closely linked to the theoretical framework of [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP), but is also distinct from EP in several domains, including research emphasis (EDP focuses on adaptations of ontogeny, as opposed to adaptations of adulthood) and consideration of proximate ontogenetic and environmental factors (i.e., how development happens) in addition to more ultimate factors (i.e., why development happens), which are the focus of mainstream evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Carlos Hernandez|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F.|date=2003|title=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: A New Tool for Better Understanding Human Ontogeny|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Blasi/publication/275042203_Evolutionary_Developmental_Psychology_A_new_tool_for_better_understanding_human_ontogeny/links/553132e10cf27acb0dea90ec.pdf|journal=Human Development|volume=46|issue=5|pages=259–281|doi=10.1159/000071935|pmid=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment theory===
{{Main|Attachment theory}}
Attachment theory, originally developed by [[John Bowlby]], focuses on the importance of open, intimate, emotionally meaningful relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=x-Oki9MxalQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA45|title=Attachment Theory: Social, Developmental, and Clinical Perspectives|last=Goldberg|first=Susan|last2=Muir|first2=Roy|last3=Kerr|first3=John|date=2013-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135890520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment is described as a biological system or powerful survival impulse that evolved to ensure the survival of the infant. A child who is threatened or stressed will move toward caregivers who create a sense of physical, emotional and psychological safety for the individual. Attachment feeds on body contact and familiarity. Later [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed the [[Mary Ainsworth#Strange Situation|Strange Situation]] protocol and the concept of the secure base.

Theorists have proposed four types of attachment styles:&lt;ref name="Schacter4402"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology|last=Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner|publisher=Worth|year=2011|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant,&lt;ref name="Adolescence3"/&gt; and disorganized.&lt;ref name="Schacter4402" /&gt; Secure attachment is a healthy attachment between the infant and the caregiver. It is characterized by trust. Anxious-avoidant is an insecure attachment between an infant and a caregiver. This is characterized by the infant's indifference toward the caregiver. Anxious-resistant is an insecure attachment between the infant and the caregiver characterized by distress from the infant when separated and anger when reunited.&lt;ref name="Adolescence3" /&gt; Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent.&lt;ref name="Schacter4402" /&gt;

A child can be hindered in its natural tendency to form attachments. Some babies are raised without the stimulation and attention of a regular caregiver or locked away under conditions of abuse or extreme neglect. The possible short-term effects of this deprivation are anger, despair, detachment, and temporary delay in intellectual development. Long-term effects include increased aggression, clinging behavior, detachment, psychosomatic disorders, and an increased risk of depression as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Psychology|last=Myers|first=D.|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2008|isbn=1-57259-096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Level Psychology Through Diagrams|last=Hill|first=G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-918094-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}

Attachment style can affect the relationships between people. Attachment is established in early childhood and attachment continues into adulthood. An example of secure attachment continuing in adulthood would be when the person feels confident and is able to meet their own needs. An example of anxious attachment during adulthood is when the adult chooses a partner with anxious-avoidant attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201307/how-your-attachment-style-impacts-your-relationship|title=How Your Attachment Style Impacts Your Relationship|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Compassion Matters|last1=Firestone|first1=Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major debates==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}

===Nature vs nurture===
A significant issue in developmental psychology is the relationship between innateness and environmental influence in regard to any particular aspect of development. This is often referred to as "[[nature and nurture]]" or [[psychological nativism|nativism]] versus [[empiricism]]. A nativist account of development would argue that the processes in question are innate, that is, they are specified by the organism's [[genes]].

An empiricist perspective would argue that those processes are acquired in interaction with the environment. Today developmental psychologists rarely take such polarised positions with regard to most aspects of development; rather they investigate, among many other things, the relationship between innate and environmental influences. One of the ways this relationship has been explored in recent years is through the emerging field of [[evolutionary developmental psychology]].

One area where this innateness debate has been prominently portrayed is in research on [[language acquisition]]. A major question in this area is whether or not certain properties of human language are specified genetically or can be acquired through [[learning]]. The empiricist position on the issue of language acquisition suggests that the language input provides the necessary information required for learning the structure of language and that infants acquire language through a process of [[statistical learning]]. From this perspective, language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development, such as [[perceptual learning]].

The nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of language. Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] asserts that, evidenced by the lack of sufficient information in the language input, there is a [[universal grammar]] that applies to all human languages and is pre-specified. This has led to the idea that there is a special cognitive [[modularity of mind|module]] suited for learning language, often called the [[language acquisition device]]. Chomsky's critique of the behaviorist model of language acquisition is regarded by many as a key turning point in the decline in the prominence of the theory of behaviorism generally.&lt;ref name="Schlinger"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Schlinger, H.D. |year=2008 |title=The long good-bye: why B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior is alive and well on the 50th anniversary of its publication |journal=The Psychological Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Skinner's conception of "Verbal Behavior" has not died, perhaps in part because it has generated successful practical applications.&lt;ref name="Schlinger" /&gt;

===Continuity vs discontinuity===
Since theorists believe that development is a smooth, continuous process, individuals gradually add more of the same types of skills throughout their lives. Other theorists, however, think that development takes place in discontinuous stages. People change rapidly and step up to a new level, and then change very little for a while. With each new step, the person shows interest and responds to the world qualitatively.

===Stability vs change===
This issue involves the degree to which we become older renditions of our early experience or whether we develop into something different from who we were at an earlier point in development. It considers the extent to which early experiences ( especially infancy) or later experiences are the key determinants of a person's development.

Most lifespan developmentalists, recognise that extreme positions are unwise. Therefore, the key to a comprehensive understanding of development at any stage requires the ·interaction of different factors and not only one.

==Mechanisms of Development==
Developmental psychology is concerned not only with describing the characteristics of psychological change over time but also seeks to explain the principles and internal workings underlying these changes. Psychologists have attempted to better understand these factors by using [[model (abstract)|models]]. Developmental models are sometimes [[computer model|computational]], but they do not need to be.

A model must simply account for the means by which a process takes place. This is sometimes done in reference to changes in the [[human brain|brain]] that may correspond to changes in behavior over the course of the development. Computational accounts of development often use either [[symbol]]ic, [[connectionist]] ([[neural net]]work), or [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] models to explain the Mechanisms of Development.

==Research areas==

===Cognitive development===
{{Main|Cognitive development|Theory of cognitive development|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}
Cognitive development is primarily concerned with the ways that infants and children acquire, develop, and use internal mental capabilities such as: problem-solving, memory, and language. Major topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisition and the development of perceptual and motor skills. Piaget was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilities. His theory suggests that development proceeds through a set of stages from infancy to adulthood and that there is an end point or goal.

Other accounts, such as that of [[Lev Vygotsky]], have suggested that development does not progress through stages, but rather that the developmental process that begins at birth and continues until death is too complex for such structure and finality. Rather, from this viewpoint, developmental processes proceed more continuously. Thus, development should be analyzed, instead of treated as a product to obtain.

[[K. Warner Schaie]] has expanded the study of cognitive development into adulthood.  Rather than being stable from adolescence, Schaie sees adults as progressing in the application of their cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Schaie, K. W. (1990). Intellectual development in adulthood. In J. E. Birren &amp; K. W. Schaie (Eds.), Handbook of the psychology of aging, 3rd ed., (pp. 291-309). New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cognitive development has integrated the considerations of [[cognitive psychology]] and the psychology of [[individual differences]] into the interpretation and modeling of development.&lt;ref name="demetriou"&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K.F.M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology'' (pp. 179–269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] showed that the successive levels or stages of cognitive development are associated with increasing processing efficiency and [[working memory]] capacity. These increases explain differences between stages, progression to higher stages, and individual differences of children who are the same-age and of the same grade-level. However, other theories have moved away from Piagetian stage theories, and are influenced by accounts of [[domain-specific]] information processing, which posit that development is guided by innate evolutionarily-specified and content-specific information processing mechanisms.

===Social and emotional development===
{{Main|Social-emotional development in childhood|Social psychology}}
Developmental psychologists who are interested in social development examine how individuals develop social and emotional competencies. For example, they study how children form friendships, how they understand and deal with emotions, and how identity develops. Research in this area may involve study of the relationship between cognition or cognitive development and social behavior.

[[Emotional self-regulation|Emotional regulation]] or ER refers to an individual's ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contexts. In young children, this modulation is in part controlled externally, by parents and other authority figures. As children develop, they take on more and more responsibility for their internal state. Studies have shown that the development of ER is affected by the emotional regulation children observe in parents and caretakers, the emotional climate in the home, and the reaction of parents and caretakers to the child's emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Morris et al. (2009) National Institute of Health. "The Role of the Family Context in Development of Emotion Regulation." pp 1-36 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PSYCH305-11.2.pdf] Retrieved May 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Music also has an influence on stimulating and enhancing the senses of a child through self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;Oaklander, Violet. (2006) Hidden Treasure : A Map to the Child's Inner Self. London,   Karnac Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

A child's social and emotional development can be disrupted by motor coordination problems as evidenced by the environmental stress hypothesis.  The environmental hypothesis explains how children with coordination problems and [[developmental coordination disorder]] are exposed to several psychosocial consequences which act as secondary stressors, leading to an increase in [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing symptoms]] such as depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cairney|first1=John|last2=Veldhuizen|first2=Scott|last3=Szatmari|first3=Peter|title=Motor coordination and emotional-behavioral problems in children|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=2010|volume=23|pages=324–329|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e32833aa0aa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motor coordination problems affect fine and gross motor movement as well as perceptual-motor skills.  Secondary stressors commonly identified include the tendency for children with poor motor skills to be less likely to participate in organized play with other children and more likely to feel socially isolated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Social and emotional development focuses on 5 keys areas: Self-Awareness, Self Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Skills and Responsible Decision Making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SEL Competencies|url = http://www.casel.org/social-and-emotional-learning/core-competencies|website = CASEL|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical development===
Physical development concerns the physical maturation of an individual's body until it reaches the adult stature. Although physical growth is a highly regular process, all children differ tremendously in the timing of their growth spurts.&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;Eaton, Warren. "Physical Maturation", University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. Retrieved on 2012-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies are being done to analyze how the differences in these timings affect and are related to other variables of developmental psychology such as information processing speed. Traditional measures of physical maturity using x-rays are less in practice nowadays, compared to simple measurements of body parts such as height, weight, head circumference, and arm span.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

A few other studies and practices with physical developmental psychology are the phonological abilities of mature 5- to 11-year-olds, and the controversial hypotheses of left-handers being maturationally delayed compared to right-handers. A study by Eaton, Chipperfield, Ritchot, and Kostiuk in 1996 found in three different samples that there was no difference between right- and left-handers.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

===Memory development===
Researchers interested in memory development look at the way our memory develops from childhood and onward. According to [[Fuzzy-trace theory]], we have two separate memory processes: verbatim and gist. These two traces begin to develop at different times as well as at a different pace. Children as young as 4 years-old have verbatim memory, memory for surface information, which increases up to early adulthood, at which point it begins to decline. On the other hand, our capacity for gist memory, memory for semantic information, increases up to early adulthood, at which point it is consistent through old age. Furthermore, our reliance on gist memory traces increases as we age.&lt;ref name="Fuzzy-trace theory and children's false memories"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brainerd|first=C.J.|author2=Reyna, V.F.|title=Fuzzy-trace theory and children's false memories|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1998|volume=71|issue=2|pages=81–129|doi=10.1006/jcep.1998.2464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods and designs==

===Main research methods===
Developmental psychology employs many of the [[psychological research methods|research methods]] used in other areas of psychology. However, infants and children cannot be tested in the same ways as adults, so different methods are often used to study their development.

Developmental psychologists have a number of methods to study changes in individuals over time. Common research methods include systematic observation, including [[naturalistic observation]] or structured observation; self-reports, which could be clinical interviews or [[structured interviews]]; clinical or [[case study]] method; and [[ethnography]] or participant observation.&lt;ref name=Berk&gt;{{cite book |title=Infants and children: Prenatal through middle childhood |author=Laura E. Berk |edition=7 |year=2012 |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31–35}} These methods differ in the extent of control researchers impose on study conditions, and how they construct ideas about which variables to study.&lt;ref name=Bruning&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruning|first=David Moshman, John A. Glover, Roger H.|title=Developmental psychology : a topical approach|year=1987|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=0-316-58561-0|pages=82–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every developmental investigation can be characterized in terms of whether its underlying strategy involves the ''experimental'', ''correlational'', or ''case study'' approach.&lt;ref name=Achenbach&gt;{{cite book|last=Achenbach|first=Thomas M.|title=Research in development psychology.|year=1978|publisher=Free Pr. [usw.]|location=New York [usw.]|isbn=0-02-900180-3|pages=74–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall&gt;{{cite book|last=Marmor|first=Robert M. Liebert, Rita Wicks Poulos, Gloria Strauss|title=Developmental psychology|year=1977|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0-13-208231-4|pages=20–37|edition=2d}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[experimental method]] involves "actual manipulation of various treatments, circumstances, or events to which the participant or subject is exposed;&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt; the ''experimental design'' points to [[Causality|cause-and-effect relationships]].&lt;ref name=Shaffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=David R.|title=Social and personality development|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Australia|isbn=0-495-60038-5|pages=21–36|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method allows for strong inferences to be made of causal relationships between the manipulation of one or more [[independent variables]] and subsequent behavior, as measured by the [[dependent variable]].&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt; The advantage of using this research method is that it permits determination of cause-and-effect relationships among variables.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; On the other hand, the limitation is that data obtained in an artificial environment may lack generalizability.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; The correlational method explores the relationship between two or more events by gathering information about these variables without researcher intervention.&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; The advantage of using a correlational design is that it estimates the strength and direction of relationships among variables in the natural environment;&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; however, the limitation is that it does not permit determination of cause-and-effect relationships among variables.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; The [[case study]] approach allows investigations to obtain an in-depth understanding of an individual participant by collecting data based on [[interviews]], structured questionnaires, observations, and test scores.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; Each of these methods have its strengths and weaknesses but the experimental method when appropriate is the preferred method of developmental scientists because it provides a controlled situation and conclusions to be drawn about cause-and-effect relationships.&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt;

===Research designs===
Most developmental studies, regardless of whether they employ the experimental, correlational, or case study method, can also be constructed using research designs.&lt;ref name=Bruning /&gt; Research designs are logical frameworks used to make key comparisons within research studies such as:
* [[cross-sectional design]]
* [[longitudinal design]]
* [[cohort study|sequential design]]
* [[microgenetic design]]

In a [[longitudinal study]], a researcher observes many individuals born at or around the same time (a [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]) and carries out new observations as members of the cohort age. This method can be used to draw conclusions about which types of development are universal (or [[norm (sociology)|normative]]) and occur in most members of a cohort. As an example a longitudinal study of early literacy development examined in detail the early literacy experiences of one child in each of 30 families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweducation.com/PhDabstractsummary.html A Longitudinal Study of Early Literacy Development and the Changing Perceptions of Parents and Teachers], Dr John Worthington, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers may also observe ways that development varies between individuals, and hypothesize about the causes of variation in their data. Longitudinal studies often require large amounts of time and funding, making them unfeasible in some situations. Also, because members of a cohort all experience historical events unique to their generation, apparently normative developmental trends may, in fact, be universal only to their cohort.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|40}}

In a [[cross-sectional study]], a researcher observes differences between individuals of different ages at the same time. This generally requires fewer resources than the longitudinal method, and because the individuals come from different cohorts, shared historical events are not so much of a [[lurking variable|confounding factor]]. By the same token, however, cross-sectional research may not be the most effective way to study differences between participants, as these differences may result not from their different ages but from their exposure to ''different'' historical events.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|41}}

A third study design, the [[cohort study|sequential design]], combines both methodologies. Here, a researcher observes members of different birth cohorts at the same time, and then tracks all participants over time, charting changes in the groups. While much more resource-intensive, the format aids in a clearer distinction between what changes can be attributed to an individual or historical environment from those that are truly universal.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|42}}

Because every method has some weaknesses, developmental psychologists rarely rely on one study or even one method to reach conclusions by finding consistent evidence from as many converging sources as possible.&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt;

==Life stages of psychological development==
&lt;!--THIS SECTION NEEDS WORK!--&gt;
{{See also|Child development stages}}

===Prenatal development===
{{Main|Prenatal development}}
{{See also|Fetal psychology}}
Prenatal development is of interest to psychologists investigating the context of early psychological development. The whole prenatal development involves three main stages: germinal stage, embryonic stage and fetal stage. Germinal stage begins at conception until 2 weeks; embryonic stage means the development from 2 weeks to 8 weeks; fetal stage represents 9 weeks until birth of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=K|last=Cherry|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/developmentalpsychology/a/prenataldevelop.htm|title=Stages of Prenatal Development|website=About Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016}} The senses develop in the womb itself: a fetus can both see and hear by the second trimester (13 to 24 weeks of age). The sense of touch develops in the embryonic stage (5 to 8 weeks).&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|97}} Most of the brain's billions of neurons also are developed by the second trimester.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|100}} Babies are hence born with some odor, taste and sound preferences, largely related to the mother's environment.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|101}}

Some [[primitive reflexes]] too arise before birth and are still present in newborns. One hypothesis is that these reflexes are vestigial and have limited use in early human life. [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]] suggested that some early reflexes are building blocks for infant sensorimotor development. For example, the [[tonic neck reflex]] may help development by bringing objects into the infant's field of view.&lt;ref name="butterworth"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Butterworth |first=G. |author2=Harris, M. |title=Principles of Developmental Psychology |year=1994 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=0-86377-280-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reflexes, such as the [[walking reflex]] appear to be replaced by more sophisticated voluntary control later in infancy. This may be because the infant gains too much weight after birth to be strong enough to use the reflex, or because the reflex and subsequent development are functionally different.&lt;ref name="bremner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bremner |first=J.G. |title=Infancy |year=1994 |publisher=Blackwell |edition=2 |isbn=0-631-18466-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that some reflexes (for example the [[moro reflex|moro]] and [[walking reflex]]es) are predominantly adaptations to life in the womb with little connection to early infant development.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt;  Primitive reflexes reappear in adults under certain conditions, such as neurological conditions like [[dementia]] or traumatic lesions.

[[Ultrasound]] has shown that infants are capable of a range of movements in the womb, many of which appear to be more than simple reflexes.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt; By the time they are born, infants can recognize and have a preference for their mother's voice suggesting some prenatal development of auditory perception.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt; Prenatal development and birth complications may also be connected to neurodevelopmental disorders, for example in [[schizophrenia]]. With the advent of [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[embryology]] and the neuroscience of prenatal development is of increasing interest to developmental psychology research.

Several environmental agents—[[teratogens]]—can cause damage during the prenatal period. These include prescription and nonprescription drugs, illegal drugs, tobacco, alcohol, environmental pollutants, infectious disease agents such as the [[rubella]] virus and the [[toxoplasmosis]] parasite, maternal malnutrition, maternal emotional stress, and Rh factor blood incompatibility between mother and child.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|102–115}} There are many statistics which prove the effects of the aforementioned substances. A leading example of this would be that, in America alone, approximately 100,000-375,000 'cocaine babies' are born on an annual basis. This is a result of an expectant mother abusing the drug while pregnant. 'Cocaine babies' are proven to have quite severe and lasting difficulties which persist throughout infancy and right throughout childhood. The drug also encourages behavioural problems in the affected children, as well as defects of various vital organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=One of five expectant mothers use cocaine, U.S. study finds|author=AP|work=Toronto star
|issn=0319-0781|date=1989-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infancy===
{{Main|Infant and child psychology|Infant cognitive development}}
From birth until the first year, the child is referred to as an [[infant]].&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt; Developmental psychologists vary widely in their assessment of infant psychology, and the influence the outside world has upon it, but certain aspects are relatively clear.

The majority of a newborn infant's time is spent in sleep. At first, this sleep is evenly spread throughout the day and night, but after a couple of months, infants generally become [[diurnal animal|diurnal]].

Infants can be seen to have six states, grouped into pairs:
* quiet sleep and active sleep ([[dream]]ing, when [[REM sleep]] occurs)
* quiet waking, and active waking
* fussing and [[crying]]

====Infant perception====
Infant perception is what a newborn can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.  These five features are better known as one's "five senses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bee |first=Denise Boyd, Helen |title=The developing child |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=978-0-205-25602-0 |page=36 |edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants respond to stimuli differently in these different states.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt;

* [[Visual perception|Vision]] is significantly worse in infants than in older children. Infant sight tends to be blurry in early stages but improves over time. Color perception similar to that seen in adults has been demonstrated in infants as young as four months, using habituation methods.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt; Infants get to adult-like vision in about six months.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|191}}
* [[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is well-developed prior to birth, unlike vision. Newborns prefer complex sounds to pure tones, human speech to other sounds, mother's voice to other voices, and the native language to other languages. Scientist believe these features are probably learned in the womb.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|151}} Infants are fairly good at detecting the direction a sound comes from, and by 18 months their hearing ability is approximately equal to an adult's.
* [[Olfaction|Smell]] and [[taste]] are present, with infants showing different expressions of disgust or pleasure when presented with pleasant odors (honey, milk, etc.) or unpleasant odors (rotten egg) and tastes (e.g. sour taste). Newborns are born with odor and taste preferences acquired in the womb from the smell and taste of amniotic fluid, in turn influenced by what the mother eats. Both breast- and bottle-fed babies around 3 days old prefer the smell of human milk to that of formula, indicating an innate preference.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|150}} There is good evidence for older infants preferring the smell of their mother to that of others.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt;

====Language====
{{Main|Language development}}
Babies are born with the ability to discriminate virtually all sounds of all human languages.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|189}} Infants of around six months can differentiate between [[phoneme]]s in their own language, but not between similar phonemes in another language. At this stage infants also start to [[Babbling|babble]], producing phonemes.

====Infant cognition: the Piagetian era====
Piaget suggested that an infant's perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor development, which was required for the infant to link visual, tactile and motor representations of objects.&lt;ref&gt;Lefmann, T. &amp; Combs-Orme, T. 2013, "Early Brain Development for Social Work Practice: Integrating Neuroscience with Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development", Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, vol. 23, no. 5, pp. 640-647.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, it is through touching and handling objects that infants develop [[object permanence]], the understanding that objects are solid, permanent, and continue to exist when out of sight.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt;

[[File:Baby.jpg|thumb|200px|Special methods are used in the psychological study of infants.]]
Piaget's sensorimotor stage comprised six sub-stages (see [[Theory of cognitive development#Sensorimotor period|sensorimotor stages]] for more detail). In the early stages, development arises out of movements caused by [[primitive reflexes]].&lt;ref name="Gruber"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Piaget |first=J. |year=1977 |title=The essential Piaget |editor-first=H.E. |editor-last=Gruber |editor2-first=J.J. |editor2-last=Voneche |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-7100-8778-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovery of new behaviors results from [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning]], and the formation of [[habit (psychology)|habits]].&lt;ref name="Gruber" /&gt; From eight months the infant is able to uncover a hidden object but will persevere when the object is moved.

Piaget came to his conclusion that infants lacked a complete understanding of object permanence before 18 months after observing infants' failure before this age to look for an object where it was last seen. Instead, infants continue to look for an object where it was first seen, committing the "[[A-not-B error]]." Some researchers have suggested that before the age of eight to nine months, infants' inability to understand object permanence extends to people, which explains why infants at this age do not cry when their mothers are gone ("Out of sight, out of mind").

====Recent findings in infant cognition====
In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers have developed many new methods of assessing infants' understanding of the world with far more precision and subtlety than Piaget was able to do in his time. Since then, many studies based on these methods suggest that young infants understand far more about the world than first thought.

Based on recent findings, some researchers (such as [[Elizabeth Spelke]] and [[Renee Baillargeon]]) have proposed that an understanding of object permanence is not learned at all, but rather comprises part of the innate cognitive capacities of our species.

Other research has suggested that young infants in their first six months of life may possess an understanding of numerous aspects of the world around them, including:

* an early [[numerical cognition]], that is, an ability to represent number and even compute the outcomes of addition and subtraction operations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wynn |first1=Karen |authorlink1=Karen Wynn |year=1992  |title=Addition and subtraction by human infants |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=358 |issue= 6389|pages=749–750 |publisher= |doi= 10.1038/358749a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v358/n6389/abs/358749a0.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an ability to infer the goals of people in their environment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1998 | title = Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach | url = | journal = Cognition | volume =  69| issue = | pages =  1–34| doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(98)00058-4  | last1 = Woodward | first1 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an ability to engage in simple causal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leslie | first1 = A. | last2 = Keeble | first2 = S. | year = 1987 | title = Do six-month-old infants perceive causality?| url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 265–288 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(87)80006-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical periods of development====
There are [[critical period]]s in infancy and childhood during which development of certain perceptual, sensorimotor, social and language systems depends crucially on environmental stimulation.&lt;ref name="Siegler"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Siegler |first=Robert |year=2006 |title=How Children Develop, Exploring Child Development Student Media Tool Kit &amp; Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=0-7167-6113-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feral child]]ren such as [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]], deprived of adequate stimulation, fail to acquire important skills and are unable to learn in later childhood. The concept of critical periods is also well-established in [[neurophysiology]], from the work of [[Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel|Wiesel]] among others.

====Developmental delays====
Children with developmental delays (DD) are at heightened risk for developing clinically significant behavioral and emotional difficulties as compared to children with typical development (TD). However, nearly all studies comparing psychopathology in youth with DD employ TD control groups of the same chronological age (CA).This comorbidity of DD and a mental disorder is often referred to as dual diagnosis. Epidemiological studies indicate that 30–50% of youth with DD meet the clinical cutoff for behavioral and emotional problems and/or diagnosable mental disorder. Studies that include comparison samples of children with typical development (TD) highlight the considerable difference in risk for psychopathology, with the relative risk for youth with DD (to youth with TD) ranging from 2.8–4.1 to 1.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Toddler-hood===
{{Main|Toddler}}
Infants shift between ages of one and two to a developmental stage known as toddlerhood. In this stage, an infant's transition into toddlerhood is highlighted through self-awareness, developing maturity in language use, and presence of memory and imagination.

During toddlerhood, babies begin learning how to [[Walking|walk]], talk, and make decisions for themselves. An important characteristic of this age period is the [[Language development|development of language]], where children are learning how to communicate and express their emotions and desires through the use of vocal sounds, babbling, and eventually words.&lt;ref name=Upton&gt;{{cite book|last=Upton|first=Penney|title=Developmental Psychology: Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Learning Matters|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85725-276-3|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-control also begins to develop. At this age, children take initiative to explore, experiment and learn from making mistakes. Caretakers who encourage toddlers to try new things and test their limits, help the child become autonomous, self-reliant, and confident.&lt;ref name=ToddlerPlay&gt;{{cite book|last=Massi|first=Wendy S.|title=Toddler Play|year=2001|publisher=Creative Pub. international|isbn=0-86573-435-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the caretaker is overprotective or disapproving of independent actions, the toddler may begin to doubt their abilities and feel ashamed of the desire for independence. The child's autonomic development is inhibited, leaving them less prepared to deal with the world in the future. Toddlers also begin to identify themselves in [[gender role]]s, acting according to their perception of what a man or woman should do.&lt;ref name=UPton&gt;{{cite book|last=Upton|first=Penney|title=Developmental Psychology: Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Learning Matters|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85725-276-3|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socially, the period of toddler-hood is commonly called the "terrible twos".&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Barbara M.|title=Development Through Life : A Psychosocial Approach|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=1-111-34468-X|pages=215–217|author2=Newman, P. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toddlers often use their new-found language abilities to voice their desires, but are often misunderstood by parents due to their language skills just beginning to develop.  A person at this stage testing their independence is another reason behind the stage's infamous label. Tantrums in a fit of frustration are also common.

===Childhood===
{{See also|Early childhood}}
[[Erik Erikson]] divides childhood into four stages, each with its distinct social crisis:&lt;ref name="Bernardo J. Carducci 2009"&gt;Bernardo J. Carducci, ''The Psychology of Personality: Viewpoints, Research, and Applications'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009), 189.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Stage 1: [[Infancy]] (0 to 1½) in which the psychosocial crisis is Trust vs. Mistrust
:* Stage 2: Early childhood (2½ to 3) in which the psychosocial crisis is Autonomy vs. Shame and doubt
:* Stage 3: Play age (3 to 5) in which the psychosocial crisis is Initiative vs. Guilt. (This stage is also called the "pre-school age," "exploratory age" and "toy age."&lt;ref&gt;Vardhaman I.Q. Toys, "Vision," http://www.vardhamaniqtoys.com/vision.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;)
:* Stage 4: School age (5 to 12) in which the psychosocial crisis is Industry vs. Inferiority

'''Play (or preschool) ages 3–5.'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the earliest years, children are "completely dependent on the care of others." Therefore, they develop a "social relationship" with their care givers and, later, with family members. During their preschool years (3-5), they "enlarge their social horizons" to include people outside the family.&lt;ref&gt;Arland Thornton, ''The Well-being of Children and Families: Research and Data Needs'' (University of Michigan Press, 2001), 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive development#Preoperational stage|Preoperational]] and then [[Cognitive development#Concrete operational stage|operational]] thinking develops, which means actions are reversible, and egocentric thought diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Lightfoot, Michael Cole, Sheila R. Cole, ''The Development of Children'' (Macmillan, 2008), 275-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The motor skills of preschoolers increase so they can do more things for themselves. They become more independent. No longer completely dependent on the care of others, the world of this age group expands. More people have a role in shaping their individual personalities. Preschoolers explore and question their world.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Preschoolers (3-5 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/preschoolers.html&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Jean Piaget]], the child is "''a little scientist'' exploring and reflecting on these explorations to increase competence" and this is done in "a very independent way."&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Halpenny, Jan Pettersen, ''Introducing Piaget: A Guide for Practitioners and Students in Early Years Education'' (Routledge, 2013), 7, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Play is a major activity for ages 3–5. For Piaget, through play "a child reaches higher levels of cognitive development."&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Halpenny, Jan Pettersen, ''Introducing Piaget: A Guide for Practitioners and Students in Early Years Education'' (Routledge, 2013), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their expanded world, children in the 3-5 age group attempt to find their own way. If this is done in a socially acceptable way, the child develops the initiative. If not, the child develops guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Bob O'Connor, Christine Wells, Trent Applegate, ''Health: You and Your World Volume 1: Brief Edition'' (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2015), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who develop "guilt" rather than "initiative" have failed Erikson's psychosocial crisis for the 3-5 age group.

'''Middle childhood ages 6–12.'''&lt;br /&gt;
For Erik Erikson, the psychosocial crisis during middle childhood is Industry vs. Inferiority which, if successfully met, instills a sense of Competency in the child.&lt;ref name="Bernardo J. Carducci 2009" /&gt;

In all cultures, middle childhood is a time for developing "skills that will be needed in their society."&lt;ref name="Barbara Engler 2013"&gt;Barbara Engler, ''Personality Theories, 9th edition'' (Cengage Learning, 2013), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; School offers an arena in which children can gain a view of themselves as "industrious (and worthy)." They are "graded for their school work and often for their industry." They can also develop industry outside of school in sports, games, and doing volunteer work.&lt;ref name="Marc H. Bornstein 2010"&gt;Marc H. Bornstein, Deborah Lowe Vandell, Karen S. Rook, ''Lifespan Development: Infancy Through Adulthood'' (Cengage Learning, 2010), 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who achieve "success in school or games might develop a feeling of competence."

The "peril during this period is that feelings of inadequacy and inferiority will develop.&lt;ref name="Barbara Engler 2013" /&gt; Parents and teachers can "undermine" a child's development by failing to recognize accomplishments or being overly critical of a child's efforts.&lt;ref name="Marc H. Bornstein 2010" /&gt;
Children who are "encouraged and praised" develop a belief in their competence. Lack of encouragement or ability to excel lead to "feelings of inadequacy and inferiority".&lt;ref&gt;Megan Broutian, Milestones, "Your child: early school years (7 to 11 years) stage of development" in ''Your Child's Development'' online at http://behavioralchild.com/milestones/. Accessed October 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control]] (the CDC) divides Middle Childhood into two stages, 6–8 years and 9–11 years, and gives "developmental milestones for each stage."&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle.html and Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (9-11 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle2.html. Both accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Middle Childhood (7-10).''&lt;br /&gt;
Entering elementary school, children in this age group begin to thinks about the future and their "place in the world." Working with other students and wanting their friendship and acceptance become more important. This leads to "more independence from parents and family." As students, they develop the mental and verbal skills "to describe experiences and talk about thoughts and feelings". They become less self-centered and show "more concern for others".&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle.html. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Middle Childhood (9-11).''&lt;br /&gt;
For children ages 9–11 "friendships and peer relationships" increase in strength, complexity, and importance. This results in greater "peer pressure." They grow even less dependent on their families and they are challenged academically. To meet this challenge, they increase their attention span and learn to see other points of view.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle2.html. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
{{Main|Adolescent psychology}}
Adolescence is the period of life between the onset of puberty and the full commitment to an adult social role, such as worker, parent, and/or citizen. It is the period known for the formation of personal and social identity (see [[Erik Erikson]]) and the discovery of moral purpose (see [[William Damon]]). Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts and formal reasoning. A return to [[egocentric]] thought often occurs early in the period. Only 35% develop the capacity to reason formally during adolescence or adulthood. (Huitt, W. and Hummel, J. January 1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~moursund/Math/developmental_theory.htm|title=Developmental Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is divided into three parts, namely:
# Early Adolescence: 9 to 13 years 
# Mid Adolescence: 13 to 15 years and
# Late Adolescence: 15 to 18 years

The adolescent unconsciously explores questions such as "Who am I? Who do I want to be?" Like toddlers, adolescents must explore, test limits, become [[autonomous]], and commit to an [[identity (social science)|identity]], or [[sense of self]]. Different roles, behaviors and [[ideologies]] must be tried out to select an identity. Role confusion and inability to choose vocation can result from a failure to achieve a sense of identity through, for example, friends.

===Early adulthood===
{{Main|Young adult (psychology)}}
Early adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 18 to 25, and according to theorists such as Erik Erikson, is a stage where development is mainly focused on [[Interpersonal relationship|maintaining relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kastenbaum|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Adult Development|year=1993|publisher=Oryx Press|isbn=0-89774-669-4|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include creating bond of intimacy, sustaining friendships, and ultimately making a family. Some theorists state that development of intimacy skills rely on the resolution of previous developmental stages. A sense of identity gained in the previous stages is also necessary for intimacy to develop. If this skill is not learned the alternative is alienation, isolation, a fear of commitment, and the inability to depend on others.

A related framework for studying this part of the lifespan is that of [[emerging adulthood]]. Scholars of emerging adulthood, such as Jeffrey Arnett, are not necessarily interested in relationship development. Instead, this concept suggests that people transition after their teenage years into a period not characterized as relationship building and an overall sense of constancy with life, but with years of living with parents, phases of self-discovery, and experimentation.&lt;ref name=Twenge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Twenge|first=Jean M.|title=Review of emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties|journal=American Journal of Psychology|year=2008|volume=121|issue=4|pages=682–687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle adulthood===
{{Main|Middle age}}
Middle adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 25 to 69. During this period, middle-aged adults experience a conflict between generativity and stagnation. They may either feel a sense of contributing to society, the next generation, or their immediate community; or develop a sense of purposelessness.

Physically, the middle-aged experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, sensory keenness, and cardiac output. Also, women experience [[menopause]] and a sharp drop in the hormone [[estrogen]]. Men experience an equivalent endocrine system event to menopause. [[Andropause]] in males is a hormone fluctuation with physical and psychological effects that can be similar to those seen in menopausal females. As men age lowered testosterone levels can contribute to mood swings and a decline in [[spermatozoa|sperm]] count. Sexual responsiveness can also be affected, including delays in [[erection]] and longer periods of [[penile stimulation]] required to achieve [[ejaculation]].

===Old age===
{{Main|Old age}}

The [[World Health Organization]] finds "no general agreement on the age at which a person becomes old." Most [[Developed country|"developed countries"]] set the age as 60 or 65. However, in [[Developing country|developing countries]] inability to make "active contribution" to society, not chronological age, marks the beginning of old age.&lt;ref&gt;"Definition of an older or elderly person" on World Health Organization website at http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageingdefnolder/en/. Accessed October 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development]], old age is the stage in which individuals assess the quality of their lives. In reflecting on their lives, people in this age group develop a feeling of integrity if deciding that their lives were successful or a feeling of despair if evaluation of one's life indicates a failure to achieve goals.&lt;ref name="Miller2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia R. Miller|title=Encyclopedia of Human Ecology: I-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPcwuEe9MBQC&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=4 December 2012|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-852-5|pages=242–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically, older people experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, stamina, hearing, distance perception, and the sense of smell.&lt;ref name="Deary2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deary | first1 = I.

Sexual expression depends in large part upon the emotional and physical health of the individual. Many older adults continue to be sexually active and satisfied with their sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanchard-Fields|first=John C.

Mental [[wikt:disintegration|disintegration]] may also occur, leading to [[dementia]] or ailments such as [[Alzheimer's disease]]. It is generally believed that [[crystallized intelligence]] increases up to old age, while [[fluid intelligence]] decreases with age.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Linda M.

==Parenting==
Parenting variables alone have typically accounted for 20 to 50 percent of the variance in child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Flaherty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flaherty|first=Serena Cherry|author2=Sadler, Lois S.|title=A Review of Attachment Theory in the Context of Adolescent Parenting|journal=Journal of Pediatric Health Care|date=1 March 2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=114–121|doi=10.1016/j.pedhc.2010.02.005|pmc=3051370|pmid=21320683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All parents have their own parenting styles. Parenting styles, according to [https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/kak33 Kimberly Kopko], are "based upon two aspects of parenting behavior; control and warmth. Parental control refers to the degree to which parents manage their children's behavior. Parental warmth refers to the degree to which parents are accepting and responsive to their children's behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kopoko|first1=Kimberly|title=Parenting Styles and Adolescents|journal=Cornell University Cooperative Extension|date=2007|pages=1–8|url=http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/outreach/parenting/research/upload/Parenting-20Styles-20and-20Adolescents.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parenting styles===
The following [[parenting styles]] have been described in the child development literature:

* Authoritative parenting is characterized as parents who have high parental warmth, responsiveness, and demandingness, but rate low in negativity and conflict.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Lorraine C.|author2=Clayton, Jennifer D. |author3=Rowley, Stephanie J. |title=Academic Socialization: Understanding Parental Influences on Children's School-Related Development in the Early Years.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2004|volume=8|issue=3|pages=163–178|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.8.3.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parents are assertive but not intrusive or overly restrictive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumrind|first=D.|title=The Influence of Parenting Style on Adolescent Competence and Substance Use|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=1 February 1991|volume=11|issue=1|pages=56–95|doi=10.1177/0272431691111004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of parenting is associated with more positive social and academic outcomes. The beneficial outcomes of authoritative parenting are not necessarily universal. Among African American adolescents, authoritative parenting is not associated with academic achievement without peer support for achievement.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; Children who are raised by authoritative parents are "more likely to become independent, self-reliant, socially accepted, academically successful, and well-behaved. They are less likely to report depression and anxiety, and less likely to engage in antisocial behavior like delinquency and drug use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewar PHD|first1=Gwen|title=The authoritative parenting style: Warmth, rationality, and high standards." A guide for the science-minded parent|url=http://www.parentingscience.com/authoritative-parenting-style.html|website=Parenting Science|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Authoritarian parenting is characterized by low levels of warmth and responsiveness with high levels of demandingness and firm control.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; These parents focus on obedience and they monitor their children regularly.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; In general, this style of parenting is associated with maladaptive outcomes.  The outcomes are more harmful for middle class boys than girls, preschool white girls than preschool black girls, and for white boys than Hispanic boys.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; Furthermore, the negative effects of authoritarian parenting among Asian Americans can be offset by positive peer support.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; Finally, among African Americans, some elements of authoritarian parenting such as firm control and physical discipline do not serve as predictive factors for negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt;
* Permissive parenting is characterized by high levels of responsiveness combined with low levels of demandingness.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; These parents are lenient and do not necessarily require mature behavior.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  They allow for a high degree of self-regulation and typically avoid confrontation.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Compared to children raised using the authoritative style, preschool girls raised in permissive families are less assertive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Additionally, preschool children of both sexes are less cognitively competent than those children raised under authoritative parenting styles.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;
* Rejecting or neglectful parenting is the final category. This is characterized by low levels of demandingness and responsiveness. These parents are typically disengaged in their child's lives, lacking structure in their parenting styles and are unsupportive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Children in this category are typically the least competent of all the categories.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;

===Mother and father factors===
Parenting roles in child development have typically focused on the role of the mother. Recent literature, however, has looked toward the father as having an important role in child development.  Affirming a role for fathers, studies have shown that children as young as 15 months benefit significantly from substantial engagement with their father.&lt;ref name="aredos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/2004-3/role.html|title=Fathers' Role in Children's Academic Achievement and Early Literacy. ERIC Digest.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Children with active, involved fathers have better social skills, are healthier, and do better in school", according to Duane Wilson, the Proud Fathers, Proud Parents program coordinator for the Michigan Department of Human Services (http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2125328669291708941 2:57)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a study in the U.S. and New Zealand found the presence of the natural father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Ellis, Child Development May/June 2003, 74:3, pp. 801–21&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, another argument is that neither a mother nor a father is actually essential in successful parenting, and that single parents as well as homosexual couples can support positive child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silverstein|first=Louise|author2=Carl Auerbach|title=Deconstructing the Essential Father|journal=American Psychologist|year=1999|volume=54|pages=397–407|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.397}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this set of research, children need at least one consistently responsible adult with whom the child can have a positive emotional connection. Having more than one of these figures contributes to a higher likelihood of positive child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Silverstein /&gt;

===Divorce===
Another parental factor often debated in terms of its effects on child development is divorce.  Divorce in itself is not a determining factor of negative child outcomes. In fact, the majority of children from divorcing families fall into the normal range on measures of psychological and cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name=Whiteside&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whiteside|first=Mary F.|author2=Becker, Betsy Jane|title=Parental factors and the young child's postdivorce adjustment: A meta-analysis with implications for parenting arrangements.|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|date=1 January 2000|volume=14|issue=1|pages=5–26|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.14.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of mediating factors play a role in determining the effects divorce has on a child, for example, divorcing families with young children often face harsher consequences in terms of demographic, social, and economic changes than do families with older children.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt; Positive coparenting after divorce is part of a pattern associated with positive child coping, while hostile parenting behaviors lead to a destructive pattern leaving children at risk.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt; Additionally, direct parental relationship with the child also affects the development of a child after a divorce.  Overall, protective factors facilitating positive child development after a divorce are maternal warmth, positive father-child relationship, and cooperation between parents.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt;

[[File:CYP2C9 1OG2.png|230px|thumb|[[Cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s are important enzymes in [[xenobiotic]] metabolism.]]
'''Drug metabolism''' is the [[metabolism|metabolic breakdown]] of [[drug]]s by living [[organism]]s, usually through specialized [[enzyme|enzymatic]] systems. More generally, '''xenobiotic metabolism''' (from the Greek [[xenos (Greek)|xenos]] "stranger"  and biotic "related to living beings") is the set of [[metabolic pathway]]s that modify the chemical structure of [[xenobiotic]]s, which are compounds foreign to an organism's normal biochemistry, such as any [[drug]] or [[poison]]. These pathways are a form of [[biotransformation]] present in all major groups of organisms, and are considered to be of ancient origin. These reactions often act to [[detoxification|detoxify]] poisonous compounds (although in some cases the intermediates in xenobiotic metabolism can themselves cause toxic effects). The study of drug metabolism is called [[pharmacokinetics]].

The metabolism of [[pharmaceutical drug]]s is an important aspect of [[pharmacology]] and [[medicine]]. For example, the rate of metabolism determines the duration and intensity of a drug's pharmacologic action. Drug metabolism also affects [[multidrug resistance]] in [[infectious disease]]s and in [[chemotherapy]] for [[cancer]], and the actions of some drugs as [[substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are a common reason for hazardous [[drug interaction]]s. These pathways are also important in [[environmental science]], with the xenobiotic metabolism of [[microorganism]]s determining whether a pollutant will be broken down during [[bioremediation]], or [[persistent organic pollutant|persist]] in the environment. The enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism, particularly the [[glutathione S-transferase]]s are also important in agriculture, since they may produce resistance to [[pesticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s.

Drug metabolism is divided into three phases. In phase I, enzymes such as [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s introduce reactive or polar groups into xenobiotics. These modified compounds are then conjugated to polar compounds in phase II reactions. These reactions are catalysed by [[transferase]] enzymes such as [[glutathione S-transferase]]s. Finally, in phase III, the conjugated xenobiotics may be further processed, before being recognised by [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux transporters]] and pumped out of cells. Drug metabolism often converts [[lipophilic]] compounds into [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] products that are more readily [[excretion|excreted]].

== Permeability barriers and detoxification ==

The exact compounds an organism is exposed to will be largely unpredictable, and may differ widely over time; these are major characteristics of xenobiotic toxic stress.&lt;ref name=Jakoby/&gt; The major challenge faced by xenobiotic detoxification systems is that they must be able to remove the almost-limitless number of xenobiotic compounds from the complex mixture of chemicals involved in normal [[metabolism]]. The solution that has evolved to address this problem is an elegant combination of physical barriers and low-specificity [[enzyme|enzymatic]] systems.

All organisms use [[cell membrane]]s as hydrophobic permeability barriers to control access to their internal environment. Polar compounds cannot diffuse across these [[cell membrane]]s, and the uptake of useful molecules is mediated through [[transport protein]]s that specifically select substrates from the extracellular mixture. This selective uptake means that most [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] molecules cannot enter cells, since they are not recognised by any specific transporters.&lt;ref name="pmid12869659"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mizuno N, Niwa T, Yotsumoto Y, Sugiyama Y | title = Impact of drug transporter studies on drug discovery and development | journal = Pharmacol. Rev. | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 425–61 |date=September 2003 | pmid = 12869659 | doi = 10.1124/pr.55.3.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the diffusion of [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] compounds across these barriers cannot be controlled, and organisms, therefore, cannot exclude [[lipid]]-soluble xenobiotics using membrane barriers.

However, the existence of a permeability barrier means that organisms were able to evolve detoxification systems that exploit the hydrophobicity common to membrane-permeable xenobiotics. These systems therefore solve the specificity problem by possessing such broad substrate specificities that they metabolise almost any non-polar compound.&lt;ref name=Jakoby/&gt; Useful metabolites are excluded since they are polar, and in general contain one or more charged groups.

The detoxification of the reactive by-products of normal metabolism cannot be achieved by the systems outlined above, because these species are derived from normal cellular constituents and usually share their polar characteristics. However, since these compounds are few in number, specific enzymes can recognize and remove them. Examples of these specific detoxification systems are the [[glyoxalase system]], which removes the reactive [[aldehyde]] methylglyoxal,&lt;ref name="pmid2198020"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thornalley PJ | title = The glyoxalase system: new developments towards functional characterization of a metabolic pathway fundamental to biological life | journal = Biochem.

== {{anchor|Phases}} Phases of detoxification ==

[[File:Xenobiotic metabolism.png|thumb|350px|right|Phases I and II of the metabolism of a lipophilic xenobiotic.]]
The metabolism of xenobiotics is often divided into three phases:- modification, conjugation, and excretion. These reactions act in concert to detoxify xenobiotics and remove them from cells.

=== Phase I – modification ===

In phase I, a variety of enzymes act to introduce reactive and polar groups into their substrates. One of the most common modifications is hydroxylation catalysed by the [[cytochrome P450|cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed-function oxidase system]]. These enzyme complexes act to incorporate an atom of oxygen into nonactivated hydrocarbons, which can result in either the introduction of hydroxyl groups or N-, O- and S-dealkylation of substrates.&lt;ref name="pmid11409933"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guengerich FP | title = Common and uncommon cytochrome P450 reactions related to metabolism and chemical toxicity | journal = Chem. Res. Toxicol. | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 611–50 |date=June 2001 | pmid = 11409933 | doi = 10.1021/tx0002583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction mechanism of the P-450 oxidases proceeds through the reduction of cytochrome-bound oxygen and the generation of a highly-reactive oxyferryl species, according to the following scheme:&lt;ref name="pmid10698731"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schlichting I, Berendzen J, Chu K, Stock AM, Maves SA, Benson DE, Sweet RM, Ringe D, Petsko GA, Sligar SG | title = The catalytic pathway of cytochrome p450cam at atomic resolution | journal = Science | volume = 287 | issue = 5458 | pages = 1615–22 |date=March 2000 | pmid = 10698731 | doi = 10.1126/science.287.5458.1615 | bibcode = 2000Sci...287.1615S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NADPH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + RH → NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ROH

Phase I reactions (also termed nonsynthetic reactions) may occur by [[oxidation]], [[Redox|reduction]], [[hydrolysis]], [[cyclization]], [[decyclization]], and addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen, carried out by mixed function oxidases, often in the liver. These oxidative reactions typically involve a [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] monooxygenase (often abbreviated CYP), NADPH and oxygen. The classes of pharmaceutical drugs that utilize this method for their metabolism include [[phenothiazine]]s, [[Paracetamol#Metabolism|paracetamol]], and steroids. If the metabolites of phase I reactions are sufficiently polar, they may be readily excreted at this point. However, many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an [[endogenous]] [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly [[polar conjugate]].

A common Phase I oxidation involves conversion of a C-H bond to a C-OH. This reaction sometimes converts a pharmacologically inactive compound (a [[prodrug]]) to a pharmacologically active one. By the same token, Phase I can turn a nontoxic molecule into a poisonous one ([[toxification]]). Simple hydrolysis in the stomach is normally an innocuous reaction, however there are exceptions. For example, phase I metabolism converts [[acetonitrile]] to HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN, which rapidly dissociates into [[formaldehyde]] and [[hydrogen cyanide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc154.htm|title=Acetonitrile (EHC 154, 1993)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase I metabolism of drug candidates can be simulated in the laboratory using non-enzyme catalysts.&lt;ref name="pmid19039354"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akagah B, Lormier AT, Fournet A, Figadère B | title = Oxidation of antiparasitic 2-substituted quinolines using metalloporphyrin catalysts: scale-up of a biomimetic reaction for metabolite production of drug candidates | journal = Org. Biomol. Chem. | volume = 6 | issue = 24 | pages = 4494–7 |date=December 2008 | pmid = 19039354 | doi = 10.1039/b815963g }}&lt;/ref&gt; This example of a [[biomimetic]] reaction tends to give products that often contains the Phase I metabolites. As an example, the major metabolite of the pharmaceutical [[trimebutine]], desmethyltrimebutine (nor-trimebutine), can be efficiently produced by in vitro oxidation of the commercially available drug.  Hydroxylation of an N-methyl group leads to expulsion of a molecule of [[formaldehyde]], while oxidation of the O-methyl groups takes place to a lesser extent.

==== Oxidation ====

* [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system]]
* [[Flavin-containing monooxygenase system]]
* [[Alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]]
* [[Monoamine oxidase]]
* Co-oxidation by [[peroxidase]]s

==== Reduction ====

* [[Cytochrome P450 reductase|NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase]]
Cytochrome P450 reductase, also known as NADPH:ferrihemoprotein oxidoreductase, NADPH:hemoprotein oxidoreductase, NADPH:P450 oxidoreductase, P450 reductase, POR, CPR, CYPOR, is a membrane-bound enzyme required for electron transfer to cytochrome P450 in the microsome of the eukaryotic cell from a FAD- and FMN-containing enzyme NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase
The general scheme of electron flow in the POR/P450 system is:
NADPH	
→
FAD
→
FMN
→
P450
→
O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Cytochrome P450 reductase|Reduced (ferrous) cytochrome P450]]

During reduction reactions, a chemical can enter ''futile cycling'', in which it gains a free-radical electron, then promptly loses it to [[oxygen]] (to form a [[superoxide anion]]).

==== Hydrolysis ====

* [[Esterase]]s and [[amidase]]
* [[Epoxide hydrolase]]

=== Phase II – conjugation {{anchor|Conjugation}} ===

In subsequent phase II reactions, these activated xenobiotic metabolites are [[Biotransformation#Phase .D0.86 reaction|conjugated]] with charged species such as [[glutathione]] (GSH), [[sulfate]], [[glycine]], or [[glucuronic acid]]. Sites on drugs where conjugation reactions occur include [[carboxyl]] (-COOH), [[hydroxyl]] (-OH), [[amino]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[sulfhydryl]] (-SH) groups. Products of conjugation reactions have increased  molecular weight and tend to be less active than their substrates, unlike Phase I reactions which often produce [[active metabolites]]. The addition of large anionic groups (such as GSH) detoxifies reactive [[electrophile]]s and produces more polar metabolites that cannot diffuse across membranes, and may, therefore, be actively transported.

These reactions are catalysed by a large group of broad-specificity transferases, which in combination can metabolise almost any hydrophobic compound that contains nucleophilic or electrophilic groups.&lt;ref name=Jakoby&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jakoby WB, Ziegler DM | title = The enzymes of detoxication | journal = J.

=== Phase III – further modification and excretion ===

After phase II reactions, the xenobiotic conjugates may be further metabolised. A common example is the processing of glutathione conjugates to [[acetylcysteine]] (mercapturic acid) conjugates.&lt;ref name="pmid4892500"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyland E, Chasseaud LF | title = The role of glutathione and glutathione S-transferases in mercapturic acid biosynthesis | journal = Adv.

Conjugates and their metabolites can be excreted from cells in phase III of their metabolism, with the anionic groups acting as affinity tags for a variety of membrane transporters of the [[P-glycoprotein|multidrug resistance protein]] (MRP) family.&lt;ref name="pmid12897433"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Homolya L, Váradi A, Sarkadi B | title = Multidrug resistance-associated proteins: Export pumps for conjugates with glutathione, glucuronate or sulfate | journal = BioFactors | volume = 17 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 103–14 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12897433 | doi = 10.1002/biof.5520170111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins are members of the family of [[ATP-binding cassette transporter]]s and can catalyse the ATP-dependent transport of a huge variety of hydrophobic anions,&lt;ref name="pmid10581368"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=König J, Nies AT, Cui Y, Leier I, Keppler D | title = Conjugate export pumps of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family: localization, substrate specificity, and MRP2-mediated drug resistance | journal = Biochim.

== Endogenous toxins ==

The detoxification of endogenous reactive metabolites such as [[peroxide]]s and reactive [[aldehyde]]s often cannot be achieved by the system described above. This is the result of these species' being derived from normal cellular constituents and usually sharing their polar characteristics. However, since these compounds are few in number, it is possible for enzymatic systems to utilize specific molecular recognition to recognize and remove them. The similarity of these molecules to useful metabolites therefore means that different detoxification enzymes are usually required for the metabolism of each group of endogenous toxins. Examples of these specific detoxification systems are the [[glyoxalase system]], which acts to dispose of the reactive aldehyde [[methylglyoxal]], and the various [[antioxidant]] systems that remove [[reactive oxygen species]].

== Sites ==

Quantitatively, the [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] of the [[liver]] cell is the principal organ of drug metabolism, although every [[biological tissue]] has some ability to metabolize drugs.
Factors responsible for the liver's contribution to drug metabolism include that it is a large organ, that it is the first organ perfused by chemicals absorbed in the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]], and that there are very high concentrations of most drug-metabolizing enzyme systems relative to other organs.
If a drug is taken into the GI tract, where it enters hepatic circulation through the portal vein, it becomes well-metabolized and is said to show the ''[[first pass effect]]''.

Other sites of drug metabolism include [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], [[lung]]s, [[kidney]]s, and the [[skin]].
These sites are usually responsible for localized toxicity reactions.

== Factors that affect drug metabolism ==

The duration and intensity of pharmacological action of most lipophilic drugs are determined by the rate they are metabolized to inactive products.
The [[Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system]] is the most important pathway in this regard.
In general, anything that ''increases'' the rate of metabolism (''e.g.'', [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|enzyme induction]]) of a pharmacologically active metabolite will ''decrease'' the duration and intensity of the drug action.
The opposite is also true (''e.g.'', [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|enzyme inhibition]]). However, in cases where an enzyme is responsible for metabolizing a pro-drug into a drug, enzyme induction can speed up this conversion and increase drug levels, potentially causing toxicity.

Various ''physiological'' and ''pathological'' factors can also affect drug metabolism.
Physiological factors that can influence drug metabolism include age, individual variation (''e.g.'', [[pharmacogenetics]]), [[enterohepatic circulation]], [[nutrition]], [[intestinal flora]], or [[sex difference]]s.

In general, drugs are metabolized more slowly in [[fetal]], [[neonatal]] and [[elderly]] [[human]]s and [[animal]]s than in [[adult]]s.

Genetic variation ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) accounts for some of the variability in the effect of drugs.
With N-acetyltransferases (involved in ''Phase II'' reactions), individual variation creates a group of people who acetylate slowly (''slow acetylators'') and those who acetylate quickly, split roughly 50:50 in the population of [[Canada]].
This variation may have dramatic consequences, as the [[slow acetylators]] are more prone to dose-dependent toxicity.

[[Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system]] enzymes can also vary across individuals, with deficiencies occurring in 1 – 30% of people, depending on their ethnic background.

Dose, frequency, route of administration, tissue distribution and protein binding of the drug affect its metabolism.

''Pathological factors'' can also influence drug metabolism, including [[liver]], [[kidney]], or [[heart]] diseases.

''In silico'' modelling and simulation methods allow drug metabolism to be predicted in virtual patient populations prior to performing clinical studies in human subjects.&lt;ref name="pmid17268485"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rostami-Hodjegan A, Tucker GT | title = Simulation and prediction of in vivo drug metabolism in human populations from ''in vitro'' data | journal = Nat Rev Drug Discov | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 140–8 |date=February 2007 | pmid = 17268485 | doi = 10.1038/nrd2173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be used to identify individuals most at risk from adverse reaction.

== History ==

Studies on how people transform the substances that they ingest began in the mid-nineteenth century, with chemists discovering that organic chemicals such as [[benzaldehyde]] could be oxidized and conjugated to amino acids in the human body.&lt;ref name="pmid11353742"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Murphy PJ | title = Xenobiotic metabolism: a look from the past to the future | journal = Drug Metab.

In the early twentieth century, work moved on to the investigation of the enzymes and pathways that were responsible for the production of these metabolites. This field became defined as a separate area of study with the publication by [[Richard Tecwyn Williams|Richard Williams]] of the book ''Detoxication mechanisms'' in 1947.&lt;ref name="pmid6347595"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Neuberger A, Smith RL | title = Richard Tecwyn Williams: the man, his work, his impact | journal = Drug Metab.

Some [[North America]]n [[university|universities]] are home to [[academic degree|degree]] programs titled '''Ecology and Evolutionary Biology''', offering integrated studies in the [[academic discipline|disciplines]] of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. The wording is intended as representing the alternative approach from the frequently used pairing of '''Cell and Molecular Biology''', while being more inclusive than the terminology of [[Botany]] or [[Zoology]].  Recently, due to advances in the fields of [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], research and education in ecology and evolutionary biology has integrated many molecular techniques.

A program that focuses on the relationships and interactions that range across levels of biological organization based on a scientific study is Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  The origins and history of ecosystems, species, genes and genomes, and organisms, and how these have changed over time is all part of the studies of how biodiversity has evolved and how it takes place.  Ecology and Evolutionary biology in North America is based on research impact determined by the top 10% of ecology programs.  The interactive web of organisms and environment are all part of what the field of Ecology explores.  There have been studies in evolution that have worked to prove that "modern organisms have developed from ancestral ones." The reason that evolutionary biology is so interesting to learn about is because of the evolutionary processes that is the reason we have such a diversity of life on Earth.There are many processes that make up evolutionary biology that give great insight to how we came to be, some of which include natural selection, speciation, and common descent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">The '''economics of scientific knowledge''' ('''ESK''') is an approach to understanding science which is predicated on the need to understand scientific knowledge creation and dissemination in economic terms.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

The approach has been developed as a contrast to the [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK)]] which places scientists in their social context and examines their behavior using social theory. ESK typically involves thinking of scientists as having economic interests with these being thought of as utility maximisation and science as being a market process. Modelling strategies might use any of a variety of approaches including the neoclasscial, game theoretic, behavioural (bounded rationality) information theoretic and transaction costs. Boumans and Davis (2010) mention [[Partha Dasgupta|Dasgupta]] and [[Paul A. David|David]] (1994) as being an interesting early example of work in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Boumans, M. and Davis, John B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">In [[applied linguistics]], an '''error''' is a deviation from accepted rules of a language made by a learner of a second language. Such errors result from the learner's lack of knowledge of correct rules of the target language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Rod |authorlink=Rod Ellis |title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KglibyrZ5sC&amp;pg=PA700 |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn= 0-19-437189-1 |page=700}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant distinction is generally made between ''errors'' and ''mistakes'' which are not treated the same from a linguistic viewpoint. The study of learners' errors was the main area of investigation by linguists in the history of [[second-language acquisition]] research.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
[[H. Douglas Brown]] has defined linguistic errors as "a noticeable deviation from the adult grammar of a native speaker, reflecting the interlanguage competence of the learner." He cites an example ''Does John can sing?'' where a preceding ''do'' auxiliary verb has been used as an error.&lt;ref name=Brown205&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=H. Douglas |title=Principles of Language Learning and Teaching |url=|accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall Regents]] |location=[[New Jersey]] |isbn= 0-13-191966-0 |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between error and mistake==
In linguistics, it is considered important to distinguish errors from mistakes. A distinction is always made between errors and mistakes where the former is defined as resulting from a learner's lack of proper grammatical knowledge, whilst the latter as a failure to utilize a known system correctly.&lt;ref name=Brown205/&gt; Brown terms these mistakes as performance errors. Mistakes of this kind are frequently made by both native speakers and second language learners. However, native speakers are generally able to correct themselves quickly. Such mistakes include slips of the tongue and random ungrammatical formations. On the other hand, errors are systematic in that they occur repeatedly and are not recognizable by the learner. They are a part of the learner's interlanguage, and the learner does not generally consider them as errors. They are ''errors'' only from the perspective of teachers and others who are aware that the learner has deviated from a grammatical norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gass|first1= Susan M.|last2=Selinker |first2=Larry |title=Second Language Acquisition: An Introductory Course |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhnbMj597-4C&amp;pg=PA102 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 0203932846|pages=102–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, mistakes can be self-corrected with or without being pointed out to the speaker but errors cannot be self-corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nika Purwati |title=Research in English and Applied Linguistics (REAL) Vol 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcFge3z0sqkC&amp;pg=PA307 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 6029126237|page=307|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of error ==
S. Pit Corder was probably the first to point out and discuss the importance of errors learners make in course of their learning a second language. Soon after, the study and analysis of learners’ errors took a prominent place in applied linguistics. Brown suggests that the process of second language learning is not very different from learning a first language, and the feedback a L2 learner gets upon making errors benefits him in developing the L2 knowledge.&lt;ref name=Brown205/&gt;

'''Ethical extensionism''' is an [[argument]] in [[environmental ethics]] that [[moral standing]] ought to be extended to things (animals, plants, species, the earth) that traditionally are not thought of as having moral standing.

For example, while many cultures differ as to what, exactly, is "[[murder]]", all cultures take it as wrong to commit murder. An example of ethical extensionism would be to extend to dogs or cats the status of being something that can be murdered, so that it would be wrong under some circumstances to kill a dog or cat.

On the one hand, ethical extensionism is a broadening of the class of things to which humans may owe an ethical duty.

But Des Jardins makes the point that most ethical extensionism has been merely broadening the ethical sphere incrementally, a process not agreeable to some environmental ethicists who would prefer more of a total replacement of traditional [[ethics]] with an entirely new approach. So, while ethical extensionism can, in principle, broaden the sphere of ethical standing to any arbitrary limits, the extensionist approach is seen by more recent ethical theorists as being inadequate.

'''Folk economics''' is the intuitive [[economics]] of [[Training|untrained]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubin |first=Paul H. |title=Folk Economics |journal=Southern Economic Journal |date=July 2003 |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=157–171 |jstor=1061637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is derived from the evolutionary basis for human intelligence.  In the evolutionary environment, life was static; there was essentially no economic growth and no innovation.  Moreover, there was relatively little specialization (except by age and gender) and the economy was simple.  Thus, our brains evolved to understand this sort of economy.  While there were many implications of such an economy,one of the most important is that we evolved to be zero-sum thinkers.  that is, when faced with an economic issue our natural tendency is to view it in zero-sum terms.  This leads to fallacies such as dislike of international trade and immigration.  Indeed, zero-sum thinking is probably the most important source of inefficient economic policies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7013">'''Folk linguistics''' is the [[amateur]] study of [[linguistics]]. The term is often used as a [[pejorative]].

The [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Ray Jackendoff]] points out that applying folk linguistics to education can be potentially damaging to the attainment of students who speak [[less standard dialect]]s. Characterising different speech as ''good'' or ''bad'' can have a serious effect.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}

The term ''folk linguistics'' can also refer to [[ideological]]&lt;ref name=BerGr&gt;{{cite book|last=Gröschel |first=Bernhard| authorlink=Bernhard Gröschel |year=2009  |language=German |title=Das Serbokroatische zwischen Linguistik und Politik: mit einer Bibliographie zum postjugoslavischen Sprachenstreit |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Between Linguistics and Politics: With a Bibliography of the Post-Yugoslav Language Dispute |series=Lincom Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; vol 34 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |pages=147, 312–329 |isbn=978-3-929075-79-3 |oclc=428012015 |lccn=2009473660 |ol=15295665W}}&lt;/ref&gt; ideas of language, such as [[nationalist]]&lt;ref name=KordiJin&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |year=2010 |language=Serbo-Croatian |title=Jezik i nacionalizam |trans-title=Language and Nationalism |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf |deadurl=no |series=Rotulus Universitas |location=Zagreb |publisher=Durieux |pages=116–119 |isbn=978-953-188-311-5 |lccn=2011520778 |oclc=729837512 |ol=15270636W |archivedate=8 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690BiBe4T?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; views of language. The scientific understanding of language by linguists often contradicts that of native speakers.&lt;ref name=BerGr/&gt;&lt;ref name=KordiJin/&gt;

==Examples==
{{see also|List of common misconceptions about language learning}}

Jackendoff (2003){{Ref label|a|a|none}} cites the following statements as typical examples of folk-linguistic beliefs.

* Claim: "Parents teach their children to talk". Adults assume that children either learn language directly from their parents or via simple [[imitation]]. 
** On the contrary, research in child [[language acquisition]] shows that a child acquires language more automatically, through a systematic pattern rarely noticed by adults. Although interaction with parents, adults and other children is crucial, it is actually very difficult to "correct" a child. Instead most children are able to learn to speak native languages (including those of their peers of the same age) through a process called "acquisition".{{Ref label|b|b|none}} Any [[speech error|error]]s noticed by a parent are often self-corrected by the child weeks or months later.
* Claim: "Children will get confused if they try to speak more than one language". Many parents are afraid a child cannot sort out input from multiple languages. 
** In reality, children can easily become [[simultaneous bilingualism|bilingual]] (native proficiency in two languages) if they are exposed to more than one language. There may be period of confusion, but most children are able to segregate two distinct grammars.
* Claim: "There is a proper, correct English".  Speakers generally value an educated form of the language, often its written form, and that other [[dialect]]al/spoken forms are considered structurally inferior or "sloppy", and speakers of these forms are often regarded as "stupid, lazy, sloppy, hick" or other pejorative terms.  
** However, linguists generally agree that dialectal forms such as [[AAVE|African American Vernacular English (AAVE)]]  have the same grammatical complexity as a standard English. Folk linguistic beliefs view these forms as inferior, and as a result speakers of non-standard forms often suffer forms of linguistic discrimination.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}
* Claim: "The modern language is going downhill". [[linguistic purism|Purist]]s opine that changes in the spoken language (e.g. [[new word]]s, innovations in grammar, new pronunciation patterns) are generally regarded as being detrimental rather than just change.
** In fact, living languages are not static. Their evolution is not just a modern phenomenon.

Other beliefs may include:
* A belief that a language's grammar can negatively influence and restrict how people think. This is also known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis|strong Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]. Although some linguists do advocate a form of this, many linguists reject this as being too simplistic.{{Ref label|b|b|none}} For instance, just because a language does not formally distinguish "he" vs. "she" in their personal pronouns does not mean that speakers do not distinguish and treat men and women differently. Similarly, just because English lacks a formal [[hodiernal tense]] does not mean that English speakers cannot distinguish events which occur "today" versus those on another day.
* Examples of [[folk etymology]] such as interpreting ''[[asparagus]]'' as "sparrow-grass".{{Ref label|b|b|none}} These are cases where speakers deduce an incorrect word origin. Another folk etymology is the assumption that the New York place name ''[[Fishkill, New York|Fishkill]]'' (on [[Fishkill Creek]]) means a place to kill fish. In reality, ''[[kill (creek)|-kill]]'' is from a Dutch word meaning "creek" (found also in river names such as [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill, Pennsylvania]] and [[Wallkill River|Wallkill, New Jersey]]). However the folk etymology caused animal rights groups such as [[PETA]] to demand that the town should be renamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A fishy name will stay the same|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9609/06/fishy.name/| publisher=CNN|date=September 6, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frits Bernard''' (28 August 1920, [[Rotterdam]] &amp;ndash; 23 May 2006, Rotterdam) was a [[clinical psychologist]], [[sexologist]] and [[gay activism|gay]] and [[pedophile activism|pedophile activist]] in the Netherlands. He was also a leading member and author for the [[Dutch Society for Sexual Reform]] and established a foundation in his own name. Bernard founded Enclave Kring (Enclave Circle), which led the Enclave International Fellowship in the 1950s. This made him the founder of the first militant pedophile movement.

==Biography==
At the age of 7, Bernard moved to Spain, where he attended the Internationale Duitse School in Barcelona. He learned Catalan, English, French and Spanish. He returned during the Second World War to the Netherlands, where he studied humanities and psychology at the University of Amsterdam and the Catholic University of Nijmegen. In the 1950s, he joined the gay rights organization, Cultuur en Ontspannings-Centrum, where, under the pseudonym Victor Servatius, he wrote many articles for ''Vriendshap'' (''Friendship,'' the magazine of the movement) dealing with homosexuality, political science and also, for the first time, on paedophilia. At the same time, he created the Enclave Kring (Enclave Circle), the first public pedophile movement. Bernard published his novels, ''Costa Brava'' and ''Persecuted Minority,'' in 1960.  He also published a newsletter on pedophilia, and organized in the framework of conferences and support for pedophiles.

In 1964, an editorial change at Vriendschap prevented him from continuing his collaboration with the COC.  By the end of the 1960s Bernard found a forum for his work in the Dutch Society for Sexual Reform (NVSH).  With Edward Brongersma, Bhawna Singh Sandhu, and Peter van Eeten he published ''Sex met Kinderen'' (''Sex with Children'') in 1972 for the NVSH. It was the first comprehensive study of importance on pedophilia. Until the end of his life, he devoted himself to the defense of the rights of homosexuals, pederasts and pedophiles.

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|right|220px|[[Standing Buddha]] with a halo, 1st–2nd century AD (or earlier), [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]].]]
[[File:Masaccio chapelle Brancacci.png|thumb|right|320px|[[Jesus]] and nine of the [[Twelve Apostles]] depicted with "Floating" disk haloes in perspective (detail from ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|The Tribute Money]]'', illustrating {{bibleverse||Matthew|17:24-27|KJV}}, by [[Masaccio]], 1424, [[Brancacci Chapel]]).]]

A '''halo''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἅλως}}, ''halōs'';&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|halo}} {{LSJ|a(/lws|ἅλως|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''nimbus''', '''[[Aureola|aureole]]''', '''glory''', or '''gloriole''') is a crown of light rays, circle or disk of light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/halo-art|title=halo – art|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that surrounds a person in art.  They have been used in the [[iconography]] of many religions to indicate holy or sacred figures, and have at various periods also been used in images of rulers or heroes.  In the sacred art of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], among other religions, sacred persons may be depicted with a halo in the form of a circular glow, or flames in [[Asian art]], around the head or around the whole body—this last one is often called a [[mandorla]].  Halos may be shown as almost any color or combination of colors, but are most often depicted as golden, yellow or white when representing light or red when representing flames.

[[Homer]] describes a more-than-natural light around the heads of [[Greek hero|heroes]] in battle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' v.4ff, xviii.203ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of [[Perseus]] in the act of slaying [[Medusa]], with lines radiating from his head, appear on a white-ground toiletry box in the [[Louvre]] and on a slightly later [[Red-figure pottery|red-figured vase]] in the style of [[Polygnotos (vase painter)|Polygnotos]], ca. 450-30 BC, in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie J. Milne, "[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/bibliography/?id=12253 Perseus and Medusa on an Attic Vase]" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' New Series, '''4'''.5 (January 1946, pp. 126-130) 126.p.) {{JSTOR|3257993}}&lt;/ref&gt; On painted wares from [[Magna Graecia|south Italy]], radiant lines or simple haloes appear on a range of mythic figures: Lyssa, a personification of madness; a [[sphinx]]; a sea demon; and [[Thetis]], the sea-nymph who was mother to [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Stephani, ''Nimbus und Strahlenkranz in den Werken der Alten Kunst" in ''Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences de Saint-Petersbourg'', series vi, vol. vol ix, noted in Milne 1946:130.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Colossus of Rhodes]] was a statue of the sun-god [[Helios]] and had his usual [[radiate crown]] (copied for the [[Statue of Liberty]]). [[Hellenistic]] rulers are often shown wearing radiate crowns that seem clearly to imitate this effect.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Further afield, [[Sumer]]ian religious literature frequently speaks of ''melam'' (loaned into [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as ''melammu''), a "brilliant, visible glamour which is exuded by gods, heroes, sometimes by kings, and also by temples of great holiness and by gods' symbols and emblems."&lt;ref&gt;J. Black and A. Green, ''Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotmia'' (Austin, 1992) p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Asian art ==
[[File:Menander II with nimbate Nike.jpg|thumb|350px|Coin of [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander II]] (90–85 BCE), displaying [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] with a halo on the reverse.]]
The halo and the [[aureola]] have been widely used in Indian art, particularly in [[Buddhist]] iconography&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/publications/pdfs/asia/divided/d1_Art_S_Asia.pdf|title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Art of South Asia|website=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it has appeared since at least the 1st century AD; the Kushan [[Bimaran casket]] in the [[British Museum]] is dated 60AD (at least between 30BC and 200AD).  The rulers of the [[Kushan Empire]] were perhaps the earliest to give themselves haloes on their coins, and the nimbus in art may have originated in Central Asia and spread both east and west.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org" /&gt;

In Chinese and Japanese [[Buddhist art]] the halo has also been used since the earliest periods in depicting the image of [[Amitabha|Amitabha Buddha]] and others. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] uses haloes and aureoles of many types, drawing from both Indian and Chinese traditions, extensively in statues and [[Thangka]] paintings of Buddhist saints such as [[Milarepa]] and [[Padmasambhava]] and deities.  Different coloured haloes have specific meanings: orange for monks, green for the Buddha and other more elevated beings,&lt;ref&gt;including the [[Qianlong Emperor]] – see note below. Rhie, Marylin and Thurman, Robert (eds):''Wisdom And Compassion: The Sacred Art of Tibet'', p. 99, &amp; passim, 2000, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8109-2526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly figures have both a halo for the head, and another circular one for the body, the two often intersecting somewhere around the head or neck. Thin lines of gold often radiate outwards or inwards from the rim of the halo, and sometimes a whole halo is made up of these.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, pp 77, 176, 197 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In India the head halo is called ''Prabhamandala'' or ''Siras-cakra'', while the full body halo is ''Prabhavali''.&lt;ref&gt; Gopinatha  Rao, T. A. (1985). [https://archive.org/details/cu31924071128825 Elements of Hindu Iconography].  pps. 31-32. [[Motilal Banarsidass]]. {{ISBN|9788120808782}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elaborate haloes and especially aureoles also appear in [[Hindu]] sculpture, where they tend to develop into architectural frames in which the original idea can be hard to recognise. [[Theravada]] Buddhism and [[Jainism]] did not use the halo for many centuries, but later adopted it, though less thoroughly than other religious groups.

In Asian art, the nimbus is often imagined as consisting not just of light, but of flames.  This type seems to first appear in Chinese bronzes of which the earliest surviving examples date from before 450.&lt;ref&gt;No doubt, as later, the same motif appeared in paintings, but none survive from this early.  L Sickman &amp; A Soper, "The Art and Architecture of China", Pelican History of Art, 3rd ed 1971, pp 86-7, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), LOC 70-125675&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the flames may be very formalized, as in the regular little flames on the ring aureole surrounding many [[Chola]] bronzes and other classic Hindu sculptures of divinities, or very prominent, as with the more realistic flames, and sometimes smoke, shown rising to a peak behind many Tibetan Buddhist depictions of the "wrathful aspect" of divinities, and also in Persian miniatures of the classic period.  This type is also very rarely found, and on a smaller scale, in medieval Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;See Didron&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}  Sometimes a thin line of flames rise up from the edges of a circular halo in Buddhist examples.&lt;ref&gt;Often in paintings from the [[Dunhuang caves]], see Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas" , 1990, British Museum publications, nos 42, 53, 54 etc, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Tibetan paintings the flames are often shown as blown by a wind, usually from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

Halos are found in [[Islamic art]] from various places and periods, especially in [[Persian miniature]]s and [[Moghul]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] art influenced by them.  Flaming halos derived from Buddhist art surround angels, and similar ones are often seen [[Depiction of Muhammad|around Muhammad]] and other sacred human figures.  From the early 17th century, plainer round haloes appear in portraits of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperors]] and subsequently [[Rajput]] and [[Sikh]] rulers;&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org" /&gt; despite the more local precedents art historians believe the Mughals took the motif from European religious art, though it expresses a Persian idea of the God-given [[charisma]] of kingship that is far older.&lt;ref&gt;Crill &amp; Jariwala, 29 and note&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] avoided using halos for the [[sultan]]s, despite their title as [[Caliph]], and they are only seen on Chinese emperors if they are posing as Buddhist religious figures, as some felt entitled to do.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the [[Qianlong Emperor]] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Qianlong_Emperor_in_Buddhist_Dress.jpg the Qianlong Emperor in Buddhist Dress], and his father.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo1.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Apollo]] with a radiant halo in a Roman floor [[mosaic]] (late 2nd century, [[El Djem]], Tunisia)]]

The halo represents an [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] or the glow of sanctity which was conventionally drawn encircling the head. It first appeared in the culture of Hellenistic Greece and [[Rome]], possibly related to the [[Zoroastrian]] ''hvarena'' – "glory" or "divine lustre" – which marked the Persian kings, and may have been imported with [[Mithraism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramsden|first=E.

In a late 2nd century AD floor mosaic from Thysdrus, [[El Djem]],   (''illustration'') [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] is identified by his effulgent halo.  Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Illustration |accessdate= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |archivedate=8 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BC to depict [[Alexander the Great]] (Bieber 1964; Yalouris 1980).

[[File:ChristAsSol.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Early pre-4th century Mosaic of [[Sol Invictus]]&lt;ref&gt;According to the 1967 [[New Catholic Encyclopedia]], a standard library reference, in an article on ''[[Constantine the Great]]'': "Besides, the Sol Invictus had been adopted by the Christians in a Christian sense, as demonstrated in the Christ as [[Helios|Apollo-Helios]] in a [[mausoleum]] (c. 250) discovered beneath [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's in the Vatican]]."&lt;/ref&gt; in Mausoleum M in the pre-4th-century necropolis [http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Necropolis/Scavi.htm beneath] [[St Peter's Basilica]] – interpreted by many as representing Christ.]]

The halo was incorporated into [[Early Christian art]] sometime in the 4th century with the earliest [[icon]]ic images of Christ, initially the only figure shown with one (together with his symbol, the [[Lamb of God]]).  Initially the halo was regarded by many as a representation of the ''[[Logos]]'' of Christ, his divine nature, and therefore in very early (before 500) depictions of Christ before his Baptism by [[John the Baptist|John]] he tends not to be shown with a halo, it being a matter of debate whether his ''Logos'' was innate from conception (the Orthodox view), or acquired at Baptism (the [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]] view).  At this period he is also shown as a child or youth in ''Baptisms'', though this may be a hieratic rather than an age-related representation.&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, p. 135, figs 150-53, 346-54. {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kölner Meister eines Evangelienbuches 001.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]'' and ''[[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration]]'' of Christ, with cross haloes; the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]], [[angel]]s and [[prophet]]s have plain ones. (1025–50, [[Cologne]]).]]

A '''cruciform halo''', that is to say a cross within, or extending beyond, a halo is used to represent the persons of the [[Holy Trinity]], especially [[Jesus]], and especially in medieval art.  In Byzantine and Orthodox images, inside each of the bars of the cross in Christ's halo is one of the [[Greek letter]]s Ο Ω Ν, making up {{lang|grc|[[I Am that I Am|ὁ ὢν]]}}—"ho ōn", literally, "the Existing One"—indicating the [[divinity of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Christian Symbols |url=http://www.catholicbiblical.ca/wp-content/uploads/Early-Christian-symbols.pdf |publisher=Catholic Biblical Association of Canada |accessdate=20 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223120343/http://www.catholicbiblical.ca/wp-content/uploads/Early-Christian-symbols.pdf |archivedate=23 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least in later Orthodox images, each bar of this cross is composed of three lines, symbolising the [[dogma]]s of the Trinity, the [[Divine simplicity|oneness of God]] and the [[Christology|two natures of Christ]].

In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-40) the juvenile Christ has a four-armed cross either on top of his head in the radius of the nimbus, or placed above the radius, but this is unusual.  In the same mosaics the accompanying angels have haloes (as, in a continuation of the Imperial tradition, does [[Herod the Great|King Herod]]), but not [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].  Occasionally other figures have crossed haloes, such as the seven doves representing the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] in the 11th century [[Codex Vyssegradensis]] [[Tree of Jesse]] (where [[Jesse]] and [[Isaiah]] also have plain haloes, as do the [[Ancestors of Christ]] in other miniatures).&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs 20-22, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, triangular haloes are sometimes given to [[God the Father]] to represent the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Halo Nationalgallery.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423223708/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Halo |date=23 April 2007 }},  Late 15th century reliefs by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] on the portal of San Petronio, Bologna are an early example of the triangular halo. According to Didron, Adolphe Napoléon: ''Christian Iconography: Or, The History of Christian Art in the Middle Ages'', London, 1851, Vol 2, p30, this is "extremely rare in France, but common enough in Italy and Greece&lt;/ref&gt;  When he is represented by a [[Hand of God (art)|hand emerging from a cloud]], this may be given a halo.

Plain round haloes are typically used to signify [[saint]]s, the Virgin Mary, [[Old Testament]] prophets, angels, symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], and some other figures. [[Byzantine emperor]]s and empresses were often shown with them in compositions including saints or Christ, however the haloes were outlined only.  This was copied by Ottonian and later Russian rulers. Old Testament figures become less likely to have haloes in the West as the Middle Ages go on.&lt;ref&gt;Didron, Vol 2, pp.68-71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pope Paschalis I. in apsis mosaic of Santa Prassede in Rome.gif|thumb|right|180px|[[Pope Paschal I]] is depicted during his lifetime, so with a square halo, c. 820, [[Santa Prassede]], Rome.]]
[[Beatification|Beatified]] figures, not yet canonised as saints, are sometimes shown in medieval Italian art with linear rays radiating out from the head, but no circular edge of the nimbus defined; later this became a less obtrusive form of halo that could be used for all figures.&lt;ref&gt;The distinction is observed in the ''Christ Glorified in the Court of Heaven'' (1423-4) by [[Fra Angelico]], [[National Gallery, London]], where only the beatified saints at the edges have radiating linear haloes.&lt;/ref&gt;   Mary has, especially from the [[Baroque]] period onwards, a special form of halo in a [[circle of stars|circle of twelve stars]], derived from her identification as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]].

'''Square haloes''' were sometimes used for the living in [[donor portrait]]s of about 500-1100 in Italy;&lt;ref&gt;only in Italy, according to Didron, Vol 2 p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Most surviving ones are of Popes and others in [[mosaic]]s in Rome, including the [[Episcopa Theodora]] head of the mother of the Pope of the day.  They seem merely an indication of a contemporary figure, as opposed to the saints usually accompanying them, with no real implication of future canonization. A late example is of [[Desiderius, Abbot of Monte Cassino]], later Pope, from a manuscript of 1056–86;&lt;ref&gt;see Didron, Vol 2 p.79 and Dodwell, C.R.; ''The Pictorial arts of the West, 800-1200'', 1993, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Gregory the Great]] had himself depicted with one, according to the 9th-century writer of his ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'', [[John, deacon of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Diaconus gives the reason: ''circa verticem tabulae similitudinem, quod viventis insigne est, preferens, non-coronam'' ("bearing around his head the likeness of a square, which is the sign for a living person, and not a crown") ([[Migne]], ''Pat. Lat.'' 75, 231). The deacon of Rome was unaware of the Eastern tradition of depicting the emperor with a halo.  Surviving examples are rare, and seem to be becoming rarer; Bishop Ecclesius has a clear one in older photos of the mosaics in [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale, Ravenna]], which appears to have been removed in recent restoration [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:SanVitale16.jpg Cupola of the choir] – see: James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p100 &amp; photo p.93, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}.  Other surviving examples are [[Pope Hadrian I]] in a mural formerly in [[Santa Prassede]], Rome, donor figures in the church at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]  [http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/cr-03/cr-01/index.html and two more Roman examples – items 3 and 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630131544/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/cr-03/cr-01/index.html |date=30 June 2007 }}, one of Paschal's mother, the rather mysterious [[Episcopa Theodora]]. see also: Fisher, Sally.

Edited by Harriet Whelchel, Harry N Abrams, Inc., 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  A figure who may represent [[Moses]] in the 3rd century [[Dura Europos Synagogue]] has one, where no round halos are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dura_Europos_fresco_holy_man.jpg|title=Joshua. Fresco from the Dura Europos synagogue (Jewish Art, ed. Cecil Roth, Tel Aviv: Massadah Press, 1961, cols. 203-204: "Joshua").|first=made by photographer|last=Becklectic|publisher=|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Personifications of the [[Virtues]] are sometimes given [[hexagon]]al haloes.&lt;ref&gt;As in the frescoes by the workshop of Giotto in the lower church at Assisi. James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p202, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scalloped haloes, sometimes just appearing as made of radiating bars, are found in the manuscripts of the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] "Ada School", such as the [[Ada Gospels]].

The whole-body image of radiance is sometimes called the  '[[Aureola|aureole]]' or ''glory''; it is shown radiating from all round the body, most often of Christ or Mary, occasionally of saints (especially those reported to have been seen surrounded by one).  Such an aureola is often a [[mandorla]] ("almond-shaped" [[vesica piscis]]), especially around [[Christ in Majesty]], who may well have a halo as well.  In [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|depictions of the Transfiguration of Jesus]] a more complicated shape is often seen, especially in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition, as in the famous 15th century icon in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Didron, Vol 2, pp. 107-126&lt;/ref&gt;

Where gold is used as a background in [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[mosaic]]s and panel paintings, the halo is often formed by inscribing lines in the [[gold leaf]], and may be decorated in patterns ([[diapering]]) within the outer radius, and thus becomes much less prominent.  The gold leaf inside the halo may also be burnished in a circular manner, so as to produce the effect of light radiating out from the subject's head. In the early centuries of its use, the Christian halo may be in most colours (though black is reserved for [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], [[Satan]] and other evil figures) or multicoloured; later gold becomes standard, and if the entire background is not gold leaf, the halo itself usually will be.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Margaret Jensen, ''Understanding Early Christian Art'', p. 112, 2000, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-20454-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline of the halo ===
[[File:Fra Angelico 082.jpg|thumb|left|290px|[[Fra Angelico]]. ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]''.  Note the haloes of the kneeling figures at the front, seen from behind.]]

With increasing [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in painting, the halo came to be a problem for artists.  So long as they continued to use the old compositional formulae which had been worked out to accommodate haloes, the problems were manageable, but as Western artists sought more flexibility in composition, this ceased to be the case.  In free-standing medieval [[sculpture]], the halo was already shown as a flat disk above or behind the head.  When [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] came to be considered essential, painters also changed the halo from an aura surrounding the head, always depicted as though seen full-on, to a flat golden disk or ring that appeared in perspective, floating above the heads of the saints, or vertically behind, sometimes transparent.  This can be seen first in [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], who still gives Christ the cruciform halo which began to be phased out by his successors.  In northern Europe the radiant halo, made up of rays like a [[sunburst]], came into fashion in French painting around the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, Hugh. ''Catalogue of the Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum'', p. 43, 1986, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7141-0525-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 15th century [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Robert Campin]] largely abandoned their use, although some other [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artists continued to use them.&lt;ref&gt;Haloes were also often added by later dealers and restorers to such works, and indeed sometimes used to convert portraits into "saints". [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/neth/hd_neth.htm Intentional Alterations of Early Netherlandish Painting, Metropolitan Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italy at around the same time, [[Pisanello]] used them if they did not clash with one of the enormous hats he liked to paint.  Generally they lasted longer in Italy, although often reduced to a thin gold band depicting the outer edge of the nimbus, usual for example in [[Giovanni Bellini]].  Christ began to be shown with a plain halo.
[[File:Madonna Benois.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (attributed),  ''[[The Benois Madonna|Benois Madonna]]''.  Floating semi-transparent haloes in perspective.]]

[[Fra Angelico]], himself a [[monk]], was a conservative as far as haloes are concerned, and some of his paintings demonstrate the problems well, as in several of his more crowded compositions, where they are shown as solid gold disks on the same plane as the picture surface, it becomes difficult to prevent them obstructing other figures.  At the same time they were useful in crowded narrative scenes for distinguishing the main, identifiable, figures from the mass of a crowd. [[Giotto]]'s [[Lamentation of Christ]] from the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] has eight figures with haloes and ten without, to whom the viewer knows they are not meant to attach a specific identity. In the same way, a ''Baptism of Christ'' by [[Perugino]] in Vienna gives neither Christ nor [[John the Baptist]] haloes, as sufficiently recognisable without them, but a saint in the background, not usually present in this scene, has a ring halo to denote his status.&lt;ref&gt;If not their identity. The painting has been partly repainted, and the current appearance may not be the original one. [[:File:Pietro Perugino 077.jpg|Vienna Perugino]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], even most Italian painters dispensed with haloes altogether, but in the Church's reaction to the [[Protestant Reformation]], that culminated in the [[Art in the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation#Council of Trent|decrees on images of the Council of Trent]] of 1563, their use was mandated by clerical writers on religious art such as [[Molanus]] and Saint [[Carlo Borromeo]].  Figures were placed where natural light sources would highlight their heads, or instead more discreet quasi-naturalistic flickering or glowing light was shown around the head of Christ and other figures (perhaps pioneered by [[Titian]] in his late period). [[Rembrandt]]'s [[etching]]s, for example, show a variety of solutions of all of these types, as well as a majority with no halo effect at all.  The disk halo was rarely used for figures from [[classical mythology]] in the Renaissance, although they are sometimes seen, especially in the classical radiant form, in [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] art.

By the 19th century haloes have become unusual in Western mainstream art, although retained in iconic and popular images, and sometimes as a medievalising effect.  When [[John Millais]] gives his otherwise realist ''[[St Stephen]]'' (1895) a ring halo, it seems rather surprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-saint-stephen-n01563|title=‘Saint Stephen’, Sir John Everett Millais, Bt, 1895 – Tate|first=|last=Tate|website=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular graphic culture, a simple ring has become the predominant representation of a halo since at least the late 19th century, as seen for example in the logo for the [[Simon Templar]] ("The Saint") series of novels and other adaptations.

== Spiritual significance in Christianity ==
[[File:Ushakov Nerukotvorniy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Eastern Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ "[[Not Made by Hand]]" with the Greek letters [[I Am that I Am|'''Ο''' &lt;big&gt;ὤ&lt;/big&gt; '''Ν''']]. [[Simon Ushakov]], 17th century.]]
The early [[Church Fathers]] expended much rhetorical energy on conceptions of God as a source of light; among other things this was because "in the controversies in the 4th century over the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son, the relation of the ray to the source was the most cogent example of emanation and of distinct forms with a common substance" – key concepts in the theological thought of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Notes on Castelseprio (1957) in Meyer Schapiro, Selected Papers, volume 3, p117, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art, 1980, Chatto &amp; Windus, London, {{ISBN|0-7011-2514-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more [[Catholic]] interpretation, less dualistic in its assumptions, is that the halo represents the light of divine grace suffusing the soul, which is perfectly united and in harmony with the physical body.

In the theology of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], an [[icon]] is a "window into heaven" through which Christ and the Saints in heaven can be seen and communicated with. The gold background of the icon indicates that what is depicted is in heaven. The halo is a symbol of the [[Uncreated Light]] (Greek: Ἄκτιστον Φῶς) or [[Divine grace|grace]] of God shining forth through the icon. [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] in his ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia|Celestial Hierarchies]]'' speaks of the angels and saints being illuminated by the grace of God, and in turn illumining others.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Origins and usage of the different terms ==
[[File:Preobrazhenie.jpeg|thumb|Late Byzantine/Russian [[icon]] of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration]]. Christ is shown surrounded by a light blue aureole with white flashes of lightning (15th century,  attributed to [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]).]]

The distinction between the alternative terms in English is rather unclear.  The oldest term in English is "glory", the only one available in the [[Middle Ages]], but now largely obsolete. It came from the French "gloire" which has much the same range of meanings as "glory".  "Gloriole" does not appear in this sense until 1844, being a modern invention, as a diminutive, in French also. "Halo" is first found in English in this sense in 1646 (nearly a century after the optical or astronomical sense). Both "halos" and "haloes" may be used as plural forms, and halo may be used as a verb.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "glory", "gloriole" and "halo".&lt;/ref&gt;  Halo comes originally from the Greek for "threshing-floor" – a circular, slightly sloping area kept very clean, around which slaves or oxen walked to thresh the grain.  In Greek, this came to mean the divine bright disk.

Nimbus means a cloud in Latin and is found as a divine cloud in 1616, whereas as "a bright or golden disk surrounding the head" it does not appear until 1727.  The plural "nimbi" is correct but "rare"; "nimbuses" is not in the OED but sometimes used. "Nimb" is an obsolete form of the noun, but not a verb, except that the obsolete "nimbated", like the commoner "nimbate", means "furnished with a nimbus".  It is sometimes preferred by art-historians, as sounding more technical than halo.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "nimbus" etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aureole", from the Latin for "golden", has been used in English as a term for a gold crown, especially that traditionally considered the reward of [[martyr]]s, since the Middle Ages (OED 1220).  But the first use recorded as a term for a halo is in 1848, very shortly after which matters were greatly complicated by the publication in 1851 of the English translation of [[Adolphe Napoléon Didron]]'s important ''Christian Iconography: Or, The History of Christian Art in the Middle Ages''.  This, by what the OED calls a "strange blunder", derived the word from the Latin "aura" as a diminutive, and also defined it as meaning a halo or glory covering the whole body, whilst saying that "nimbus" referred only to a halo around the head.  This, according to the OED, reversed the historical usage of both words, but whilst Didron's diktat was "not accepted in France", the OED noted it had already been picked up by several English dictionaries, and influenced usage in English, which still seems to be the case, as the word "nimbus" is mostly found describing whole-body haloes, and seems to have also influenced "gloriole" in the same direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "aureole".&lt;/ref&gt;

The only English term that unequivocally means a full-body halo, and cannot be used for a circular disk around the head is "[[mandorla]]", first occurring in 1883.  However, this term, which is the Italian word for "[[almond]]", is usually reserved for the [[vesica piscis]] shape, at least in describing Christian art.  In discussing Asian art, it is used more widely.&lt;ref&gt;For example by Sickman and Soper, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, there could be said to be an excess of words that could refer to either a head-disk or a full-body halo, and no word that clearly denotes a full-body halo that is not vesica piscis shaped.  "Halo" by itself, according to recent dictionaries,&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary, 1995, and Collins English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; means only a circle around the head, although Rhie and Thurman use the word also for circular full-body aureoles.&lt;ref&gt;op &amp; pages cit.  The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1911 (link above) has a further set of meanings for these terms, including glory.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11134">The '''''Heidelberg Appeal''''', authored by [[Michel Salomon]], was an appeal directed against the findings of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;James Lawrence Powell: ''The Inquisition of Climate Science''. New York 2012, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; organised initially by the tobacco industry as part of its "junk-science" program. The Heidelberg Appeal's goal was similar to the later published [[Leipzig Declaration]] and an earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaw |first1=Allison |last2=Robinson |first2=John |date=2004 |title=RELEVANT BUT NOT PRESCRIPTIVE?

It was published at the last day of the [[Rio Summit]] 1992 and warned governments that they don't base their policy on environmental policy, which they regarded as "pseudoscientific arguments or false and nonrelevant data."&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt; It was brought forward by the tobacco and asbestos industry, to support the climate-denying [[Global Climate Coalition]]. According to [[SourceWatch]] the appeal is "a scam perpetrated by the asbestos and tobacco industries in support of the Global Climate Coalition". Both industries had no direct reason to deny global warming, but rather wanted to promote their "sound science" agenda, which basically states that industry-funded science is good science and science contradicting those science (such as environmental science) is bad science or "[[junk science]]".&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt;

==Signed up for what?==

The technique used by Salomon's group to enlist members of the scientific establishment to lend their names to climate denial by signing the Appeal document, was quite unique. It is important to realise that, at this time, some sections of the environmental movement were anti-science, and anti-technology.  They blamed the scientists as much as the industrialists for damaging the ecology of the planet.

The document most of the signatories thought they were signing was an appeal for the society to pay more attention to scientists than to the many irrational health and environmental activists. They were objecting to the way in which they were losing their privileged position as the 'go-to authorities' on all such health and environmental matters.  They didn't see this as a climate-denial statement.

One of the signatories, Nobel Prize winner [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]], a professor of physics at Princeton University, cited the continued dispersal of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as a prime example of an environmentally hazardous situation identified by scientists.  He complained that despite science's disapproval, CFC's persists to be released as a result of industrial interests and denial of potential harm. He asserted that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It's a sneaky thing to keep the CFC plants going. [... However ... ] industrialists, not scientists are to blame for much of the planet's ecological degradation."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He agreed with Salomon in attacking the animal-rights people as &lt;blockquote&gt;''"clearly irrational?" [... ] "This is obvious when they resort to illegality and violence to propagate their ends." [such] forces "make the public afraid of science."'' 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.the-scientist.com/news/rio-document-spurs-debate-is-science-an-ecological-foe-60005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No draft of the original signed document exists, but participants have since claimed that the document they signed was a general 'motherhood' statement about the need for better science in dealing with hazardous and health-related products.  However, when release and publicised by [[Fred Singer]]'s [[Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project]] operation specific mention of climate change was added in the introductory passages and press release.  It was carefully released to coincide with the opening of the Rio Earth Summit.

==Success?==

The ''Heidelberg Appeal'' has been enthusiastically embraced by large corporations and individual critics of the environmental movement. Conservative think tanks frequently cite the Heidelberg Appeal as proof that scientists reject the theory of [[global warming]] as well as a host of other environmental health risks associated with modern science and industry. Its name has subsequently been adopted by the [[Heidelberg Appeal Nederland Foundation]], which was founded in 1993 and disputes health risks related to nitrates in foods and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Heidelberg Appeal was promoted in 1993 by the [[International Center for a Scientific Ecology]], a group set up by Michael Salomon "that was considered important in [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]]' plans to create a group in Europe similar to [[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]] (TASSC)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1446867 | pmid=11684592 | volume=91 | title=Junking science to promote tobacco | date=November 2001 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1745–8 | last1 = Yach | first1 = D | last2 = Bialous | first2 = SA | doi=10.2105/ajph.91.11.1745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2028385372.html International Center for A Scientific Ecology Guidelines for the Seminar on Linear Relationship for Risk Assessment of Low Doses of Carcinogens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014201129/http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2028385372.html |date=2010-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Originator ==

Michel Salomon was the editor of the Paris-based "Projections" magazine. He was hired by Philip Morris to extend their junk-science program into Europe. They had already been highly successful with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt; TASSC ([[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]]) in the US under [[Steven Milloy]], &lt;br&gt; &lt;LI&gt; SEPP ([[Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project]] (run by Fred Singer) and semi-attached to TASSC.
&lt;LI&gt; ESEF ([[European Science and Environment Forum]]) run by [[Roger Bate]] on secondment from the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] in London.&lt;/ul&gt;

Following the Heidelberg Appeal, Salomon established for them the ICSE (aka "CIES") which is variously quoted in the tobacco archive documents as the [[International Center for a Scientific Ecology]] or, in French, the [[Centre International pour une Ecologie Scientifique]].  He wrote about the appeal:
 &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; ''... we brought together at Heidelberg about fifty well-known scientists, including Nobel Prize winners Rita Levi and Manfred Eigen, as well as medical practitioners, sociologists, moralists and members of the editorial staff of Projections. They came from a range of disciplines, from numerous European countries, including the former Soviet Union, and had divergent views on many questions. 

Why Heidelberg? We wanted to meet in a prestigious European university town. Oxford or Cambridge would have done just as well. The warm welcome we received at the beginning of our round of the university towns, from cardiologist Gothard Schettler, Vice President of the Academy of Science at Heidelberg, and from Professor Harald zur Hausen at the Cancer Research Institute, persuaded us to pitch our tent on the banks of the Neckar. As the substances in question were incriminated, among other things, for their supposed or real carcinogenic effects, we accepted Professor zur Hausen's generous hospitality.  

 The Heidelberg meeting was lively and fruitful. Experts in CFCs, dioxins, radiation and asbestos summarized the latest epidemiological and other research on the impact of these substances on health, and their conclusions were discussed by the members of the meeting. But the question of the coming ''' Earth Summit''' preoccupied the participants too much for them to stop at purely technical discussions. ''' We were therefore not overly surprised when numerous voices were raised wanting the group to discuss Rio and to adopt a definite position on the matter.'''

 &lt;u&gt;We had rather anticipated this reaction&lt;/u&gt;. An initial text which we had passed round friends in Paris had already attracted about fifty signatures. We presented it at Heidelberg. It was discussed paragraph by paragraph, word by word. The Heidelberg declaration in its present version was the result of those discussions. '' &lt;ref&gt;  Michel Salomon editorial Projections, April 14 1992.  http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/yqg80c00/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

==Neolithic architecture==
[[File:Orkney Skara Brae.jpg|thumb|left|Excavated dwellings at [[Skara Brae]]]]
{{main|Neolithic architecture}}

Neolithic architecture is the architecture of the [[Neolithic]] period. Although many dwellings belonging to all prehistoric periods and also some clay models of dwellings have been uncovered enabling us to make faithful reconstructions, they selfom included elements that may relate them to art. Some exceptions are provided by wall decorations and by finds that equally apply to Neolithic and Eneolithic rites and art.

In Southwest Asia, Neolithic [[Archaeological culture|cultures]] appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the [[Levant]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) and from there spread eastwards and westwards. There are early Neolithic cultures in Southeast Anatolia, Syria and Iraq by 8000 BC, and food-producing societies first appear in southeast Europe by 7000 BC, and Central Europe by c. 5500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the [[Kőrös culture|Starčevo-Koros (Cris)]], [[Linearbandkeramic]], and [[Vinca culture|Vinča]]). With the exception of the [[Andean civilizations|Andes]], the [[Isthmo-Columbian area]] and [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica|Western Mesoamerica]] (and a few copper [[hatchet]]s and [[spear]] heads in the [[Old Copper Complex|Great Lakes region]]), the people of the [[Americas]] and the Pacific remained at the Neolithic level of [[technology]] up until the time of Western contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Old Copper Complex: North America's First Miners &amp; Metal Artisans|url=http://copperculture.homestead.com/|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Song|first1=Jeeun|title=The History of Metallurgy and Mining in the Andean Region|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/1011/pope/sje2.html|website=World History at Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Charles Q.|title=Pre-Incan Metallurgy Discovered|url=http://www.livescience.com/1442-pre-incan-metallurgy-discovered.html|website=Live Science|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maldonado|first1=Blanco D.|title=Tarascan Copper Metallurgy at the Site of Itziparátzico, Michoacán, México|journal=Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies|date=2003|url=http://www.famsi.org/reports/02063/02063Maldonado01.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neolithic people in the [[Levant]], [[Anatolia]], [[Syria]], northern [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Central Asia]] were great builders, utilizing [[mud-brick]] to construct houses and villages. At [[Çatalhöyük]], houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals. The Mediterranean neolithic cultures of [[Malta]] worshiped in [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|megalithic temples]].

In Europe, [[Neolithic long house|long houses]] built from [[wattle and daub]] were constructed. Elaborate tombs for the dead were also built. These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland, where there are many thousands still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built [[long barrow]]s and [[chamber tomb]]s for their dead and [[causewayed camp]]s, [[henge]]s flint mines and [[cursus]] monuments.

Ancient [[Mesopotamia]] is most noted for its construction of mud brick buildings and the construction of [[Ziggurats]], religious temples made for worship of the gods and goddesses of Mesopotamia. The word Ziggurat is an anglicized form of the Akkadian word ziqqurratum, the name given to the solid stepped towers of mud brick. It derives from the verb zaqaru, ‘to be high'. The buildings are described as being like mountains linking Earth and heaven. The ziggurat at Ur, excavated by [[Leonard Woolley]], is 64 by 46 meters at base and originally some 12 meters in height with three stories. It was built under [[Ur-Nammu]] (c.2100 B.C.) and rebuilt under [[Nabonidus]] (555-539 B.C.) when it was increased in height to probably seven stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gods and Goddesses|url=http://www.mesopotamia.co.uk/staff/resources/background/bg22/home.html|website=Mesopotamia.co.uk|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egyptian architecture===
[[File:Egypt.MedinetHabu.02.jpg|thumb|right|Ceiling decoration in the peristyle hall of [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]], an example of ancient Egyptian architecture]]
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}

In [[Ancient Egypt]] and other early societies, people believed in the [[omnipotence]] of gods, with many aspects of daily life carried out with respect to the idea of the divine or [[supernatural]] and the way it was manifest in the mortal cycles of generations, years, seasons, days and nights. [[Harvest]]s for example were seen as the benevolence of [[fertility]] deities. Thus, the founding and ordering of the city and her most important buildings (the [[palace]] or [[temple]]) were often executed by priests or even the ruler himself and the construction was accompanied by [[rituals]] intended to enter human activity into continued divine [[benediction]].

Ancient architecture is characterized by this tension between the divine and mortal world. Cities would mark a contained sacred space over the wilderness of [[nature]] outside, and the temple or palace continued this order by acting as a house for the gods. The architect, be he [[priest]] or [[monarch|king]], was not the sole important figure; he was merely part of a continuing tradition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Greek architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Ancient Greece}}
[[File:Concordiatempelagrigent2 retouched.jpg|thumb|right|[[Valle dei Templi#Temple of Concordia|Temple of Concordia]] in [[Valle dei Templi|Agrigento]], Sicily.]]
The architecture and urbanism of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] was very different from that of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. Civic life gained importance for all members of the community. In the time of the ancients religious matters were only handled by the ruling class; by the time of the Greeks, religious mystery had skipped the confines of the temple-palace compounds and was the subject of the people or ''[[polis]]''.

Greek civic life was sustained by new, open spaces called the ''[[agora]]'' which were surrounded by public buildings, stores and temples. The ''agora'' embodied the newfound respect for social justice received through open debate rather than imperial mandate. Though divine wisdom still presided over human affairs, the living rituals of ancient civilizations had become inscribed in space, in the paths that wound towards the ''[[acropolis]]'' for example. Each place had its own nature, set within a world refracted through myth, thus temples were sited atop mountains all the better to touch the heavens.

Greek architecture was typically post-and-beam (called "trabeated") and made of stone. Most surviving buildings are temples, based on strict rules of proportion. These temples typically included a [[peristyle]] (outer area with (typically [[Doric order|doric]]) columns), and three-sections in the middle, being 1. the [[Pronaos|pronaus]] (entrance), 2. the main [[cella]] or naos chamber (where a statue of the god or goddess and an altar was built), and 3. the [[opisthodomos]] behind the [[cella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Read Buildings|last=Cragoe|first=Carol Davidson|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications, Inc.|year=2017|isbn=978-0-8478-3112-8|location=New York, NY|pages= 24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman architecture===
{{Main|Roman architecture}}

The Romans conquered the Greek cities in Italy around three hundred years BCE and much of the Western world after that. The Roman problem of rulership involved the unity of disparity &amp;mdash; from [[Spain|Spanish]] to [[Greece|Greek]], [[Macedon]]ian to [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] &amp;mdash; Roman rule had extended itself across the breadth of the known world and the myriad pacified cultures forming this ''ecumene'' presented a new challenge for justice.

One way to look at the unity of Roman architecture is through a new-found realization of theory derived from practice, and embodied spatially. Civically we find this happening in the Roman ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]'' (sibling of the Greek agora), where public participation is increasingly removed from the concrete performance of rituals and represented in the decor of the architecture. Thus we finally see the beginnings of the contemporary public square in the Forum Iulium, begun by [[Julius Caesar]], where the buildings present themselves through their facades as representations within the space.

As the Romans chose representations of sanctity over actual sacred spaces to participate in society, the communicative nature of space was opened to human manipulation. None of which would have been possible without the advances of Roman [[engineering]] and construction or the newly found [[marble]] quarries which were the spoils of war; inventions like the [[arch]] and [[concrete]] gave a whole new form to Roman architecture, fluidly enclosing space in taut [[dome]]s and [[colonnade]]s, clothing the grounds for imperial rulership and civic order. This was also a response to the changing social climate which demanded new buildings of increasing complexity &amp;mdash; the [[colosseum]], the residential block, bigger hospitals and academies. General civil construction such as roads and bridges began to be built.

The Romans widely employed, and further developed, the [[arch]], [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and [[dome]] (see the [[Roman Architectural Revolution]]), all of which were little used before, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Romans were the first builders in Europe, perhaps the first in the world, fully to appreciate the advantages of the arch, the vault and the dome.''(Robertson, D.S.: Greek and Roman Architecture, 2nd edn., Cambridge 1943, p.231)&lt;/ref&gt; Their innovative use of [[Roman concrete]] facilitated the building of the many public buildings of often unprecedented size throughout the [[Roman empire|empire]]. These include [[Roman temple]]s, [[thermae|Roman baths]], [[List of Roman bridges|Roman bridges]], [[Roman aqueduct]]s, [[Indo-Roman trade and relations#Ports|Roman harbours]], [[List of ancient Roman triumphal arches|triumphal arches]], [[List of Roman amphitheatres|Roman amphitheatres]], [[Circus (building)#List of Roman circuses|Roman circuses]] [[palace]]s, [[mausoleum|mausolea]] and in the [[Late antiquity|late empire]] also [[Church (building)|church]]es.

[[List of Roman domes|Roman domes]] permitted construction of vaulted ceilings and enabled huge covered public spaces such as the [[Thermae|public baths]] like [[Baths of Diocletian]] or the monumental [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in the city of Rome.

Art historians such as Gottfried Richter in the 1920s identified the Roman architectural innovation as being the [[Triumphal Arch]] and it is poignant to see how this symbol of power on earth was transformed and utilized within the Christian basilicas when the Roman Empire of the West was on its last legs: The arch was set before the altar to symbolize the triumph of Christ and the after life. It is in their impressive [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] that we see the arch triumphant, especially in the many surviving examples, such as the [[Pont du Gard]], the aqueduct at [[Segovia]] and the remains of the [[Aqueducts of Rome]] itself. Their survival is testimony to the durability of their materials and design.

The [[Byzantine Empire]] gradually emerged as a distinct artistic and cultural entity from the Roman Empire after AD 330, when the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] moved the capital of the Roman Empire east from Rome to [[Byzantium]] (later renamed [[Constantinople]] and now called [[Istanbul]]). The empire endured for more than a millennium, dramatically influencing [[Medieval architecture|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance-era]] architecture in Europe and, following the capture of Constantinople by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, leading directly to the [[Ottoman architecture|architecture of the Ottoman Empire]].

Early Byzantine architecture was built as a continuation of [[Roman architecture]]. [[Architectural style|Stylistic drift]], [[pendentive|technological advancement]], and [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|political]] and territorial changes meant that a distinct style gradually emerged which imbued certain influences from the Near East and used the [[Cross-in-square|Greek cross]] plan in church architecture. Buildings increased in geometric [[Cruciform|complexity]], brick and plaster were used in addition to stone in the decoration of important public structures, [[classical orders]] were used more freely, [[mosaic]]s replaced carved decoration, complex domes rested upon massive [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], and windows filtered light through thin sheets of [[alabaster]] to softly illuminate interiors. (see [[Hagia Sophia]])

The pre-Islamic styles draw on 3-4 thousand years of architectural development from various civilizations of the Iranian plateau. The Islamic architecture of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy.
Iran is recognized by UNESCO as being one of the cradles of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928124326/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the periods of [[Elam]]ites, [[Achaemenid]]s, [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]ns, and [[Sassanid]]s were creators of great architecture that over the ages has spread wide and far to other cultures being adopted. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, including [[Alexander The Great]]'s decision to burn [[Persepolis]], there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its classical architecture.

The [[Achaemenid]]s built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories of what was then the largest state in the world. [[Pasargadae]] set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with bridges, gardens, [[colonnade]]d palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with Susa and Persepolis expressed the authority of The King of Kings, the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier.

With the emergence of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Sassanid]]s there was an appearance of new forms. Parthian innovations fully flowered during the Sassanid period with massive [[barrel-vault]]ed chambers, solid masonry domes, and tall columns. This influence was to remain for years to come.
The roundness of the city of [[Baghdad]] in the [[Abbasid]] era for example, points to its Persian precedents such as [[Firouzabad]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]].&lt;ref&gt;Islam Art and Architecture. Markus Hattstein, Peter Delius. 2000. p96. {{ISBN|3-8290-2558-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two designers who were hired by [[al-Mansur]] to plan the city's design were [[Naubakht]], a former Persian Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and Mashallah, a former Jew from Khorasan.
The ruins of [[Persepolis]], [[Ctesiphon]], [[Jiroft Civilization|Jiroft]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/05/jan/1290.html Discovery of brick tablet in Jiroft proves 3rd millennium BC civilization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sialk]], [[Pasargadae]], [[Firouzabad]], [[Arg-é Bam]], and thousands of other ruins may give us merely a distant glimpse of what contribution Persians made to the art of building.

The fall of the Sassanid Empire to invading Islamic forces ironically led to the creation of remarkable religious buildings in Iran. Arts such as [[calligraphy]], stucco work, mirror work, and mosaic work, became closely tied with architecture in [[Iran]] in the new era. Archaeological excavations have provided sufficient documents in support of the impacts of Sasanian architecture on the architecture of the Islamic world.
Many experts believe the period of Persian architecture from the 15th through 17th Centuries to be the most brilliant of the post-Islamic era. Various structures such as mosques, mausoleums, bazaars, bridges, and different palaces have mainly survived from this period.

In the old Persian architecture, semi-circular and oval-shaped vaults were of great interest, leading Safavi architects to display their extraordinary skills in making massive domes. In the words of D. Huff, a German archaeologist, the dome is the dominant element in Persian architecture. Domes can be seen frequently in the structure of [[bazaar]]s and mosques, particularly during the Safavi period in Isfahan. Iranian domes are distinguished for their height, proportion of elements, beauty of form, and roundness of the dome stem. The outer surfaces of the domes are mostly mosaic faced, and create a magical view. [[Safavid dynasty|Safavi]] [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] tried to achieve grandeur in scale (Isfahan's [[Naghsh-i Jahan Square]] is the 6th [[List of city squares by size|largest square]] worldwide) knowledge about building tall buildings with vast inner spaces. However, the quality of ornaments was decreased in comparison with those of the 14th and 15th centuries.

The great mosques of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Tabriz]] each used local geometry, local materials, and local building methods to express in their own ways the order, harmony, and unity of Islamic architecture. And thus when the major monuments of Islamic Persian architecture are examined, they reveal complex geometrical relationships, a studied hierarchy of form and ornament, and great depths of symbolic meaning.

Due to the extent of the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic conquests]], Islamic architecture encompasses a wide range of architectural styles from the foundation of Islam to the present day.  Both the religious and secular designs have influenced the design and construction of buildings and structures within and outside the sphere of Islamic culture.  Islamic architecture is typically based on the idea of relating to the secular or the religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/126412|title=The Islamic city: a colloquium [held at All Souls College, June 28-July 2, 1965] published under the auspices of the Near Eastern History Group, Oxford, and the Near East Centre, University of Pennsylvania;|date=1970|publisher=Cassirer|others=Hourani, Albert, 1915-1993,, Stern, S. M. (Samuel Miklos), 1920-1969., Near Eastern History Group, Oxford.|isbn=0571090850|location=Oxford,|oclc=126412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some distinctive structures in Islamic architecture are [[mosque]]s, [[tomb]]s, [[palace]]s, [[Turkish bath|baths]], and [[fort]]s, although Islamic architects have of course also applied their distinctive design precepts to domestic architecture.

The wide and long history of Islam has given rise to many local architectural styles, including [[Abbasid architecture|Abbasid]], [[Persian architecture|Persian]], [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]], [[Architecture of Central Asia|Timurid]], [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]], [[Fatimid architecture|Fatimid]], [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]], [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]], [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]], [[Chinese mosques|Sino-Islamic]] and [[African architecture|Afro-Islamic]] architecture. Notable Islamic architectural types include the early [[Abbasid architecture|Abbasid]] buildings, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of Anatolia.  Islam does not encourage the worship of idols; therefore the architecture tends to be decorated with Arabic calligraphy from the Quran rather than illustrations of scenes from it.

[[File:Lalibela Bet Giyorgis 19 (27886830573).jpg|thumb|Large, monolithic churches such as the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela]], were hewn out of the ground in Ethiopia.]]
Ethiopian architecture (including modern-day Eritrea) expanded from the Aksumite style and incorporated new traditions with the expansion of the Ethiopian state. Styles incorporated more wood and rounder structures in commoner's architecture in the center of the country and the south, and these stylistic influences were manifested in the construction of churches and monasteries. Throughout the medieval period, Aksumite architecture and influences and its monolithic tradition persisted, with its influence strongest in the early medieval (Late Aksumite) and Zagwe periods (when the churches of Lalibela were carved). Throughout the medieval period, and especially from the 10th to 12th centuries, churches were hewn out of rock throughout Ethiopia, especially during the northernmost region of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], which was the heart of the Aksumite Empire. However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as [[Adadi Maryam]] (15th century), about 100&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Addis Abeba]]. The most famous example of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the 11 monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red volcanic tuff found around the town. Though later medieval hagiographies attribute all 11 structures to the eponymous King [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela|Lalibela]] (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with only a few of the more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and ''Ethiopisant'' [[David Phillipson]] postulates, for instance, that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 A.D., originally as a fortress but was later turned into a church.&lt;ref&gt;David Keys: [http://www.archaeology.org/0411/newsbriefs/ethiopia.html Medieval Houses of God, or Ancient Fortresses?]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early modern period, the absorption of new diverse influences such as Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian style began with the arrival of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Portuguese soldiers had initially come in the mid-16th century as allies to aid Ethiopia in [[Abyssinian–Adal war|its fight against Adal]], and later Jesuits came hoping to convert the country. Some Turkish influence may have entered the country during the late 16th century during its war with the Ottoman Empire (see [[Habesh]]), which resulted in an increased building of fortresses and castles. Ethiopia, naturally easily defensible because of its numerous [[amba (geology)|amba]]s or flat-topped mountains and rugged terrain, yielded little tactical use from the structures in contrast to their advantages in the flat terrain of Europe and other areas, and so had until this point little developed the tradition. Castles were built especially beginning with the reign of [[Sarsa Dengel]] around the [[Lake Tana]] region, and subsequent Emperors maintained the tradition, eventually resulting in the creation of the [[Fasil Ghebbi]] (royal enclosure of castles) in the newly founded capital (1635), [[Gondar]]. Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia|Susenyos]] (r.1606-1632) converted to Catholicism in 1622 and attempted to make it the state religion, declaring it as such from 1624 until his abdication; during this time, he employed Arab, Gujarati (brought by the Jesuits), and Jesuit masons and their styles, as well as local masons, some of whom were [[Beta Israel]]. With the reign of his son [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]], most of these foreigners were expelled, although some of their architectural styles were absorbed into the prevailing Ethiopian architectural style. This style of the Gondarine dynasty would persist throughout the 17th and 18th centuries especially and also influenced modern 19th-century and later styles.

[[File:Great-Zimbabwe-2.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The conical tower inside the Great Enclosure in [[Great Zimbabwe]], a medieval city built by a prosperous culture.]]
[[Great Zimbabwe]] is the largest medieval city in sub-Saharan Africa. By the late nineteenth century, most buildings reflected the fashionable European [[eclecticism]] and pastisched Mediterranean, or even Northern European, styles.

In the Western [[Sahel]] region, Islamic influence was a major contributing factor to architectural development from the later ages of the [[Kingdom of Ghana]]. At [[Kumbi Saleh]], locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques, as described by [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri|al-bakri]], with one centered on [[Friday prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society of Ghana. Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana, The Society, 1957, pp81&lt;/ref&gt; The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long, forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase; with the walls and chambers filled with sculpture and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Basil. The Lost Cities of Africa. Boston: Little Brown, 1959, pp86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sudano-Sahelian|Sahelian architecture]] initially grew from the two cities of [[Djenné]] and [[Timbuktu]]. The [[Sankore|Sankore Mosque]] in [[Timbuktu]], constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the [[Great Mosque of Djenné]]. The rise of kingdoms in the West African coastal region produced architecture which drew on indigenous traditions, utilizing wood. The famed [[Benin City]], destroyed by the [[Punitive Expedition]], was a large complex of homes in coursed clay, with hipped roofs of [[Roof shingle|shingles]] or palm leaves. The Palace had a sequence of ceremonial rooms, and was decorated with [[Benin Bronzes|brass plaques]].

Indian architecture encompasses a wide variety of geographically and historically spread structures, and was transformed by the history of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that, although it is difficult to identify a single representative style, nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. The diversity of Indian culture is represented in its architecture. It is a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from West and Central Asia, as well as Europe. Architectural styles range from [[Hindu temple architecture]] to [[Islamic architecture]] to western [[classical architecture]] to [[modern architecture|modern]] and [[post-modern architecture]].

India's Urban Civilization is traceable originally to [[Mohenjodaro]] and [[Harappa]], now in Pakistan. From then on, Indian architecture and [[civil engineering]] continued to develop, manifesting in [[temple]]s, [[palace]]s and [[fort]]s across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and neighbouring regions. Architecture and civil engineering was known as ''sthapatya-kala'', literally "the art of constructing".

[[File:Fatehpur1.jpg|thumb|left|The Hall of Private Audience at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India, an early example of the [[Mughal architecture|architecture of the Mughal Empire]].]]
The temples of [[Aihole]] and [[Pattadakal]] are the earliest known examples of [[Hindu temples]]. There are numerous Hindu as well as Buddhist temples that are known as excellent examples of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]]. According to J.J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson,&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_mathematics.html ''Overview of Indian Mathematics''], School of Mathematics, University of St Andrew, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Sulbasutras]]'' were appendices to the [[Vedas]] giving ''rules for constructing altars''. "They contained quite an amount of geometrical knowledge, but the mathematics was being developed, not for its own sake, but purely for practical religious purposes."

During the [[Kushan Empire]] and [[Mauryan Empire]], Indian architecture and civil engineering reached regions like [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Statues of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] were cut out, covering entire mountain cliffs, like in [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], Afghanistan. Over a period of time, the ancient Indian art of construction blended with Greek styles and spread to [[Central Asia]].
It includes the architecture of various dynasties, such as [[Hoysala architecture]], [[Vijayanagara architecture]] and [[Western Chalukya architecture]].

The rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan Sultanates]] and [[Mughal Empire]] led to the development of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], a style that combined Islamic influences with traditional Indian styles. 

During the [[British Raj]], a new style of architecture known as the [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic revival style]] developed, which incorporated varying degrees of Indian elements into the British style. The [[Churches and convents of Goa]] which is cast in the Indian [[Baroque]] Architectural style under the orientation of the most eminent architects of the time. It is a prime example of the blending of traditional Indian styles with western European architectural styles.

[[File:Main building of Angkor Wat temple.jpg|thumb|left|Angkor Wat temple, the highest achievement of Khmer architecture.]] 
The main evidence of [[Khmer architecture]] and ultimately for Khmer civilization, however, remains the religious buildings, considerable in number and extremely varied in size. They were destined for immortal gods and as they were built of durable materials of brick, [[laterite]] and [[sandstone]], many have survived to the present day. They were usually surrounded by enclosures to protect them from evil powers but confusion has often arisen as to which is a temple enclosure and which is that of the town of which the temple was a part.

[[Angkor Wat]] temple is a great example of Khmer architectural masterpiece, was built by king [[Suryavarman II]] in 12th century. Despite the fact that it is over 800 years old, it has still maintained its top rank to be the world's largest religious structure.

{{main|Architecture of Indonesia}}
The architecture of Indonesia reflects both the [[culture of Indonesia|cultural]] diversity of the region and its rich [[History of Indonesia|historical]] inheritance. The [[Geography of Indonesia|geographic]] position of Indonesia means a transition between the culture of Asian Hindu-Buddhism architecture and animistic architecture of [[Oceanic art and architecture|Oceania]]. Indonesian wide range of vernacular styles is the legacy of an [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] architectural tradition characterized by wooden pile dwellings, high pitched roofs and extended roof ridges. The temples of Java, on the other hand, share an Indian Hindu-Buddhist ancestry, typical of Southeast Asia; though indigenous influences have led to the creation of a distinctly Indonesian style of monumental architecture. Gradual spread of Islam through the region from the 12th century onwards creates an Islamic architecture which betray a mixture of local and exotic elements. Arrival of the European merchant, especially the Dutch, shows incorporation of many Indonesian features into the architecture of the native Netherlands to produce an eclectic synthesis of Eastern and Western forms apparent in the early 18th-century [[Indies Style]] and modern [[New Indies Style]]. The years that followed independence saw the adoption of Modernist agenda on the part of Indonesian architects apparent in the architecture of the 1970s and 1980s.

===Chinese architecture===
{{Main|Chinese architecture}}
Chinese architecture refers to a style of architecture that has taken shape in East Asia over many centuries.especially Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Ryukyu. The structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Since the Tang Dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Korea, Vietnam, and Japan.

From the [[Neolithic]] era [[Longshan Culture]] and [[Bronze Age]] era [[Erlitou culture]], the earliest [[rammed earth]] fortifications exist, with evidence of [[timber framing|timber architecture]]. The subterranean ruins of the palace at [[Yinxu]] dates back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600 BC&amp;ndash;1046 BC). In historic China, architectural emphasis was laid upon the horizontal axis, in particular the construction of a heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized. This contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings. The deviation from this standard is the tower architecture of the Chinese tradition, which began as a native tradition{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} and was eventually influenced by the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] building for housing religious [[sutra]]s — the [[stupa]] — which came from Nepal. Ancient Chinese tomb model representations of multiple story residential towers and watchtowers date to the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&amp;ndash;220 AD). However, the earliest extant Buddhist [[Chinese pagoda]] is the [[Songyue Pagoda]], a 40&amp;nbsp;m (131&amp;nbsp;ft) tall circular-based brick tower built in [[Henan]] province in the year 523 AD. From the 6th century onwards, stone-based structures become more common, while the earliest are from stone and brick arches found in Han Dynasty tombs. The [[Zhaozhou Bridge]] built from 595 to 605 AD is China's oldest extant stone bridge, as well as the world's oldest fully stone [[spandrel|open-spandrel]] segmental [[arch bridge]].

[[File:Gugong.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the [[Forbidden City]]- an example of [[Chinese architecture]] from the 15th century.]]
The vocational trade of architect, craftsman, and engineer was not as highly respected in premodern Chinese society as the [[scholar-bureaucrats]] who were drafted into the government by the [[Imperial examinations|civil service examination system]]. Much of the knowledge about early Chinese architecture was passed on from one tradesman to his son or associative apprentice. However, there were several early treatises on architecture in China, with encyclopedic information on architecture dating back to the Han Dynasty. The height of the classical Chinese architectural tradition in writing and illustration can be found in the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'', a building manual written by 1100 and published by Li Jie (1065&amp;ndash;1110) in 1103. In it there are numerous and meticulous illustrations and diagrams showing the assembly of halls and building components, as well as classifying structure types and building components.

There were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the Emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles; yellow having been the Imperial color, yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the [[Forbidden City]]. The [[Temple of Heaven]], however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets, a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surface of the walls, tend to be red in colour.

Many current Chinese architectural designs follow [[post-modern]] and [[Western world|western]] styles.

=== Korean architecture ===
{{main|Korean architecture}}

The basic construction form is more or less similar to Eastern Asian building system.  From a technical point of view, buildings are structured vertically and horizontally. A construction usually rises from a stone subfoundation to a curved roof covered with tiles, held by a console structure and supported on posts; walls are made of earth (adobe) or are sometimes totally composed of movable wooden doors. Architecture is built according to the {{not a typo|k'an}} unit, the distance between two posts (about 3.7 meters), and is designed so that there is always a transitional space between the "inside" and the "outside."

The console, or bracket structure, is a specific architectonic element that has been designed in various ways through time. If the simple bracket system was already in use under the Goguryeo kingdom (37 BCE–668 CE)—in palaces in Pyongyang, for instance—a curved version, with brackets placed only on the column heads of the building, was elaborated during the early Koryo dynasty (918–1392). The Amita Hall of the Pusok temple in Antong is a good example. Later on (from the mid-Koryo period to the early Choson dynasty), a multiple-bracket system, or an inter-columnar-bracket set system, was developed under the influence of Mongol's Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). In this system, the consoles were also placed on the transverse horizontal beams. Seoul's Namtaemun Gate Namdaemun, Korea's foremost national treasure, is perhaps the most symbolic example of this type of structure.
In the mid-Choson period, the winglike bracket form appeared (one example is the Yongnyongjon Hall of Jongmyo, Seoul), which is interpreted by many scholars as an example of heavy Confucian influence in Joseon Korea, which emphasized simplicity and modesty in such shrine buildings. Only in buildings of importance like palaces or sometimes temples (Tongdosa, for instance) were the multicluster brackets still used. Confucianism also led to more sober and simple solutions.

[[File:Himeji Castle The Keep Towers.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Himeji Castle]] from Nishi-no-maru]]

Japanese architecture has as long a history as any other aspect of Japanese culture.  it also shows a number of important differences and aspects which are uniquely Japanese.

Two new forms of architecture were developed in medieval Japan in response to the militaristic climate of the times: the [[castle]], a defensive structure built to house a feudal lord and his soldiers in times of trouble; and the ''shoin'', a reception hall and private study area designed to reflect the relationships of lord and vassal within a feudal society.

Because of the need to rebuild Japan after World War II, major Japanese cities contain numerous examples of modern architecture. Japan played some role in modern [[skyscraper]] design, because of its long familiarity with the cantilever principle to support the weight of heavy tiled temple roofs. New [[city planning]] ideas based on the principle of layering or cocooning around an inner space (oku), a Japanese spatial concept that was adapted to urban needs, were adapted during reconstruction. [[Modernism]] became increasingly popular in architecture in Japan starting in the 1950s.

===Mesoamerican architecture===
{{main|Mesoamerican architecture}}
Mesoamerican architecture is the set of architectural traditions produced by pre-Columbian cultures and civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], (such as the Olmec, [[Maya architecture|Maya]], and [[Aztec architecture|Aztec]]) traditions which are best known in the form of public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures. The distinctive features of Mesoamerican architecture encompass a number of different regional and historical styles, which however are significantly interrelated. These styles developed throughout the different phases of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican history]] as a result of the intensive cultural exchange between the different cultures of the Mesoamerican culture area through thousands of years. Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] which are the largest such structures outside of [[Ancient Egypt]].

===Incan architecture===
{{main|Incan architecture}}
[[File:Sunset across Machu Picchu.jpg|thumb|150px|left|View of [[Machu Picchu]]]]
Incan architecture consists of the major construction achievements developed by the [[Incas]]. The Incas developed an extensive [[Inca road system|road system]] spanning most of the western length of the continent. [[Inca rope bridge]]s could be considered the world's first suspension bridges. Because the Incas used no wheels (It would have been impractical for the terrain) or horses, they built their roads and bridges for foot and pack-[[llama]] traffic. Much of present-day architecture at the former Inca capital [[Cuzco]] shows both Incan and Spanish influences. The famous lost city [[Machu Picchu]] is the best surviving example of Incan architecture. Another significant site is [[Ollantaytambo]]. The Inca were sophisticated stone cutters whose masonry used no mortar.

The [[Mississippian culture]] was among the [[Mound builder (people)|mound-building peoples]], noted for construction of large earthen [[platform mound]]s.

Impermanent buildings, which were often architecturally unique from region to region, continue to influence American architecture today. In his summary, "The World of Textiles", North Carolina State's Tushar Ghosh provides one example: the Denver International Airport's roof is a fabric structure that was influenced by and/or resembles the tipis of local cultures. In writing about [https://archive.is/20071014131553/http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/NAS/ Evergreen State College], Lloyd Vaughn lists an example of very different native architecture that also influenced contemporary building: the Native American Studies program is housed in a modern-day longhouse derived from pre-Columbian Pacific Northwest architecture.

===Medieval architecture===
{{Main|Medieval architecture}}
{{see also|Architecture of Kievan Rus'|Norse architecture}}
Surviving examples of medieval secular architecture mainly served for defense. [[Castle]]s and [[fortified wall]]s provide the most notable remaining non-religious examples of medieval architecture. Windows gained a cross-shape for more than decorative purposes: they provided a perfect fit for a [[crossbow]]man to safely shoot at invaders from inside. [[Crenellation]] walls ([[battlement]]s) provided shelters for archers on the roofs to hide behind when not shooting.

====Pre-Romanesque====
{{Main|Pre-Romanesque art and architecture}}
{{see also|First Romanesque}}

Western European architecture in the [[Early Middle Ages]] may be divided into [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] and [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], including [[Merovingian art and architecture|Merovingian]], [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]], [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian]], and [[Asturian art and architecture|Asturian]]. While these terms are problematic, they nonetheless serve adequately as entries into the era. Considerations that enter into histories of each period include [[Trachtenberg]]'s "historicising" and "modernising" elements, Italian versus northern, Spanish, and Byzantine elements, and especially the religious and political maneuverings between kings, popes, and various ecclesiastic officials.

====Romanesque====
{{Main|Romanesque architecture}}
[[File:Karlstejn.jpg|thumb|[[Karlštejn]] is a large Gothic castle founded 1348 by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].]]
Romanesque, prevalent in medieval Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries, was the first pan-European style since [[Roman architecture|Roman Imperial architecture]] and examples are found in every part of the continent. The term was not contemporary with the art it describes, but rather, is an invention of modern scholarship based on its similarity to Roman architecture in forms and materials. Romanesque is characterized by a use of round or slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, and cruciform piers supporting vaults.

====Gothic====
{{Main|Gothic architecture}}
The various elements of Gothic architecture emerged in a number of 11th- and 12th-century building projects, particularly in the [[Île de France]] area, but were first combined to form what we would now recognise as a distinctively Gothic style at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|12th-century abbey church of Saint-Denis]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near [[Paris]].  Verticality is emphasized in Gothic architecture, which features almost skeletal stone structures with great expanses of glass, pared-down wall surfaces supported by external [[flying buttress]]es, pointed [[arch]]es using the [[ogive]] shape, ribbed stone vaults, clustered columns, pinnacles and sharply pointed spires. Windows contain beautiful [[stained glass]], showing stories from the [[Bible]] and from lives of [[saint]]s. Such advances in design allowed cathedrals to rise taller than ever, and it became something of an inter-regional contest to build a church as high as possible.

===Renaissance architecture===
[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].]]
{{Main|Renaissance architecture}}

The [[Renaissance]] often refers to the [[Italian Renaissance]] that began in the 14th century, but recent research has revealed the existence of similar movements around Europe before the 15th century; consequently, the term "[[Early Modern]]" has gained popularity in describing this cultural movement. This period of cultural rebirth is often credited with the restoration of scholarship in the Classical Antiquities and the absorption of new scientific and philosophical knowledge that fed the arts.

The development from [[Medieval]] architecture concerned the way [[geometry]] mediated between the intangibility of light and the tangibility of the material as a way of relating divine creation to mortal existence. This relationship was changed in some measure by the invention of [[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] which brought a sense of infinity into the realm of human comprehension through the new representations of the horizon, evidenced in the expanses of space opened up in Renaissance painting, and helped shape new [[humanism|humanist]] thought.

Perspective represented a new understanding of space as a universal, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' fact, understood and controllable through human reason. Renaissance buildings therefore show a different sense of conceptual clarity, where spaces were designed to be understood in their entirety from a specific fixed viewpoint. The power of Perspective to universally represent reality was not limited to ''describing'' experiences, but also allowed it to anticipate experience itself by projecting the image back into reality.
&lt;!--should this be kept?:
[[Donato Bramante]]'s [[Cortile del Belvedere]] project is one such instance where spaces were pictured/designed together before being built. Such a space was only possible due to the powers of abstraction, offered by perspective, that allowed the composition of heterogeneous activities into a metaphor for the legitimacy of current rule. The commission was set by [[Pope Julius II]] to connect an ancient pontifical palace on the right of St Peter's with the palace, built by Pollaiolo for Innocent VIII. In doing so Bramante organised the ascent through three courts that sees the lower, theatrical level move into the upper level through increasingly planned gardens thereby creating a tension between the human realm and an idealised vision of the "ideal city", Jerusalem, this is explicitly shown in Bramante's depiction of the ascent from the perspective of Pope Julius's bedroom window.--&gt;

The Renaissance spread to France in the late 15th century, when [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] returned in 1496 with several Italian artists from his conquest of Naples. Renaissance chateaux were built in the Loire Valley, the earliest example being the [[Château d'Amboise]], and the style became dominant under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515–47). (See [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley]]). The [[Château de Chambord]] is a combination of Gothic structure and Italianate ornament, a style which progressed under architects such as Sebastiano Serlio, who was engaged after 1540 in work at the [[Château de Fontainebleau]].

Architects such as [[Philibert Delorme]], [[Androuet du Cerceau]], [[Giacomo Vignola]], and [[Pierre Lescot]], were inspired by the new ideas. The southwest interior facade of the Cour Carree of the [[Louvre]] in Paris was designed by Lescot and covered with exterior carvings by [[Jean Goujon]]. Architecture continued to thrive in the reigns of Henry II and Henry III.

In England the first great exponent of Renaissance architecture was [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of [[Palladio]] was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the [[Queen's House]] at Greenwich in 1616 and the Banqueting House at [[Whitehall]] three years later. These works with their clean lines and symmetry, were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and turrets.

With the rise of various European [[colonial empire]]s from the 16th century onward through the early 20th century, the new stylistic trends of Europe were exported to or adopted by locations around the world, often evolving into new regional variations.

===Baroque architecture===
{{Main|Baroque architecture}}

The periods of [[Mannerism]] and the [[Baroque]] that followed the Renaissance signaled an increasing anxiety over meaning and representation. Important developments in science and philosophy had separated mathematical representations of reality from the rest of culture, fundamentally changing the way humans related to their world through architecture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It would reach its most extreme and embellished development under the decorative tastes of [[Rococo]].

===Return to Classicism===
{{main|Palladian architecture|Neoclassical architecture}}

In the late 17th and 18th centuries, the works and theories of [[Andrea Palladio]] (from 16th-century Venice) would again be interpreted and adopted in England, spread by the English translation of his [[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]], and pattern books such as ''Vitruvius Brittanicus'' by [[Colen Campbell]]. This [[Palladian architecture]] and continued classical imagery would in turn go on to influence [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other early architects of the United States in their search for a new national architecture.

By the mid-18th century, there tended to be more restrained decoration and usage of authentic classical forms than in the Baroque, informed by increased visitation to classical ruins as part of the [[Grand Tour]], coupled with the excavations of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]].

[[Federal architecture|Federal-style architecture]] is the name for the classicizing architecture built in [[North America]] between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815.  This style shares its name with its era, the [[Federalist Era|Federal Period]]. The term is also used in association with furniture design in the United States of the same time period. The style broadly corresponds to the middle-class classicism of [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Regency style]] in Britain and to the French [[Empire style]].

Beaux-Arts architecture&lt;ref&gt;The phrase ''Beaux Arts'' is usually translated as "[[Fine Arts]]" in non-architectural English contexts.&lt;/ref&gt; denotes the academic classical [[architectural style]] that was taught at the [[École des Beaux Arts]] in Paris. The ''style "Beaux-Arts"'' is above all the cumulative product of two and a half centuries of instruction under the authority, first of the Académie royale d'architecture, then, following the Revolution, of the Architecture section of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The organization under the Ancien Régime of the competition for the [[Grand Prix de Rome]] in architecture, offering a chance to study in Rome, imprinted its codes and esthetic on the course of instruction, which culminated during the [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] (1850–1870) and the Third Republic that followed. The style of instruction that produced Beaux-Arts architecture continued without a major renovation until 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Middleton, Editor.

===Art Nouveau===

{{main|Art Nouveau}}
Around 1900 a number of architects around the world began developing new architectural solutions to integrate traditional precedents with new social demands and technological possibilities. The work of [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]] in Brussels, [[Antoni Gaudí]] in Barcelona, [[Otto Wagner]] in Vienna and [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow, among many others, can be seen as a common struggle between old and new.

===Early Modern architecture===
{{Further|Modern architecture}}
&lt;!--[[File:Falling Water 01.jpg|thumb]]--&gt;

Early Modern architecture began with a number of building styles with similar characteristics, primarily the simplification of form and the elimination of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], that first arose around 1900. By the 1940s these styles had largely consolidated and been identified as the [[international style (architecture)|International Style]].

The exact characteristics and origins of modern architecture are still open to interpretation and debate. An important trigger appears to have been the [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] credited to [[Louis Sullivan]]: "[[form follows function]]". '''Functionalism''', in architecture, is the principle that architects should design a building based on the purpose of that building. This statement is less self-evident than it first appears, and is a matter of confusion and controversy within the profession, particularly in regard to [[modern architecture]].

===Expressionist architecture===
[[File:Goetheanum.jpg|thumb|[[Goetheanum]] by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in 1923]]
{{Main|Expressionist architecture}}

Expressionist architecture was an architectural movement that developed in Northern Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the [[expressionism|expressionist]] visual and performing arts.

The style was characterised by an early-[[modernist architecture|modernist]] adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in many of the most important expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels''. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate.

===Art Deco===
{{main|Art Deco}}
[[File:Chrysler Building spire, Manhattan, by Carol Highsmith (LOC highsm.04444).jpg|thumb|right|140px|The [[Art Deco]] [[Chrysler Building]] in [[New York City]] (1930)]]
The [[Art Deco]] style in architecture emerged in Paris just before [[World War I]] with the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] by [[Auguste Perret]] (1911-1913) and the Majorelle Building by [[Henri Sauvage]] (1913). Its revolutionary use of reinforced concrete, geometric forms, straight lines, and decorative sculpture applied to the outside of the building in plaques of marble, ceramics and stucco, and later in stainless steel, were a departure from [[Art Nouveau]].  The style reached its peak in the 1920s and 1930s, and took its name from the [[International Exhibition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts]] in Paris in 1925.  Art Deco became especially popular in the United States in the late 1920s, where the style was used for [[skyscrapers]] including the [[Chrysler Building]] (1930) and [[Empire State Building]] (1931), and for lavish motion picture palaces including [[Radio City Music Hall]] (1932) in [[New York City]] and the [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]] in [[Oakland, California]].  In the 1930s a stripped-down variation called [[Streamline Moderne]] emerged, which was inspired by the curving aerodynamic forms of ocean liners, airplanes and trains.  Art Deco was used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations and movie theaters around the world in the 1930s, but declined rapidly at the end of the decade due to the [[Great Depression]] and intense criticism of the style by modernist architects such as [[Le Corbusier]], who denounced what he felt was its excessive ornament. By 1939, the style was largely out of fashion and was replaced by the more austere [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]].{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=175-206}}

===International Style===
[[File:Glaspaleis front-east.jpg|thumb|The [[Glaspaleis|Glass Palace]], a celebration of transparency, in Heerlen, The Netherlands (1935)]]
{{Main| International style (architecture)}}

The International style was a major [[architectural style|architectural trend]] of the 1920s and 1930s. The term usually refers to the buildings and architects of the formative decades of modernism, before World War II. The term had its origin from the name of a book by [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] and [[Philip Johnson]] which identified, categorised and expanded upon characteristics common to modernism across the world. As a result, the focus was more on the stylistic aspects of modernism. The basic design principles of the International Style thus constitute part of [[modernism]].

The ideas of Modernism were developed especially in what was taught at the German [[Bauhaus]] School in [[Weimar]] (from 1919), [[Dessau]] (between 1926–32) and finally [[Berlin]] between 1932–33, under the leadership first of its founder [[Walter Gropius]], then [[Hannes Meyer]], and finally [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. Modernist theory in architecture resided in the attempt to bypass the question of what [[Architectural style|style]] a building should be built in, a concern that had overshadowed 19th-century architecture, and the wish to reduce form to its most minimal expression of structure and function. In the United States, [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] treated this new phenomenon in 1931 as if it represented a new style - the [[international style (architecture)|International Style]], thereby misrepresenting its primary mission as merely a matter of eliminating traditional [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]]. The core effort to pursue Modern architecture as an abstract, scientific programme was more faithfully carried forward in [[Europe]], but issues of style always overshadowed its stricter and more puritan goals, not least in the work of [[Le Corbusier]].

===Modern architecture===
{{Main|Modern architecture}}
Modern architecture is generally characterized by simplification of form and creation of ornament from the structure and theme of the building. It is a term applied to an overarching movement, with its exact definition and scope varying widely.&lt;ref name=GEMbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth, Efficiency, and Modernism|url=http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration|accessdate=March 2011|pages=14–15|origyear=2003|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110331105542/http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern architecture has continued into the 21st century as a contemporary style, especially for corporate office buildings.  In a broader sense, modern architecture began at the turn of the 20th century with efforts to reconcile the principles underlying architectural design with rapid technological advancement and the [[modernization]] of society. It would take the form of numerous movements, schools of design, and architectural styles, some in tension with one another, and often equally defying such classification.&lt;ref name=GEMbook /&gt;

===Critical regionalism===
[[File:Sydney Opera House Sails.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sydney Opera House]] - designed to evoke the sails of yachts in Sydney harbour]]
{{Main|Critical regionalism}}

Critical regionalism is an approach to architecture that strives to counter the placelessness and lack of meaning in [[Modern architecture]] by using contextual forces to give a sense of place and meaning. The term critical regionalism was first used by [[Alexander Tzonis]] and [[Liane Lefaivre]] and later more famously by [[Kenneth Frampton]].

Frampton put forth his views in "Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points of an architecture of resistance." He evokes [[Paul Ricœur]]'s question of "how to become modern and to return to sources; how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in universal civilization". According to Frampton, critical regionalism should adopt modern architecture critically for its universal progressive qualities but at the same time should value responses particular to the context. Emphasis should be on topography, climate, light, tectonic form rather than scenography and the tactile sense rather than the visual. Frampton draws from [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] to supplement his arguments.

Postmodern architecture is an international style whose first examples are generally cited as being from the 1950s, and which continues to influence present-day architecture. [[Postmodernity]] in architecture is generally thought to be heralded by the return of "wit, ornament and reference" to architecture in response to the formalism of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] of modernism. As with many cultural movements, some of postmodernism's most pronounced and visible ideas can be seen in architecture. The [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]] and formalized shapes and spaces of the [[Modernism|modernist]] movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse [[aesthetics]]: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound.

Classic examples of [[modern architecture]] are the [[Lever House]] and the [[Seagram Building]] in commercial space, and the architecture of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] or the [[Bauhaus]] movement in private or communal spaces. Transitional examples of postmodern architecture are the [[Portland Building]] in [[Portland, OR|Portland]] and the [[Sony Building (New York City)]] (originally AT&amp;T Building) in New York City, which borrows elements and references from the past and reintroduces color and symbolism to architecture. A prime example of inspiration for postmodern architecture lies along the [[Las Vegas Strip]], which was studied by [[Robert Venturi]] in his 1972 book ''Learning from Las Vegas'' celebrating the strip's ordinary and common architecture. Venturi opined that "Less is a bore", inverting [[Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s dictum that "Less is more".

Following the postmodern movement, a renaissance of pre-modernist urban and architectural ideals established itself, with [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] being prominent movements.

{{Main|Deconstructivism}}

Deconstructivism in architecture is a development of [[postmodern architecture]] that began in the late 1980s. It is characterized by ideas of fragmentation, [[Nonlinear (arts)|non-linear]] processes of design, an interest in manipulating ideas of a structure's surface or skin, and apparent [[non-Euclidean geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Origins of Geometry'', Introduction by Jacques Derrida&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., non-[[rectilinear polygon|rectilinear]] shapes) which serve to distort and dislocate some of the [[Design principles and elements|elements of architecture]], such as structure and [[building envelope|envelope]]. The finished visual appearance of buildings that exhibit the many deconstructivist "styles" is characterised by a stimulating unpredictability and a controlled chaos.

Important events in the history of the deconstructivist movement include the 1982 [[Parc de la Villette]] [[architectural design competition]] (especially the entry from [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Peter Eisenman]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman, ''Chora L Works'' (New York: Monacelli Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bernard Tschumi]]'s winning entry), the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s 1988 ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' exhibition in New York, organized by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Mark Wigley]], and the 1989 opening of the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition featured works by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelblau]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Since the exhibition, many of the architects who were associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from the term. Nonetheless, the term has stuck and has now, in fact, come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.

==Architecture in the 21st century==
[[File:Freiburg 071ss.jpg|thumb|[[Energy-plus-house]]s at [[Vauban, Freiburg|Freiburg-Vauban]] in Germany]]
On January 21, 2013 architects began preparations for constructing the world's first [[3D printing|3D-printed]] building. An industrial-scale 3D printer used high strength artificial marble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21121061|title=Architect plans 3D-printed buildings|publisher=BBC|date=21 January 2013|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies around the world have 3D-printed numerous buildings, many only taking a few hours to be completed. 3D-printed buildings have been shown to be practical, cost effective, and environmentally friendly. The technology is being expanded to other frameworks.

[[Sustainable architecture]] is an important topic in contemporary architecture, including the trends of [[New Urbanism]], [[New Classical architecture]] and [[Eco-cities]].

'''Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research''' '''(IGCAR)''' is one of [[India]]'s premier [[Nuclear physics|nuclear research]] centres. It is the second largest establishment of the [[Department of Atomic Energy, India|Department of Atomic Energy]] (DAE), next to [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre|Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC)]], located at [[Kalpakkam]], 80&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Chennai]], India.&lt;ref name="About IGCAR"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.igcar.ernet.in/igc2004/igc.htm|title = About IGCAR|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1971 as an exclusive centre dedicated to the pursuit of fast reactor science and technology, due to the vision of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.&lt;ref name=IGCnewsOct04 /&gt; Originally, it was called as '''Reactor Research Centre (RRC)'''. It was renamed as '''Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research''' '''(IGCAR)''' by the then Prime Minister of India, '''Rajiv Gandhi''' in December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1726/17261240.htm|title = A mission at Kalpakkam: Frontline article|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre is engaged in broad-based multidisciplinary programme of scientific research and advanced engineering directed towards the development of Fast Breeder Reactor technology, in India.&lt;ref name="About IGCAR"/&gt;

The present Director of IGCAR is '''A. K. Bhaduri'''. He has taken over as Director with effect from 1 July 2016, following the superannuation of Dr. S. A. V. Satya Murty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/satya-murty-is-next-igcar-director/article7601563.ece|title = Dr. A.K.

==History==

The fast reactor related research in India, originated at BARC, Mumbai. Later, RRC was established at Kalpakkam with the same mandate.&lt;ref name=IGCnewsOct04 /&gt; The Central Workshop, Safety Research Laboratory and Materials Sciences Laboratory were constructed in 1975–1976. Soon, the Radio-Chemistry Lab and Electronics and Instrumentation Lab were constructed.

The centre houses a Fast Breeder Test Reactor ([[FBTR]]), which attained its first criticality in October 1985.&lt;ref name=IGCnewsOct04 /&gt;

A few years later, in 1994, SQUID, ASIC and Diamond Anvil Cells were developed. In the same year, High-Power Physics and Engineering Experiments were undertaken in the FBTR.

In 1996, [[KAMINI]] reactor reached criticality. State-of-the-art Neutronic Channels were commissioned for FBTR in 1999.

A Boron-Enrichment Plant was commissioned in April 2001.

A BARC Training School&lt;ref name=IGCnewsOct04&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.igcar.ernet.in/lis/nl62/igc62.pdf |title = IGC newsletter |date = October 2004 |volume=62 |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was started in 2006. In 2009,  FBTR was operated at a maximum power level of 18.6 MWt with 55 sub-assemblies for 1732 hours.

== Commercial Reactors ==
{{main article|Madras Atomic Power Station}}
The facility houses two [[PHWR]]s that generate 220MWe each that operate for commercial purposes. These are managed independently by the [[Nuclear Power Corporation of India]].&lt;ref name="globalsecurity1"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/india/kalpakkam.htm |title=Kalpakkam Reprocessing Plant – India Special Weapons Facilities |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Reactors ==

There are three research reactors at IGCAR.

*[[FBTR]] is a liquid metal cooled [[fast breeder test reactor]], maintained by Reactor Operation and Maintenance Group (ROMG).
*[[KAMINI]] 30&amp;nbsp;kW(t) reactor, starred in 1996, uses [[Uranium 233]] fuel transformed from [[Thorium]] in the FBTR.
*[[Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor]], a 500MWe fast breeder reactor using Mixed Oxide (Uranium oxide + Plutonium oxide) fuel based on the [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/09/07/stories/2005090704781300.htm |title=Kalpakkam PFBR to be completed ahead of schedule |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=7 September 2005 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Research Facility also built the 100MWe reactor for India's first nuclear submarine the [[Arihant class submarine]] project and operated it on land for testing purposes since it attained criticality in December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/11/25/stories/2005112502201400.htm |title=ATV project: India crosses major milestone |publisher=Hindu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The submarine launched on 26 July 2009 has this reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rajat Pandit, TNN 17 Jul 2009, 01.10&amp;nbsp;am IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-17/india/28203215_1_nuclear-powered-submarine-atv-project-ins-arihant |title=India set to launch nuclear-powered submarine |publisher=The Times of India |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reprocessing Plant ==
The Kalpakkam Atomic Reprocessing Plant [KARP] facility has been estimated to have a capacity to reprocess 100 tonnes of spent fuel [[plutonium]] per annum.it incorporates a number of innovative features such as hybrid maintenance concept in hot cells using servo-manipulators and engineered provisions for extending the life of the plant. This plant will cater to the needs of reprocessing fuels from MAPS as well as [[FBTR]]. It has mastered the technology of reprocessing highly irradiated mixed carbide fuel for the first time in the world. 
&lt;ref name="globalsecurity1"/&gt;

==Fast Reactor Fuel Reprocessing at IGCAR ==

Reprocessing Development Laboratory was designed in early seventies and the commissioning of inactive facilities was carried
out in 1976. The plutonium handling facilities were cleared for operation in 1980. The reprocessing of irradiated thorium rods which was carried out during the period 1989 to 1992 in the concrete shielded cells, was the first major radioactive operation. The [[Uranium 233|U-233]] recovered during the operation was used in fabricating the fuel for the KAlpakkam MINI reactor (KAMINI). U-233 was also useful for the fuel development programme for carrying out the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor test fuel irradiation experiments in Fast Breeder Test Reactor. Apart from this, the operation aided in validating the equipment and design of system as well as the manpower training. Later a hot cell facility for reprocessing of Fast Breeder Test Reactor fuel was conceived which had the necessary features for delivering the product with all the uncertainties in the dissolution of irradiated fuel and process flowsheet. Added to this was the need for the deployment of the yet to be proven designs of centrifuge and centrifugal extractors without which the success of the PUREX process for fast reactor fuel reprocessing would be doubtful. With these minimal inputs, the hot cell facility, Lead Mini Cell (LMC) was created, which was later rechristened as CORAL (COmpact Reprocessing facility for Advanced fuels in Lead cells). Based on the dissolution experiments carried out on unirradiated single pellets and systematic studies related to the third phase formation, the flow sheet, prepared earlier for the oxide fuel was modified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igcar.ernet.in/igc2004/oct11-vol-90.pdf |title=October 2011 – Volume 90 |publisher=igcar.ernet.in |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strategic &amp; Human Resources Planning Section'''

==Staff==

The Centre has a staff strength of 2514 including 1243  Engineers and Scientists.

==Budget==

The annual outlay of the Centre is around 8450 Million INR towards its Research &amp; Development activities and plan.

==Collaborations==

The interaction with IIT-M started in 1995 through two collaborative projects, which were initiated with late Dr. R.S. Alwar, eminent
professor in Applied Mechanics. The first project was on simulation of thermal shock on the control plug mockup and the second was
on simulation of thermal striping in the core structure. An MoU was established on 19 July 1997 for the formation of ‘IGCAR- IITM
Cell’ with Prof. R. Natarajan (then Director, IIT-M) as chairman and late Dr. Placid Rodriguez as Co-Chairman. Prof. K.V.S. Rama Rao
was Dean, ICSR during that period. In the first cell meeting held on 26 February 1997, seven projects were identified. Based on the

In the [[visual arts]], '''interlace''' is a decorative element found in  [[medieval art]]. In interlace, bands or portions of other [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s are looped, [[braid]]ed, and [[knot]]ted in complex [[geometry|geometric]] patterns, often to fill a space. Interlacing is common in the [[Migration period art]] of [[Northern Europe]], especially in the [[Insular art]] of Ireland and the British Isles and [[Norse art]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]] and in [[Islamic interlace patterns|Islamic art]].

Intricate braided and interlaced patterns, called ''plaits'' in British usage, are found in late [[Roman art]] in many parts of Europe, in [[mosaic]] floors and other media.  [[Coptic art|Coptic manuscripts and textiles]] of 5th- and 6th-century Christian Egypt are decorated with broad-strand ribbon interlace ornament bearing a "striking resemblance" to the earliest types of knotwork found in the [[Insular art]] manuscripts of Ireland and the  [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name="M1"&gt;Mitchell et al. 1977, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and application==

[[File:Torque de Foxados - Detalle.JPG|thumb|left|Interlace and [[rotational symmetry]]: Iron Age ''Torque de Foxados'', Museo de [[Pontevedra]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]]]

===Northern Europe===
Interlace is a key feature of the "Style II" [[animal style]] decoration of Migration Period art, and is found widely across Northern Europe, and was carried by the [[Lombards]] into Northern Italy.  Typically the long "ribbons" eventually terminate in an animal's head.  By about 700 it becomes less common in most of Europe, but continues to develop in the British Isles and [[Scandinavia]], where it is found on metalwork, woodcarving, [[runestone]]s, [[high cross]]es, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the 7th to 12th centuries.  Artist [[George Bain (artist)|George Bain]] has characterised the early Insular knotwork found in the 7th-century [[Book of Durrow]] and the [[Durham Cathedral]] [[Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)|Gospel Book fragment]] as "broken and rejoined" braids.&lt;ref&gt;Bain 1973, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Coptic braid patterns were transmitted directly to [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]] [[monastery|monasteries]] from the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] or came via [[Lombards|Lombardic]] Italy is uncertain.&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt; Art historian [[James Johnson Sweeney]] argued for direct communication between the [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] of [[Early history of Ireland|Early Christian Ireland]] and the Coptic monasteries of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop 2001, p.270&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
This new style featured elongated beasts intertwined into symmetrical shapes, and can be dated to the mid-7th century based on the accepted dating of examples in the [[Sutton Hoo]] treasure.&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt;   The most elaborate interlaced [[zoomorphism|zoomorphics]] occur in [[Viking Age]] art of the [[Urnes style]] (arising before 1050), where tendrils of foliate designs intertwine with the stylized animals.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Campbell 1980, pp. 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The full-flowering of Northern European interlace occurred in the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the animal style ornament of Northern Europe blended with ribbon knotwork and Christian influences in such works as the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' and the [[Cross of Cong]].&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt;  Whole [[carpet page]]s were illuminated with abstract patterns, including much use of interlace, and stone [[high cross]]es combined interlace panels with figurative ones.  Insular interlace was copied in continental Europe, closely in the [[Franco-Saxon school]] of the 8th to 11th centuries, and less so in other [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] schools of illumination, where the tendency was to [[foliage|foliate]] decorative forms.  In [[Romanesque art]] these became typical, and the interlace generally much less complex.  Some animal forms are also found.

===Islamic art===
{{main|Islamic interlace patterns}}
Geometric interlacing patterns are common in Islamic ornament. They can be considered a particular type of [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]. [[Umayyad architecture|Umayyad architectural]] elements such as floor [[mosaics]], window grilles, carvings and wall paintings, and decorative metal work of the 8th to 10th centuries are followed by the intricate interlacings common in later medieval [[Islamic art]]. Interlaced elaborations are also found in [[Kufic]] [[calligraphy]].

===Southern Europe===
Interlace and knotwork are often found in [[Byzantine art]], continuing Roman usage, but they are not given great prominence. One notable example of a widespread local usage of interlace is the [[Croatian wattle|three-ribbon interlace]] found in the [[Early middle ages|early]] [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|medieval Croatia]] on stone carvings from the 9th to 11th centuries.

'''Katabasis''' or '''catabasis''' ({{lang-grc|κατάβασις}}, from {{lang|grc|κατὰ}} "down" and {{lang|grc|βαίνω}} "go") is a descent of some type, such as moving downhill, the sinking of the winds or sun, a military retreat, a trip to the [[underworld]], or a trip from the interior of a country down to the coast. The term has multiple related meanings in poetry, rhetoric, and modern psychology.

==A trip to the coast==
The term catabasis can refer to a trip from the interior of a country down to the coast (for example, following a river), in contrast to the term "[[wikt:anabasis|anabasis]]", which refers to an expedition from a coastline up into the interior of a country.

The main meaning given for catabasis by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') describes "A going down; a military retreat, in allusion to that of the ten thousand Greeks under [[Xenophon]], related by him in his [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|''Anabasis'']]:
{{quotation|1837 [[Thomas De Quincey|DE QUINCEY]] ''Revolt Tartars Wks''. 1862 IV. 112 The Russian anabasis and catabasis of Napoleon. 1899 ''Westm. Gaz.'' 17 May 4/1 Little space is devoted to the ''Anabasis''; it is, as in the story of Xenophon, the ''Catabasis'' which fills the larger part.| [[Oxford English Dictionary]] - catabasis}}

In the opening of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'', [[Socrates]] recounts "going down" to the port city of [[Piraeus]], located south of his native [[Athens]].  Several scholars, including [[Allan Bloom]], have read this first word, {{lang|grc|κατέβην}} ("I went down") as an allusion to [[Odysseus]]' journey into the [[underworld]].

==Arts==
In [[poetry]] and [[rhetoric]], the term ''katabasis'' refers to a "gradual descending" of emphasis on a theme within a sentence or paragraph, while ''anabasis'' refers to a gradual ascending in emphasis. John Freccero notes, "In the ancient world, [the] descent in search of understanding was known as katabasis",{{sfn|Freccero|1988|p=108}} thus endowing mythic and poetic accounts of katabasis with a symbolic significance.

==Modern psychology==
In modern psychology, the term ''katabasis'' is sometimes used to describe the [[depression (mood)|depression]] some young men experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.org.uk/picasso/jung_article.html Jung's 1932 Article on Picasso]&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Robert Bly]] proposes in his book ''[[Iron John: A Book About Men]]'' several reasons for the "catabasis phenomenon", amongst them the lack of Western [[initiation rite]]s and the lack of strong [[father figure]]s and [[role model]]s.

==Trip into the underworld==
The trip to the underworld is a [[mytheme]] of [[comparative mythology]] found in a diverse number of religions from around the world. The [[hero]] or upper-world deity journeys to the [[underworld]] or to the land of the dead and returns, often with a [[quest]]-object or a loved one, or with heightened knowledge. The ability to enter the realm of the dead while still alive, and to return, is a proof of the classical hero's exceptional status as more than mortal. A deity who returns from the underworld demonstrates [[Eschatology|eschatological]] themes such as the cyclical nature of time and existence, or the defeat of death and the possibility of [[immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2005|p=98}}; {{harvnb|Edmonds III|2004||loc=''passim''}}; {{harvnb|Collins|Fishbane|1995|loc=''passim''}}; and {{harvnb|Louden|2011|pp=197–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Katabasis'' is the epic convention of the hero's trip into the [[underworld]].{{sfn|Serrano|1999|pp=129–179}} In [[Greek mythology]], for example, [[Orpheus]] enters the underworld in order to bring [[Eurydice]] back to the world of the living.

Most ''katabases'' take place in a supernatural underworld, such as [[Hades]] or [[Hell]] —  as in [[Nekyia]], the 11th book of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', which describes [[Odysseus]]'s descent to the underworld. However, ''katabas''is can also refer to a journey through other ''dystopi''c areas, like those Odysseus encounters on his 10-year journey back from [[Troy]] to [[Ithaca]]. Pilar Serrano{{sfn|Serrano|1999|pp=129–179}} allows the term ''katabasis'' to encompass brief or chronic stays in the underworld, including those of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], and [[Castor and Pollux]].  In this case, however, the ''katabasis'' must be followed by an ''[[wikt:anabasis|anabasis]]'' (a going or marching up) in order to be considered a true ''katabasis'' instead of a death.

=== The ''Odyssey'' ===
[[File:Alessandro Allori - Odysseus questions the seer Tiresias.jpg|thumb|Odysseus consults the soul of the prophet Tiresias in his ''katabasis'' during the 11th book of the ''Odyssey.'']]
In the 11th book of the ''Odyssey'', Odysseus follows the advice of Circe and consults Tiresias in the land of the dead.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=10: 504 – 11: 50}} During Odysseus' visit, the souls of many appear to him. The first to appear to Odysseus is [[Elpenor]], his crew member who died prior to leaving Circe's island. Elpenor asks Odysseus to give him a proper burial, and Odysseus agrees.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 51–83}}  The next to appear to Odysseus is his mother, [[Anticlea]]. As Odysseus has been away fighting the Trojan War for nearly 20 years, he is surprised and saddened by the sight of her soul.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 84–89}}

[[Tiresias]], the soul whom Odysseus came to see, next appears to him. Tiresias gives him several pieces of information concerning his ''[[nostos]]'' (homecoming) and his life after. Tiresias details [[Poseidon|Poseidon's]] anger at Odysseus' blinding of [[Polyphemus|Polyphemos]] (and the coming troubles as a consequence), warns Odysseus not to eat the livestock of the god [[Helios]], and prophesies Odysseus' return home to [[Ithaca]] and his eventual death at sea at an old age.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 90–137}} After Tiresias instructs Odysseus to allow the spirits he wants to talk to drink the sacrificial blood he used to find Tiresias, he is again given the chance to see his mother, and she tells him of the suffering of his family as they await his return home.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 145–224}} As his mother leaves, Odysseus is then visited by a string of souls of past queens. He first sees [[Tyro]], the mother of [[Pelias]] and [[Neleus]] by Poseidon.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 235–259}}

He next talks to [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]], the mother of [[Amphion and Zethus]] (the founders of Thebes) by [[Zeus]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 260–265}} Then, he is visited by [[Alcmene]], the mother of [[Heracles]] by Zeus, and Heracle's wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 266–270}} He is also visited by [[Jocasta|Epicaste,]] the mother of Oedipus, and [[Chloris]], the queen of [[Pylos]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 271–285}} Odysseus is then visited by [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], the mother of [[Castor and Pollux|Castor and Polydeuces]] and [[Iphimedeia]], mother of the [[Aloadae]] by Poseidon.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 298–320}} Odysseus then sees a list of women whom he only briefly mentions: [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Procris]], [[Ariadne]], Maera, [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]], and [[Eriphyle]], all also lovers of gods or heroes.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 321–332}} Next to visit Odysseus is [[Agamemnon]], the king of [[Mycenae]]. Agamemnon tells Odysseus of his death by his wife, [[Clytemnestra]] and her lover [[Aegisthus]]. He warns Odysseus to return to Ithaca in secret and be wary of his own wife.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 385–461}}

Odysseus then encounters [[Achilles]], who asks after the well being of his father, [[Peleus]], and his son, [[Neoptolemus]]. Odysseus reassures Achilles of his son's bravery in fighting the Trojans.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 466–540}} Odysseus then begins seeing figures of dead souls who do not talk directly to him: [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], [[Minos]], [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], [[Tityos]], [[Tantalus]], and [[Sisyphus]].{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 550–600}} Odysseus ends his visit with Heracles, who asks about Odysseus' intention in Hades. Odysseus begins to get fearful as he waits for more heroes and leaves.{{sfn|Homer|1975|loc=11: 601–640}}
[[File:Scene from Virgil's Aeneid; the Cumaean Sibyl leads Aeneas t Wellcome V0042049.jpg|thumb|The Cumaean Sibyl leads Aeneas to the Underworld for his katabasis in the ''Aeneid.'']]

=== The ''Aeneid'' ===
The ''katabasis'' of Virgil's ''Aeneid'' occurs in book 6 of the epic. Unlike Odysseus, Aeneas seeks to enter the underworld, rather than bring the spirits of the dead to him through sacrifice. He begins his journey with a visit to the Cumaean Sibyl (a priestess of Apollo) and asks for her assistance to journey to the underworld and visit his father.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 1–124}} The priestess tells him to find a golden branch, and if the branch breaks off in his hands, he is fated to go to the underworld. She also tells Aeneas to bury his dead friend and prepare cattle for sacrifice.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 125–155}} When Aeneas reaches the forest to find the golden branch, he is guided by birds to the tree, and the branch breaks into his hand. The branch, however, does not easily break off as the Sibyl said would happen to a person fated to go to the Underworld - the branch is described as "cunctantem" ("hesitant"). The implications of this have been debated by scholars - some arguing that it means that Aeneas is not as heroic as he needs to be, others arguing that Aeneas has not yet fulfilled his destiny, and several arguing that he is still a hero, with this section added purely for drama. Aeneas buries Misenus and he and the Sibyl prepare a sacrifice to enter the underworld.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 176–267}} Aeneas first encounters several beings and monsters as he enters: Sorrows, Heartaches, Diseases, Senility, Terror, Hunger, Evil, Crime, Poverty, Death, Hard Labor, Sleep, Evil Pleasures of Mind, War, Family Vengeance, Mad Civil Strife, [[Scylla]], [[Hekatonkheires|Briareus]], Hydra, [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimaera]], [[Gorgon]]s, [[Harpy|Harpies]], and [[Cerberus]].{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 268–294}} Next, Aeneas encounters [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], the ferryman who leads souls into the underworld, and the mass of people who are unburied.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 295–332}} His first conversation is with Palinurus, a man of his crew who fell overboard and died on their journey. Palinurus begs Aeneas to bury him so he can enter the underworld.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 337–383}} The Sibyl convinces Charon to carry them across the river Styx in exchange for the golden bough.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 384–416}} Aeneas encounters Minos pronouncing judgment on souls and the souls that died for love: [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Procris]], [[Eriphyle]], [[Evadne]], [[Pasiphaë|Pasiphae]], [[Laodamia]], [[Caeneus]], and [[Dido]].{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 426–451}} Next, Aeneas sees heroes of battle: [[Tydeus]], Parthenopaeus, [[Adrastus]], [[Glaucus (soldier)|Glaucus]], [[Medon]], Thersilochus, [[Polybotes|Polyboetes]], Idaeus, [[Agamemnon]], and [[Deiphobus]].{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 477–534}} The Sibyl then leads Aeneas to Elysium, the place for the blessed. On the way, they pass the place for tortured souls and the Sibyl describes some of the tortured's fates. Tityos has his liver eaten by a vulture daily. Pirithous and Ixion have a rock constantly hanging over them at all times. Many others face the punishment of moving rocks, being stretched, and being tied to wheels.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 548–636}} The two then enter the Estates of the Blessed, where they see a utopian land where heroes and good people reside. There, Aeneas finds his father, who tells him of the rich history of Rome to come.{{sfn|Virgil|2007|loc=6: 637–901}}

=== The Metamorphoses ===
In Ovid's poetic collection of mythological stories, he includes accounts of ''katabasis'' as well. In book 4, he includes an account of Juno's descent to Hades to bring her perceived justice to Ino.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 578–617}} Ovid describes Juno's path to the underworld, noting Cerberus' presence.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 594–617}} Juno seeks the Furies (Tisiphone, Megara, and [[Alecto]]) to destroy the house of [[Cadmus]], namely Ino and her husband [[Athamas]]. While in the underworld, Juno passes several souls who are being punished in Hades. Hades is also a person, and he needs to get rid of those souls because he needs them to fully recover. –[[Tantalus]], [[Sisyphus]], [[Ixion]], and the [[Daughters of Danaus|Belides]].{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 624–634}} When the Furies agree to Juno's request, she happily returns to the heavens where she is purified by Iris.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=4: 649–659}}

[[File:Orpheus &amp; Euridice.jpg|thumb|Orpheus travels out of the underworld followed by the shade of his wife, Eurydice.]]
The next major ''katabasis'' in the ''Metamorphoses'' occurs in book 5 by [[Proserpina]], the daughter of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] who is kidnapped by [[Saturn (mythology)|Dis]]. As Proserpina is picking flowers, Dis falls in love with her and decides to grab her and take her to the underworld in his chariot. Worried about her now-missing daughter, Ceres becomes distraught and searches for Proserpina.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=5: 552–615}}

When Ceres discovers the kidnapping, she goes to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] to attempt to get Proserpina back. He agrees that she should be returned as long as Proserpina has not touched any food in the underworld. However, she has eaten pomegranate seeds, and cannot be returned to Ceres.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=5: 658–712}} To ensure compromise between Ceres and Dis, Jove divides the year into halves and commands that Proserpina must spend equal parts of the year between her mother and her husband. From that point on, Proserpina makes annual trips to the underworld, spending half the year there.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=5: 739–746}}

Ovid also briefly mentions the ''katabasis'' of Hercules in book 7. Ovid is telling the etiological story of [[Medea|Medea's]] poison for [[Theseus]]. When Hercules travelled to the underworld to capture Cerberus as one of his [[Labours of Hercules|twelve Labours]], Cerberus spread white foam from his mouths which grew poisonous plants.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=7: 575–595}}

The ''katabasis'' of [[Orpheus]] in book 10 is the last major inclusion of the theme by Ovid in the ''Metamorphoses''. Orpheus is distraught by the death of his wife, [[Eurydice]]. He enters the underworld through the Spartan Gates and visits Dis and Proserpina to beg for the return of his bride. Overcome by the heartfelt song of Orpheus, Proserpina calls Eurydice to leave with her husband–on the condition that he does not look back until he reaches the exit. When he looks back, his wife disappears, and he is pained by grief for her death a second time.{{sfn|Ovid|2010|loc=10: 1–110}}

==Wind==
{{main|Katabatic wind}}
Air cooled by a glacier flows down the glacier and generates wind movement known as a ''katabatic wind''. In Antarctica, katabatic winds perpetually flow off the Antarctic plateau and are channelled through mountain passes, descending down steep glaciers to the oceans. They blow at storm force year round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/southpole/577 Climate: The South Pole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918055013/http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/SouthPole/577 |date=2008-09-18 }} [http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/admin/directory.html Stanford Humanities Lab], Retrieved 2008-10-01   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920222812/http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/admin/directory.html |date=2008-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lewis &amp; Clark College''' is a private [[liberal arts college]] in the [[Pacific Northwest|northwest]] [[United States]], located in [[Portland, Oregon]].  It has an undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences, a School of Law, and a Graduate School of Education and Counseling.

Lewis &amp; Clark is a member of the [[Annapolis Group]] of colleges with athletic programs competing in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] [[Northwest Conference]]. Just over 2,000 students attend the undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lclark.edu/college/offices/admissions/facts_and_figures|title=Facts &amp; Figures - Admissions - College of Arts and Sciences - Lewis &amp; Clark|website=Lclark.edu|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a student body from more than 50&amp;nbsp;countries across six continents as well as most U.S.&amp;nbsp;states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lclark.edu/offices/international/admissions/|title=International Admissions - International Students and Scholars - Lewis &amp; Clark|website=Lclark.edu|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Law is best known for its [[environmental law]] program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/environmental-law-rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403220407/http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/environmental-law-rankings |archivedate=2016-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Graduate School of Education &amp; Counseling is active in community engagement and social justice.

It was originally chartered as the '''Albany Collegiate Institute''' in [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]], about {{convert|70|mi|spell=in}} south. The school moved to the Portland campus in 1938 and in 1942 adopted the name Lewis &amp; Clark College after the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. Today, the three schools and their supporting offices occupy the {{nowrap|{{convert|137|acre|km2|adj=on}}}} campus, centered on the [[M.&amp;nbsp;Lloyd Frank Estate]] on Palatine Hill in the [[Collins View, Portland, Oregon|Collins View]] neighborhood of Southwest Portland.

==History==
[[File:Albany College Administration Building.png|thumb|left|Albany College Administration Building.]]
Like many modern universities, the institution that would eventually become Lewis &amp; Clark was initially intended to provide secondary as well as higher education for a specific religious community, in this case [[Presbyterian]] pioneers in Oregon's [[Willamette Valley]]. To this end the Presbyterian church incorporated Albany Academy in 1858,&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;Corning, Howard M. ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords &amp; Mort Publishing, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; making Lewis &amp; Clark one of four Oregon colleges with foundations predating Oregon's statehood (along with [[Willamette University]], [[Pacific University]], and [[Linfield College]]).

Within a decade of its founding, Albany Academy began to focus more exclusively on higher education, changing its official name to the Albany Collegiate Institution in 1866. Lewis &amp; Clark's official founding date comes from the current charter, which has been legally valid since the Presbyterian church reincorporated the Albany Collegiate Institution as Albany College in 1867.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; Unlike most Oregon colleges of the pioneer-era, the college has been coeducational since the first class, which graduated in 1873. The early campus of {{convert|7|acre|spell=in}} in Albany was situated on land donated by the Monteith family. In 1892, the original school building was enlarged, and in 1925 the school relocated south of Albany where it remained until 1937.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

Albany College established a junior college to the north in Portland in 1934, with the entire school moving to Portland in 1939.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; The campus grounds later became home to the federal government's [[Albany Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 the college trustees acquired the Lloyd Frank (of the historic Portland department store [[Meier &amp; Frank]]) "Fir Acres" estate in southwest Portland, and the school name was changed to Lewis &amp; Clark College.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; The original school mascot, the Pirates, was changed to the Pioneers in 1946.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5151">The '''Linear Model of Innovation''' was an early model designed for to understand the relationship of science and technology that begins with basic research that flows into applied research, development and diffusion &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Godin|first=Benoît|date=2006|title=The Linear Model of Innovation: The Historical Construction of an Analytical Framework|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/29733964|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|volume=31|issue=6|pages=639–667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Technological Change.jpg|750px|thumb|right|Original model of three phases of the process of Technological Change]]

It prioritizes scientific research as the basis of innovation, and plays down the role of later players in the innovation process.

Current models of [[innovation]] derive from approaches such as [[Actor-Network Theory]], [[Social shaping of technology]] and [[Social learning theory|social learning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/53871734|title=Networks of innovation : change and meaning in the age of the Internet|last=Ilkka.|first=Tuomi,|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199256985|oclc=53871734}}&lt;/ref&gt;,provide a much richer picture of the way innovation works. Current ideas in [[Open Innovation]] and [[User innovation]] derive from these later ideas. 

In the 'Phase Gate Model' , the product or services concept is frozen at an early stage to minimize risk. Through enterprise, the innovation process involves a series of sequential phases arranged in a manner that the preceding phase muse be cleared before movie to the next phase. Therefore a project must pass through a gate with the permission of the gatekeeper before moving to the next succeeding phase.

Criteria for passing through each gate is defined beforehand. The gatekeeper examines whether the stated objectives for the preceding phase have been properly met or not and whether desired development has taken place during the preceding phase or not.

Two versions of the linear model of innovation are often presented:

# "technology push" model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "market pull" model &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to the Mid-1960s, the industrial innovation process was generally perceived as a linear progression from scientific discovery, through technological development in firms, to the marketplace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The stages of the "Technology Push" model are: 

:Basic science→Design and engineering→Manufacturing→Marketing→Sales

From the Mid 1960s to the Early 1970s, emerges the second-generation Innovation model, referred to as the "market pull" model of innovation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to this simple sequential model, the market was the source of new ideas for directing [[Research and development|R&amp;D]], which had a reactive role in the process. The stages of the "market pull " model are:

:Market need—Development—Manufacturing—Sales.

The linear models of innovation supported numerous criticisms concerning the linearity of the models. These models ignore the many feedbacks and loops that occur between the different "stages" of the process. Shortcomings and failures that occur at various stages may lead to a reconsideration of earlier steps and this may result in an innovation. A history of the linear model of innovation may be found in Godin ''The Linear Model of Innovation: The Historical Construction of an Analytical Framework''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godin|first1=Benoit|title=The Linear Model of Innovation: The Historical Construction of an Analytical Framework|journal=Science, Technology &amp; Human Values|year=2006|volume=31|pages=639–667|url=http://www.csiic.ca/PDF/Godin_30.pdf|doi=10.1177/0162243906291865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ludomusicology''' (also called '''video game music studies''' or '''video game music research''') is a field of academic research and scholarly analysis focusing on  [[video game music]], understood as the music found in [[video game]]s and in related contexts. It is closely related to the fields of [[musicology]] and [[Sound effect#Video games|interactive and games audio research]], and game music and audio are sometimes studied as a united phenomenon. Ludomusicology is also related to the field of [[game studies]], as music is one element of the wider video game text and some theories on video game functions are directly relevant to music.

Whereas the overarching areas of interactive and game audio research and game studies are highly interdisciplinary (ranging from [[Interface (computing)|interface]] research, [[Neurology|neurological research]], [[psychology]] and [[informatics]] to [[sound studies]], [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]]), ludomusicology as a subfield has been mainly driven by musicologists (albeit with an openness to interdisciplinary inquiry). Ludomusicology not only deals with music in games and music games as its subject matter, but is also interested in the ways in which games and their music have become subjects of playful engagement themselves, e.g. within the frame of fancultural practices. Additionally and more generally, game music challenges the ways in which we think about music, and subsequently how we study it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Elferen|first1=Isabella|title=Ludomusicology and the new drastic (Conference paper, unpublished)|journal=Creativity, Circulation and Copyright: Sonic and Visual Media in the Digital Age|date=28–29 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=Roger|title=Playing Games with Music (and Vice Versa): Ludomusicological Perspectives on Guitar Hero and Rock Band|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of anthologies and monographs dealing with the specific subject of game music and music in game culture is steadily increasing. The ludomusicological community now organizes conferences, runs subgroups within the musicological societies, and engages in discourse with scholarly colleagues in a wide range of related fields.

==History==
Academic research on video game music began in the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matthew|first1=Belinkie|title=Video game music: not just kid stuff|url=http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml|website=Videogame Music Archive|accessdate=26 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613143431/http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml|archivedate=16 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed through the mid 2000s. Early research on the topic often involved historical studies of game music, or comparative studies of video game music and film music (see, for instance, Zach Whalen's article "Play Along - An Approach to Videogame Music" which includes both).&lt;ref name="whalen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whalen|first1=Zach|date=November 2004|title=Play Along - An Approach to Videogame Music|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/0401/whalen/|journal=Game Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of video game music is also known by some as "ludomusicology" — a portmanteau of "[[ludology]]" (the study of games and gameplay) and "[[musicology]]" (the study and analysis of music) — a term coined independently by Guillaume Laroche and Roger Moseley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=Roger|editor1-last=Cook|editor1-first=Nicholas|editor2-last=Pettengill|editor2-first=Richard|title=Taking it to the bridge: music as performance|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|pages=283, 308|chapter=Playing games with music (and vice versa): ludomusicological perspectives on Guitar Hero and Rock Band}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karbani|first1=Tasneem|title=Summer research project was music to student's ears|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~publicas/folio/45/01/04.html|website=University of Alberta|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent figure in early video game music and audio research is Karen Collins, who is associate professor at the [[University of Waterloo]] and Canada Research Chair in Interactive Audio at the University of Waterloo Games Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Collins|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/english/people-profiles/karen-collins|website=University of Waterloo|accessdate=2 May 2017|date=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her monograph ''Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design'' (MIT Press 2008)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design|last1=Collins|first1=Karen|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262033787|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a seminal work in the field, and was influential in the subsequent development of video game music studies.

In 2012, the Ludomusicology Research Group held its inaugural conference at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was the first conference in the world to be focused specifically on video game music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2014 the inaugural North American Conference on Video Game Music was held at [[Youngstown State University]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both conferences have since been held annually, at varying locations in Europe and North America respectively.

In late 2016, the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.&lt;ref name="about-sssmg" /&gt; The SSSMG is the first international society dedicated to the study of video game music. In September 2017, the SSSMG announced the planned launch of a new journal dedicated to video game music and sound research, the ''Journal of Sound &amp; Music in Games''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/2017/09/04/announcement/|title=SSSMG Executive Committee Appointments &amp; Journal Announcement|last=Sweeney|first=Mark|date=4 September 2017|website=SSSMG|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of enquiry==
Ludomusicology examines any and all aspects of video game music and audio, some of which are described in brief here.

===Interactivity===
{{see also|Interactivity}}
Interactivity is one of the major differentiating qualities of video game music, distinguishing it from other screen media music through the incorporation of player actions. In interactive gameplay, the sound and music played by the game can respond to the actions of the player within the game.&lt;ref name="whalen" /&gt; Furthermore, as video games frequently feature non-linear or multi-linear timelines, their music can be similarly multi-threaded in both its form and its experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} Because each player takes an independently-chosen path through the game, any player’s experience of a game's music will be different (considered as a whole) to any other player's experience from the same game, even though constructed from the same basic elements. Therefore, the intent and output of the composer and the music's effect on the player (which similarly varies from player to player) must both be considered during analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Iain|title=Meaningful Play: Performativity, Interactivity and Semiotics in Video Game Music|journal=Musicology Australia|date=2014|volume=36|issue=2|pages=273–290|doi=10.1080/08145857.2014.958272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept to that of interactivity is that of [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]], which considers the ability of a video game to draw the player into a deep engagement with the game's diegetic space. Isabella van Elferen has developed a model of video game music immersion called "the ALI model", which understands player immersion to be a confluence of "musical affect, musical literacy and musical interaction":
* Affect: "personal investment in a given situation through memory, emotion and identification"
* Literacy: "fluency in hearing and interpreting... music through the fact of our frequent exposure to [it]", which builds on such literacy from other musical media
* Interaction: the player's reactions to music, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|last=Isabella|first=van Elferen|publisher=Equinox|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Kamp|editor-first=Michiel|location=Sheffield|pages=34–39|chapter=Analysing Game Musical Immersion: The ALI Model|editor-last2=Summers|editor-first2=Tim|editor-last3=Sweeney|editor-first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
{{see also|Video game music|Chiptune}}
Historical studies of video game music usually incorporate examinations of game music technology. Technological limitations of audio chips in early consoles and computer systems were, in many ways, instrumental in shaping the development of both the functions and aesthetics of game music. For example, Karen Collins describes how the [[Television Interface Adaptor|Television Interface Adapter]] in the [[Atari 2600]] created tones that could be out of tune by up to half a semitone; this led to minimal music in games for this platform, and substantial modifications to the music of ported games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|21–23}} Similarly, Melanie Fritsch observes the relative freedoms afforded to game composers by [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD audio]] (higher quality, though limited to 79.8 minutes) and later [[MP3]] (similar quality to CD audio but with compression minimising length restrictions), while also noting the challenges presented by writing increasingly detailed music to accompany hundreds of hours of gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Fritsch|first=Melanie|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=24–25|chapter=History of Video Game Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technology that has attracted significant academic attention is [[iMUSE]], a [[MIDI]]-based system developed by [[LucasArts]] that allowed dynamic and smooth musical transitions, which were triggered by game conditions but which would occur at musically expedient (pre-designated) positions in the soundtrack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|51–57}}

Ludomusicology also investigates muso-technological practices in fields surrounding video games. For example, scholarly attention is turning to [[chiptune]], which is the creation of music using old video game or sound chip hardware (a definition which is sometimes broadened to include the imitation of the resulting aesthetic).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Pasdzierny|first=Matthias|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=174–175|chapter=Geeks on Stage? Investigations in the World of (Live) Chipmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition===
{{see also|Video game music}}
Ludomusicology examines the composition of video game music, both in relation to and as distinct from other forms of [[Musical composition|music composition]]. Studies of game music compositional processes are often contributed by active [[composer]]s and industry practitioners (for example, [[Winifred Phillips]]'s book ''A Composer's Guide to Game Music'', and [[Stephen Baysted]]'s chapter "Palimpsest, Pragmatism and the Aesthetics of Genre Transformation: Composing the Hybrid Score to Electronic Arts' ''Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed''").&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Composer's Guide to Game Music|last=Phillips|first=Winifred|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|last=Baysted|first=Stephen|publisher=Equinox|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Kamp|editor-first=Michiel|location=Sheffield|pages=152–171|chapter=Palimpsest, Pragmatism and the Aesthetics of Genre Transformation: Composing the Hybrid Score to Electronic Arts' Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed|editor-last2=Summers|editor-first2=Tim|editor-last3=Sweeney|editor-first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant distinction of video game music composition is the need to incorporate the player's interactivity into the compositional process, and particularly as part of the negotiation of engagement and immersion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|35–36}} Composition is also at the nexus of creative potential and technological possibility, and throughout the development of game music (and particularly in its early phases) this has had significant effects on both compositional processes and game music aesthetics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|35}}

===Music video games===
{{see also|Music video game}}
Music video games, which use music as part of a dominant gameplay mechanism, are a focus of many ludomusicological studies. The clear relationship between music and gameplay in games like the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Rock Band]]'' series facilitates the study of performance and performativity within gameplay, and provokes questions of musical ideology, performance practice and multimedia pedagogy. Kiri Miller writes that music video games feature a smaller disparity between the actions of player and avatar than is usually present in video games, and that this can encourage heightened levels of physical and musical engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Playing Along: Digital Games, YouTube, and Virtual Performance|last=Miller|first=Kiri|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Roesner, Anna Paisley, and Gianna Cassidy have examined these phenomena within the classroom context, observing that music video games can inspire not only musical creativity, but the positive self-perception of musicality in students; they suggest that such effects can be used to encourage student engagement and development within both musical and non-musical curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music Video Games: Performance, Politics, and Play|last=Roesner|first=David|last2=Paisley|first2=Anna|last3=Cassidy|first3=Gianna|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Austin|editor-first=Michael|location=New York|pages=213–215|chapter=Guitar Heroes in the Classroom: The Creative Potential of Music Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to music in other screen media===
{{see also|Soundtrack|Film score}}
Because video games are (usually) screen-based media, there are strong links between the study of game music and the study of music in other screen-based media (like film and television). Concepts such as [[Diegesis#In film|diegesis]] and [[Acousmatic sound|acousmatics]], which originate in film and film audio studies, are broadly applicable to video game music analyses, often with minimal adjustment.&lt;ref name=whalen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medina-Gray|first1=Elizabeth|editor1-last=Donnelly|editor1-first=K.J.|editor2-last=Gibbons|editor2-first=William|editor3-last=Lerner|editor3-first=Neil|title=Music in Video Games: Studying Play|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=Meaningful Modular Combinations: Simultaneous Harp and Environmental Music in two ''Legend of Zelda'' Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are similarities between video game and film music techniques as varying stages throughout video game music history. For example, Neil Lerner notes a relationship between music in [[Silent film|early/silent cinema]] and game music aesthetics from the 1970s onwards, on the basis of "largely nonverbal communication system[s]" and "continuous musical accompaniment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music in Video Games: Studying Play|last=Lerner|first=Neil|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Donnelly|editor-first=K.J.|location=New York|pages=12|chapter=Mario's Dynamic Leaps: Musical Innovations (and the Specter of Early Cinema) in ''Donkey Kong'' and ''Super Mario Bros.''|editor-last2=Gibbons|editor-first2=William|editor-last3=Lerner|editor-first3=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Gregor Herzfeld compares the use of high energy music in ''[[Gran Turismo (video game)|Gran Turismo]]'' to the use of rock music in action films like ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', due to associations with risky and/or exciting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Herzfeld|first=Gregor|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is also well noted within ludomusicological discourse that video games are very different media to film and television due to the player's interaction. Consequently, the application of concepts like diegesis does require a nuanced approach that takes the peculiarities of the video game medium into account. For example, Collins observes that linear approaches to [[musical analysis]] (such as the observation of synchronicity between musical and visual cues) fail to address the non-linear timescales that are typical of video games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} This forms a basis of Collins's reiteration of a warning by video game theorists against "theoretical imperialism".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|5}}

===Research methods===
Several academics have written about the research methods involved in ludomusicology. One of the more comprehensive of these studies is found in Tim Summers's book ''Understanding Video Game Music'', in which Summers describes the process of "analytical play", wherein the analyst is "deliberately subverting the game's expectations of the player's actions.... At moments when game rules are tested, the architecture is often clearest. By playing experimentally (or using 'analytical play') to investigate the musical system in the game and comparing multiple play sessions, the musical mechanics of the game programming can be divined".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|35}} Summers places this analytical method alongside more conventional sources of research data, both from inside the game (e.g., programmatic and musical information, the latter of which frequently involves the application of conventional musicology and music theory to the video game music text) and from texts and communities surrounding the game.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|34–50}}

==Groups and Conferences==

===Ludomusicology Research Group===
The Ludomusicology Research Group is an inter-university research organisation focusing on the study of music in games, music games and music in video game culture, composed of four researchers: Michiel Kamp, Tim Summers, Melanie Fritsch, and Mark Sweeney.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.ludomusicology.org/about/|website=Ludomusicology|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they organise an annual international conference held in the UK or Europe (at the time of writing, the most recent was the Ludo2017 conference held at Bath Spa University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludo 2017|url=http://www.ludomusicology.org/past-events/ludo-2017/|website=Ludomusicology|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ludo2018 held in Leipzig, Germany, in April 2018, was the biggest Ludo-conference so far, attracting more than 80 participants from all over the world. The group was originally founded by Kamp, Summers and Sweeney in August 2011, who have also edited a collection of essays based around the study of game sound entitled ''Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music'', published in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kamp|editor1-first=Michiel|editor2-last=Summers|editor2-first=Tim|editor3-last=Sweeney|editor3-first=Mark|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|date=2016|publisher=Equinox|isbn=9781781791974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludomusicology|url=https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/ludomusicology/|website=Equinox|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also edited a double special issue of [https://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-issue,id=2999/ ''The Soundtrack''] and initiated a new book series called [http://www.ludomusicology.org/2017/04/20/new-book-series-studies-game-sound-music/ ''Studies in Game Sound and Music''] in 2017. In September 2016, Tim Summers' book ''Understanding Video Game Music'' was published by Cambridge University Press.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Tim|title=Understanding Video Game Music|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107116870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritsch officially joined the group in 2016. She had edited the 2nd issue of the online journal [http://www.act.uni-bayreuth.de/en/archiv/2011-02/index.html ''ACT - Zeitschrift für Musik und Performance''], published in July 2011 that included ludomusicological contributions written by Tim Summers, Steven Reale and James Brame. She had been a regular at the conferences since 2012 and published several book chapters on the topic. Whereas Kamp, Summers and Sweeney have a background in Musicology, Fritsch has her background in Performance Studies. Her doctoral thesis and first monograph "Performing Bytes. Musikperformances der Computerspielkultur" is scheduled for publication during 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://uni-bayreuth.academia.edu/mfritsch&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM)===
The North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM) is an international conference on video game music held annually in North America since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, B. I. (2014, January 18). [https://www.wired.com/2014/01/game-music/  There Really Is a Conference Where Nerds Study Videogame Music.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Checkpoint!: The floodgates have opened.

===Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG)===
In late 2016 the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.&lt;ref name="about-sssmg"&gt;{{cite web|title=About SSSMG|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/about-sssmg/|website=SSSMG|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSSMG has the aim of bringing together both practitioners and researchers from across the globe in order to develop the field's understanding of sound and video game music and audio. Its initial focus is the use of its website as a "hub" for communication and resource centralisation, including a video game music research bibliography (a project initially begun by the Ludomusicology Research Group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/bibliography/|website=SSSMG|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMS Ludomusicology Study Group===
The Ludomusicology Study Group of the [[American Musicological Society]] was founded in 2015 and "is dedicated to facilitating academic research on music interactive media", including holding a panel on video game music as part of the annual meetings of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gamemusicstudies.org/?page_id=12|title=About|work=Ludomusicology Study Group|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ludomusicology Society of Australia (LSA)===
The Ludomusicology Society of Australia was launched in April 2017, during the Ludo2017 conference in Bath, UK; it aims to "offer a centralised and local professional body nurturing game music studies for academics, people in industry and game music fans alike in the Australasian region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The LSA is here!|url=http://ludomusicologysociety.com.au/2017/03/07/hello-world/|website=The Ludomusicology Society of Australia|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Datuk shrine Pulau Pangkor 2007 006.jpg|thumb|250px|Shrine of Panglima Hijau, a ''Datuk'' or (in Malaysian Chinese) ''[[Na Tuk Kong]]'', a [[tutelary deity|god of the place]] on [[Pangkor Island]].]]

'''Malaysian folk religion''' refers to the [[animism|animistic]] and [[polytheism|polytheistic]] beliefs and practices that are still held by many in the [[Islam]]ic-majority country of [[Malaysia]]. Malaysian folk faith is practiced either openly or covertly depending on the type of rituals performed. 

Some forms of belief are not recognised by the government as a religion for statistical purposes although such practices are not outlawed. There is a deep interaction between the [[Chinese folk religion]] of the large [[Malaysian Chinese]] population, and the indigenous Malaysian folk religion.

==Overview==
{{see also|Datuk Keramat}}
[[File:Poh-San-Teng-2290.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Poh San Teng Temple]] is the oldest temple dedicated to the [[Hakka people|Hakka]]n ancestral figure of [[Tua Pek Kong]], reputedly one of the first settlers of [[Penang]]; it was built in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazingmelaka.com/2011/12/sam-po-keng-temple/|title=Sam Po Keng Temple|work=AmazingMelaka.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are different types of Malaysian folk religion practised throughout the country. [[shamanism|Shamanic]] performances are held by people known as ''[[dukun]]s'', otherwise also known as ''dukun'' or ''pawang''. Most [[Orang Asli]] (indigenous people) are [[animism|animists]] and believe in spirits residing in certain objects. However, some have recently converted to mainstream religions due to state-sponsored Muslim [[dawah]] or [[evangelism]] by Christian missionaries.

In [[Indonesia]], indigenous religions are also practised by various [[Borneo|Bornean]] tribal groups. [[Chinese Indonesians]] generally practice folk religion, which is also animistic in nature. The word ''bomoh'' has been used throughout the country to describe any person with knowledge or power to perform certain spiritual rituals including traditional healing, and as a substitute for the word "shaman". Generally speaking, Indonesians have deep [[superstition|superstitious]] beliefs, especially more so in the rural areas.

==History==
[[File:Da Bogong Temple Kusu Island.JPG|thumb|[[Tua Pek Kong]] Temple on [[Kusu Island]], [[Singapore]].]]
Historically, before the arrival and spread of [[Islam]] in the 15th century, and the spread of [[Christianity]] from the 19th century, the inhabitants in the land were either [[Hindu]] or practiced indigenous faiths. In the peninsula, widespread [[Islamization]] is said to have begun in 1409 after [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] became [[Sultanate of Malacca|Sultan of Malacca]] and converted to [[Islam]] after marrying a princess from the [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate]]. Since then, other Sultanates in the Malay peninsula have adopted Islam. Also since then, and continuing after the independence of Malaysia, Islam played a central role in Malaysian society.

Similarly in East Malaysia, folk religion was widespread prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries from Europe. The practice of [[headhunting]] was quite common in these societies.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Susan, [http://www.seasite.niu.edu/crossroads/russell/headhunting.htm "Head-hunting in Southeast Asia"], ''Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Northern Illinois University''. Accessed 15 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sabah]], the [[Kadazan-Dusun]]s worshipped [[Kinoingan]], a rice deity, and celebrate [[Kaamatan]], the harvest festival, every year. During Kaamatan, there are certain rituals which has to be carried out by the high priestesses known as ''[[bobohizan]]s'' (or ''bobolian'' in the Bundu-Liwan dialect of [[Dusun language|Dusun]]). Today, most Kadazan-Dusuns have adopted Christianity, but some still celebrate Kaamatan. However, the number of bobohizans has tremendously dropped and this role is on the brink of extinction.&lt;ref name=dailyexpress&gt;[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=29782 "Set up knowledge academy on traditional healing: Pairin  "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234850/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=29782 |date=26 September 2007 }}, ''Daily Express'', 6 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Sarawak]], it has been said that the animism practised by the [[Iban people|Ibans]] and other related groups is the most developed, elaborated, and intellectualised in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Cavendish, Richard]], [[Man, Myth &amp; Magic (encyclopedia)|"Man, Myth &amp; Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural (vol. 3)"]], New York: Marshall Cavendish Corp. (1970); [http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_29.html pg. 312]. Accessed 13 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk religious practice in East Malaysia is related to the religion of [[Kaharingan]] in [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]], which has been recognised as an official religion by the Indonesian government. However, the rituals involved are not entirely similar with variations depending on the ethnic subgroups which practices it.

==Shamanism and traditional healing==
{{main|Bomoh|Dukun|Pawang}}
The shamans ''bomohs'' or [[witch doctor]]s still practice their craft in Malaysia. The bomoh practice by Malays have been [[syncretism|integrated]] into Islam and is not forbidden.&lt;ref name=islamonline&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/english/Science/2002/10/article16.shtml "Malaysian Bomoh Practitioners: a Dying Breed"], ''Islam Online''. Accessed 12 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as [[traditional medicine|traditional healers]] and sometimes serve as an alternative to conventional modern medicine. However, the practice has sometimes been viewed negatively by Malaysian society as in some instances bomohs have the power to cast spells (jampi) and have used them on other people with ill effects. The number practitioners of bomohs has also dropped.&lt;ref name="islamonline" /&gt;

The bobohizans of Sabah are also shamans and are traditional healers. They also act as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate with spirits and play an important role in the rituals involved during Kaamatan, a harvest festival celebration of the [[Kadazan-Dusun]].

Recently there has been suggestions for the need and importance to preserve the practice of bomohs and other shamans as traditional healers and to complement or substitute conventional modern medicine.&lt;ref name="dailyexpress" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/printable.php?id=184419 "Bomoh And Malays Are Inseparable, Says Don"], ''Bernama'', 8 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysian Chinese Gods==
{{main|Na Tuk Kong|Tua Pek Kong|}}
[[File:Pagoda of Tua Pek Kong Temple.JPG|thumb|A pagoda of [[Tua Pek Kong Temple, Sibu]].]]
'''Tua Pek Kong''' ({{zh|c=大伯公|p=Dàbó Gōng}}, [[Hakka]]: Thai phak koong, [[Hokkien]]: Tuā-peh-kong, {{lang-ms|Topekong}}. lit. "grand uncle") is one of the pantheon of [[Shenism in Southeast Asia|Malaysian Chinese deities]]. He is believed to have arrived in [[Penang]] 40 years before [[Francis Light]] in 1746. 

Tua Pek Kong is said to have been a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] named Zhang Li ({{zh|c=张理}}). His [[Sumatra]]-bound boat was struck by wind and accidentally landed on [[Penang]] off Malaysia, which at that time had only 50 inhabitants. After his death, the local people began worshipping him and built the Tua Pek Kong temple there. Today Tua Pek Kong is worshipped by Malaysian Chinese throughout the country.

[[Image:DatukAli002.jpg|thumb|90px|One of the ''Natuk Kong'' in Malaysia, "''Datuk'' Ali" ({{zh|c=拿督阿里}}).]]

==Chinese folk religion==
{{Further|Shenism in Southeast Asia}}
Today most of the Chinese population in Malaysia are [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]], while the rest are [[Confucianism|Confucianist]], [[Daoism|Taoist]], Christians, and a small number of Muslims and Hindus. Most Chinese Malaysians still adhere to Chinese folk religion or [[veneration of the dead]] in tandem with mainstream religious practices. 

Some have stopped practising this religion after adopting a mainstream religion which prohibits animism or [[idolatry]]. As is the case in [[China]], the practice of this religion is not documented by the government for statistics purpose. Thus the number of followers in Malaysia can only be estimated.

The '''National Human Genome Research Institute''' ('''NHGRI''') is an Institute of the [[National Institutes of Health]], located in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].

NHGRI began as the Office of Human Genome Research in The Office of the Director in 1988. This Office transitioned to the '''National Center for Human Genome Research''' (NCHGR), in 1989 to carry out the role of the NIH in the [[International Human Genome Project]] (HGP). The HGP was developed in collaboration with the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) and began in 1990 to map the [[human genome]]. In 1993, NCHGR expanded its role on the NIH campus by establishing the [[Division of Intramural Research]] (DIR) to apply genome technologies to the study of specific diseases. In 1996, the [[Center for Inherited Disease Research]] (CIDR) was also established (co-funded by eight NIH institutes and centers) to study the genetic components of complex disorders.

In 1997 the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) renamed NCHGR the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), officially elevating it to the status of research institute - one of 27 institutes and centers that make up the NIH.

The Institute has successfully accomplished determination of the [[human genome]] in April 2003.

== NHGRI Organizational Structure ==
NHGRI is organized into seven divisions and the Office of the Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10000968/organization/|title=Organization|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of these divisions support extramural research (the grant-giving side), one coordinates the intramural (on-campus) research arm of the institute, one deals with administration, management, and budget, and one serves as the public-facing side of the institute housing the communications, policy, and education teams. 

==Events in NHGRI history==
{{main|List of events in NHGRI history}}

 | publisher=[[Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.]] | page=7 | date=2008-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* November 17, 2009 - NIH Appoints [[Eric D. Green]], M.D., Ph.D. to be Director of The National Human Genome Research Institute. It is the first time an institute director has risen to lead the entire NIH and subsequently picked his own successor.

== CEER Centers ==
In 1990 as part of the [[Human Genome Project]], the NHGRI dedicated 5% of its annual budget to explore the ethical, legal, and social implications of genomic research. This program’s current priorities focus on the ethical applications of genomics to as it applies to communities, families, and individuals in areas such as healthcare, research, defense, intellectual property, regulation, policy, and larger social issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genome.gov/elsi/#al-1&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004 the ELSI program established several Centers for Excellence in ELSI research (CEER). It was funded with substantial contributions from the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]]. CEER centers have a common focus on the ethical, social, and legal implications resulting from the advances in genomic research.&lt;ref&gt;http://depts.washington.edu/cghe/CGHE-CEER&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial centers were&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genome.gov/12512375&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[Case Western Reserve]] University's Center for Genetic Research Ethics and Law; Eric Juengst, Ph.D., $5.3 million
* The [[Duke University|Duke]] Center for the Study of Public Genomics; Robert Cook-Deegan, M.D., $4.8 million
* [[Stanford University]] School of Medicine's Center for Integration of Research on Genetics and Ethics; Mildred Cho, Ph.D., $3.8 million
* [[University of Washington]]'s Center for Genomics and Healthcare Equality; Wylie Burke, M.D., Ph.D., $4.7 million
This center is focused on equitable distribution and use of translational genome research in underserved and marginalized communities. CGHE has several cores working to address different lenses of health disparities, genomic research, and outreach education. These cores include the Partnership core, the Genome Sciences core, the Healthcare Decision-making core and the Indigenous Genomics Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;http://depts.washington.edu/cghe/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New musicology''' is a wide body of [[musicology]] since the 1980s with a focus upon the cultural study, aesthetics, criticism, and hermeneutics of music. It began in part a reaction against the traditional [[Positivism|positivist]] musicology (focused on primary research) of the early 20th century and [[postwar era]].  Many of the procedures of new musicology are now (2016) considered standard, although the name more often refers to the historical turn rather than to any single set of ideas or principles.  Indeed, although it was notably influenced by [[feminism]], [[gender studies]], [[queer theory]], [[postcolonial studies]], and [[critical theory]], new musicology has primarily been characterized by a wide-ranging eclecticism.

==Definitions and history==
New musicology seeks to question the research methods of traditional musicology by displacing [[positivism]], working in partnership with outside [[discipline]]s, including the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]], and by questioning accepted musical knowledge. New musicologists seek ways to employ [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[gender studies]], [[feminism]], [[history]], and [[philosophy]] in the study of music. 

In 1980 [[Joseph Kerman]] published the article "How We Got into Analysis, and How to Get Out," calling for a change in musicology. He asked for "a new breadth and flexibility in academic music criticism [musicology]"  (Kerman, 1994, 30) that would extend to musical discourse, [[critical theory]] and [[analysis]]. In the words of [[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]]: "For me...the notion of an intimate relationship between music and society functions not as a distant goal but as a starting point of great immediacy...the goal of which is to articulate something essential about why any particular music is the way it is in particular, that is, to achieve insight into the character of its identity."{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Susan McClary suggests that new musicology defines music as "a medium that participates in social formation by influencing the ways we perceive our feelings, our bodies, our desires, our very subjectivities—even if it does so surreptitiously, without most of us knowing how" (Brett, 1994).  For [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]], music has meanings "definite enough to support critical interpretations comparable in depth, exactness, and density of connection to interpretations of literary texts and cultural practices" (Kramer, 1990).

New musicology combines cultural studies with the analysis and criticism of music, and it accords more weight to the sociology of musicians and institutions and to non-canonical genres of music, including jazz and popular music, than traditional musicology did. (A similar perspective became common for American ethnomusicologists during the 1950s.) This has caused many musicologists to question previously held views of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] and to make assessments based on critical methods "concerned with finding some kind of [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] between [musical] analysis and a consideration of social meaning" (Beard and Gloag, 2005, 38).

New musicologists question the processes of canonization. Gary Tomlinson suggests that meaning be searched out in a "series of interrelated historical narratives that surround the musical subject" (Beard and Gloag, 2005, 123) – a "web of culture" (Tomlinson, 1984). For example, the work of Beethoven has been examined from new perspectives by studying his reception and influence in terms of masculine hegemony, the development of the modern concert, and the politics of his era, among other concerns.  The traditional contrast between Beethoven and Schubert has been revised in the light of these studies, especially with reference to Schubert's possible homosexuality (McClary in Brett, 1994; Kramer 2003; Mathew, 2012).

==Relationship to music sociology==
New musicology is distinct from German [[sociomusicology|music sociology]] in the work of Adorno, [[Max Weber]] and [[Ernst Bloch]]. Although some new musicologists claim some allegiance to [[Theodor Adorno]], their work has little in common with the wider field of Adorno studies, especially in [[Germany]]. New musicologists frequently exhibit strong resistance to German intellectual traditions, especially in regard to nineteenth-century German music theorists including [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]] and [[Eduard Hanslick]], and also the twentieth-century figures [[Heinrich Schenker]] and [[Carl Dahlhaus]].

A fundamental distinction has to do with attitudes towards [[modernism]] and [[popular culture]]. Influential, oft-cited essays such as McClary 1989 and McClary 2006 are highly dismissive of modernist music. German music sociologists tend to be more favorable towards modernism (though by no means uncritically) and severely critical of popular music as inextricably tied to the aesthetics of distraction as demanded by the [[culture industry]]. Metzger describes "a fascistic element" in the music of the Rolling Stones. New musicology, on the other hand, often overlaps with [[postmodern]] aesthetics; various new musicologists are highly sympathetic towards musical [[minimalism]] (see McClary 1990 and 2000 and Fink 2005).

==Criticisms of new musicology==
[[Vincent Duckles]] writes, "As musicology has grown more [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]], its practitioners have increasingly adopted methods and theories deemed by observers to mark the academy as irrelevant, out of touch with 'mainstream values', unwelcoming of [[Western canon]]ic traditions or simply incomprehensible. Paradoxically, such approaches have distanced music scholarship from a broad public at the very moment they have encouraged scholars to scrutinize the popular musics that form the backbone of modern mass musical culture."

Critics of new musicology include [[Pieter van den Toorn]] and to a lesser extent [[Charles Rosen]]. In response to an early essay of McClary (McClary 1987), Rosen says that "she sets up, like so many of the 'new musicologists', a straw man to knock down, the dogma that music has no meaning, and no political or social significance. (I doubt that anyone, except perhaps the nineteenth-century critic Hanslick, has ever really believed that, although some musicians have been goaded into proclaiming it by the sillier interpretations of music with which we are often assailed.)" (Rosen 2000).  For David Beard and Kenneth Gloag, however, writing at two later moments (2005, 2016), the methods of new musicology have been fully incorporated into mainstream musicological practice.

'''Osmotic power''', '''salinity gradient power''' or '''blue energy''' is the energy available from the difference in the salt concentration between [[seawater]] and [[fresh water|river water]]. Two practical methods for this are [[reverse electrodialysis]] (RED) and
[[pressure retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Both processes rely on [[osmosis]] with [[artificial membrane|membrane]]s. The key waste product is [[brackish water]]. This byproduct is the result of natural forces that are being harnessed: the flow of fresh water into seas that are made up of salt water.

In 1954, Pattle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=R.E. Pattle|title=Production of electric power by mixing fresh and salt water in the hydroelectric pile|journal=Nature|date=2 October 1954|volume=174|page=660|doi=10.1038/174660a0|issue=4431|bibcode=1954Natur.174..660P}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there was an untapped source of power when a river mixes with the sea, in terms of the lost osmotic pressure, however it was not until the mid ‘70s where a practical method of exploiting it using selectively permeable membranes by Loeb &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S. Loeb|title=Osmotic power plants|journal=Science|date=22 August 1975|volume=189|issue=4203|pages=654–655|doi=10.1126/science.189.4203.654|pmid=17838753|bibcode=1975Sci...189..654L}}&lt;/ref&gt; was outlined.

The method of generating power by pressure retarded osmosis was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1973 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel.&lt;ref&gt;^ Israel Patent Application 42658 of July 3, 1973. (see also {{patent|US|3906250|title=Method and apparatus for generating power utilizing pressure-retarded-osmosis}} Erroneously shows Israel priority as 1974 instead of 1973 {{patent|US|3906250|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea came to Prof. Loeb, in part, as he observed the Jordan River flowing into the Dead Sea. He wanted to harvest the energy of mixing of the two aqueous solutions (the Jordan River being one and the Dead Sea being the other) that was going to waste in this natural mixing process.&lt;ref&gt;^ Weintraub, Bob. "Sidney Loeb," Bulletin of the Israel Chemical Society, Dec. 2001, issue 8, page 8-9. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hpgY6dd0Qtb4M6xnNXhutP4pMxidq_jqG962VzWt_W7-hssGnSxSzjTY8RvW/edit&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 Prof. Loeb invented a method of producing power by a reverse electrodialysis heat engine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US4171409?dq=4,171,409&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sVRiUoX1N8bA0QXm6YGIDA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA%20 United States Patent US4171409 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406074428/https://www.google.com/patents/US4171409?dq=4%2C171%2C409&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sVRiUoX1N8bA0QXm6YGIDA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA%20 |date=2016-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technologies have been confirmed in laboratory conditions. They are being developed into commercial use in the Netherlands (RED) and Norway (PRO). The cost of the membrane has been an obstacle. A new, lower cost membrane, based on an electrically modified [[polyethylene]] plastic, made it fit for potential commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.statkraft.com/Images/Faktaark%20OSMOTIC%20ENG_tcm4-7797.pdf History of osmotic power (PDF) at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods have been proposed and are currently under development.

==Basics of salinity gradient power==
[[Image:Blue energy mechanism.png|thumb|right|Pressure-retarded osmosis]]
Salinity gradient power is a specific renewable energy alternative that creates renewable and sustainable power by using naturally occurring processes. This practice does not contaminate or release [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions (vapor pressure methods will release dissolved air containing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at low pressures—these non-condensable gases can be re-dissolved of course, but with an energy penalty). Also as stated by Jones and Finley within their article “Recent Development in Salinity Gradient Power”, there is basically no fuel cost.

Salinity gradient energy is based on using the resources of “osmotic pressure difference between fresh water and sea water.”&lt;ref&gt;(Jones, A.T., W. Finley. “Recent developments in salinity gradient power”. Oceans. 2003. 2284-2287.)&lt;/ref&gt; All energy that is proposed to use salinity gradient technology relies on the evaporation to separate water from salt. Osmotic pressure is the "chemical potential of concentrated and dilute solutions of salt".&lt;ref&gt;(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water trough salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?” Environmental Process and Technology. Jan 2007. 312-323.)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at relations between high osmotic pressure and low, solutions with higher concentrations of salt have higher pressure.

Differing salinity gradient power generations exist but one of the most commonly discussed is [[pressure-retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Within PRO seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber where the pressure is lower than the difference between fresh and salt water pressure. Fresh water moves in a semipermeable membrane and increases its volume in the chamber. As the pressure in the chamber is compensated a turbine spins to generate electricity. In Braun's article he states that this process is easy to understand in a more broken down manner. Two solutions, A being salt water and B being fresh water are separated by a membrane. He states "only water molecules can pass the semipermeable membrane. As a result of the osmotic pressure difference between both solutions, the water from solution B thus will diffuse through the membrane in order to dilute solution A".&lt;ref&gt;(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water through salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?.” ''Environmental Process and Technology''. Jan 2007. 312-323.)&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure drives the turbines and power the generator that produces the electrical energy. Osmosis might be used directly to "pump" fresh water out of The Netherlands into the sea. This is currently done using electric pumps.

==Efficiency==
A 2012 study on efficiency from Yale university concluded that the highest extractable work in constant-pressure PRO with a seawater draw solution and river water feed solution is 0.75 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; while the free energy of mixing is 0.81 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;—a thermodynamic extraction efficiency of 91.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es300060m | pmid=22463483 | volume=46 | issue=9 | title=Thermodynamic and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Power Generation from Natural Salinity Gradients by Pressure Retarded Osmosis | year=2012 | journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | pages=5230–5239 | last1 = Yin Yip | first1 = Ngai | last2 = Elimelech | first2 = Menachem| bibcode=2012EnST...46.5230Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
While the mechanics and concepts of salinity gradient power are still being studied, the power source has been implemented in several different locations. Most of these are experimental, but thus far they have been predominantly successful. The various companies that have utilized this power have also done so in many different ways as there are several concepts and processes that harness the power from salinity gradient.

One method to utilize salinity gradient energy is called [[pressure-retarded osmosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TGK-4MDGP8H-1&amp;_user=607017&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=607017&amp;md5=acc4682fd086886dff4b0cb1ee6123df Salinity-gradient power: Evaluation of pressure-retarded osmosis and reverse electrodialysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water. Freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane, which increase both the volume and pressure of the chamber. As the pressure differences are compensated, a turbine is spun, providing kinetic energy. This method is being specifically studied by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[public utility|utility]] [[Statkraft]], which has calculated that up to 2.85 GW would be available from this process in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf Recent Developments in Salinity Gradient Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901211414/http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf |date=2011-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statkraft has built the world's first [[Statkraft osmotic power prototype in Hurum|prototype PRO power plant]] on the Oslo fjord which was opened by [[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway|Princess Mette-Marit of Norway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/ |title=The world's first osmotic power plant from Statkraft |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024125/http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/ |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }} Statkraft-osmotic-power&lt;/ref&gt; on November 24, 2009.

===Reversed electrodialysis===
A second method being developed and studied is [[reversed electrodialysis]] or reverse dialysis, which is essentially the creation of a salt battery. This method was described by Weinstein and Leitz as “an array of alternating anion and cation exchange membranes can be used to generate electric power from the free energy of river and sea water.”

The technology related to this type of power is still in its infant stages, even though the principle was discovered in the 1950s. Standards and a complete understanding of all the ways salinity gradients can be utilized are important goals to strive for in order make this clean energy source more viable in the future.

===Capacitive method===
A third method is [[Doriano Brogioli]]'s&lt;ref name="Brogioli" /&gt; capacitive method, which is relatively new and has so far only been tested on lab scale. With this method energy can be extracted out of the mixing of saline water and freshwater by cyclically charging up [[electrode]]s in contact with saline water, followed by a discharge in freshwater. Since the amount of electrical energy which is needed during the charging step is less than one gets out during the discharge step, each completed cycle effectively produces energy. An intuitive explanation of this effect is that the great number of [[ion]]s in the saline water efficiently neutralizes the charge on each electrode by forming a thin layer of opposite charge very close to the electrode surface, known as an [[double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer]]. Therefore, the [[voltage]] over the electrodes remains low during the charge step and charging is relatively easy. In between the charge and discharge step, the electrodes are brought in contact with freshwater. After this, there are less ions available to neutralize the charge on each electrode such that the voltage over the electrodes increases. The discharge step which follows is therefore able to deliver a relatively high amount of energy. A physical explanation is that on an electrically charged capacitor, there is a mutually attractive [[electric force]] between the [[electric charge]] on the electrode, and the ionic charge in the liquid. In order to pull ions away from the charged electrode, osmotic pressure must do [[work (physics)|work]]. This work done increases the electrical potential energy in the capacitor. An electronic explanation is that [[capacitance]] is a function of ion density. By introducing a salinity gradient and allowing some of the ions to diffuse out of the capacitor, this reduces the capacitance, and so the voltage must increase, since the voltage equals the ratio of charge to capacitance.

===Vapor pressure differences: open cycle and absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)===
Both of these methods do not rely on membranes, so filtration requirements are not as important as they are in the PRO &amp; RED schemes.

====Open cycle====
Similar to the open cycle in ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). The disadvantage of this cycle is the cumbersome problem of a large diameter turbine (75 meters +) operating at below atmospheric pressure to extract the power between the water with less salinity &amp; the water with greater salinity.

====Absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)====
For the purpose of dehumidifying air, in a [[absorption refrigerator#Water spray absorption refrigeration|water-spray absorption refrigeration]] system, water vapor is dissolved into a [[deliquescent]] salt water mixture using osmotic power as an intermediary. The primary power source originates from a thermal difference, as part of a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[heat engine]] cycle.

===Solar pond===
At the Eddy Potash Mine in New Mexico, a technology called "salinity gradient [[solar pond]]" (SGSP) is being utilized to provide the energy needed by the mine. '''This method does not harness osmotic power''', only solar power (see: [[solar pond]]). Sunlight reaching the bottom of the saltwater pond is absorbed as heat. The effect of [[natural convection]], wherein "heat rises", is blocked using density differences between the three layers that make up the pond, in order to trap heat. The upper convection zone is the uppermost zone, followed by the stable gradient zone, then the bottom thermal zone. The stable gradient zone is the most important. The saltwater in this layer can not rise to the higher zone because the saltwater above has lower salinity and is therefore less-dense and more buoyant; and it can not sink to the lower level because that saltwater is denser. This middle zone, the stable gradient zone, effectively becomes an "insulator" for the bottom layer (although the main purpose is to block natural convection, since water is a poor insulator). This water from the lower layer, the storage zone, is pumped out and the heat is used to produce energy, usually by turbine in an [[organic Rankine cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/756432-k7Q3X9/webviewable/756432.pdf Salinity Gradient Solar Pond Technology Applied to Potash Solution Mining]&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory a solar pond ''could'' be used to generate osmotic power if evaporation from solar heat is used to create a salinity gradient, ''and'' the potential energy in this salinity gradient is ''harnessed directly'' using one of the first three methods above, such as the capacitive method.

===Boron nitride nanotubes===

A research team built an experimental system using boron nitride that produced much greater power than the Statoil prototype. It used an impermeable and electrically insulating membrane that was pierced by a single boron nitride nanotube with an external diameter of a few dozen nanometers. With this membrane separating a salt water reservoir and a fresh water reservoir, the team measured the electric current passing through the membrane using two electrodes immersed in the fluid either side of the nanotube.

The results showed the device was able to generate an electric current on the order of a nanoampere. The researchers claim this is 1,000 times the yield of other known techniques for harvesting osmotic energy and makes boron nitride nanotubes an extremely efficient solution for harvesting the energy of salinity gradients for usable electrical power.

The team claimed that a {{convert|1|m2}} membrane could generate around 4&amp;nbsp;kW and be capable of generating up to 30 MWh per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |title=Nanotubes boost potential of salinity power as a renewable energy source |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028032447/http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |archivedate=2013-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Using low caloric waste energy by regenerate a high solution ammonium bicarbonate in a solution with a low salinity===
At Pennsylvania State University, Dr. Logan tries to use waste heat with low calority using the fact that [[ammonium bicarbonate]] disappears into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in warm water to form ammonia bicarbonate again in cold water. So in a RED energy producing closed system the two different gradients of salinity are kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/ |title=Energy from Water |accessdate=2017-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202195525/http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible negative environmental impact==

Marine and river environments have obvious differences in water quality, namely salinity. Each species of aquatic plant and animal is adapted to survive in either marine, brackish, or freshwater environments. There are species that can tolerate both, but these species usually thrive best in a specific water environment. The main waste product of salinity gradient technology is brackish water. The discharge of brackish water into the surrounding waters, if done in large quantities and with any regularity, will cause salinity fluctuations. While some variation in salinity is usual, particularly where fresh water (rivers) empties into an ocean or sea anyway, these variations become less important for both bodies of water with the addition of brackish waste waters. Extreme salinity changes in an aquatic environment may result in findings of low densities of both animals and plants due to intolerance of sudden severe salinity drops or spikes.&lt;ref name=Montague&gt;Montague, C., Ley, J. A Possible Effect of Salinity Fluctuation on Abundance of Benthic Vegetation and Associated Fauna in Northeastern Florida Bay. Estuaries and Coasts. 1993. Springer New York. Vol.15 No. 4. Pg. 703-717&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prevailing environmentalist opinions, the possibility of these negative effects should be considered by the operators of future large blue energy establishments.

The impact of brackish water on ecosystems can be minimized by pumping it out to sea and releasing it into the mid-layer, away from the surface and bottom ecosystems.

Impingement and entrainment at intake structures are a concern due to large volumes of both river and sea water utilized in both PRO and RED schemes. Intake construction permits must meet strict environmental regulations and desalination plants and power plants that utilize surface water are sometimes involved with various local, state and federal agencies to obtain permission that can take upwards to 18 months.

'''Personnel Psychology''' is a subfield of [[Industrial and Organizational Psychology]].&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Paul E.|title=Industrial/organizational psychology : understanding the workplace|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-4292-2370-7|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel psychology is the area of industrial/organizational psychology that primarily deals with the [[recruitment]], selection and evaluation of [[personnel]], and other job aspects such as morale, [[job satisfaction]], and relationships between managers and workers in the workplace.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book|last=Reber|first=Arthur S.|title=The Penguin dictionary of psychology|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0-14-051451-1|edition=3.|author2=Reber, Emily S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the field of study that concentrates on the selection and evaluation of employees; this area of psychology deals with [[job analysis]] and defines and measures [[job performance]], [[performance appraisal]], employment testing, employment interviews, employee selection and employee training, and [[human factors and ergonomics]].&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

==History==

===Twentieth Century===
By the end of the nineteenth century, industrial, or personnel psychology, was developed as a way to understand work behavior.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;  One influential figure in the beginning of this new area was [[Hugo Munsterberg]], a German psychologist who was trained by [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and who also worked with [[William James]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Munger /&gt;  Munsterberg studied selection and fit in the workplace, and he proposed experimental methods as solutions to business problems in his text, ''Psychology and Industrial Efficiency'' (1913).&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan E. Kazdin, ed. in chief|title=Encyclopedia of psychology, Vol. 4|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=1-55798-653-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served on the faculty at Harvard, and in his writings, talked about such topics as fit in a career, from both an employer's and employee's perspective.&lt;ref name=Munger&gt;{{cite book|last=Munger|first=Margaret P.|title=The history of psychology : fundamental questions|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, N.Y [etc.]|isbn=978-0-19-515154-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Dill Scott]], also trained by Wundt and a professor at Northwestern University, is credited with the foundation of I/O psychology, as he used such psychology in advertising and in founding the first personnel consulting firm.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;

===World War I===

The time around WW I brought about significant contributions to the field of industrial psychology. [[Robert Yerkes]], along with Walter Van Dyke Bingham and Scott, headed the selection and placement of army personnel with their [[Army Alpha]] and [[Army Beta]] tests.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt; These test helped to bring attention to testing as a form of selection and their uses in practical applications.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; This was the beginning of industrial psychology in the real world as opposed to the world of academia.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

===World War II===
World War II was marked by much of the same needs as in World War I.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; Bingham and Yeakes helped out the military again in developing research programs designed to assess work behavior, including: the Army General Classification Test (AGCT), the Aircrew Classification Test Battery, assessment center methods, and performance appraisal methods.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; Post World War II advances were also seen in increased doctoral programs, master's degree programs, and the expansion of other already existing programs.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;

===Twenty-first Century===
As opposed to war defining most of the twentieth century and the use of the applied psychology, economics will be the main focus of the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;  Technology is ever changing and decreasing the number of jobs for individuals; organizations are also striving to "flatten" out in their attempts to move away from largely [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] companies, and one other changing area of the twenty-first century is the diversifying of the workplace.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;  All these applications and areas will help to serve as importance for I/O psychology in the workplace and economic world.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

==Uses==

Personnel psychology is used in a variety of ways. Some of the most important functions it serves range from analyzing [[corporate culture]] and individual and group interactions to developing and evaluating employee selection and appraisal techniques. Other areas of use are assessing corporate [[leadership]] and [[employee motivation]] strategies, identifying causes and resolutions to internal conflicts, advising management of the potential psychological and social impact of corporate policies, and researching ways organizations can effectively manage cultural differences and leadership styles.&lt;ref name="previous book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aamodt|first=Michael G.|title=Industrial/organizational psychology : an applied approach|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0495601063|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personnel psychologists work in a variety of settings, including education, business, community, and agency environments. Many personnel psychologists serve as human resources specialists, helping organizations with staffing, training, and employee development and management in areas such as strategic planning, quality management, and adjustments to organization changes. Personnel psychologists apply psychological theories and principles to organizations. This field focuses on increasing workplace productivity and related issues such as the physical and mental well being of employees. Personnel psychologists use psychological measurement and research findings related to human abilities, motivation, perception, and learning in seeking to improve the fit between the needs of the work organization and those of the people who populate it.&lt;ref name="previous book" /&gt;

===Job Analysis===
[[Job analysis]] can be defined as "A loose term for the study of particular aspects of a given job. Those aspects may range from the tasks and duties of the position, to an examination of the desirable qualities of an employee, to the conditions of employment including pay, promotion opportunities, vacations, etc.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment]]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different ways to conduct a job analysis, as there are many different parts to it: job evaluation, job description, and job specifications.&lt;ref name="OD book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Worley|first=Thomas G. Cummings, Christopher G.|title=Organization development &amp; change|year=2009|publisher=South-Western/Cengage Learning|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-324-42138-5|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common tool used to measure job design is the ''Job Description Survey'' or JDS,&lt;ref name=WDQ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgeson|first=Frederick P.|author2=Humphrey, Stephen E.|title=The Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ): Developing and validating a comprehensive measure for assessing job design and the nature of work.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=91|issue=6|pages=1321–1339|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.6.1321|pmid=17100487}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is growing literature for other surveys and measures such as the ''Work Design Questionnaire'' or WDQ.&lt;ref name=WDQ /&gt; Such analyses are used to determine "what is important" within the job description, so as to better educate companies and individuals on the descriptions and requirements of the job.&lt;ref name=JDS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hackman|first=J. Richard|author2=Oldham, Greg R.|title=Development of the Job Diagnostic Survey.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 1975|volume=60|issue=2|pages=159–170|doi=10.1037/h0076546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection===
Selection involves the exchange of information between applicants and employers.&lt;ref name=selection&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bangerter|first=Adrian |author2=Roulin, Nicolas |author3=König, Cornelius J.|title=Personnel selection as a signaling game.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 2011|doi=10.1037/a0026078|volume=97|pages=719–738|pmid=22040263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel selection involves the goal alignment of applicants and organizations, however those goals may not always line up at times. Thus selection processes are designed to ensure that those goals line up and individuals are the best "fit" for the organization. Thus individuals may be likely to adapt their own behavior to better align with an organization.&lt;ref name=selection /&gt; 
Interviews are one of the most important pieces of information in regards to selection decisions.&lt;ref name="OCB selection"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Podsakoff|first=Nathan P.|author2=Whiting, Steven W. |author3=Podsakoff, Philip M. |author4=Mishra, Paresh |title=Effects of organizational citizenship behaviors on selection decisions in employment interviews.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 2011|volume=96|issue=2|pages=310–326|doi=10.1037/a0020948 |pmid=20919791}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interviews, it is found that individuals are more likely to exhibit organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) in their hopes of being hired by the company, but it is also found that these OCBs play a positive role in the interviewer's evaluation of the individuals.&lt;ref name="OCB selection"/&gt; Today, increases in technology have allowed for a much easier administration of such online tests as measures of aptitude, achievement, and personality. Thus these tests are starting to serve as the first hurdle of the selection process, even more so than the interview.&lt;ref name=feedback&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schinkel|first=Sonja |author2=van Dierendonck, Dirk |author3=van Vianen, Annelies |author4=Ryan, Ann Marie |title=Applicant Reactions to Rejection|journal=Journal of Personnel Psychology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=146–156|doi=10.1027/1866-5888/a000047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training===
[[Training and development|Training]] relates to an organization giving an individual the skills, knowledge, and abilities to help put the individual in line with the organization's goal.&lt;ref name="Dardar 2011 929–940"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dardar|first=A. |author2=Jusoh, A. |author3=Rasli A.|title=Impact of training on job turnover: Evidence from contemporary literature.|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business|year=2011|volume=3|issue=4|pages=929–940.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training provides the opportunity for the individual to gain personal, career, and job-related benefits, such as individual increases in job performance, better career relationships and objectives, and pride and job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Dardar 2011 929–940"/&gt; Research has also shown that the effectiveness of training has a relationship in how the work of an individual is organized.&lt;ref name=Training&gt;{{cite journal|last=Felstead|first=Alan|author2=Gallie, Duncan |author3=Green, Francis |author4= Zhou, Ying |title=Employee involvement, the quality of training and the learning environment: an individual level analysis|journal=The International Journal of Human Resource Management|date=1 August 2010|volume=21|issue=10|pages=1667–1688|doi=10.1080/09585192.2010.500489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations that allow employees more autonomy and freedom in how they do their work have shown that employees are more able to improve and incorporate training aspects into their work.&lt;ref name=Training /&gt;

===Rewards===
One major approach to [[Wage|compensation]] around the world, is performance based pay.&lt;ref name="performance pay"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ganster|first=Daniel C.|author2=Kiersch, Christa E. |author3=Marsh, Rachel E. |author4=Bowen, Angela |title=Performance-Based Rewards and Work Stress|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior Management|date=1 October 2011|volume=31|issue=4|pages=221–235|doi=10.1080/01608061.2011.619388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short of job loss, income security is a major stressor for individuals as they stress out over predictability of income.&lt;ref name="performance pay" /&gt; In contrast, other research has also shown though that such pay systems can actual provide motivation, satisfaction, or desired challenge levels to the job, instead of individuals perceiving it is inequality, unfair, or stressful.&lt;ref name="performance pay" /&gt; 
Stable pay systems have been found to not necessarily be the best link between an individual's performance and his pay level. Stable pay levels can also account for decreases in performance as individuals' incomes are not linked with their performances. Thus these performance levels may drop without a perceived cost to their pay level.&lt;ref name="manager pay"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heneman|first=Herbert G.|title=Impact of performance on managerial pay levels and pay changes.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1 January 1973|volume=58|issue=1|pages=128–130|doi=10.1037/h0035424}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that individuals who perceive a strong connection between their effort and reward are evaluated more highly and in turn have higher work satisfaction.&lt;ref name=effort&gt;{{cite journal|last=SCHNEIDER|first=BENJAMIN|author2=OLSONS, LOREN K.|title=EFFORT AS A CORRELATE OF ORGANIZATIONAL REWARD SYSTEM AND INDIVIDUAL VALUES|journal=Personnel Psychology|date=1 September 1970|volume=23|issue=3|pages=313–326|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1970.tb01659.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feedback===
[[Feedback#Social sciences|Feedback]] has been defined as any response from the environment that helps to influence future actions, information that follows task performance, or information from others in the social world, whether it be approval or disapproval.&lt;ref name=dictionary /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dictionary2&gt;{{cite book|last=Cardwell|first=Mike|title=Dictionary of psychology|year=1999|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|location=London|isbn=1579580645}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A positive feedback culture is one in which individuals not only receive and solicit feedback for job performance improvement, but also use both formal and informal feedback as means to accomplish performance goals.&lt;ref name=Feedback&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=Jane Brodie|author2=Levy, Paul E.|title=It's not me, it's you: A multilevel examination of variables that impact employee coaching relationships.|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=1 January 2011|volume=63|issue=2|pages=67–88|doi=10.1037/a0024152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such an environment is created by an employee's direct supervisors and includes the quality and frequency of
coaching and informal feedback delivery.&lt;ref name=Feedback /&gt; Research has found publicly offering employees negative feedback may decrease positive affect and willingness to show organizational citizenship behaviors, and doing so, also increases tendencies to engage in more destructive forms of work behavior &lt;ref name=Feedback2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belschak|first=Frank D. |author2=Den Hartog, Deanne N.|title=Consequences of Positive and Negative Feedback: The Impact on Emotions and Extra-Role Behaviors|journal=Applied Psychology|date=1 April 2009|volume=58|issue=2|pages=274–303|doi=10.1111/j.1464-0597.2008.00336.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Armed Forces]] defines '''personnel recovery''' as "The sum of military, [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] civilian, DOD contractor personnel, or other personnel designated by the [[President of the United States|President]] or [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], who are isolated, missing, detained, or captured (IMDC) in an operational environment.  Also called PR." 
The [[Joint Personnel Recovery Agency]] is the Chairman's Controlled Activity and is designated as DoD's office of primary responsibility for DoD-wide personnel recovery (PR) matters, less policy. 

The [[European Personnel Recovery Centre]] facilitates the harmonisation of personnel recovery policy, doctrine and standards through clear lines of communications with partners stakeholders (nations and international organizations)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eprc.it/structure/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==The five PR execution tasks==
# Report: Begins with the recognition of an isolating event.  It must be both timely and accurate.
# Locate: Involves the effort to find and authenticate isolated personnel.  Accurate position and positive ID are generally required prior to committing forces.
# Support: Involves support for isolated personnel and their families.  It can include establishing two-way communications, dropping supplies, or suppressing enemy threats.
# Recover: Involves coordinated actions of commanders and staffs, recovery forces and the isolated individual.
# Reintegrate: The primary consideration is the physical and mental health of the recovered personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1056a: Reintegration of recovered Department of Defense personnel; post-isolation support activities for other recovered personnel|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section1056a&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim#sourcecredit|website=uscode.house.gov|publisher=uscode.house.gov|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">The '''Petersen matrix''' is a comprehensive description of systems of [[biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] used to model [[chemical reactor|reactors]] for [[Biodegradability prediction|pollution control]] (engineered [[decomposition]]) as well as in [[environmental systems]]. It has got as many columns as the number of relevant involved components ([[chemicals]], [[pollutants]], [[biomass]]es, [[gases]]) and as many rows as the number of involved [[Chemical process|processes]] (biochemical reactions and physical degradation). One further column is added to host the description of the [[kinetics (chemistry)|kinetics]] of each transformation ([[rate equation]]).&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=David L.|title=Practical wastewater treatment|year=2006|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-471-78044-1|pages=288|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471780448.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fang&gt;{{cite book|last=Fang|first=editor, Herbert H.P.|title=Environmental anaerobic technology : applications and new developments|year=2010|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=London|isbn=9781848165427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matrix structure ==
The mass conservation principle for each process is expressed in the rows of the matrix. If all components are included (none omitted) then the mass conservation principle states that, for each process:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all process } i:\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}\dot{\rho_j} = 0 \;,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{\rho_j}&lt;/math&gt; is the density rate of each component. This can also be seen as the process [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric relation]].

Moreover, the rate of variation of each component for all processes simultaneous effect can be easily assessed by summing the columns:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all component } j: \frac{\partial C_j}{\partial t} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ij} r_i \; ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; are the reaction rates of each process.

== Example ==
A system of a third [[Order of reaction|order reaction]] followed by a [[Michaelis-Menten]] enzyme reaction.

:&lt;chem&gt;
{A} + 2B -&gt; S
&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;
{E} + S &lt;=&gt;[k_f][k_r] ES -&gt;[k_\mathrm{cat}] {E} + P
&lt;/chem&gt;

where the reagents A and B combine forming the substrate S (S = AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which with the help of enzyme E is transformed into the product P.
Production rates for each substance is:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d [\ce A]}{d t} &amp;= -k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2
\\
\frac{d [\ce B]}{d t} &amp;= -2 k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2
\\
\frac{d [\ce S]}{d t} &amp;= k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2 - k_f[\ce E][\ce S] + k_r[\ce{ES}]
\\
\frac{d [\ce E]}{d t} &amp;= - k_f[\ce E][\ce S] + k_r[\ce{ES}] + k_\ce{cat}[\ce ES]
\\
\frac{d [\ce ES]}{d t} &amp;= k_f[\ce E][\ce S] - k_r[\ce{ES}] - k_\ce{cat}[\ce{ES}]
\\
\frac{d [\ce P]}{d t} &amp;= k_\ce{cat}[\ce ES]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the Petersen matrix reads as
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{Diagonal split header|Process | Components&lt;br/&gt;(kmol/m³)}} !! A !! B !! S !! E !! ES !! P !! Reaction rate  
|-
| P1: 2nd order formation of S from A and B || -1 || -2 || +1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P2: Formation of ES from E and S|| 0 || 0 || -1 || -1 || +1 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_f[\ce E][\ce S]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P3: Back decomposition of ES into E and S|| 0 || 0 || +1 || +1 || -1 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_r[\ce{ES}]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P4: Forward decomposition of ES into E and P || 0 || 0 || 0 || +1 || -1 || +1 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_\ce{cat}[\ce{ES}]&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The Petersen matrix can be used to write the system's rate equation

:&lt;math chem&gt;
  \begin{pmatrix} 
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce A] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce B] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce S] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce E] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce{ES}] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce P]
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
    -2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23363">'''Post-expressionism''' is a term coined by the German [[art critic]] [[Franz Roh]] to describe a variety of movements in the post-war art world which were influenced by [[expressionism]] but defined themselves through rejecting its aesthetic. Roh first used the term in an essay in 1925, "Magic Realism: Post-Expressionism", to contrast to [[Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub]]'s "[[New Objectivity]]", which more narrowly characterized these developments within German art. Though Roh saw "post-expressionism" and "[[Magic Realism (painting)|magic realism]]" as synonymous, later critics characterized distinctions between magic realism and other artists initially identified by Hartlaub and have also pointed out other artists in Europe who had different stylistic tendencies but were working within the same trend.

==Background==

Leading up to [[World War I]], much of the art world was under the influence of [[Futurism]] and [[Expressionism]]. Both movements abandoned any sense of order or commitment to objectivity or tradition.

The sentiment of Futurists was most vocally expressed by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Filippo Marinetti]] in the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', where he called for a rejection of the past, a rejection of all imitation &amp;mdash; of other artists or of the outside world &amp;mdash; and praised the virtue of originality and triumph of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Umbro Apollonio (ed.), ''Futurist Manifestos'', MFA Publications, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-87846-627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, along these lines, said “After seeing electricity, I lost interest in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Greaves, Zaller, and Roberts 1997, p.779&lt;/ref&gt; Marinetti and other Futurists glorified war and violence as a way to revolution &amp;ndash; bringing freedom, establishing new ideas, and rallying one to fight for one's own people &amp;ndash; and as war was shaping up in Europe, many saw it and encouraged a way to “purify” the culture and destroy old, obsolete elements of society.

Expressionists, likewise abandoning imitation nature, sought to express emotional experience, but often centered their art around [[angst]] &amp;mdash; inner turmoil; whether in reaction to the modern world, to alienation from society, or in the creation of personal identity. In concert with this evocation of angst, expressionists also echoed some of the same feelings of revolution as did Futurists. This is evidenced by a 1919 anthology of expressionist poetry titled ''[[Menschheitsdämmerung]]'', which translates to “Dawn of Humanity” &amp;mdash; meant to suggest that humanity was in a 'twilight'; that there was an imminent demise of some old way of being and beneath it the urgings of a new dawning.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Both futurism and expressionism were always met by opposition, but the destruction that occurred in the war had heightened the criticism against them. Following the war, in and throughout different artistic circles there was a call for a [[Return to Order|return to order]] and re-appreciation of tradition and of the natural world. In Italy, this was encouraged by the magazine ''[[Valori Plastici]]'' and came together in the [[Novecento Italiano|Novecento]], a group that exhibited in the Venice Biennale and was joined by many Futurists who had rejected their former work. [[Mario Sironi]], a member of this group, stated that they “would not imitate the world created by God but would be inspired by it.” The “New Objectivity” or ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', as coined by Hartlaub, described the developments in Germany and became the title of an exhibition that he staged in 1925. ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' was influenced not only by the “return to order” but also a call to arms among more left-leaning artists who wanted to use their art in a forward, political manner that expressionism didn't enable them to do. In Belgium, there was another vein in the common trend, which would later be referred to as a “retour à l’humain”.

==Movements==

When Hartlaub defined the idea of the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', he identified two groups: the ''verists'', who “[tore] the objective form of the world of contemporary facts and represent current experience in its tempo and fevered temperature,” and the ''classicists'', who “[searched] more for the object of timeless ability to embody the external laws of existence in the artistic sphere.”

Although Roh originally meant the term 'Magic Realism' to be more or less synonymous with ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', the artists identified by Hartlaub as 'classicists' later became associated with Roh's term. These 'Magic Realists' were all influenced by the classicism developed in Italy by the Novecento, and in turn by [[de Chirico]]'s concept of ''[[metaphysical art]]'', which had also branched into surrealism. Art critic [[Wieland Schmeid]] in 1977 posited that despite the fact that the terms were meant to refer to the same thing, the understanding of them as different groups derives from the fact that the movement had a right and left wing, with the Magic Realists on the right &amp;mdash; many later supporting fascism or accommodating to it&amp;mdash; and the ''verists'' we associate as the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' on the left &amp;mdash; fighting against fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Crockett 1998, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups in addition to having different political philosophies likewise had different artistic philosophies.

The third movement that is important to include in post-expressionism, and which Roh excluded, is the reaction to [[Flemish Expressionism]], as opposed to strains of German expressionism and Italian futurism. This is typically referred to as ''animism''.

===Magic Realism===

{{Main|Magic Realism (painting)}}
[[File:Donghi antonio-due canarini in gabbia-reduced size.jpg|thumb|275px|left|''Due canarini in gabbia'' by Antonio Donghi, 1932]]
[[File:Anton Raderscheidt, 1926, Tulpen auf der Fensterbank.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''Tulpen auf der Fensterbank'' by Anton Räderscheidt, 1926]]
'Magic Realism' for Roh, as a reaction to expressionism, meant to declare “[that] the autonomy of the objective world around us was once more to be enjoyed; the wonder of matter that could crystallize into objects was to be seen anew.”&lt;ref&gt;Zamora and Ferris 1995&lt;/ref&gt; With the term, he was emphasizing the “magic” of the normal world as it presents itself to us &amp;mdash; how, when we really look at everyday objects, they can appear strange and fantastic.

In Italy, the style that Roh identified was created by a confluence of a renewed focus on harmony and technique called for by the “return to order” and ''metaphysical art'', a style which had been developed by Carlo Carrà and Giorgio de Chirico, two members of the Novecento. Carrà described his purpose as to explore the imagined inner life of familiar objects when represented out of their explanatory contexts: their solidity, their separateness in the space allotted to them, the secret dialogue that may take place between them.

The leading painter in Italy associated with this style is perhaps [[Antonio Donghi]], who kept to traditional subject matter &amp;mdash; popular life, landscapes, and still life &amp;mdash; but presented it with strong composition and spatial clarity to give it gravity and stillness. His still lifes often consist of a small vase of flowers, depicted with the disarming symmetry of [[naive art]]. He also often painted birds carefully arranged for display in their cages, and dogs and other animals ready to perform for circus acts, to suggest an artificial arrangement placed on top of nature. In Germany, [[Anton Räderscheidt]] followed a style similar to Donghi, turning to magic realism after abandoning constructivism. [[Georg Schrimpf]] is somewhat like the two, working in a style influenced by [[primitivism]].

[[Filippo De Pisis]], who is often associated with ''metaphysical art'', can also be seen as a magic realist. Like Donghi, he often painted traditional subjects, but rather than developing a strict classical style, used a more painterly brush to bring out the intimacy of the objects, similar to the Belgian ''animists''. His association with ''metaphysical art'' comes from the fact that he would often contrapose objects in his still lifes, and set them in a scene that gave them context.

Another artist in Italy considered a [[magic realism|magic realist]] is [[Felice Casorati]], whose paintings are rendered with fine technique but often distinguished by unusual perspective effects and bold colorfulness. In 1925, Rafaello Giolli summarized the disconcerting aspects of Casorati's art — “The volumes have no weight in them, and the colors no body. Everything is fictitious: even the living lack all nervous vitality. The sun seems to be the moon ... nothing is fixed or definite.”

Other German artists who worked within this style are [[Alexander Kanoldt]] and [[Carl Grossberg]]. Kanoldt painted still lifes and portraits, while Grossberg painted urban landscapes and industrial sites rendered with chilly precision.

===New Objectivity and Verism===

{{Main|New Objectivity}}
[[File:George grosz-the eclipse of the sun.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''The Eclipse of the Sun'' by George Grosz, 1926]]
The artists most associated with the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' today are those Hartlaub identified as 'verists'. These artists tended to oppose expressionism, but did not so much exemplify the “return to order” as much as they opposed what they saw as the political impotence of expressionist art. They sought to involve themselves into revolutionary politics and their form of realism distorted appearances to emphasize the ugly, as they wanted to expose what they considered the ugliness of reality. The art was raw, provocative, and harshly satirical.

[[Bertolt Brecht]], a German dramatist, was an early critic of Expressionism, referring to it as constrained and superficial. Just like in politics Germany had a new parliament but lacked parliamentarians, he argued, in literature there was an expression of delight in ideas, but no new ideas, and in theater a 'will to drama', but no real drama. His early plays, ''Baal'' and ''Trommeln in der Nacht'' (Drums in the Night) express repudiations of fashionable interest in Expressionism. Opposed to the focus on individual emotional experience in expressionist art, Brecht began a collaborative method to play production, starting with his ''[[Man Equals Man]]'' project.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the ''verist'' critique of expressionism was influenced by [[Dadaism]]. The early exponents of Dada had been drawn together in Switzerland, a neutral country in the war, and in common cause, they wanted to use their art as a form of moral and cultural protest &amp;mdash; shaking off not only the constraints of nationality, but also of artistic language, in order to express political outrage and encourage political action.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Expressionism, to Dadaists, expressed all of the angst and anxieties of society, but was helpless to do anything about it.

Out of this, Dada cultivated a “satirical hyperrealism”, as termed by [[Raoul Hausmann]], and of which the best known examples are the graphical works and photo-montages of [[John Heartfield]]. Use of collage in these works became a ''compositional'' principle to blend reality and art, as if to suggest that to record the facts of reality was to go beyond the most simple appearances of things.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; This later developed into portraits and scenes by artists such as [[George Grosz]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Rudolf Schlichter]]. Portraits would give emphasis to particular features or objects that were seen as distinctive aspects of the person depicted. Satirical scenes often depicted a madness behind what was happening, depicting the participants as cartoon-like.

Other ''verist'' artists, like Christian Schad, depicted reality with a clinical precision, which suggested both an empirical detachment and intimate knowledge of the subject. Schad's paintings are characterized "an artistic perception so sharp that it seems to cut beneath the skin", according to Schmied.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied 1978, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Often, psychological elements were introduced in his work, which suggested an underlying unconscious reality to life.

===Animism===

{{Main|Animism (art)}}
[[File:Wolvens, Bont strandzicht, reduced size.jpg|thumb|430px|left|''Bont strandzicht'' by Henri-Victor Wolvens, 1959. Wolvens began his style in the 1920s but worked until his death in 1977.]]
In Belgium, expressionism had been influenced by artists like [[James Ensor]] and [[Louis Pevernagie]] who had combined expressionism with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. Ensor, known for his paintings of people in masks, carnival outfits, and side-by-side with skeletons, also often painted realistic scenes, but imbued them with a fevered brush, garish colors, and strong contrasts to suggest a strange unreality present in them, as did Pevernagie. Expressionism was also exhibited in the [[Latemse School]], where adherents like [[Constant Permeke]] and [[Hubert Malfait]] used brushwork in painting and loose form in sculpture to show a mystic reality behind nature.

In what had been called a “retour à l’humain” (return to the human), many artists working in Belgium after the war had kept the expressive brush of their forebearers, but had rejected what they had seen as the anti-human, unreal distortions in their subject matter. The goal was to use the expressive brush to depict the soul or spirit of the objects, people, and places they were painting, rather than a hyperbolic, externalized, displaced angst of the artist. These artists were often characterized as 'introverts', as opposed to the 'extroverts' of expressionism.
[[File:Jespers, floris-still life with coffeepot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Stillleben mit Kaffeekanne'' by Floris Jespers, 1932. Jespers was influenced by animism after the war.]]
Belgian art critic [[Paul Haesaerts]] later gave this movement the title ''animism'', which he took from anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]]'s book ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) describing '[[animism]]' as primitive religion that based itself on the idea a soul inhabited all objects. Later, Haesaerts, driven by criticism to do so, also used the terms ''réalisme poétique'' and ''intimism'', although ''animism'' is still most commonly used in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumhermandecuyper.be/evolutie_animisme_en.htm|title= ''Artistic evolution: animism'' |publisher = Museum Herman De Cuyper}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intimism'' will more often refer to the art practiced by some members of the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/291874/Intimism|title= ''Intimism'' |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recognized painter of these artists is [[Henri-Victor Wolvens]], who painted many scenes of the beach and ocean at [[Oostende]]. In his beach scenes, harsh waves are painted with a rough brush, clouds in patches &amp;mdash; rougher when in storm &amp;mdash; and the sand with a scraped quality. Figures are painted as simply as possible, often as stick figures, and given translucency and movement &amp;mdash; so his bathers show the activity of the beach and it the activity of the bathers blend in with the motion of the waves crashing ashore.

The work of [[Floris Jespers]] was strongly influenced by an animist spirit after the war. He uses form and color to give different degrees of vividness to the subjects in his paintings, each to the degree that one would associate them with in life.

Other painters associated with this movement are [[Anne Bonnet]], [[Albert Dasnoy]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Mayou Iserentant]], [[Jacques Maes]], [[Marcel Stobbaerts]], [[Albert Van Dyck]], [[Louis Van Lint]], [[War Van Overstraeten]] and [[Jozef Vinck]].

Filippo De Pisis, referenced above, exhibited animist tendencies.

[[George Grard]] is the sculptor most associated with animism. Like expressionists, he went against both naturalism and classical tendencies, but used exaggerations from his models to heighten the feeling and sensuality of the form, and chose lyrical subjects. Grard was friends with [[Charles LePlae]], who had a similar style, but kept more in line with natural and classical forms.

[[Herman De Cuyper]] is also associated with animism, and abstracted to a more extreme degree than did Grard or LaPlae, and in some ways is more similar to [[Henry Moore]].

==Counter-movements==

An early revolt against the imposed classicism that was popular in the Novecento took place with the founding of the ''[[Scuola Romana]]''.

===Romantic Expressionism===

{{Main|Scuola Romana}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mafai, fantasia no 9 , 1942.jpg|thumb|400px|right|''Fantasia n.9 &amp;mdash; Fucilazione'' by Mario Mafai, 1942]] --&gt;
[[Corrado Cagli]] was a member of this group, and identified himself and others whom he met as members of the “New Roman School of Painting”, or ''nuovi pittori romani'' (new Roman painters).&lt;ref&gt;''Anticipi sulla Scuola di Roma (Anticipations on the School of Rome)'' on "Quadrante" (I, 1933 n.6)&lt;/ref&gt; Cagli spoke of a spreading sensitivity and an ''Astro di Roma'' (Roman Star) which guided them, affirming it as the poetic basis of their art:
{{quote|''In a primordial dawn all has to be reconsidered, and Imagination relives all wonders and trembles for all mysteries.''}}

Sometimes referred to as ''romantic expressionism'', art from this group exhibits a wild painting style, expressive and disorderly, violent and with warm ochre and maroon tones. Contrary to early expressionism, the focus isn't on angst and turmoil, but rather seeing the world anew, as Cagli described, through romantic imagination. Yet, the formal rigour of the Novecento was replaced by a distinctly expressionist visionariness.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Renato Barilli, ''L'arte contemporanea: da [[Cézanne]] alle ultime tendenze'', Feltrinelli, 2005, p.248: "... a savage and reductive raffiguration dominates, which recalls distant baroque trends, or even closer to the expressionist furores of artists such as [[Chagall]], made viable to them thanks to Antonietta Raphaël, who had known him in [[Paris]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scipione]] brought to life a sort of Roman baroque expressionism, where often decadent landscapes appear of Rome's historical baroque centre, populated by priests and cardinals, seen with a vigorously expressive and hallucinated eye.

[[Mario Mafai]] painted many scenes of Rome and its suburbs, and used warm chromatic colors to convey a sense of freshness and pictorial curiosity. This bent is particularly emphasised in his 1936-1939 work, in a series paintings entitled ''Demolitions'', where in order to make a political statement he painted urban restructuring being carried out by the fascist regime. During the Second World War he painted a series of ''Fantasies'' depicting horrors committed by the fascists.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. F. Negri Arnoldi, ''Storia dell'Arte Moderna'', [[Milan]] 1990, pp.613-616&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonietta Raphaël]], Mafai's wife and a sculptor, was also a member of this group.

Another member was [[Renatto Guttuso]], who like Mafai made paintings which denounced the fascist regime. Guttuso's works are generally bright, lively, and verging on abstraction.

[[Emanuele Cavalli]] and [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]] have associations both with the ''Scuola Romana'' and with Magic Realism.

The code of '''purity of arms''' ({{lang-he|טוהר הנשק}}, ''Tohar HaNeshek'') is one of the values stated in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]' official doctrine of ethics, ''The Spirit of the IDF''. It states that:

{{cquote|The soldier shall make use of his weaponry and power only for the fulfillment of the mission and solely to the extent required; he will maintain his humanity even in combat. The soldier shall not employ his weaponry and power in order to harm non-combatants or prisoners of war, and shall do all he can to avoid harming their lives, body, honor and property.|||IDF Spirit&lt;ref name="doctrine" /&gt;}}

==Jewish and universal moral sources of the code==

The "Spirit of the IDF", a text within the IDF's main doctrine, requires "honoring the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish ... state", referring to both "the tradition of the Jewish People throughout their history" and "universal moral values based on the value and dignity of human life".&lt;ref name="doctrine"/&gt; [[Halacha|Jewish religious law]] does not directly determine IDF policy, and the IDF Doctrine Statement is not a religious document, but its underlying religious basis was articulated by Chief Rabbi [[Shlomo Goren]] (1917–1994), who had served in the IDF as both paratrooper and chief chaplain.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; 

According to [[Norman Solomon (rabbi)|Rabbi Norman Solomon]], the concepts of [[Havlaga]] and purity of arms arise out of the ethical and moral values stemming from the tradition of Israel, extrapolation from the Jewish [[Halakha]], and the desire for moral approval and hence political support from the world community.&lt;ref name= "solomon"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Judaism and the ethics of war |author=[[Norman Solomon (rabbi)|Norman Solomon]] |journal=International Review of the Red Cross |volume=87 |number=858 |date=June 2005 |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc_858_solomon.pdf |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite doubts when confronted by indiscriminate terrorism, purity of arms remains the guiding rule for the Israeli forces.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; These foundations have elicited a fair degree of consensus among Jews, both religious and secular.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt;

A notable proponent of this image is Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], a retired British army officer, who called the IDF the most moral army in the world on Israel's Channel 2 News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israeltoday.co.il/Default.aspx?tabid%3D178%26nid%3D24780 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513204717/http://www.israeltoday.co.il/Default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=24780 |archivedate=May 13, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 document regarding Operation Protective Edge, published by [[Friends of Israel Initiative]], the High Level Military Group, composed of military experts from Australia, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Spain, acknowledged that Israel made "unprecedented efforts" to avoid civilian casualties exceeding international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.high-level-military-group.org/pdf/hlmg-assessment-2014-gaza-conflict.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011145546/http://www.high-level-military-group.org/pdf/hlmg-assessment-2014-gaza-conflict.pdf |archivedate=October 11, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast, the 2015 report of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Operation Protective Edge, chaired by Mary McGowan Davis (ex-Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York), voiced concerns that "the fact that the political and military leadership did not change its course of action, despite considerable information regarding the massive degree of death and destruction in Gaza, raises questions about potential violations of international humanitarian law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Human Rights Council |date=23 June 2015 |title=Report of the detailed findings of the independent commission of inquiry established pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-21/1|publisher=United Nations|docket=A/HRC/29/CRP.4|access-date=14 June 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactical and ethical dilemmas==

In combat and other confrontation situations several of the values within the Spirit of the IDF code are concomitantly evoked, such as:
*Human Life: "The IDF servicemen and women will act in a judicious and safe manner in all they do, out of recognition of the supreme value of human life. During combat they will endanger themselves and their comrades only to the extent required to carry out their mission."&lt;ref name="doctrine" /&gt;
*Comradeship: "The IDF servicemen and women will act out of fraternity and devotion to their comrades, and will always go to their assistance when they need their help or depend on them, despite any danger or difficulty, even to the point of risking their lives."&lt;ref name="doctrine"&gt;{{cite web |title=Doctrine |publisher=Israel Defense Forces |url=http://www1.idf.il/dover/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=32 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031938/http://www1.idf.il/dover/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=32 |year=2006 |archivedate=April 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dealing with such dilemmas requires a coherent response on the part of officer and soldier alike.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Selective targeting (or [[targeted killing]]) of terrorist leaders is considered by the IDF as a legitimate mode of operation and part of a state's counterterrorism, anticipatory, self-defense activities that are designed to prevent the continuation of terrorism. Selective targeting of terrorist activists is used as a measure designed to hurt the real enemy while minimizing civilian casualties. The practice was challenged before the Israeli Supreme Court, which held that while terrorists were civilians under the law of armed conflict, they were not protected by the prohibition in Article 51(3) of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which provides that civilians enjoy immunity from deliberate attack "unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rule 6. Civilians’ Loss of Protection from Attack |publisher=ICRC |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter1_rule6 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found that the meaning of both "for such time" and "direct part in hostilities" covered those providing services to unlawful combatants in any period before a potential attack; therefore terrorists did not qualify for this immunity, a ruling that has been accepted into international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nils Melzer |title=Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities Under International Humanitarian Law |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision received a mixed reception from the international community, with one scholar expressing concern that it threatened "to undermine international law's protection of civilians in armed conflict by shifting the balance toward military advantage and increasing the likelihood of collateral damage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kristen Eichensehr |title=On Target? The Israeli Supreme Court and the Expansion of Targeted Killings |volume=116 |issue=8 |journal=Yale Law Journal |page=1881 |date=June 2007 |url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/comment/on-target-the-israeli-supreme-court-and-the-expansion-of-targeted-killings |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |doi=10.2307/20455778}} See also articles in ''Journal of International Criminal Justice'' 5 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Some challenge the idea that the IDF is either particularly moral or follows the concept of "Purity of Arms",&lt;ref name="Prior1999p208"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Michael Prior]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAFJVy6GPHkC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%22Purity+of+arms%22 |title=The state of Israel: A Moral Inquiry |chapter=Purity of Arms |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1999 |page=208 |isbn=9780203980217 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Avneri2007p31"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Uri Avneri]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLUDrlB2ui8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22arm%C3%A9e+la+plus+morale+du+monde%22 |title=Guerre du Liban, un Israélien accuse |publisher=[[L'Harmattan]] |year=2007 |page=31 |isbn=9782296023413 |others=Roland Massuard and Sylviane de Wangen, translators; Sylviane de Wangen, contributor}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to [[Gideon Levy]], the "majority of the Israelis is still deeply convinced that their army, the IDF, is the most moral army of the world, and nothing else".&lt;ref name ="GL"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="Prior1999p208"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Avneri2007p31"/&gt; Criticism of the concept has centered on its consistency with international law, and the tendency for civilians to be killed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;By the end of 2005, almost 300 terrorist organization members and 150 civilian bystanders had been killed in targeted killings, in addition to hundreds of civilians wounded.

According to [[Avi Shlaim]], "purity of arms" is one of the key features of "the conventional Zionist account or old history" whose "popular-heroic-moralistic version of the 1948 war" is "taught in Israeli schools and used extensively in the quest for legitimacy abroad".&lt;ref name="shlaimdebate"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Avi Shlaim]] |url=http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472115419-ch5.pdf |chapter=The Debate About 1948 |title=Making Israel |accessdate=March 5, 2015}} Also published in {{cite journal |title= The Debate About 1948 |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=27 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=287–304 |doi=10.1017/s0020743800062097}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benny Morris]] adds, "[t]he Israelis' collective memory of fighters characterized by "purity of arms" is also undermined by the evidence of [the dozen case] of rapes committed in conquered towns and villages." According to him, "after the war, the Israelis tended to hail the "purity of arms" of its militiamen and soldiers to contrast this with Arab barbarism, which on occasion expressed itself in the mutilation of captured Jewish corpses. (...) This reinforced the [[Hasbara|Israelis' positive self-image and helped them 'sell' the new state abroad]] and (...) demonized the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Benny Morris]] |title=1948.

Following the [[Qibya massacre]], [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] questioned the moral character of operations of the Israeli army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] |title=After Qibya |journal=BeTerem |date=December 15, 1953 |pages=168–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that at the contrary of the time of diaspora, Jews established in Israel have the possibility to resort to force and that if in 1948 they had no choice, at Qibya the Israeli nation showed his moral limits.&lt;ref name = "MorrisQibya"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Benny Morris]] |title=The Israeli Press and the Qibya Operation, 1953 |year=1996 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Colonel Dov Yirmiah has referred to "the lies about humanitarianism and 'purity of arms'", and refers to purity of arms as a phrase that is "sickening and false".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Noam Chomsky]] |title=The Fateful Triangle: the United States, Israel and the Palestinians |year=1989 |publisher=Pluto Press |edition=2nd New |isbn=978-0745315355}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dov's book ''My War Diary: Lebanon June 5 – July 1, 1982'' has been described as having "crushed the myth" of the purity of arms of the IDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Embracing the Other: Philosophical, Psychological, and Historical Perspectives on Altruism |author=Pearl Oliner |author2=Samuel P.

According to [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]] the claim that the IDF is the most moral army in the world is "yet another myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John Mearsheimer]] |author2=[[Stephen Walt]] |title=The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |date=2008 |isbn=978-0374531508}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting Rabbinic opinion===

Some rabbis oppose the stipulation of avoiding harm to non-combatants, arguing that Jewish law specifically rejects this requirement during wartime. Some instances:
* Rabbis associated with the Israeli settlement movement in the West Bank and Gaza demanded in 2004 that terrorism must be fought without regard for the safety of the enemy civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=September 9, 2004 |url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/4561_62.htm |title=ADL Strongly Condemns Declaration of Rabbis |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002221043/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/4561_62.htm |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], the main organization of Modern Orthodox rabbis in the United States called on the Israeli military to be less concerned with avoiding civilian casualties on the opposing side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rebecca Spence |title=Rabbis: Israel Too Worried Over Civilian Deaths |newspaper=The Jewish Daily Forward |date=August 25, 2006 |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/1438/ |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that [[Hezbollah]] hides among the civilian population, and therefore it would be immoral not to attack Hezbollah—as Hezbollah poses an extreme threat to the Israeli civilian population.

In a study assessing an increasingly-diversified array of publishers and their service to the academic community, [[Janice S. Lewis]] concluded that college and university librarians ranked university presses higher and commercial publishers lower than did members of the [[American Political Science Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Janice S. "An assessment of publisher quality by political science librarians." College &amp; Research Libraries 61.4 (2000): 313-323&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of approaches to ranking academic book publishers;&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, Larry P., Bradford Dillman, and Anil Hira.

(2007).http://eprints.utas.edu.au/7236/1/AusPSA_RQF_final_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; rankings rely on subjective impressions by the scholarly community, on analyses of prize winners of scientific associations and a publisher's reputation and [[impact factor]] (particularly in the sciences). According to Colin Steele, a librarian at the [[Australian National Library]] in [[Canberra]], "Listings of publishers by title also fail to take into account that some university presses are strong in certain disciplines, but not across the whole spectrum."&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Colin.

== {{anchor|SENSE Rankings}}SENSE rankings ==
The [[Research School for Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment]] (SENSE Research School) ranked scientific publishers in 2006.&lt;ref name="SENSEdoc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sense.nl/organisation/documentation|title=SENSE - Quality &amp; Criteria|website=www.sense.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; SENSE works in conjunction with the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW), in accordance with the standard evaluation protocol for Dutch universities. The school developed its ranking in conjunction with performance criteria for its staff. rating A, B, and C journals and A, B, C, D, and E publishers. A-publishers are ranking scheme,&lt;ref name="SENSEranking"&gt;http://www.sense.nl/gfx_content/documents/ABCDE-indeling%20Scientific%20Publishers%20SENSE_approved_May_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the "few top-notch international publishers"; B-publishers are "good international publishers";&lt;ref name="SENSEranking" /&gt; C-publishers are "decent international publishers and excellent national publishers";&lt;ref name="SENSEranking" /&gt; D-publishers are "professional publications published by major international organisations and good national publishers",&lt;ref name="SENSEranking" /&gt; and E-publishers are "publications mainly published for a non-academic general public by national organisations and small local publishers". The SENSE Ranking was recognized in [[bibliometric]] literature&lt;ref&gt;Zuccala, Alesia, et al. "Can we rank scholarly book publishers? A bibliometric experiment with the field of history." Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 66.7 (2015): 1333-1347; Torres-Salinas, Daniel, et al. "The BiPublishers ranking: Main results and methodological problems when constructing rankings of academic publishers." arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.01074 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; and other universities' attempts to rate publishers.&lt;ref&gt;see for example the ranking, provided by the [[Education University of Hong Kong]] https://www.ied.edu.hk/include_n/getrichfile.php?key=95030d9da8144788e3752da05358f071&amp;secid=50424&amp;filename=secstaffcorner/research_doc/Compiled_Publisher_List.pdf This "Hong Kong" ranking quotes rankings by the [[Australian Political Studies Association]]; and another publisher ranking system of the Centre for Resource Studies for Human Development (CERES) of the [[University of Utrecht]] in addition to the SENSE Ranking. The "Hong Kong" ranking emphasizes the high correlation between all these ranking attempts by explicitly stating "There was a high level of consistency in the ranking of Book Publishers among the three systems."&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest SENSE ranking, like its previous rankings, is based on the subjective assessment of a publisher by prominent Dutch and international scientists. An [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] table is available at the school's website.&lt;ref name="SENSEdoc" /&gt;

{{quote|Libcitation counts reflect judgments by librarians on the usefulness of publications for their various audiences of readers. The Libcitation measure thus resembles a citation impact measure in discriminating values of publications on a defined ground. It rewards authors whose books (or other publications) are seen by librarians as having relatively wide appeal. A book's absolute appeal can be determined simply by counting how many libraries hold it, but it can also be gauged in relation to other books in its subject class.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;}}

[[Libcitation]]s, according to the RIMS, reflect what librarians know about the prestige of publishers, the opinions of reviewers, and the reputations of authors.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

'''Repurposing''' is the process by which an object with one [[use value]] is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value.

==Description==
Repurposing is as old as [[human civilization]], with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re-appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/04/medieval-recycling/ | title=Medieval Recycling | publisher=Harvard Gazette | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, repurposing has been celebrated by 21st century hobbyists and arts-and-crafts organizations such as [[Instructables]] and other [[Maker culture]] communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the 21st century.  Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left- and right-[[libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Malewitz, R. (2014) {{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=22814 | title=The Practice of Misuse | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=3195 | title=Throwaways: Work Culture and Consumer Education | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repurposing is the use of a tool being re-channeled into being another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk, garbage, or obsolete. A good example of this would be the [[Earthship]] style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as [[boat fender]]s and [[steel drum]]s or plastic drums as [[feeding trough]]s and/or composting bins. [[Incinerator]] and power plant exhaust stack [[fly-ash]] is used extensively as an [[concrete additive|additive to concrete]], providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes, for example using worn-out clothes as [[Textile|rags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/6081/repurpose/100-ways-repurpose-reuse-broken-household-items | title=100 Ways to Repurpose and Reuse Broken Household Items | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly, take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy, in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel, and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly, in which repurposing vehicles for [[Electric vehicle conversion|electric car conversion]] can be the recommended alternative to that, though its cost can be negligible upfront.

==Examples==

The bell's body is made of aluminum, probably a broken kitchen utensil, while the clapper is a brass cartridge case (SMI 25 NATO, probably 7.62×51mm).]]

===Automobiles===
*[[Full-size van]]s from the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] which have been used for airport shuttle service have been repurposed as church vans mainly because of some [[depreciation]] to facilitate affordable cost for thrifty church groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/200401/200401_54_sb6_vans.cfm | title=What Church Leaders Should Know About Church Vans | publisher=Enrichment Journal | accessdate=3 August 2014 | author=Hammar, Richard R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronics===
*A [[USB dead drop]] can be mounted on a [[brick wall]] since this gives an opportunity to repurpose older USB flash drives with obsolete capacities to continue service for file transfer (especially anonymous ones) that don't demand more than one [[gigabyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/participate/ |title=How to make your own |publisher=Deaddrops.com |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Everdrive]] and other flash video game cartridges have offered opportunities to download [[ROM image]]s of video game cartridges onto [[SD card]]s while offering opportunities to repurpose real vintage video game consoles for retro gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130329014653/http://www.stoneagegamer.com/mega-everdrive-deluxe.html Stoneagegamer's article on the Everdrive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Old Android smartphones, which tend to have little computing resources yet which are unused and probably contain a triaxial [[accelerometer]] of decent specifications, can be used as an amateur seismograph node for a distributed seismography project, e.g., [[Quake-Catcher Network]].
*Discarded or new consumer COTS surplus parabolic reflectors intended for use for C band satellite TV reception can be repurposed for a wide gamut of applications for which a consumer-grade reflector of low gain is adequate, incl. amateur microwave SETI (mainly [[Project Argus]]), Wi-Fi links, and microwave [[amateur radio]] [[radio beacons]].

===As a tactic for manufacturing goods===
* [[Right-hand-drive]] [[Jeep]] brand vehicles, such as the [[Jeep Wrangler]], which are initially slated for import to right-hand-drive countries, have had some specially designed versions repurposed for US and Canada [[postal service]] mail carrying, in which this tactic of repurposing can consolidate the overhead of retooling for specialty manufacturing of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rightdrivejeeps4postal.com/ US Drive Right: The Nation's Largest Seller Of Used Factory

===Manufacturing of recycled goods===
*[[Reusable packaging]] can be reused for a wide variety of other purposes.
* [[Recycling]] can also involve repurposing of materials, such as products using [[recycled paper]].&lt;ref name="debunking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the Myths of Recycled Paper|url=http://recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm|publisher=Recycling Point Dot Com|accessdate=4 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006094659/http://www.recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm |archivedate = 6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Security and strategic studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] centered on the study of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and [[peace]] [[Strategy|strategies]], often devoting special attention to the relationship between [[international politics]], [[geostrategy]], [[international diplomacy]], [[international economics]], and [[armed forces|military power]]. In the scope of the studies are also subjects such as the role of [[intelligence]], [[diplomacy]], and international cooperation for security and defense. The subject is normally taught at the [[post-graduate]] academic or professional, usually strategic-political and strategic-military levels.

The academic foundations of the subject began with classic texts initially from the Orient such as [[Sun Tzu]]’s ''[[Art of War]]'' and went on to gain a European focus with [[Carl von Clausewitz]]’s ''[[On War]]''. Like Clausewitz, many academics in this field reject monocausal theories and hypotheses that reduce the study of conflict to one independent variable and one dependent variable.  Already in the late eighteenth century, a colourful mathematician named [[Dietrich Heinrich von Bülow]] attempted to establish mathematical formulae for the conduct of war.  Carl von Clausewitz rejected Bülow’s approach and his popular claim that warfare could be reduced to positivist, teachable principles of war.  Instead of formulae, we find Clausewitz stressing, time and again, that the whole purpose of educating the military commander is not to give him a series of answers for the task he will face (the complexities of which cannot be foreseen), but to educate him about different aspects of what will face him so as to let him evaluate the situation for himself, and develop his own strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Otte: “Educating Bellona: Carl von Clausewitz and Military Education”, in G.C. Kennedy &amp; K. Neilson (eds): ''Military Education: Past, Present and Future'' (New York: Praeger, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategic thinkers on the whole will search for recurrent patterns, which in themselves cannot predict the characteristics of any individual case even if it doubtless fits a larger category; not all patterns of characteristics will be found in all cases.

In recent times, the major conflicts of the nineteenth century and the two [[World Wars]] have spurred strategic thinkers such as [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]], [[Julian Corbett|Corbett]], [[Giulio Douhet]], [[Liddell Hart]] and, later, [[Andre Beaufre|André Beaufre]]. The Cold War with its danger of degenerating into a nuclear war produced an expansion of the discipline, with authors like [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]], [[Michael Howard (historian)|Michael Howard]], [[Raymond Aron]], [[Lucien Poirier]], [[Lawrence Freedman]], [[Colin S. Gray|Colin Gray]], and many others.

== History of Taiwan Studies ==
As with all area studies, funding and interest in Taiwan studies has largely followed American and other nations' changing political interests. Japanese interest in Taiwan studies preceded significant Western interest in the island and its diverse set of people beginning as a part of maintaining its own [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|colonial interests]] there (Taiwan was a Japanese colony from 1895-1945), and continuing in a post-colonial mode following the handover of Taiwan to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) following its defeat in World War II. An early peak of interest by Western scholars in studying Taiwan occurred following the defeat of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) in the [[Chinese civil war]] and its subsequent retreat to Taiwan beginning in 1947. With [[Communist Party of China|China's Communist Party]] taking power in mainland China, the mainland quickly became off-limits for the vast majority of Western sinologists (exceptions included [[William H. Hinton|William Hinton]], author of Fan Shen). This closing off, in concert with the United States' strong political and military support for Taiwan and British Hong Kong as bulwarks against Communist expansion, ushered in a "golden age" for the study of China beyond China, including increasing studies of "Chinese" in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Following diplomatic shifts of recognition [[Timeline of diplomatic relations of the Republic of China|away from the Taiwan-based ROC]] [[Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China|towards the China-based]] [[PRC]] beginning in the late 1970s and picking up speed with [[Chinese economic reform|China's reform and opening]], academics once again began to shift their focus on China to the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/stevehar/shortCV.html |title=Stevan Harrell |last1=Harrell |first1=Stevan |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Existing reference to Stevan Harrell's CV does not support this claim -- original research?|date=June 2015}} Western academic interest in Taiwan continued at a lower rate with a relatively strong focus on the politics of Taiwan-China-United States relations across the [[Cross-Strait relations|Taiwan Straits]].

Leading up to the [[Martial law in Taiwan|end of martial law]] in Taiwan in 1987, a space began to open up for criticism of KMT authoritarian rule and the beginnings of discussions of a history of the people of the geographic islands of Taiwan. Previous history textbooks that students in martial law Taiwan studied from began history centered on dynastic events in China and only shifted focus to the island the students lived on as the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1947. This [[Taiwanization]] movement suggested instead that it was worthwhile to study the local history of Taiwan itself: a history which included long periods of habitation by [[Taiwanese aborigines|disparate groups of aboriginal peoples]], early colonizations by [[Dutch Formosa|European]] [[Spanish Formosa|powers]], rule by [[Koxinga]] ([[Zheng Chenggong]]), waves of migrations of [[Hoklo people|Hok'lo]] and then [[Hakka]] Chinese people from mainland China, a short period of nominal [[Taiwan under Qing Dynasty rule|Qing "Chinese" Rule]], and a Japanese colonial period all prior to the establishment of Taiwan as the base of power of the ROC in exile. In academia, Taiwanization and [[Taiwan#Democratization|democratization in Taiwan]] brought about a new interest in studying Taiwan and its people without assuming that they are representative of something, or at least of a single something, "Chinese."

Taiwan studies today involves a wide range of disciplines in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] both in Taiwan and beyond it that work to take Taiwan itself as a central subject of analysis. This includes not just work on Taiwanese or Aboriginal groups on Taiwan, but also includes comparative work as well as work that focuses on cross-straits issues and "Chinese" (or Han, Hok'lo, or Hakka) cultures as instantiated on Taiwan. The biggest difference in the latter work is that Taiwan studies scholars who study "Chinese" culture on Taiwan do so with an understanding of the vast range of historical, political, and economic influences on Taiwan's people that have been completely different from those that have influenced "Chinese" heritage peoples in, for example, Hong Kong, Singapore, or the PRC.

'''''The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music''''' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik}}) is an 1872 work of [[dramatic theory]] by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. It was reissued in 1886 as ''The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus}}). The later edition contained a prefatory essay, "[[s:An Attempt at Self-Criticism|An Attempt at Self-Criticism]]", wherein Nietzsche commented on this earliest book.

== The Book ==

Nietzsche found in [[Theater of ancient Greece|classical Athenian]] [[tragedy]] an art form that transcended the [[pessimism]] and [[nihilism]] of a fundamentally meaningless world. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering and affirming it, passionately and joyously affirmed the meaning of their own existence. They knew themselves to be infinitely more than petty individuals, finding self-affirmation not in another life, not in a world to come, but in the terror and ecstasy alike celebrated in the performance of tragedies.

Originally educated as a [[philology|philologist]], Nietzsche discusses the history of the tragic form and introduces an intellectual [[dichotomy]] between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysian and the Apollonian]] (very loosely: reality as disordered and undifferentiated by forms versus reality as ordered and differentiated by forms). Nietzsche claims life always involves a struggle between these two elements, each battling for control over the existence of humanity. In Nietzsche's words, "Wherever the Dionysian prevailed, the Apollonian was checked and destroyed.... wherever the first Dionysian onslaught was successfully withstood, the authority and majesty of the Delphic god [[Apollo]] exhibited itself as more rigid and menacing than ever." Yet neither side ever prevails due to each containing the other in an eternal, natural check or balance.

Nietzsche argues that the tragedy of Ancient Greece was the highest form of art due to its mixture of both Apollonian and Dionysian elements into one seamless whole, allowing the spectator to experience the full spectrum of the [[human condition]]. The Dionysian element was to be found in the music of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]], while the Apollonian element was found in the dialogue which gave a concrete symbolism that balanced the Dionysian revelry. Basically, the Apollonian spirit was able to give form to the abstract Dionysian.

Before the tragedy, there was an era of static, idealized plastic art in the form of sculpture that represented the Apollonian view of the world. The Dionysian element was to be found in the wild revelry of festivals and drunkenness, but, most importantly, in music. The combination of these elements in one art form gave birth to tragedy. He theorizes that the chorus was originally always [[satyr]]s, goat-men. (This is speculative, although the word “tragedy” τραγωδία is contracted from trag(o)-aoidiā = "goat song" from ''tragos'' = "goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing".) Thus, he argues, “the illusion of culture was wiped away by the primordial image of man” for the audience; they participated with and as the chorus empathetically, “so that they imagined themselves as restored natural geniuses, as satyrs.” But in this state, they have an Apollonian dream vision of themselves, of the energy they're embodying. It's a vision of the god, of Dionysus, who appears before the chorus on the stage. And the actors and the plot are the development of that dream vision, the essence of which is the ecstatic dismembering of the god and of the [[Bacchante]]s' rituals, of the inseparable ecstasy and suffering of human existence.

After the time of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]], there was an age where tragedy died.  Nietzsche ties this to the influence of writers like [[Euripides]] and the coming of rationality, represented by [[Socrates]].  Euripides reduced the use of the chorus and was more naturalistic in his representation of human drama, making it more reflective of the realities of daily life. Socrates emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of myth and suffering to human knowledge. For Nietzsche, these two intellectuals helped drain the ability of the individual to participate in forms of art, because they saw things too soberly and rationally. The ''[[participation mystique]]'' aspect of art and myth was lost, and along with it, much of man's ability to live creatively in [[optimistic]] harmony with the sufferings of life. Nietzsche concludes that it may be possible to reattain the balance of Dionysian and Apollonian in modern art through the operas of [[Richard Wagner]], in a ''rebirth'' of tragedy.

In contrast to the typical [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view of ancient Greek culture as noble, simple, elegant and grandiose, Nietzsche believed the Greeks were grappling with pessimism. The universe in which we live is the product of great interacting forces; but we neither observe nor know these as such. What we put together as our conceptions of the world, Nietzsche thought, never actually addresses the underlying realities. It is human destiny to be controlled by the darkest universal realities and, at the same time, to live life in a human-dreamt world of illusions.

The issue, then, or so Nietzsche thought, is how to experience and understand the Dionysian side of life without destroying the obvious values of the Apollonian side. It is not healthy for an individual, or for a whole society, to become entirely absorbed in the rule of one or the other. The soundest (healthiest) foothold is in both. Nietzsche's theory of Athenian tragic drama suggests exactly how, before Euripides and Socrates, the Dionysian and Apollonian elements of life were artistically woven together. The Greek spectator became healthy through direct experience of the Dionysian within the protective spirit-of-tragedy on the Apollonian stage.

==History==
In January and February 1870, Nietzsche delivered two lectures about ancient Greek drama. After receiving copies of the lectures, his friends Richard and [[Cosima Wagner]] suggested that he write a book about the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1871, he submitted a manuscript to publisher [[Wilhelm Engelmann]]. When Englemann was unresponsive, Nietzsche asked for the return of the manuscript in June. He had a portion of the book [[Vanity press|privately printed]] under the title ''Socrates and Greek Tragedy'' ({{lang-de|Sokrates und griechische Tragödie}}) and sent to friends. Richard Wagner received the first copy on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1871, Nietzsche submitted a revised manuscript to E. W. Fritzsch, who had published works by Wagner. Fritzsch accepted the book in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was completed at the end of December, and the book, now titled ''The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik}}), reached bookstores on 2 January 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition was printed by Fritzsch in 1874, but due to the publisher's financial problems, it was not bound until 1875 and had little circulation. In 1878, the remaining copies and publication rights for the first two editions were acquired by Nietzsche's new publisher, Ernst Schmeitzner.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1886, Nietzsche had fallen out with Schmeitzner, and Fritzsch had recovered from his financial difficulties. Fritzsch published a new edition in October 1886, retitled ''The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus}}), with an added prefatory essay by Nietzsche called "An Attempt at Self-Criticism", commenting on the earlier editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
''The Birth of Tragedy'' is a young man's work, and shows the influence of many of the philosophers Nietzsche had been studying. His interest in classical Greece as in some respects a rational society can be attributed in some measure to the influence of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], although Nietzsche departed from Winckelmann in many ways.  In addition, Nietzsche uses the term "naïve" in exactly the sense used by [[Friedrich Schiller]]. Of great importance are the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], especially ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''. The Apollonian experience bears great similarity to the experience of the world as "representation" in Schopenhauer's sense, and the experience of the Dionysian bears similarities to the identification with the world as "will." Nietzsche opposed Schopenhauer's Buddhistic negation of the will. He argued that life is worth living despite the enormous amount of cruelty and suffering that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

One year before the publication of ‘’The Birth of Tragedy’’, Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljp2NPK0qPAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=nietzsche+%2B+%22what+we+here+have+asserted%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vxdZT8bsHc6I0QGJt_DRDw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Music and Words]. In it he asserted the Schopenhauerian judgment that  music is a primary expression of the essence of everything.  Secondarily derivative are lyrical poetry and drama, which represent mere phenomenal appearances of objects. In this way, tragedy is born from music.

== Reception ==
''The Birth of Tragedy'' was angrily criticized by many respected professional scholars of Greek literature. Particularly vehement was philologist [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], who denounced Nietzsche's work as slipshod and misleading. Prompted by Nietzsche, [[Erwin Rohde]]—a friend who had written a favorable review that sparked the first derogatory debate over the book—responded by exposing Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's inaccurate citations of Nietzsche's work. [[Richard Wagner]] also issued a response to Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's critique, but his action only served to characterize Nietzsche as the composer's lackey.

In his denunciation of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Wilamowitz says:

:Herr N. ... is also a professor of classical philology; he treats a series of very important questions of Greek literary history. ... This is what I want to illuminate, and it is easy to prove that here also imaginary genius and impudence in the presentation of his claims stands in direct relation to his ignorance and lack of love of the truth. ... His solution is to belittle the historical-critical method, to scold any aesthetic insight which deviates from his own, and to ascribe a "complete misunderstanding of the study of antiquity" to the age in which philology in Germany, especially through the work of [[Gottfried Hermann]] and [[Karl Lachmann]], was raised to an unprecedented height.

In suggesting the Greeks might have had problems, Nietzsche was departing from the scholarly traditions of his age, which viewed the Greeks as a happy, perhaps even naive, and simple people. The work is a web of professional [[philology]], philosophical insight, and admiration of musical art. As a work in philology, it was almost immediately rejected, virtually destroying Nietzsche's academic aspirations. The music theme was so closely associated with Richard Wagner that it became an embarrassment to Nietzsche once he himself had achieved some distance and independence from Wagner. It stands, then, as Nietzsche's first complete, published philosophical work, one in which a battery of questions are asked, sketchily identified, and questionably answered.

Marianne Cowan, in her introduction to Nietzsche's ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', describes the situation in these words:
:''The Birth of Tragedy'' presented a view of the Greeks so alien to the spirit of the time and to the ideals of its scholarship that it blighted Nietzsche's entire academic career.  It provoked pamphlets and counter-pamphlets attacking him on the grounds of common sense, scholarship and sanity. For a time, Nietzsche, then a professor of classical philology at the [[University of Basel]], had no students in his field.  His lectures were sabotaged by German philosophy professors who advised their students not to show up for Nietzsche's courses.

By 1886, Nietzsche himself had reservations about the work, and he published a preface in the 1886 edition where he re-evaluated some of his main concerns and ideas in the text. In this post-script, Nietzsche referred to ''The Birth of Tragedy'' as "an impossible book... badly written, ponderous, embarrassing, image-mad and image-confused, sentimental, saccharine to the point of effeminacy, uneven in tempo, [and] without the will to logical cleanliness."&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he defended the "arrogant and rhapsodic book" for inspiring "fellow-rhapsodizers" and for luring them on to "new secret paths and dancing places."

In 1888, in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', Nietzsche was back on the attack. He defends ''The Birth of Tragedy'' by stating: "...It is indifferent toward politics,—'un-German,' to use the language of the present time—it smells offensively Hegelian, and the cadaverous perfume of Schopenhauer sticks only to a few formulas. An 'idea'—the antithesis of the Dionysian and the Apollinian—translated into the metaphysical; history itself as the development of this 'idea'; in tragedy this antithesis is sublimated into a unity; under this perspective things that had never before faced each other are suddenly juxtaposed, used to illuminate each other, and comprehended... Opera, for example, and the revolution.— The two decisive innovations of the book are, first, its understanding of the Dionysian phenomenon among the Greeks: for the first time, a psychological analysis of this phenomenon is offered, and it is considered as one root of the whole of Greek art. The other is the understanding of Socratism: Socrates is recognized for the first time as an instrument of Greek disintegration, as a typical décadent. 'Rationality' against instinct. 'Rationality' at any price as a dangerous force that undermines life!— Profound, hostile silence about Christianity throughout the book. That is neither Apollinian nor Dionysian; it negates all aesthetic values—the only values that the 'Birth of Tragedy' recognizes: it is nihilistic in the most profound sense, while in the Dionysian symbol the ultimate limit of affirmation is attained. There is one allusion [The Birth of Tragedy, 24] to Christian priests as a 'vicious kind of dwarfs' who are 'subterranean' ..."

In the title of his novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'', [[Thomas Mann]] alludes to a passage from ''The Birth of Tragedy'', and the influence of Nietzsche's work can be seen in the novel's character Mynheer Peepercorn, who embodies the "Dionysian principle."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''The Birth of Tragedy'' (Trans. Douglas Smith), Oxford University Press, 2008: pp. xxxii, 28, 109, 140. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of a critical study of Nietzsche's "atheist humanism", the influential Catholic theologian [[Henri de Lubac]] considered it "a work of genius", and dedicated several pages of his study to explicate the relationship between Nietzsche's early thought and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;De Lubac, Henri, ''The Drama of Atheist Humanism'', Ignatius Press (San Francisco), 2008: pp. 74, 82. For De Lubac's full discussion of this early work of Nietzsche, see ''id''., pp. 73–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham''''' is a book by biblical scholar [[Thomas L. Thompson]], Professor of Old Testament Studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]].

Together with [[John Van Seters]]'s [[Abraham in History and Tradition (book)|''Abraham in History and Tradition'']] (1975), this book marked the culmination of a growing current of dissatisfaction in scholarly circles with the then-current consensus (or near-consensus) on the Patriarchal narratives. The consensus can be summarized as the proposal that, even if archaeology could not directly confirm the existence of the patriarchs ([[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]), these Patriarchal narratives had originated in a second millennium BC setting because many personal names, place names, and customs referenced in the Genesis narratives were unique to that era. This view was expressed by [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] in his influential ''History of Israel'' (1959, 2nd edition 1960) in these words; "one is forced to the conclusion that the patriarchal narratives authentically reflect social customs at home in the second millennium rather than those of later Israel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/epn_4_selman.html#7 John Bright, "History of Israel", quoted in Martin J. Selman, "Comparative Customs and the Patriarchal Age"]&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson and Van Seters pointed out that, in fact, none of the archaeological evidence cited by the dominant scholars of the time (notably [[William F. Albright]], [[E. A. Speiser]], [[Cyrus Gordon]], and Bright himself) actually provided irrefutable proof for the historicity of the Patriarchal narratives. "Not only has archaeology not proven a single event of the patriarchal traditions to be historical, it has not shown any of the traditions to be likely."&lt;ref&gt;"The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives", p.328, quoted in review by Dennis Pardee in [https://www.jstor.org/stable/545164 ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', Vol. 36, No.3 (July 1977)]&lt;/ref&gt; Albright's reputation never quite recovered from the publication of Thompson's book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e1x9Rs_zdG8C&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=3o0u6HYPvz&amp;sig=elF1DM6SQWF_b3XmQ27aocIZXq0&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3DA%2BCentury%2Bof%2BBiblical%2BArchaeology%2Bby%2BRoger%2BMoorey%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title#PPA114,M1 P.R.F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16773">Religious economy refers to religious persons and organizations interacting within a market framework of competing groups and ideologies.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; An economy makes it possible for religious suppliers to meet the demands of different religious [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref name="ncsociology.org"&gt;Wortham, Robert A. Religious Choices and Preferences: North Carolina's Baskin Robbins Effect? 2004. 27 Sep. 2007. [http://www.ncsociology.org/sociationtoday/v21/religion.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; By offering an array of religions and religious products, a competitive religious economy stimulates such activity in  a [[marketplace|market]]-type setting.&lt;ref name="ncsociology.org"/&gt;

The field applies [[rational choice theory]] to the [[theory of religion]] such that [[supply and demand]] are used to model the development and success of [[organized religion]]s.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stark |first= Rodney |authorlink= Rodney Stark |title= Sociology |edition= 10th |year= 2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth |isbn= 0-495-09344-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major proponents of the theory include [[William Sims Bainbridge]],  [[Roger Finke]], [[Laurence Iannaccone]], and [[Rodney Stark]].

==Major debates==
The idea of religious economy frames religion as a product and as those who practice or identify with any particular religion as a consumer. But when the idea of belief is brought into the equation, this definition expands, and [[ideology]] affects the "product" and who "consumes" it. When examining depictions of religious identity in a global world, it is easy to see how ideology affects religious economy.

[[Carl L. Bankston]] III refers to religions and religious groups as "…competing firms [that vie for] customers who make rational choices among available products…" (311). Using a liberal economic (see [[Economic liberalism]]) framework for analysis, Bankston is claiming that religions and religious groups’ popularity is dependent on the laws of supply and demand. As a marketplace, religious consumers are subject to things such as marketing, availability of product, resources, brand recognition, etc. But unlike some actual commodity such as a computer, these commodities speak to an individual’s beliefs. Bankston poses the idea that belief deals with ideology and extends beyond what one would typically define as a market good by stating "…belief is produced and resides in communicated thoughts, (and) the consumers of goods of faith can only become consumers by becoming producers, by participating in interactions of belief…" (322).

===Secularization and religious economy===
{{Main|Secularization}}
Prior to the emergence of the theory of religious economy some scholars of religion, such as Steve Bruce,&lt;ref name="Bruce 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Steve|title=Choice and Religion: A Critique of Rational Choice|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-829584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed that [[modernization]] would lead inevitably to the erosion of religiosity. These sociologists have predicted the disappearance of religion from [[Earth]], based on the decline in religious belief and observance in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="Young 1997"/&gt; According to the theory of religious economy, societies that restrict supply of religion, either through an imposed state religious monopoly or through state-sponsored secularization, are the main causes of drops in religiosity. Correspondingly, the more [[religion]]s a society has, the more likely the population is to be religious.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; This is refuted in the orthodox view by stating that if a liberal religious community is tolerant of a wide array of belief, then they are less likely to hold certain beliefs in common, so nothing can be shared and reified in a community context. If nothing is shared, then nothing is shunned, and there is thus a loss in observance of modern liberal traditions.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1999"/&gt;

====Revival====
According to [[Rodney Stark]], revival is another aspect of religious change which coincides with [[secularization]].  Over time established religious groups will spawn smaller and less worldly subgroups of the faith.  This trend of revival provides a plausible explanation why religion never seems to fade away and to why previously prominent religious organizations have dissipated.  Revival produces a shift in which religious groups a population will follow and proves effective against the demise of religion.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

====Cults====
Unlike a sect which follows traditions from its parent religion, a cult presents completely new religious traditions.  Cult is simply another word for a new religion and all current religions at one point could have been considered cult movements.  The negative connotations on the word cult have led to hostility between these movements and their social environments. [[Rodney Stark]] defines the two reactions from [[secularization]] being revival and cult formation. As old faiths eventually weaken the rise of different religious sects and cults will prevail.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

====Strict regulations to enforce strong ties====
Strict Churches are prevalent in the US and around the world and while people still question and debate their ascent, their ties are characteristically defined as being strong within the group with few weak ties branching outside to other groups. Strict churches arise from strict doctrines and can be in many forms such as large churches, sects, or cults but are not limited to these. Churches are most often known for their “cosmopolitan networks, while sects tend to consist of intense local networks,”&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark, 2007. ''Sociology''. Tenth Edition. Thomas Wadsworth. {{ISBN|0-495-09344-0}}./&lt;/ref&gt; while this may be true for “unstrict” doctrines this is not always the case for strict doctrines. Strong doctrines can arise from certain sects as various religions have done such as [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Islam]], certain denominations of [[Christianity]], or can include rather smaller cults or small sects. What all strong doctrines employ though, are formal controls to discourage [[Free rider problem|free riding]] within the group and to keep the church strong and together.&lt;ref&gt;Hechter, Michael. Principles of Group Solidarity. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-06462-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These controls can vary from church to church but all serve the same purpose of keeping group solidarity.

As commonly seen strict churches employ various means of keeping their ties in their church strong while limiting excessive access to other groups such as dress code, eating habits, and rituals that prevent mixing with other groups. The implication of these, “strict demands ‘strengthen’ a church in three ways; they raise overall levels of commitment, they increase average rates of participation, and they enhance the net benefits of membership.”&lt;ref name="Iannaccone, Laurence R. 1211"&gt;Laurence R. Iannaccone, 1994. "Why Strict Churches Are Strong,"  ''American Journal of Sociology'', 99(5), pp. [http://religionomics.com/iannaccone/papers/Iannaccone%20-%20Strict%20Churches.pdf 1180-1211.]&lt;/ref&gt; Complying with these demands prevent the members of a church from free loading within the group and promote group solidarity. The strict rules that govern and regulate a church actually help and promote the strength of the ties within the group. Those who don’t comply with these strictures are screened out leaving only those who do comply and comply earnestly.”&lt;ref name="Iannaccone, Laurence R. 1211"/&gt; These strict doctrines and regulations serve to keep the church strong and together while screening out members that may actually harm the church unintentionally by being free loaders within the group.

===Church-sect theory===
&lt;!-- Not sure this section belongs in this article, as it seems off-topic. --&gt;
Originally proposed by [[H. Richard Niebuhr]] in his book ''The Social Sources of Denominationalism'', the theory discusses the difference between churches and [[sects]]. Niebuhr proposed that there is a cycle which [[sects]] and churches follow. Religions originate as [[sects]] designed to serve the needs of the deprived. If they flourish, they increasingly serve the interests of the middle and upper classes and are transformed into churches. Once the sects have become churches they become less effective in satisfying the needs of the lower class and the formation of a sect is re-created.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

In 1963 Benton Johnson revised the church-sect theory into its current state.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; Church and sect form opposite poles on an  axis representing the amount of "tension" between religious organizations and their social environments.  Tension, as defined by Benton Johnson, is "a manifestation of deviance." &lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; The tension is described to be between the groups members and the outside world.  Churches are described as religious bodies having low tension, whereas, [[sects]] have high tension.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

====Ideology====

Some social scientists have become increasingly uncomfortable with what they see as the intermingling of social scientific analysis and free-market ideology in rational choice theory.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Michael. Rationality and the Ideology of Disconnection. Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have likewise raised critical questions about the ideological use of neo-classical economic metaphors in rational choice theorizing about religion &lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2013). 'Ideology and the Market Metaphor in Rational Choice Theory of Religion: A Rhetorical Critique of “Religious Economies”'. Critical Sociology, vol 39, no. 4 [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3714/1/rational_choice_critique_author_final_version.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The ''theory of religious economy'' arises from the application of fundamental principles of economics to the analysis of religious organizations. Just as commercial economies consist of a market in which different firms compete, religious economies consist of a market (the aggregate demand for religion) and firms (different religious organizations) seeking to attract and hold clients.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt; The theory of religious economy was developed to explain why and how religions change.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"/&gt;

==Market situation==
According to the theory, [[religious pluralism]] gives the population a wide variety of choices in religion and leads to a religious economy in which different [[religious organizations]] compete for followers, much the way businesses compete for consumers in a commercial [[economy]]. The Theory of Religious Economy takes into account a wide spectrum of issues (e.g., the differences between competitive religious markets and religious [[monopoly|monopolies]]), making this theory one of the most significant developments in the social scientific study of religion during the past thirty years.&lt;ref name="Young 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Lawrence A.|title=Rational Choice Theory and Religion |year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-91192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory  focuses attention on religious suppliers and whether religious firms have the ability to increase the demand for religion.&lt;ref name="Young 1997"/&gt;

In a free market, or [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]] religious market, many religious organizations exist and seek to appeal to certain segments of the market. Organizations in a free market cannot rely on the state for resources so they must compete for participation of the religious consumer. Contest among religious firms results in the specialization of products so that consumers are able to distinguish different organization from others(Chesnut). Pluralistic religions operate on a personal scale, marketing more to individual demands as opposed to public. As the majority of the consumer market, organizations market more to women than men. Pluralism is only possible through lack of favoritism by the state.(Chesnut) A competitive and pluralistic religious economy has a positive effect on levels of participation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A [[microeconomic]] theory of the [[household production function]] and time allocation is associated with the work of [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago]] economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;• Gary S. Becker, 1965. “A Theory of the Allocation of Time,” ''Economic Journal'' 75 (299), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2228949 p. 493]-517.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • _____, 1973. "A Theory of Marriage: Part I." ''Journal of Political Economy'', 81(4), pp. [http://www.fep.up.pt/docentes/pcosme/micro-g102/beckerJPE1973.pdf 813-846.]&lt;/ref&gt; An influential approach dating from the 1970s adapts that theory to explain religious participation and a resulting formation of norms. It postulates stable preferences and [[rational choice]] constrained by limited [[human capital|human]] and [[social capital]] to explain behavior.&lt;ref&gt;• Corry Azzi and [[Ronald Ehrenberg]],  1975. "Household Allocation of Time and Church Attendance," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 83(1), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1833272 27]-56.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Ronald G. Ehrenberg]], 1977. "Household Allocation of Time and Religiosity: Replication and Extension,"
''Journal of Political Economy'', 85(2), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1830802 415]-423.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Gary S. Becker, 1996. ''Accounting for Tastes'', Harvard. ch. 11. sect. 3, "'Churches' and the Formation of Norms," pp. 227-30.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Lawrence A. Young, ed., 1997.

"Economics of Religion," in ''The Blackwell Companion to the Study of Religion'', Ch. 3, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IjUHk_NCP0AC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;dq=f=false 47-67.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As in economics, the market situation can be described with concepts about monopoly, prohibition, and pluralism. Monopolies in religion are only made possible through state enforcement and often function on a public scale. When the government establishes a set religion and all other competition is drowned out then "believers are culturally connected but not necessarily spiritually"(Andrew Chesnut) to the religion enforced by the state. Since participation in a religious monopoly is not as important because the church does not have to rely on members for resources they are not forced to provide adequate or marketable "religious products"(Chesnut), due to lack of competition. The ability of a religious organization to monopolize a religious economy is entirely dependent on the extent to which the state governs the religious economy. A monopolized religious economy tends to have lower levels of participation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Lawrence A.|title=Rational Choice Theory and Religion|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-91192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states may categorically ban religious observances, and attempt to sanction those who persist in displaying religious conviction. [[Disestablishmentarianism]] results from state withdrawal from an organization that was originally established under the state.

Religious markets are similar to other markets in that they are social creations. The exchanges that take place in a religious market are regulated by social factors. Elements of social interactions such as norms and morals influence the individual choices and preferences of the religious consumer. Therefore, elements of social interactions influence the types of religious goods offered to consumers in the marketplace and the changes in consumer demands over a span of time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

According to [[W. Robertson Smith]], "The fear of the gods was a motive to enforce the laws of society which were also the laws of morality".&lt;ref&gt;Robertson Smith, W.: Religion of the Semites; with a new introduction by Robert A. Segal., New Brunswick, N.J. : Transaction Publishers, c2002.&lt;/ref&gt; People are taught that those who believe will gain rewards or avoid punishment in the afterlife, and non-believers will miss out on the rewards or receive punishment.

'''Zoophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] involving a sexual fixation on non-human animals. '''Bestiality''' is [[Cross-species sex|cross-species sexual activity]] between [[human]] and non-human [[animals]]. The terms are often used interchangeably, but some researchers make a distinction between the attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality).&lt;ref name="ranger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ranger |first1=R. |last2=Fedoroff |first2=P. | year = 2014 | title = Commentary: Zoophilia and the Law | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 421–426 | url = http://www.jaapl.org/content/42/4/421.full | pmid = 25492067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sex with animals [[Zoophilia and the law|is not outlawed in some countries]], in most countries, bestiality is illegal under [[cruelty to animals|animal abuse]] laws or laws dealing with [[buggery]] or [[crime against nature|crimes against nature]].

== Terminology ==
===General===
Three key terms commonly used in regards to the subject — ''zoophilia'', ''bestiality'', and ''zoosexuality'' — are often used somewhat interchangeably. Some researchers distinguish between zoophilia (as a persistent sexual interest in animals) and bestiality (as sexual acts with animals), because bestiality is often not driven by a sexual preference for animals.&lt;ref name="ranger" /&gt; Some studies have found that a preference for animals is rare among people who engage in sexual contact with animals.&lt;ref name="earls"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107906320201400106 |pmid=11803597 |title=A Case Study of Preferential Bestiality (Zoophilia) |year=2002 |last1=Earls |first1=C. M. |last2=Lalumiere |first2=M. L. |journal=Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some zoophiles report that they have never had sexual contact with an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maratea, R. J. | year = 2011 | title = Screwing the pooch: Legitimizing accounts in a zoophilia on-line community | journal = Deviant Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 10 | page = 938 | doi=10.1080/01639625.2010.538356}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with zoophilia are known as "zoophiles", though also sometimes as "zoosexuals", or even very simply "zoos".&lt;ref name="ranger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Handbookth"&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=G_MwT9OHj4AC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=zoophilia#v=onepage&amp;q=zoophilia&amp;f=false | title = The International Handbook of Animal Abuse and Cruelty: Theory, Research, and Application | chapter = Bestiality and Zoophilia: A Discussion of Sexual Contact With Animals | isbn = 978-1-55753-565-8 | editor = Ascione, Frank | author = Beetz, Andrea M. | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zooerasty, [[sodomy]], and zooerastia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=zooerastia definition|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zooerastia|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are other terms closely related to the subject but are less synonymous with the former terms, and are seldom used. "Bestiosexuality" was discussed briefly by Allen (1979), but never became widely established.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Ernest Bornemann]] (1990, cited by Rosenbauer, 1997) coined the separate term ''[[zoosadism]]'' for those who derive pleasure – sexual or otherwise – from inflicting pain on animals. Zoosadism specifically is one member of the [[Macdonald triad]] of precursors to [[Psychopathy|sociopathic behavior]].&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=J.

===Zoophilia===
The term ''zoophilia'' was introduced into the field of research on sexuality in ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' (1886) by [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]], who described a number of cases of "violation of animals (bestiality)",&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing: [[Psychopathia Sexualis]], p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "zoophilia erotica",&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing: [[Psychopathia Sexualis]], p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; which he defined as a sexual attraction to animal skin or fur. The term ''zoophilia'' derives from the combination of two nouns in [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''''ζῷον''''' (''zṓion'', meaning "animal") and '''''φιλία''''' (''[[wiktionary:-philia|philia]]'', meaning "(fraternal) love"). In general contemporary usage, the term ''zoophilia'' may refer to sexual activity between human and non-human animals, the desire to engage in such, or to the specific [[paraphilia]] (''i.e.,'' the atypical arousal) which indicates a definite preference for non-human animals over humans as sexual partners. Although Krafft-Ebing also coined the term ''zooerasty'' for the paraphilia of exclusive sexual attraction to animals,&lt;ref name="deviance 391"&gt;D. Richard Laws and William T. O'Donohue: [https://books.google.com/books?id=yIXG9FuqbaIC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;dq=zoophilia+paraphilia Books.Google.co.uk], Sexual Deviance, page 391. [[Guilford Press]], 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-59385-605-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that term has fallen out of general use.

===Zoosexuality===
[[File:Tako to ama retouched.jpg|thumb|right|[[Katsushika Hokusai|Hokusai]]&lt;!--Katsushika is the family name so it is put first, BUT he is called by his given name--&gt;'s (1760–1849) ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]''.]]

The term ''zoosexual'' was proposed by [[Hani Miletski]] in 2002&lt;ref name="Handbookth"/&gt; as a value-neutral term. Usage of ''zoosexual'' as a noun (in reference to a person) is synonymous with zoophile, while the adjectival form of the word – as, for instance, in the phrase "zoosexual act" – may indicate sexual activity between a human and a non-human animal. The derivative noun "zoosexuality" is sometimes used by self-identified zoophiles in both support groups and on internet-based discussion forums to designate [[sexual orientation]] manifesting as romantic or emotional involvement with, or sexual attraction to, non-human animals.&lt;ref name="Handbookth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is zoosexuality|url=http://zoosexuality.org/?id=1|website=Zoosexuality.org|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bestiality===

The legal term ''bestiality'' has three common pronunciations: {{IPA|[ˌbestʃiˈæləti]}} or {{IPA|[ˌbistʃiˈæləti]}} in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pronunciation of bestiality|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/american/bestiality|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPA|[ˌbestiˈæləti]}} in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pronunciation of bestiality|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/british/bestiality|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some zoophiles and researchers draw a distinction between ''zoophilia'' and ''bestiality'', using the former to describe the desire to form sexual relationships with animals, and the latter to describe the sex acts alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/glossary/g/zoophilia.htm |title=Sexuality.about.com |website=Sexuality.about.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusing the matter yet further, writing in 1962, Masters used the term ''bestialist'' specifically in his discussion of zoosadism.

Stephanie LaFarge, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New Jersey Medical School, and Director of Counseling at the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|ASPCA]], writes that two groups can be distinguished: bestialists, who rape or abuse animals, and zoophiles, who form an emotional and sexual attachment to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All Opposed, Say Neigh |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/1999-12-15/news/all-opposed-say-neigh/ |author=Melinda Roth |work=Riverfront Times |date=15 December 1991 |accessdate=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin J. Williams]] and [[Martin Weinberg]] studied self-defined zoophiles via the internet and reported them as understanding the term ''zoophilia'' to involve concern for the animal's welfare, pleasure, and consent, as distinct from the self-labelled zoophiles' concept of "bestialists", whom the zoophiles in their study defined as focused on their own gratification. Williams and Weinberg also quoted a British newspaper saying that ''zoophilia'' is a term used by "apologists" for ''bestiality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams CJ, Weinberg MS |title=Zoophilia in men: a study of sexual interest in animals |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=523–35 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14574096 |doi=10.1023/A:1026085410617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent of occurrence==
The [[Kinsey report]]s rated the percentage of people who had sexual interaction with animals at some point in their lives as 8% for men and 3.6% for women, and claimed it was 40–50% in people living near farms,&lt;ref name="deviance 391" /&gt; but some later writers dispute the figures, because the study lacked a random sample in that it included a disproportionate number of prisoners, causing [[sampling bias]]. [[Martin Duberman]] has written that it is difficult to get a random sample in sexual research, and that even when [[Paul Gebhard]], Kinsey's research successor, removed prison samples from the figures, he found the figures were not significantly changed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Duberman: [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/publications/duberman.html KinseyInstitute.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111215816/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/publications/duberman.html |date=11 January 2009 }}, Kinsey's Urethra ''The Nation,'' 3 November 1997, pp. 40–43. Review of ''Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life.'' By James H. Jones.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, the farm population in the USA had declined by 80 percent compared with 1940, reducing the opportunity to live with animals; Hunt's 1974 study suggests that these demographic changes led to a significant change in reported occurrences of bestiality. The percentage of males who reported sexual interactions with animals in 1974 was 4.9% (1948: 8.3%), and in females in 1974 was 1.9% (1953: 3.6%). Miletski believes this is not due to a reduction in interest but merely a reduction in opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1974, cited and re-examined by Miletski (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Friday]]'s 1973 book on [[female sexuality]], ''[[My Secret Garden]]'', comprised around 190 fantasies from different women; of these, 23 involve zoophilic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Friday|title=My Secret Garden|publisher=Simon and Schuster|edition=Revised|year=1998|isbn=978-0-671-01987-7|pages=180–185|chapter=What do women fantasize about?

In one study, psychiatric patients were found to have a statistically significant higher prevalence rate (55 percent) of reported bestiality, both actual sexual contacts (45 percent) and sexual fantasy (30 percent) than the control groups of medical in-patients (10 percent) and psychiatric staff (15 percent).&lt;ref name="psych"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1778686 |year=1991 |last1=Alvarez |first1=WA |last2=Freinhar |first2=JP |title=A prevalence study of bestiality (zoophilia) in psychiatric in-patients, medical in-patients, and psychiatric staff |volume=38 |issue=1–4 |pages=45–7 |journal=International Journal of Psychosomatics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crépault and Couture (1980) reported that 5.3 percent of the men they surveyed had fantasized about sexual activity with an animal during heterosexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01542159 |title=Men's erotic fantasies |year=1980 |last1=Crépault |first1=Claude |last2=Couture |first2=Marcel |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=565–81 |pmid=7458662}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 study, 3% of women and 2.2% of men reported fantasies about having sex with an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Joyal |first1=C.

Sexual arousal from watching animals mate is known as ''faunoiphilia''.&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal, Anil.

CRC Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A frequent interest in and sexual excitement at watching animals [[mating|mate]] is cited as an indicator of latent zoophilia by Massen (1994). [[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] about zoophilic acts can occur in people who do not have any wish to experience them in real life. Nancy Friday notes that zoophilia as a fantasy may provide an escape from cultural expectations, restrictions, and judgements in regard to sex. Masters (1962) says that some brothel madams used to stage exhibitions of animals mating, as they found it aroused potential clientele, and that this may have encouraged the clients to engage in bestiality.&lt;ref name="watching"&gt;R.E.L.

==Perspectives on zoophilia==
[[File:Franz von Bayros 020.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Art by [[Franz von Bayros]] depicting [[oral sex]] between an adolescent and a [[deer]]]]

=== Research perspectives ===
Zoophilia has been partly discussed by several sciences: [[Psychology]] (the study of the human [[mind]]), [[sexology]] (a relatively new discipline primarily studying [[human sexuality]]), [[ethology]] (the study of [[ethology|animal behavior]]), and [[anthrozoology]] (the study of human-animal interactions and bonds).

The nature of animal minds, animal [[mental process]]es and structures, and animal [[self-awareness]], [[perception]], [[emotion in animals]], and "map of the world", are studied within [[animal cognition]] and also explored within various specialized branches of [[neuroscience]] such as [[neuroethology]].

In the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-5), zoophilia is placed in the classification "other specified paraphilic disorder"&lt;ref name="DSM 5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder, 302.89 (F65.89) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | page = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[paraphilia]]s not otherwise specified" in the DSM-III and IV&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[World Health Organization]] takes the same position, listing a sexual preference for animals in its [[ICD]][[ICD-10|-10]] as "other disorder of sexual preference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10, F65.8 Other disorders of sexual preference |website=Who.int |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the DSM-5, it rises to the level of a diagnosable disorder only when accompanied by distress or interference with normal functioning.&lt;ref name="DSM 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miletski | first1 = H | year = 2015| title = Zoophilia – Implications for Therapy | url = | journal = JSET | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 85–86 | doi=10.1080/01614576.2001.11074387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophilia may also be covered to some degree by other fields such as ethics, philosophy, law, [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]]. It may also be touched upon by [[sociology]] which looks both at zoosadism in examining patterns and issues related to [[sexual abuse]] and at non-sexual zoophilia in examining the role of animals as emotional support and companionship in human lives, and may fall within the scope of [[psychiatry]] if it becomes necessary to consider its significance in a clinical context.
The Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine (Vol. 18, February 2011) states that sexual contact with animals is almost never a clinically significant problem by itself;&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2011.01.004 |title=A new classification of zoophilia |year=2011 |last1=Aggrawal |first1=Anil |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=73–8 |pmid=21315301}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also states that there are several kinds of zoophiles:&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"/&gt;

{| valign="top"
|-
|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human-animal role-players&lt;li&gt;Romantic zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Zoophilic fantasizers&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol start="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tactile zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Fetishistic zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Sadistic bestials&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol start="7"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opportunistic zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Regular zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Exclusive zoophiles&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|}

Additionally, zoophiles in categories 2, 3, and 8 (romantic zoophiles, zoophilic fantasizers, and regular zoophiles) are the most common, while zoophiles found in categories 6 and 7 (sadistic bestials and opportunistic zoophiles) are the least common.&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"/&gt;

Zoophilia may reflect childhood experimentation, sexual abuse or lack of other avenues of sexual expression. Exclusive desire for animals rather than humans is considered a rare paraphilia, and sufferers often have other paraphilias&lt;ref name="LawsO'Donohue2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

Zoophiles will not usually seek help for their condition, and so do not come to the attention of psychiatrists for zoophilia itself.&lt;ref name="Roukema2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard W.

The first detailed studies of zoophilia date from prior to 1910. Peer reviewed research into zoophilia in its own right started around 1960. However, a number of the most oft-quoted studies, such as Miletski, were not published in [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journals. There have been several significant modern books, from Masters (1962) to Beetz (2002);&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.4 – 5.2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; their research arrived at the following conclusions:

:*Most zoophiles have (or have also had) long term human relationships as well or at the same time as zoosexual ones, and that zoosexual partners are usually dogs and/or horses (Masters, Miletski, Beetz)&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggrawal2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anil Aggrawal|title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=zoophilia+most+common+animal#PPA258|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=December 22, 2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4309-9|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Zoophiles' emotions and care for animals can be real, relational, authentic and (within animals' abilities) reciprocal, and not just a substitute or means of expression.&lt;ref&gt;(Masters, Miletski, Weinberg, Beetz)&lt;/ref&gt; Beetz believes zoophilia is not an inclination which is chosen.&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;
:* Society in general at present is considerably misinformed about zoophilia, its stereotypes, and its meaning.&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt; The distinction between zoophilia and zoosadism is a critical one to these researchers, and is highlighted by each of these studies. Masters (1962), Miletski (1999) and Weinberg (2003) each comment significantly on the social harm caused by misunderstandings regarding zoophilia: "This destroy[s] the lives of many citizens".&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;

Beetz also states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The phenomenon of sexual contact with animals is starting to lose its taboo: it is appearing more often in scholarly publications, and the public are being confronted with it, too.[...] Sexual contact with animals – in the form of bestiality or zoophilia – needs to be discussed more openly and investigated in more detail by scholars working in disciplines such as animal ethics, animal behavior, anthrozoology, psychology, mental health, sociology, and the law."&lt;ref name="BeetzPodberseck"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony L. Podberscek|author2=Andrea M. Beetz|title=Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z-GbOvrbniQC&amp;lpg=PT91&amp;dq=beetz%202002%20zoophilia&amp;pg=PT94#v=onepage&amp;q=beetz%202002%20zoophilia&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=September 1, 2005|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-0-85785-222-9|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, research has engaged three further directions – the speculation that at least some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] is not present, and can form an affectionate bond.&lt;ref&gt;Masters, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as [[consent]] beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Balcombe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/29/animalbehaviour.evolution |title=Animals can be happy too |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 May 2012 |location=London |date=29 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beetz described the phenomenon of zoophilia/bestiality as being somewhere between crime, paraphilia and love, although she says that most research has been based on [[criminology|criminological]] reports, so the cases have frequently involved violence and psychiatric illness. She says only a few recent studies have taken data from volunteers in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scie-socialcareonline.org.uk/profile.asp?guid=fac3acab-5377-4f9a-a9f0-007248ee2e43 Scie-SocialCareOnline.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115133416/http://www.scie-socialcareonline.org.uk/profile.asp?guid=fac3acab-5377-4f9a-a9f0-007248ee2e43 |date=15 November 2010 }} Bestiality/Zoophilia: A Scarcely-Investigated Phenomenon Between Crime, Paraphilia, and Love&lt;/ref&gt; As with all volunteer surveys and sexual ones in particular, these studies have a potential for [[self-selection]] bias.&lt;ref name="Slade2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph W.

Several cultures built temples ([[Khajuraho]], India) or other structures ([[Sagaholm]], [[tumulus|barrow]], Sweden) with zoophilic carvings on the exterior, however at [[Khajuraho]] these depictions are not on the interior, perhaps depicting that these are things that belong to the profane world rather than the spiritual world, and thus are to be left outside.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In the Church-oriented culture of the [[Middle Ages]] zoophilic activity was met with execution, typically burning, and death to the animals involved either the same way or by hanging, as "both a violation of [[Religion and sexuality|Biblical edicts]] and a degradation of man as a spiritual being rather than one that is purely animal and carnal."&lt;ref&gt;Masters (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Some witches were accused of having congress with the devil in the form of an animal. As with all accusations and confessions extracted under torture in the [[witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], their validity cannot be ascertained.&lt;ref name="BulloughBullough1994"/&gt;

===Religious perspectives===
Passages in [[Leviticus 18]] (Lev 18:23: "And you shall not lie with any beast and defile yourself with it, neither shall any woman give herself to a beast to lie with it: it is a perversion." RSV) and 20:15–16 ("If a man lies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast. If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them." RSV) are cited by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologians as categorical denunciation of bestiality. However, the teachings of the [[New Testament]] have been interpreted by some as not expressly forbidding bestiality.&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Plummer |first=Keith |title=To beast or not to beast: does the law of Christ forbid zoophilia? |year=2001 |url=http://place.asburyseminary.edu/trenpapers/892 |conference=53rd National Conference of the Evangelical Theological Society |location=Colorado Springs, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part II of his [[Summa Theologica]], medieval philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] ranked various "unnatural vices" (sex acts resulting in "venereal pleasure" rather than procreation) by degrees of sinfulness, concluding that "the most grievous is the sin of bestiality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aquinas-homo.html Fordham.edu] Aquinas on Unnatural Sex&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christian theologians extend [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]'s view that [[Antithesis of the Law#Adultery|even having thoughts of adultery is sinful]] to imply that thoughts of committing bestial acts are likewise sinful.

There are a few references in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scriptures to religious figures engaging in symbolic sexual activity with animals such as explicit depictions of people having sex with animals included amongst the thousands of sculptures of "Life events" on the exterior of the [[Hindu temple|temple complex]] at [[Khajuraho]]. The depictions are largely symbolic depictions of the sexualization of some animals and are not meant to be taken literally.&lt;ref&gt;The Critical and Cultural Study of the Shatapatha Brahmana by Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Hindu tradition of erotic painting and sculpture, having sex with an animal is believed to be actually a human having sex with a God incarnated in the form of an animal.&lt;ref name="PodberscekBeetz2005"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Anthony L. |last1=Podberscek |first2=Andrea M. |last2=Beetz |title=Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-GbOvrbniQC&amp;pg=PT12 |accessdate=4 January 2013 |date=1 September 2005 |publisher=Berg |isbn=978-0-85785-222-9 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some Hindu scriptures, such as the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and the ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'', having sex with animals, especially the cow, leads one to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Hell]], where one is tormented by having one's body rubbed on trees with razor-sharp thorns.&lt;ref name = "mani"&gt;{{cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 978-0-8426-0822-0|oclc=2198347|pages = 368–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, all forms of zoophilic acts are prohibited; others outlaw only the mistreatment of animals, without specific mention of sexual activity. In the United Kingdom, [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] (also known as the Extreme Pornography Act) outlaws images of a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive).&lt;ref name=opsisect63&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/63|work=Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|title=Section 63 – Possession of extreme pornographic images|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[United Kingdom Ministry of Justice|UK Ministry of Justice]]'s explanatory note on extreme images saying "It is not a question of the intentions of those who produced the image.

Laws on zoophilia are sometimes triggered by specific incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Fischer: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080515222156/http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/122006 Lawmakers hope to outlaw bestiality], 
''Arizona Daily Star,'' 28 March 2006. In Arizona, the motive for legislation was a "spate of recent cases."&lt;/ref&gt; While some laws are very specific, others employ vague terms such as "[[sodomy]]" or "bestiality", which lack legal precision and leave it unclear exactly which acts are covered. In the past, some bestiality laws may have been made in the belief that sex with an animal could result in monstrous offspring, as well as offending the community. Current anti-cruelty laws focus more specifically on animal welfare while anti-bestiality laws are aimed only at offenses to community "standards".&lt;ref name="posner"&gt;Posner, Richard, A Guide to America's Sex Laws, The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-226-67564-0}}. Page 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
Notable legal views include Sweden, where a 2005 report by the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency for the government expressed concern over the increase in reports of [[horse-ripping]] incidents. The agency believed current animal cruelty legislation was not sufficient in protecting animals from abuse and needed updating, but concluded that on balance it was not appropriate to call for a ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=1357 |title=TheLocal.se |publisher=TheLocal.se |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515124451/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=1357 |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], the 1989 Crimes Bill considered abolishing bestiality as a criminal offense, and instead viewing it as a mental health issue, but they did not, and people can still be prosecuted for it.

Pornography involving sex with animals is widely illegal, even in most countries where bestiality itself is not explicitly outlawed.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In the [[United States]], zoophilic pornography would be considered [[obscene]] if it did not meet the standards of the [[Miller Test]] and therefore is not openly sold, mailed, distributed or imported across state boundaries or within states which prohibit it. Under U.S. law, 'distribution' includes transmission across the Internet. Production and mere possession appears to be legal, however. U.S. prohibitions on distribution of sexual or obscene materials are {{As of|2005|lc=on}} in some doubt, having been ruled [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] in ''[[United States v. Extreme Associates]]'' (a judgement which was overturned on appeal, December 2005).

Similar restrictions apply in Germany (see [[Zoophilia#Legal status|above]]). In [[New Zealand]] the possession, making or distribution of material promoting bestiality is illegal.

The potential use of media for [[pornographic movie]]s was seen from the start of the era of [[silent film]]. ''Polissons and Galipettes'' (re-released 2002 as "[[The Good Old Naughty Days]]") is a collection of early French silent films for brothel use, including some animal pornography, dating from around 1905 – 1930.

Material featuring sex with animals is widely available on the Internet, due to its ease of production.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Prior to the advent of mass-market magazines such as [[Playboy]], so-called [[Tijuana Bible]]s were a form of pornographic tract popular in America, sold as anonymous underground publications typically comprising a small number of stapled comic-strips representing characters and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;An example digitized Tijuana Bible entitled ''The Pet'' from the 1960s is linked at [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=detail&amp;item=TB073&amp;fullsize=0 tijuanabibles.org page link] (also see [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi/hzpi/u/HzSt031FT7pj.ctu7.2/hazel.cgi?action=detail&amp;item=TB073&amp;fullsize=1 full size] and [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=SEARCH&amp;SEARCH_SPEC=bestiality&amp;SUBMIT_ACTION_SEARCH=Search search]).&lt;/ref&gt;
The promotion of "stars" began with the Danish [[Bodil Joensen]], in the period of 1969–72, along with other porn actors such as the Americans [[Linda Lovelace]] (''Dogarama'', 1969), Chessie Moore (multiple films, c. 1994), Kerri Downs (three films, 1998) and Calina Lynx (aka Kelly G'raffe) (two films, 1998). Another early film to attain great infamy was "[[Animal Farm (video)|Animal Farm]]", smuggled into Great Britain around 1980 without details as to makers or provenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dark Side of Porn Season 2 (2006) - Documentary / TV-Show|url=http://crimedocumentary.com/dark-side-porn-season-2-2006/|website=Crimedocumentary.com|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later traced to a crude juxtaposition of smuggled cuts from many of Bodil Joensen's 1970s Danish movies.

Into the 1980s the Dutch took the lead, creating figures like "Wilma" and the "Dutch Sisters". In the 1980s, "bestiality" was featured in Italian adult films with actresses like Denise Dior, Francesca Ray, and [[Marina Hedman]], manifested early in the softcore flick ''Bestialità'' in 1976.

Today, in [[Hungary]], where production faces no legal limitations, zoophilic materials have become a substantial industry that produces numerous films and magazines, particularly for Dutch companies such as ''Topscore'' and ''Book &amp; Film International'', and the [[genre]] has stars such as "Hector", a [[Great Dane]] starring in several films. Many Hungarian mainstream performers also appeared anonymously in animal pornography in their early careers. For example, Suzy Spark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurobabeindex.com/sbandoindex/suzyspark.html EuroBabeIndex.com], Suzy Spark&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, animal pornography is used to bypass censorship laws, often featuring Japanese and Swedish{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} female models performing [[fellatio]] on animals, because oral penetration of a non-human penis is not in the scope of Japanese mosaic censor. Sakura Sakurada is an [[AV idol]] known to have appeared in animal pornography, specifically in the AV ''The Dog Game'' in 2006. While primarily underground, there are a number of animal pornography actresses who specialize in bestiality movies. A box-office success of the 1980s, ''[[24 Horas de Sexo Explícito]]'' featured zoophilia.

In the UK [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] criminalises possession of realistic pornographic images depicting sex with animals (see [[extreme pornography]]), including fake images and simulated acts, as well as images depicting sex with dead animals, where no crime has taken place in the production. The law provides for sentences of up to two years in prison; a sentence of 12 months was handed down in one case in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2086306_acts_of_depravity_found_on_dads_computer ‘Acts of depravity’ found on dad’s computer], ''[[Reading Post]]'', 26 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography of this sort has become the business of certain [[spam (electronic)|spammers]] such as [[Jeremy Jaynes]] and owners of some fake [[Thumbnail gallery post|TGP]]s, who use the promise of "extreme" material as a bid for users' attention.

==Health and safety==
{{Main article|Zoonosis}}
Infections that are transmitted from animals to humans are called [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]]. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, but others are much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the [[semen]], vaginal fluids, [[urine]], [[saliva]], [[feces]] and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are [[Brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[leptospirosis]], and [[toxocariasis]]. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. [[Allergy|Allergic reactions]] to animal semen may occur, including [[anaphylaxis]]. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.

==Zoophiles==

=== Non-sexual zoophilia ===
The love of animals is not necessarily sexual in nature. In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] the word "zoophilia" is sometimes used without sexual implications. Being fond of animals in general, or as pets, is accepted in Western society, and is usually respected or tolerated. However, the word zoophilia is used to mean a sexual preference towards animals, which makes it &lt;ref name="CraigheadNemeroff2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=W. Edward Craighead|editor2=Charles B. Nemeroff|title=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JQMRmyOfpJ8C&amp;dq=zoophilia+meaning&amp;q=zoophilia+meaning#v=snippet&amp;q=zoophilia%20meaning&amp;f=false|date=November 11, 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-27083-6|page=1050}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[paraphilia]]. Some zoophiles may not act on their sexual attraction to animals. People who identify as zoophiles may feel their love for animals is romantic rather than purely sexual, and say this makes them different from those committing entirely sexually motivated acts of bestiality.&lt;ref name="Delaney2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Delaney|title=Law and Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjqWw-9ZQfYC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=zoophilia+romantic|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43700-4|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoophile community===
[[File:Zeta toy MMB 01.jpg|thumb|right|Several companies (e.g., Bad Dragon) sell [[dildo]]s in the shape of animal penises, both realistic and fantastical. This one is based on a [[wolf's penis]].]]
An online survey which recruited participants over the internet concluded that prior to the arrival of widespread [[computer network]]ing, most zoophiles would not have known other zoophiles, and for the most part, zoophiles engaged in bestiality secretly, or told only trusted friends, family or partners. The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and anonymity. Because of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to "openly" express their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Montclair, 1997, cited by Miletski, 1999, p .35.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many other [[alternative lifestyle|alternate lifestyles]], broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in [[online community|networked social groups]] became more common at home and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Weinberg and Williams"&gt;Weinberg and Williams&lt;/ref&gt; Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together.&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular newsgroup [[alt.sex|alt.sex.bestiality]], said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), – and reputedly started in humor&lt;ref&gt;Miletski p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; – along with personal [[bulletin board]]s and [[talker]]s, chief among them [[Sleepy's multiple worlds]], [[Lintilla (talker)|Lintilla]], and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind&lt;!-- Clarify: Of what kind? Of all internet groups? Or of zoophilia-related internet groups? --&gt; in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and [[Internet Forum|internet forums]]. By around 1992–1994, the wide social net had evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Miletski (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This was initially centered around the above-mentioned [[newsgroup]], alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured into a discussion and support group.&lt;ref&gt;Milteski (1999), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andriette, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montclair, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events.&lt;ref&gt;Donofrio, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, other zoophile websites have been created and have grown in size; for example, the zoophile website and internet forum "beastforum.com" has more than one million members as of March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-boards.com/board/1626/ |title=Beast Forum statistics |publisher=Big-boards.com |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106122801/http://www.big-boards.com/board/1626/ |archivedate=6 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beastforum.com |title=The Worlds Largest Bestiality Board |publisher=BeastForum.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinberg and Williams observe that the internet can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey’s day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might have been part of a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile community is not known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may not be aware of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture{{clarify|date=December 2011}}, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.&lt;ref name="Weinberg and Williams"/&gt;

There also exist websites which aim to provide support and social assistance to zoophiles (including resources to help and rescue abused or mistreated animals), but these are not usually well publicized. Such work is often undertaken as needed by individuals and friends, within social networks, and by word of mouth. One notable early attempt at creating a zoophile support structure focused on social and psychological support was the newsgroup soc.support.zoophilia, which was proposed in 1994 but narrowly failed to meet the 2/3 majority needed to be created{{clarify|date=December 2011}}. There was also a German support group called "Interessengemeinschaft Zoophiler Menschen ("Zoophile Interest Group").&lt;ref&gt;Miletski (1999), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophiles tend to experience their first zoosexual feelings during adolescence, and tend to be secretive about it, hence limiting the ability for non-Internet communities to form:&lt;ref name="browplm2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Francis |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/2/ |title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement – Page 2 – News – Broward/Palm Beach – New Times Broward-Palm Beach |publisher=Broward/Palm Beach |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I asked him [a zoophile] when he had his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always interested in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted to make him feel good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I was the only one who did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be talking to my parents or my friends about this.'[...] 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'"&lt;ref name="browplm2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Leda - after Michelangelo Buonarroti.jpg|thumb|[[Leda and the Swan (Michelangelo)|''Leda and the Swan'']], copy of a lost Michelangelo.]]

Because of its controversial nature, people have developed arguments both for&lt;ref name="singer01"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pablo Stafforini |url=http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |title=Heavy Petting, by Peter Singer |publisher=Utilitarian.net |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606173906/http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |archivedate=6 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and against&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopbestiality.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/bestiality-and-lack-of-consent/ |title=Bestiality and Lack of Consent " StopBestiality |publisher=Stopbestiality.wordpress.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; zoophilia. Arguments for and against zoosexual activity from a variety of sources, including religious, moral, ethical, psychological, medical and social.

=== Arguments against bestiality ===
Bestiality is seen by the government of the United Kingdom as profoundly disturbed behavior (as indicated by the UK [[Home Office]] review on sexual offences in 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm56/5668/5668.pdf |title=Protecting the Public: Strengthening Protection Against Sex Offenders and Reforming the Laws on Sexual Offences |chapter=Other offences |pages=32–3 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-10-156682-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20131205100653/http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm56/5668/5668.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Beetz states there is evidence that there can be violent zoosadistic approaches to sex with animals. Beetz argues that animals might be traumatized even by a non-violent, sexual approach from a human;&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Beetz also says that in some cases, non-abusive bestiality can be reciprocally pleasurable for both the human and non-human animal.&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"/&gt;

An argument from human dignity is given by Wesley J. Smith, a senior fellow and [[Intelligent Design]] proponent at the [[Center for Science and Culture]] of the conservative Christian [[Discovery Institute]]: – "such behavior is profoundly degrading and utterly subversive to the crucial understanding that human beings are unique, special, and of the highest moral worth in the known universe—a concept known as '[[human exceptionalism]]' ... one of the reasons bestiality is condemned through law is that such degrading conduct unacceptably subverts standards of basic human dignity and is an affront to humankind's inestimable importance and intrinsic moral worth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyjsmith.com/blog/2005/08/bestiality-and-varied-attacks-on-human.html Wesleyjsmith.com] and [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/985pgwjh.asp Weeklystandard.com], 31 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary critiques of bestiality is that it is harmful to animals and necessarily abusive, because animals are unable to give or withhold consent.&lt;ref name=Regan63&gt;Regan, Tom. ''Animal Rights, Human Wrongs''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, pp. 63–4, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) has said that as animals do not have the same capacity for thinking as humans, they are unable to give full consent. The HSUS takes the position that all sexual activity between humans and animals is abusive, whether it involves physical injury or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ Sex Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071214033934/http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |date=14 December 2007 }}, NManimalControl.com&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1993 article, Dr. Frank Ascione stated that "bestiality may be considered abusive even in cases when physical harm to an animal does not occur." In a 1997 article, Piers Beirne, Professor of Criminology at the University of Southern Maine, points out that 'for genuine consent to sexual relations to be present...both participants must be conscious, fully informed and positive in their desires.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |title=The First Strike Campaign: ANIMAL SEXUAL ABUSE FACT SHEET |website=NManimalControl.com |accessdate=13 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312010653/http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |archive-date=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2752/089279393787002105 |title=Children Who are Cruel to Animals: A Review of Research and Implications for Developmental Psychopathology |year=1993 |last1=Ascione |first1=Frank R. |journal=Anthrozoös: A Multidisciplinary Journal of the Interactions of People and Animals |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=226–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for bestiality ===
[[File:Persian woman with an animal Wellcome L0033282.jpg|thumb|Book illustration depicting dog with woman, [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]], 15th century.]]
Some defenders of bestiality argue that the issue of [[sexual consent]] is irrelevant because many legal human practices (such as [[semen collection]], [[Artificial insemination of livestock and pets|artificial insemination]], hunting, [[animal testing|laboratory testing]], and slaughtering animals for meat) do not involve the consent of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 February 2011 by Lucas Wachob |url=http://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/columnists/article_f08fbb0c-42ca-11e0-ab43-00127992bc8b.html |title=Column: In defense of chicken 'lovers' – The Breeze: Columnists |website=Breezejmu.org |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Cutteridge states the following regarding this argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Animal sexual autonomy is regularly violated for human financial gain through procedures such as [artificial insemination and slaughter]. Such procedures are probably more disturbing physically and psychologically than acts of zoophilia would be, yet the issue of consent on the part of the animal is never raised in the discussion of such procedures. To confine the 'right' of any animal strictly to acts of zoophilia is thus to make a law [against zoophilia] based not on reason but on moral prejudice, and to breach the constitutional rights of zoophiles to due process and equality before the law. [...] Laws which criminalize zoophilia based on societal abhorrence of such acts rather than any real harm caused by such acts are an unjust and unconstitutional infringement on individual liberty."&lt;ref name="interdis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cutteridgepaper.pdf |title=Inter-disciplinary.net |format=PDF |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722100122/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cutteridgepaper.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hani Miletski|Miletski]] believes that "Animals are capable of sexual consent – and even initiation – in their own way."&lt;ref&gt;Miltski, 1999, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with ("hump") the legs of people of both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Cauldwell, 1948 &amp; 1968; Queen, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes that as far as cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively.&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"/&gt; Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes even seem to enjoy the sexual attention&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 1971, and Greenwood, 1963, both cited in Miletski, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans.&lt;ref name="Dekkers, 1994"&gt;Dekkers, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and "seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human."&lt;ref name="interdis"/&gt; Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not like. Most people can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away. An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it. To those defending bestiality this is seen as a way in which animals give consent, or the fact that a dog might wag its tail.&lt;ref&gt;(Einsenhaim, 1971, cited in Kathmandu, 2004)"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Preference utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] philosopher and [[Animal rights|animal liberation]] author [[Peter Singer]] argues that bestiality is not unethical so long as it involves no harm or cruelty to the animal&lt;ref name=SingerNerve&gt;Singer, Peter.

Some zoophiles claim that they are not abusive towards animals:&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In other recent surveys, the majority of zoophiles scoffed at the notion that they were abusive toward animals in any way—far from it, they said. Many even consider themselves to be animal welfare advocates in addition to zoophiles."&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mentions in the media==
Because of its controversial nature, different countries vary in the discussion of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement. In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator ([[OFCOM]]) updated its code stating that freedom of expression is at the heart of any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed as to what they will be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a fully informed choice for themselves, should be protected. Hence a [[Watershed (television)|watershed]] and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people. Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/codes/bcode/?a=87101 |title=OFCOM Broadcasting Code |website=Ofcom.org.uk |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPT was replaced after the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act in 1993, replaced with bodies designed to allow both more debate and increased consistency, and possession and supply of material that it is decided are objectionable was made a criminal offence.

Mention in the media is often comical in nature. References to bestiality are not uncommon in some media, especially adult [[cartoon]] series such as ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'', [[satire|satirical comedy]] such as ''[[Borat]]'', and films (especially shock [[exploitation film]]s), although a few broadcasters such as [[Howard Stern]] (who joked about bestiality dial-a-date on NBC) and [[Tom Binns]] (whose [[XFM London]] Breakfast Show resulted on one occasion in a live discussion about the ethics of zoophilic pornographic movies at peak child listening time) have been reprimanded by their stations for doing so.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In literature, American novelist [[Kurt Vonnegut]] refers to a photo of a woman attempting sexual intercourse with a Shetland Pony in ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'', and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]''. [[Philip K. Dick]] also refers to a photo of a woman copulating with a Shetland Pony in ''[[Flow My Tears The Policeman Said]]''. [[John Irving]]'s novel ''[[The Cider House Rules]]'' repeatedly mentions a pornographic photograph depicting oral sex on a pony. In ''[[Clerks II]]'' Randal orders a [[donkey show]] as a going away present for his best friend Dante, in which it is referred to as "interspecies erotica" by the male performer.

[[Pu Songling]] refers to zoophilia in the ''[[Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio]]'' short story "[[The Fornicating Dog]]", which talks about sexual relations between a woman and her white dog.
