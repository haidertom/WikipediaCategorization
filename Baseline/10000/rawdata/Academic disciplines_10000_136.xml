'''''A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive''''' is an 1843 book by [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] [[John Stuart Mill]]. In this work, he formulated the five principles of [[inductive reasoning]] that are known as [[Mill's Methods]]. This work is important in the philosophy of science, and more generally, insofar as it outlines the empirical principles Mill would use to justify his moral and political philosophies.
An article in "Philosophy of Recent Times" has described this book as an "attempt to expound a psychological system of logic within empiricist principles.”

This work was important to the history of science, being a strong influence on scientists such as [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]].&lt;ref name=FarmeloDirac&gt;{{cite book| last=Farmelo | first=Graham | authorlink=Graham Farmelo | title=The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Quantum Genius | isbn=9780571222780| publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MillInfluenceDirac&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | last=Cassidy | first=David C.| title=Graham Farmelo.

Mill revised the original work several times over the course of thirty years in response to critiques and commentary by Whewell, Bain, and others.

'''''Being Different: An Indian Challenge to Western Universalism''''' is a [[2011 in literature|2011]] book by [[Rajiv Malhotra]], an Indian-American author, philanthropist and public speaker, published by [[HarperCollins]]. The book reverts the gaze of the [[western culture]]s on India, repositioning India from being the observed to the observer, by looking at the West from a [[Dharma|Dharmic]] point of view.

==About the book==
Malhotra intends to give a critique of western culture, by comparing it with Indian culture, as seen from a 'Dharmic point of view.' To accomplish this goal, he postulates a set of characteristics of western culture, and a set of characteristics of Indian culture and religion, characterised as "Dharmic." Malhotra explains that in ''Being Different'',
{{quote|'Dharma' is used to indicate a family of spiritual traditions originating in India which today are manifested as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. I explain that the variety of perspectives and practices of dharma display an underlying integral unity at the metaphysical level.{{sfn|Malhotra|2011|p=3}}}}

Malhotra summarizes his rationale for treating Dharmic traditions as a family, contrasting the family of Dharmic traditions with Abrahamic religions. He constructs their differences from this 'Dharmic perspective,' thereby 'reversing the gaze.'{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=371}} Malhotra clarifies that he is not replacing a West-centric view with a Dharma-centric view by proposing the reversal of gaze.{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=375}} Malhotra explains that he seeks a dialogue, where the world civilizations are not merely seen from the viewpoint of the West, but the west is also seen from a non-western, c.q. 'dharmic' point of view.{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=371}}

Malhotra calls for mutual respect as a higher standard for pluralism than tolerance. Mutual respect does not call for acceptance of beliefs held by others, only to have genuine respect for difference, because, beliefs are not facts.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news| author =Rajiv Malhotra | title='Tolerance Isn't Good Enough'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rajiv-malhotra/hypocrisy-of-tolerance_b_792239.html | work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malhotra explains why this gaze from the other side benefits the West,{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=373}} explaining that he
{{quote|... hopes to set the terms for a deeper and more informed engagement between dharmic and Western civilizations."{{sfn|Malhotra|2011|p=2}}}}

==Overview==
Malhotra identifies "six distinct and fundamental points of divergence between the dharmic traditions and the West."&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis"&gt;[http://beingdifferentbook.com/synopsis/ beingdifferentbook.com, ''Synopsis'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Malhotra argues that understanding these six points of divergence is crucial to recognizing the fallacy of  facile sameness arguments and to understanding senselessness of inculturation efforts.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} These points of divergence are:&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Patheos Book Club" /&gt;
# Approaches to difference
# History-centrism versus inner sciences
# Integral versus synthetic unity
# The nature of chaos and uncertainty
# Translatability vs. Sanskrit
# Western universalism challenged

===Divergence 1: Approaches to difference===
According to Malhotra, there is a pervasive anxiety in the west over personal and cultural differences. Therefore, the west tries to assimilate and convert "all that does not fit its fundamental paradigms."&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis" /&gt; According to Malhotra, this anxiety is grounded in schisms which are inherent in the western worldview. In contrast, "Dharmic traditions [...] are historically more comfortable with differences."&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis" /&gt;

===Divergence 2: History Centrism versus inner sciences===
According to Malhotra, Dharmic traditions rely on adhyatma-vidya,{{refn|group=note|"Sciences of spirituality,"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/adhyatmavidya Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Adhyatmavidya'']&lt;/ref&gt; "True, Genuine and Authentic Spiritual Knowledge."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://adhyatmavidya.com/ adhyatmavidya.com]&lt;/ref&gt;}} while the [[Abrahamic religions]] rely on God's interventions in human history.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Problematizing God's Interventions In History|url=http://creative.sulekha.com/problematizing-god-s-interventions-in-history_103442_blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; For followers of history-centric (Abrahamic) religions, truth-claims based on history are more significant than the scriptural message itself. History-centric dogma such as original sin and resurrection become critical beliefs and no compromise can be made on their acceptance. This explains the centrality of Nicene creed to all major Christian denominations. Followers of history-centric religions believe that the God revealed His message through a special prophet and that the message is secured in scriptures. This special access to God is available only to these intermediaries or prophets and not to any other human beings.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Problematizing God's Interventions In History|url=http://creative.sulekha.com/problematizing-god-s-interventions-in-history_103442_blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma traditions do not hold history central to their faith. Gautama Buddha emphasized that his enlightenment was merely a discovery of a reality that is always there. He was not bringing any new covenants from any God. The history of the Buddha is not necessary for Buddhist principles to work. In fact, Buddha stated that he was neither the first nor the last person to have achieved the state of enlightenment. He also asserted that he was not God nor sent by any God as a prophet, and whatever he discovered was available to every human to discover for himself. This makes Buddhism not History-Centric.

Malhotra explains how history-centrism or lack of it has implications for religious absolutist exclusivity vs. flexible pluralism:
{{quote|Abrahamic religions claim that we can resolve the human condition only by following the lineage of prophets arising from the Middle East. All other teachings and practices are required to be reconciled with this special and peculiar history. By contrast, the dharmic traditions – Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism -- do not rely on history in the same absolutist and exclusive way. This dharmic flexibility has made fundamental pluralism possible which cannot occur within the constraints of history centrism, at least as understood so far.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Dharma and the new Pope|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rajiv-malhotra/dharma-and-the-new-pope_b_2755683.html | work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Divergence 3: Integral versus synthetic unity===
Both Western and Dharmic civilizations have cherished unity as an ideal, but with a different emphasis.  Here, Malhotra posits a crucial distinction between what he considers a "synthetic unity" that gave rise to a static intellectualistic Worldview in the West positioning itself as the Universal and an "integrative unity" that gave rise to a dynamically oriented Worldview based on Dharma.{{sfn|Tilak|2012}} While the former is characterized by a "top-down" essentialism embracing everything a priori, the latter is a "bottom-up" approach acknowledging the dependent co-origination of alternative views of the human and the divine, the body and the mind, and the self and society.

===Divergence 4: The nature of chaos and uncertainty===
Dharma philosophical systems are highly systematized in their approach to understanding ultimate reality and in carefully addressing what one can know through various means of knowledge.  However, this rigor does not restrict their freedom in being comfortable with social organization.  Indians exhibit remarkable openness to self-organization and decentralization.  Malhotra explains the basis for this openness:
{{quote|Hinduism weaves multiple narratives around the central motif of cooperative rivalry between order (personified as devas) and chaos (personified as asuras). A key myth shared by all the dharma traditions – the 'churning of the milky ocean,' or 'samudra-manthan' – shows the eternal struggle between two poles. The milky ocean is the ocean of consciousness and creativity, which is to be churned in order to obtain amrita, or the nectar of eternal life."&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Order, chaos and creation|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/Order-chaos-and-creation/articleshow/10552328.cms | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dharma actually recognises the need for both Order and Chaos to co-exist in the universe. In the story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/Order-chaos-and-creation/articleshow/10552328.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Order, chaos and creation – The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prajapati attempts to create the Universe keeping Order and Chaos in dynamic balance. His initial attempts fail because they're too 'Jami'/homogenous or too 'Prthak'/different. Finally he gets the combination just-right by using the principle of 'Bandhuta/[[Bandhu]]' i.e. binding together dissimilar things by what is common across all things in the entire creation.

=== Divergence 5: Translatability vs. Sanskrit ===
Malhotra identifies various non-translatables in Sanskrit that have been mapped into Abrahamic religious concepts. These mis-translations then are used to draw sameness arguments or to denounce Hinduism. Malhotra explains that

{{quote|In the fashionable search for sameness in all religions, Holy Spirit in Christianity is often equated with Shakti or kundalini in Hinduism. However, these terms represent different, even incompatible cosmologies. Christianity assumes an inherent dualism between God and creation. This necessitates historical revelations along with prophets, priests and institutions to bring us the truth. But Shakti, being all-pervading, obviates dependence on these; its experience can be discovered by going within through yoga.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title='Holy Spirit' is not the same as 'Shakti' or 'Kundalini'|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Hinduism/Articles/Holy-Spirit-is-not-the-same-as-Shakti-or-Kundalini.aspx?p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Malhotra gives example of a list of Sanskrit non-translatables and goes on to provide key differences in their original meaning and the most common translated word in English. For example,{{sfn|Malhotra|2011|p=251-306}}

===Divergence 6: Western universalism challenged===
Malhotra claims that refuting Western Universalism is one of the most important objectives of his book, the conscious effort from American and European individuals to make the rest of the world fit into the template provided by these civilizations. He claims that all people and culture are forced into the various schemes put forward to bring this about and asserts that modern laws, regulation, conventions and common practices are formed, whether consciously or not with Western Universalism in mind.

Malhotra then goes on to provide a case study of Germany for Western digestion and synthesis. He claims that late 18th and early 19th century saw a special interest in ancient India in European academia now called as Romantic movement and Indic origin of European culture started to compete with the earlier held Semitic origin. To satisfy German cultural and religious egotistic interests various German Romantic thinkers like [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|K. W. F. Schlegel]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hagel]] slowly digested Indic ideas, like [[monism]], and presented a caricature of India as the 'frozen other'. Malhotra says Hagel presented, "The ''[[Weltgeist]]'' or World Spirit is, in effect the protagonist of this history, and the West is extraordinary because it is destined to lead this journey while all other civilizations must follow or perish." He claims this narrative gave the West its privileges and those who doesn't fit into this scheme are not a part of history, even though the Spirit may use (parts of) them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegel|first1=G. W. F.|title=Phenomenology of Spirit.|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malhotra alleges "He (Hegel) laboriously criticizes Sanskrit and Indian civilization, arguing with European Indologists with the aim of assimilating some ideas (such as absolute idealism) into his own philosophy) while postulating India as the inferior other in order to construct his theory of the West. Asia's place in history is as an infant, whereas the West is mature and everyone's eventual destination." This argument led to justification of colonialism as a [[Teleology|teleological imperative]] by which the superior Europeans must appropriate others. For example, Hegel argues it is better for Africans to remain enslaved until they pass through a process of maturation that culminates in their total conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schlegel|first1=K. W. F.|title=The Philosophy of History|date=1859|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel regarded colonization as India's inevitable fate and was declared 'static' and incapable of progress by itself, and it was up to the West to colonize and 'operate' on her for her own benefit. Hegel's perception of India as stagnant and lacking history was perpetuated by [[Karl Marx]], who described India as caught in the 'Asiatic Mode of Production'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marx|first1=Karl|title=The British Rule in India|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/06/25.htm|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=New-York Herald Tribune|date=1853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel writes, 'The Germanic Spirit (germanische Geist) is the Spirit of the New World (neuen Welt), whose end is the realization of the absolute truth... The destiny of the Germanic people is that of serving as the bearer of the Christian principle'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegel|first1=G. W. F.|title=Lectures on the Philosophy of World History|date=1982|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Hegel establishes that while the West is pure, some westerners (Germans) are purer than others. As [[Wilhelm Halbfass|Halbfass]] explains, 'European thought has to provide the context and categories for the exploration of all traditions of thought',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halbfass|first1=Wilhelm|title=India and Europe : An Essay in Understanding|date=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0887067952|page=96|url=https://www.amazon.com/India-Europe-An-Essay-Understanding/dp/0887067956|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Malhotra argues sees the digestion of Indian civilization into Western categories as both natural and desirable. Malhotra also writes that, after Hegel's death his sweeping Eurocentric accounts of history was extrapolated which culminates at the Aryan identity. Malhtora states,

{{quote|Hegel's theory of history has led to liberal Western supremacy, which hides behind the notion of providing the 'universals'. These European Enlightenment presuppositions became incorporated in the confluence of academic philosophy, philology, social theories and 'scientific' methodologies – all of which were driven by various imperial and colonial values alongside Christian theology.}}

In February 2012, Patheos Book Club hosted a discussion of Being Different on their website. &lt;ref group=web name="Patheos Book Club"&gt;{{cite web |title=Patheos Book Club – Being Different|url=http://www.patheos.com/Books/Book-Club/Rajiv-Malhotra-Being-Different.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Journal of Hindu Studies===
'''Cleo McNelly Kearns'''

According to Kearns,  Malhotra puts forward a valuable challenge to Christian theology.{{sfn|Kearns|2012|p=349-368}} She also notes that Malhotra himself adds to the "binary thinking" which he rejects.{{sfn|Kearns|2012|p=349-368}}

==== Rita M. Gross ====
According to Gross, Malhotra has located "one of the most urgent tasks for human survival", namely the ability to accommodate diversity without judging one culture over another as superior or inferior.{{sfn|Gross|2012|p=323-334}}

====  Shrinivas Tilak ====
Tilak is appreciative of the "counterreading"{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=306}} that Malhotra offers. According to Tilak, Malhotra "gives voice to Indic subjects who have been silenced or transformed by nineteenth century and contemporary Indological filters.{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=306}} Tilak uses the term ''Dharmacatuskam'', "House of Dharma with Its Four Wings (Dharmas)",{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=291}} to denote the sense of integration that underlies the Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism traditions.{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=291}} Tilak points out that Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism offer various approaches to dharma, which are "not unitary but composite".{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=295}}

====Gerald James Larson====
Gerald James Larson is critical of Malhotra's presentation of "differences". According to Larson,
Malhotra ignores the differences, to arrive at a "integral unity" "that is little more than a Neo-Vedanta or Neo-Hindu reading of the Bhagavad Gita documented with numerous citations from Aurobindo." Larson calls this the "Brahmin imaginary",{{refn|group=note|Doniger: "It is often convenient to speak of a Brahmin-oriented quasi-orthodoxy (or ortho-praxy [...]), which we might call the Brahmin imaginary or the idealized system of class and life stage (''varna-ashrama-dharma''). but whatever we call this constructed center, it is, like the empty center in the Zen diagram of Hinduisms, simply an imaginary point around which we orient all the actual Hindus who accept or oppose it; it is what Indian logicians call the straw man (''purva paksha''), against whom argues. The actual beliefs and practices of Hindus – renunciation, devotion, sacrifice, and so many more – are peripheries that the imaginary Brahmin center cannot hold.{{sfn|Doniger|2010|p=29-30}}}} the standard Brahmanical view of Indic religion and philosophy in its [[Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Hindu]] understanding.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} According to Larson, the "Brahmin imaginary" is an imagined "integral unity" that is adhered to only by a cultural elite, with very little reality "on the ground", as it were, throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} Larson also criticises the use of the term "Dharma traditions" or "dharmic systems", which ignores the differences between the various Indian religions.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} Larson ends his review with the recommendation to move toward a future in which "being different" really reflects the  "differences' in Indic religion and thought, "in a manner that challenges but also learns from the ongoing interactions with "the West.""{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}}

====Robert A. Yelle====
Robert A. Yelle is highly critical of Malhotra's approach. According to Yelle, "there is little, if any, original scholarship in the book. It is the work of a polemicist," who uses western scholarship when criticizing the West, but ignores this scholarship when he presents his own nativist vision of "dharmic traditions." According to Yelle, Malhotra's vision is a mirror image of Orientalism, namely Occidentalism.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=337-338}} Robert A. Yelle also criticises Malhotra for his use of the term "dharmic traditions".{{sfn|Yelle|2012}} According to Yelle, Malhotra ignores the differences that exist among and within the various traditions of India. According to Yelle, Malhotra presents a thoroughly homogenized ideal of Hinduism, based on a limited choice of aspects from Vedanta philosophy and Yoga.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338-339}} Yelle ends his review with the remark that there has been a gradual improvement in Western scholars' knowledge of Indian traditions. To come to a real dialogue, Indians must also be willing to look in the mirror, and be open to self-criticism.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=346}}

====Nicholas F. Gier====
Gier criticizes Malhotra for ignoring profound differences between Dharmic traditions in seeing an integral unity. Gier notices that Malhotra himself admits that there are ‘profound differences in theory and practice' in the Dharma traditions. According to Gier,this undermines Malhotra's principal claim that these philosophical schools are "integral".{{sfn|Gier|2012}}

===Other peer-reviewed reviews===
====Brian Campbell====
In the ''Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford'', Brian Campbell wrote that the book succeeds in fulfilling only one of its four goals. According to Campbell, it gives a simplistic view of modern colonialism. It also fails to reverse the gaze, and to apply dharmic categories to Western socio-cultural reality. According to Campbell, Malhotra does
succeed in tracing the difference between Western and Oriental thought.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=225}}

The '''Berlin Mathematical School''' ('''BMS''') is a joint [[graduate school]] of the three renowned [[mathematics]] departments of the [[public university|public]]  research universities in [[Berlin]]: [[FU Berlin|''Freie Universität Berlin'']], [[Humboldt Universität|''Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin'']], and [[Berlin Institute of Technology|''Technische Universität Berlin'']].
In October 2006, the BMS was awarded one of the 18 prestigious graduate school awards by the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Excellence Initiative]]  of the German Federal Government for its innovative concept, its strong cross-disciplinary focus, and its outstanding teaching schedule tailored to the needs of students in an international environment. This was reconfirmed in June 2012 when the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] announced that the BMS would also receive funding for a second period until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/list/projectdetails/index.jsp?id=24061210&amp;sort=nr_asc&amp;prg=GSC Retrieved 2015-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
The BMS Chair is [[Günter M. Ziegler]] (FU), and the deputy Chairs are [http://didaktik.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/index.php?article_id=15&amp;clang=0 Jürg Kramer] (HU) and [[John M. Sullivan (mathematician)|John M. Sullivan]] (TU).

== Cooperation ==

BMS students enjoy access to exclusive seminars, workshops and lectures in English not only at the participating universities, but also at their academic partners:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math-berlin.de/about-bms/people-a-organization/units&lt;/ref&gt;

• the Research Training Groups (RTG)

• the International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS)

• ECMath

• the Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB)

• the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS)

or the DFG Collaborative Research Centers:

• Space – Time – Matter (SFB 647)

• Discretization in Geometry (SFB 109)

• Scaling Cascades in Complex Systems (SFB 1114).

== PhD in Mathematics at the BMS ==

The BMS PhD study program guides a student with a bachelor's degree through a structured course program, an oral qualifying exam, then directly to a doctoral degree in four to five years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math-berlin.de/students/program-information&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math-berlin.de/students/timeline-of-phd&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase I is the first part of the program and includes a lecture program created specifically for the BMS and coordinated among the three universities. Applicants who hold a bachelor's degree, ''Vordiplom'', or equivalent can apply for Phase I of the BMS. Each semester, seven to ten Basic Courses are offered in English. During Phase I, every BMS student should complete at least five Basic Courses, plus two Advanced Courses (including one seminar) within three to four semesters. At the end of Phase I the Qualifying Exam takes place: an oral exam which is mandatory for admission to the research phase. Phase I students have a BMS faculty member as a mentor, who is assigned by the Admissions Committee. The Phase I mentor guides the student for the entire duration of Phase I, through the BMS Qualifying Exam until the start of Phase II.

Phase II is the research phase of the BMS PhD program and, to apply, students are expected to have a master's degree and meet the regular admission requirements of the Berlin universities' PhD programs. Each student is registered as a PhD student at one of the three universities and are expected to finish Phase II within four to six semesters.  Phase II students have a thesis supervisor who provides support in all aspects of the PhD thesis, and gives advice on choosing the right conferences and publishing articles. In addition, Phase II students also have a separate mentor who can assist them in forming a career plan and in establishing a professional network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math-berlin.de/index.php/students/mentoring&lt;/ref&gt;

== BMS Fridays ==

The BMS Friday is a colloquium which takes place  fortnightly at the BMS Loft in the Urania in Berlin during the lecture period. The BMS welcomes and invites scholars in mathematics. &lt;br /&gt;BMS Fridays also include "What is...?"-seminars&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/w/Math/WhatIsSeminar&lt;/ref&gt; organised by students and offers "tea and cookies" before each talk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6790">[[File:Royal Scottish Academy, Princes Street Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The Royal Institution, Edinburgh (now the [[Royal Scottish Academy building]]), was commissioned and owned by the Board of Manufactures. It served as the head office of the Board from 1826 until its demise in 1906, and as home to several learned societies.]]

During the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[industrial revolution]], Scottish [[industrial policy]] was made by the '''Board of Trustees for Fisheries, Manufactures and Improvements in Scotland''', which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woollens, this meant linen.

The Board was established in 1727, with the purpose of dispersing [[Government grant|grants]] to encourage the growth of the [[Fishing in Scotland|fishing]] and manufacturing industries.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/scottishGovernmentAfter1707.asp|title=Scottish government records after 1707|year=2006|publisher=[[The National Archives of Scotland]]|accessdate=20 November 2011|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[state regulation]] of the linen industry was abolished in 1823, the focus of the board turned to the [[decorative arts]] and the improvement of [[fine arts]] education. The Board had established the [[Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh]] in 1760, to improve [[industrial design]], and in 1906 the Board's remaining functions were transferred to the Trustees of the [[National Galleries of Scotland]] by the National Galleries of Scotland Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Edw7/6/50/enacted | title = National Galleries of Scotland Act 1906 | accessdate = 2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linen industry==
The linen industry was Scotland's premier industry in the 18th century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute,&lt;ref&gt;Louise Miskell and C. A. Whatley, "'Juteopolis' in the Making: Linen and the Industrial Transformation of Dundee, c. 1820-1850," ''[[Textile History]],'' Autumn 1999, vol. 30 (2), pp. 176–98.&lt;/ref&gt; and woollen industries.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair J. Durie, "The Markets for Scottish Linen, 1730-1775," ''Scottish Historical Review'' vol. 52, no. 153, Part 1 (April, 1973), pp. 30–49 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25528985 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged and subsidized by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Durie, "Imitation in Scottish Eighteenth-Century Textiles: The Drive to Establish the Manufacture of Osnaburg Linen," ''Journal of Design History,'' 1993, vol. 6 (2), pp. 71–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen industry in the 18th century, exporting linen to England and America. As a joint-stock company, it had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity. Renamed the [[British Linen Bank]] in 1906, it was one of Scotland's premier banks until it was bought out by the Bank of Scotland in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Malcolm, ''The History of the British Linen Bank'' (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; It joined the established Scottish banks such as the [[Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1695) and the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1727).&lt;ref&gt;R. Saville, ''Bank of Scotland: a History, 1695-1995'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press 1996), {{ISBN|0-7486-0757-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow would soon follow and Scotland had a flourishing financial system by the end of the century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Daunton, ''Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700-1850'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-19-822281-5}}, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Cowen and R.

'''Bonito Phase''' is an archeological term that refers to the period between 900 and 1140 CE, during which the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] in the [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]] area constructed numerous [[Great house (pueblo)|great house]]s. The system is divided into three parts: the '''Early Bonito phase''' from 900 to 1040; the '''Classic Bonito phase''' from 1040 to 1100, and the '''Late Bonito phase''' from 1100 to 1140. When the system was created in the 1980s, it was thought that construction at [[Pueblo Bonito]] began around 920, but it is now known that building at the great house started almost one hundred years earlier, {{circa|850}}.{{sfn|Vivian|Hilpert|2012|p=72}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4218">The '''British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology''' ('''BSSSP''') was founded in 1913, "to advance a particularly radical agenda in the field of sex reform, based on the writings of gurus such as [[Edward Carpenter|[Edward] Carpenter]] and [[Havelock Ellis|[Havelock] Ellis]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lesley A. Hall, '"Disinterested Enthusiasm for Sexual Misconduct": The British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, 1913-47', ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 30, No. 4 (Oct. 1995),  pp.665-686&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 the Society was renamed the '''British Sexological Society'''.&lt;ref name=Ives&gt;[http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00060.xml George Cecil Ives: An Inventory of His Papers] at the [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;
It seems to have continued until some point in the 1940s.

The society was particularly concerned with [[homosexuality]], aiming to combat legal discrimination against homosexuality with scientific understanding. Members included [[George Cecil Ives]],&lt;ref name=Ives/&gt; [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Montague Summers]], [[Stella Browne]],  [[Laurence Housman]], [[Havelock Ellis]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], and [[Ernest Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;David C.

'''Canadian Impressionism''' is a subclass of [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] art influenced from French Impressionism. [[Guy Wildenstein]] of the [[Wildenstein Institute]] in Paris states in the foreword of A.K. Prakash's ''Impressionism in Canada: A Journey of Rediscovery'' that Canadian impressionism is "the Canadian artists who gleaned much from the French but, in their improvisations, managed to transmute what they learned into an art reflecting the aesthetic concerns of their compatriots and the times in which they lived and worked".&lt;ref&gt;Prakash. 2015. p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; The early Canadian Impressionist painters belong into the "Group of who?" as coined by James Adams of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/group-of-who-a-new-book-paints-the-fullest-picture-yet-of-canadas-vision-of-impressionism/article21967828/|title=Group of who?

A '''chronology of Jesus''' aims to establish a [[timeline]] for the events of the life of [[Jesus]]. Scholars have correlated [[Jewish]] and [[Greco-Roman]] documents and astronomical calendars with the [[New Testament]] accounts to estimate dates for the major events in Jesus's life. 

Two main approaches have been used to estimate the year of the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]]: one based on the accounts in the [[Gospels]] of his birth with reference to [[Herod the Great|King Herod's]] reign, and the other by subtracting his stated age of "about 30&amp;nbsp;years" when he began preaching. Most scholars, on this basis, assume a date of birth between 6 and 4&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=MJDG324 &gt;[[John P. Meier]] (1991).

Three details have been used to estimate the year when [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus began preaching]]: a mention of his age of "about 30&amp;nbsp;years" during "the fifteenth year" of the reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]], another relating to the date of the building of the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]], and yet another concerning the [[death of John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 &gt;Eerdman Publishing.

Five methods have been used to estimate the date of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. One uses non-Christian sources such as [[Josephus]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book |last=Funk |first=Robert W. |author2=[[Jesus Seminar]]  |authorlink=Robert W.

Both methods result in AD&amp;nbsp;36 as an upper bound to the crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 &gt;Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum. (2009).

[http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1985/JASA3-85Humphreys.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[lunar eclipse]] method, the Apostle Peter's statement that the moon turned to blood at the crucifixion ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14-21]]) is taken to refer to the lunar eclipse of 3 April AD 33; although astronomers are discussing whether the eclipse was visible as far west as Jerusalem.  Recent astronomical research uses the contrast between the synoptic date of Jesus' last Passover on the one hand with John's date of the subsequent "Jewish Passover" on the other hand, to propose Jesus' Last Supper to have been on Wednesday, 1 April AD 33 and the crucifixion on Friday 3 April AD 33.

Turner 2008 {{ISBN|0-8010-2684-9}} page 613&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the gospels provide some details regarding events which can be clearly dated, so one can establish date ranges regarding major events in Jesus' life by comparison with independent sources.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 /&gt;&lt;ref name = autogenerated5&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Historical  Figure of Jesus | last = Sanders | first = EP | publisher = Penguin Books | place = London | year = 1995 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of historical non-Christian documents, such as Jewish and [[Greco-Roman]] sources, have been used in historical analyses of the chronology of Jesus.&lt;ref name= Blomberg431 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L.

===Biblical references to King Herod's reign===
The two [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity accounts of Jesus]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke]] differ substantially from each other, and are considered to have been written independently. However, some consistent elements are evidently derived from a common early tradition:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulrich Luz]]: ''Die Geburtsgeschichten Jesu und die Geschichte.'' Göttingen 2013, [https://books.google.de/books?id=6ZJbAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 S. 170]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jesus was born under the Judean king [[Herod the Great]] (Matt 2,1f; Luke 1,5 vs Luke 2,1f)
*in [[Bethlehem]] (Matt 2,5f; Luke 2,4.15)
*prior to his parents moving to [[Nazareth]] (Matt 2,22f), or before their return to Nazareth (Luke 2,39).
*Jesus' parents [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] were [[Engagement#Betrothal|betrothed]] (Matt 1,18–20; Luke 1,27; 2,5).
* His birth was a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] conceived by the [[Holy Spirit]].
* [[Angel]]s announced Jesus' birth, his name, his role as the [[Messiah]] (being a descendant of King [[David]] and the [[Son of God (Christianity)|son of God]]), and his mission to save his people from sin (Matt 1,21; Luke 1,77; 2,11,30).

Thus both Luke and Matthew independently associate Jesus' birth with the reign of [[Herod the Great]].&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 731&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew furthermore implies that Jesus was up to two years old when Herod reportedly ordered the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], that is, the murder of all boys in Bethlehem up to the age of two (Matt 2:16).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Edwin D | last = Freed | title = Stories of Jesus' Birth | publisher = Continuum International | year = 2004 | page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars agree that Herod died in 4 BC, although some have argued for 1 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Timothy David|title=The Date of Herod's Death|journal=[[Journal of Theological Studies]]|issue=19|year=1968|pp=204–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernegger|first=P.

===Subtracting Jesus' age of "about 30 years" when preaching===
Another approach to estimating Jesus' year of birth is based on the statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] that he was "about 30 years of age" when starting his ministry.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Andreas J. Köstenberger]], L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus began to preach after being baptised by [[John the Baptist]], and based on Luke’s gospel John only began baptising people in "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]]), which scholars estimate to have been in AD 28–29.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 Amsterdam University Press {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} pages 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoehner 1978 29–37"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ | last = Hoehner| first = Harold W | authorlink = Harold Hoehner|year= 1978|publisher=Zondervan |isbn= 0-310-26211-9|pages= 29–37| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6z-NcR7fVSIC&amp;dq=CHronological+Aspects+of+the+Life+of+Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subtracting 30 years, it appears that Jesus was born in 1-2 BC. However, if the phrase "about 30" is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

This date is independently confirmed by John's reference in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] to the Temple being in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which corresponds to around 28–29 AD according to scholarly estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Jack V. Scarola, "A Chronology of the nativity Era" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos 2'' by Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-582-0}} pages 61–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches===
The Gospel of John 8:57 mentions in passing an upper limit of 50 for Jesus' age when preaching: ''Then the Jews said to Him: You are not even fifty years old, and you claim to have seen Abraham?'' Fifty years is a round number which emphasises the discrepancy to Jesus's claim he had existed before Abraham, that is, for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref name=Humphreys72 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have attempted to establish the date of birth by identifying the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with some known astronomical or astrological phenomenon. For example, astronomer Michael Molnar proposed 17 April 6 BC as the likely date of the Nativity, since that date corresponded to the [[heliacal rising]] and lunar [[occultation]] of [[Jupiter]], while it was [[Apparent retrograde motion#Apparent motion|momentarily stationary]] in the [[Aries (constellation)|constellation of Aries]]. According to Molnar, to knowledgeable astrologers of this time, this highly unusual combination of events would have indicated that a regal personage would be (or had been) born in Judea. &lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Molnar, "The Star of Bethlehem: The Legacy of the Magi," Rutgers University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research points to a 1991 report from the Royal Astronomical Society, which mentions that Chinese astronomers noted a "comet" that lasted 70 days in the Capricorn region of the sky, in March of 5 BC.  Authors Dugard and O'Reilly consider this event as the likely Star of Bethlehem. &lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Bill, and Dugard, Martin, "Killing Jesus: A History," Henry Holt and Company, 2013, {{ISBN|0805098542}}, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many possible phenomena and none seems to match the Gospel account exactly.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''101 Questions and Answers on the Bible'', Paulist Press (2003), page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Years of preaching==

===Reign of Tiberius and the Gospel of Luke===
[[File:Sapsaphas Madaba.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Madaba Map]] showing [[Bethabara]] (Βέθαβαρά), calling it the place where John baptised]]
One method for the estimation of the date of the beginning of the [[ministry of Jesus]] is based on the Gospel of Luke's specific statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1-2]] about the ministry of [[John the Baptist]] which preceded that of Jesus:&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans67 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]] began on the death of his predecessor [[Augustus Caesar]] in September AD&amp;nbsp;14, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in late AD&amp;nbsp;28 or early AD&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name=Cradle &gt;Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum, Charles L Quarles, ''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown'' (B&amp;H Publishing, 2009), page 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=art201 &gt;''Luke 1-5: New Testament Commentary'' by John MacArthur 2009 {{ISBN|0-8024-0871-0}} page 201&lt;/ref&gt; Riesner's alternative suggestion is that John the Baptist began his ministry in AD&amp;nbsp;26 or 27, because Tiberius ruled together with Augustus for two years before becoming the sole ruler. If so, the fifteenth year of Tiberius' reign would be counted from AD&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;ref name="Riesner"/&gt; Riesner's suggestion is however considered less likely, as all the major Roman historians who calculate the years of Tiberius' rule - namely Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio - count from AD&amp;nbsp;14 - the year of Augustus' death. In addition, coin evidence shows that Tiberius started to reign in AD&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;ref name=Humphreys64 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament presents [[John the Baptist]] as the precursor to Jesus and the [[Baptism of Jesus]] as marking the beginning of Jesus' ministry.&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blomberg224 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}} page 224-229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alister16 &gt;''Christianity: an introduction'' by Alister E.

Rausch 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5078-3}} page&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus' baptism account is followed directly by his [[Temptation of Christ|40 day fast and ordeal]].

===The Temple in Jerusalem and the Gospel of John===
[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 3.JPG|right|thumb|[[Herod's Temple]], referred to in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]], as imagined in the [[Holyland Model of Jerusalem]]. It is currently situated adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Book]] exhibit at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem.]]

Another method for estimating the start of the ministry of Jesus without reliance on the [[Synoptic gospels]] is to relate the account in the [[Gospel of John]] about the visit of Jesus to [[Herod's Temple]] in Jerusalem with historical data about the construction of the Temple.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]] says that Jesus went to the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]] around the start of his ministry and in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] Jesus is told: "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?".&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;

Herod's Temple in Jerusalem was an extensive and long term construction on the [[Temple Mount]], which was never fully completed even by the time it was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70.&lt;ref name=Roller67 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lundquist /&gt;&lt;ref name= Maxxix &gt;''The biblical engineer: how the temple in Jerusalem was built'' by Max Schwartz 2002 {{ISBN|0-88125-710-9}} pages xixx-xx&lt;/ref&gt; Having built entire cities such as [[Caesarea Maritima]], Herod saw the construction of the Temple as a key, colossal monument.&lt;ref name=Lundquist &gt;''The Temple of Jerusalem: past, present, and future'' by John M. Lundquist 2007 {{ISBN|0-275-98339-0}} pages101-103 [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9VeCEwbNvsC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22john+2:20%22+temple&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kpydTvvXB-qK4gSg2NHPCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%202%3A20%22%20temple&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication of the initial temple (sometimes called the inner Temple) followed a 17 or 18 month construction period, just after the visit of [[Augustus]] to Syria.&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Roller67 &gt;''The building program of Herod the Great'' by Duane W. Roller 1998 University of California Press {{ISBN|0-520-20934-6}} pages 67-71 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZsB1yQOmyEC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=herod+temple+construction&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DredTu3cIqT64QSitp2nCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=temple%20construction&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josephus]] ([[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XV|Ant 15.11.1]]) states that the temple's reconstruction was started by Herod in the 18th year of his reign.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kostenberger140"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the historical Jesus'' by Craig A. Evans 2008 {{ISBN|0-415-97569-7}} page 115&lt;/ref&gt; But there is some uncertainty about how Josephus referred to and computed dates, which event marked the start of Herod's reign, and whether the initial date should refer to the inner Temple, or the subsequent construction.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum140 /&gt; Hence various scholars arrive at slightly different dates for the exact date of the start of the Temple construction, varying by a few years in their final estimation of the date of the Temple visit.&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pages 140-141&lt;/ref&gt; Given that it took 46 years of construction, the best scholarly estimate for when Jesus preached is around the year AD&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=PAnderson200 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoblet /&gt;&lt;ref name="J.

===Josephus' reference to John the Baptist===
Both the gospels and first-century historian [[Flavius Josephus]], in his work [[Antiquities of the Jews]],&lt;ref&gt;''The new complete works of Josephus by Flavius Josephus'', William Whiston, Paul L. Maier {{ISBN|0-8254-2924-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to [[Herod Antipas]] killing [[John the Baptist]], and to the marriage of Herod and [[Herodias]], establishing two key connections between Josephus and the biblical episodes.&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 /&gt; Josephus refers to the imprisonment and execution of John the Baptist by Herod Antipas and that Herodias left her husband to marry Herod Antipas, in defiance of Jewish law.&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromiley694 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Ant 18.5.2-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephus and the gospels differ, however, on the details and motives, e.g. whether the execution was a consequence of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias (as indicated in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:4|Matthew 14:4]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:18|Mark 6:18]]), or a pre-emptive measure by Herod which possibly took place before the marriage to quell a possible uprising based on the remarks of John, as Josephus suggests in [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Ant 18.5.2]].&lt;ref name=Leslie508 &gt;''Jesus in history, thought, and culture: an encyclopedia, Volume 1'' by James Leslie Houlden 2003 {{ISBN|1-57607-856-6}} pages 508-509 [https://books.google.com/books?id=17kzgBusXZIC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=baptist+josephus+antipas+jesus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5kmbTvPYB9TP4QSuzIDjAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=baptist%20herodias%20josephus%20antipas%20jesus&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Women in scripture'' by [[Carol Meyers]], Toni Craven and Ross Shepard Kraemer 2001 {{ISBN|0-8028-4962-8}} pages 92-93 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MFbHT73BxpAC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=herodias+herod&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FJmcToy0M4abOtTmzIYJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=herodias%20herod&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Herod Antipas in Galilee: The Literary and Archaeological Sources'' by Morten H.

===Reign of Herod Antipas===
{{see also|Jesus at Herod's court}}
In the [[Gospel of Luke]], while Jesus is in [[Pilate's court]], Pilate realizes that Jesus is a Galilean and thus is under the jurisdiction of [[Herod Antipas]].&lt;ref name=Niswonger &gt;''New Testament History'' by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} page 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carter120 &gt;''Pontius Pilate: portraits of a Roman governor'' by Warren Carter 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5113-1}} pages 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Herod was in Jerusalem at that time, Pilate decided to send Jesus to Herod to be tried.&lt;ref name=Niswonger /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carter120 /&gt;

This episode is described only in the [[Gospel of Luke]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#23:7|23:7–15]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'' by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa 2005 {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}} page 181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Patella &gt;''The Gospel according to Luke'' by Michael Patella 2005 {{ISBN|0-8146-2862-1}} page 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke: The Gospel of Amazement'' by Michael Card 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-8308-3835-6}} page 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudyworkshop.com/data/Lesson228.pdf |title=Bible Study Workshop - Lesson 228 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some scholars have questioned the authenticity of this episode, given that it is unique to the Gospel of Luke, the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia states that it fits well with the theme of the gospel.&lt;ref name=Bromiley694 /&gt;

Herod Antipas, a son of [[Herod the Great]], was born before 20 BC and was exiled in the summer of AD&amp;nbsp;39 following a lengthy intrigue involving [[Caligula]] and [[Agrippa I]], the grandson of his father.&lt;ref&gt;''Herod Antipas'' by Harold W.

===Conversion of Paul===
[[File:The Temple of Apollo at Delphi.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Delphi]], Greece, where the [[Delphi Inscription]] was discovered early in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=CCPaul20 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marrow45 /&gt;]]
Another approach to estimating an [[upper bound]] for the year of death of Jesus is the estimation of the date of [[conversion of Paul the Apostle]] which the New Testament accounts place some time after the death of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riesner /&gt; Paul's conversion is discussed in both the [[Letters of Paul]] and in the [[Acts of the Apostles]].&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey William (1979). ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A–D'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. pp. 689. {{ISBN|0-8028-3781-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|15:3–8]]), Paul refers to his conversion. The [[Acts of the Apostles]] includes three separate references to his conversion experience, in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#9|Acts 9]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#22|Acts 22]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#26|Acts 26]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paul and His Letters'' by John B. Polhill 1999 {{ISBN|0-8054-1097-X}} pages 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'' by William Lane Craig, James Porter Moreland 2009 {{ISBN|1-4051-7657-1}} page 616&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimating the year of Paul's conversion relies on working backwards from his trial before [[Junius Annaeus Gallio|Junius Gallio]] in [[Achaea]] Greece ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:12|Acts 18:12–17]]) around AD&amp;nbsp;51–52, a date derived from the discovery and publication, in 1905, of four stone fragments as part of the [[Delphi Inscription]]s, at [[Delphi]] across the Gulf from [[Corinth]].&lt;ref name=Marrow45 &gt;''Paul: his letters and his theology'' by Stanley B. Marrow 1986 {{ISBN|0-8091-2744-X}} pages 45–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak18 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 18–22&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gallio Inscription|url=http://www.wfu.edu/~horton/r102/gallio.html|accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; preserves a letter from Claudius concerning Gallio dated during the 26th acclamation of Claudius, sometime between January 51 and August 52.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Polhill, ''Paul and His Letters'', B&amp;H Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|9780805410976}}, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this basis, most historians estimate that Gallio (brother of [[Seneca the Younger]]) became [[proconsul]] between the spring of AD&amp;nbsp;51 and the summer of AD&amp;nbsp;52, and that his position ended no later than AD&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;ref name=CCPaul20 &gt;''The Cambridge Companion to St Paul'' by James D.

Evans 2004 {{ISBN|0-7814-4006-8}} page 248&lt;/ref&gt; The trial of Paul is generally assumed to be in the earlier part of Gallio's tenure, based on the reference ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|Acts 18:2]]) to his meeting in Corinth with [[Priscilla and Aquila]], who had been recently expelled from Rome based on Emperor Claudius' [[Claudius' expulsion of Jews from Rome|expulsion of Jews from Rome]], which is dated to AD&amp;nbsp;49–50.&lt;ref name=Novak18 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament edition'' by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 {{ISBN|0-88207-812-7}} page 405&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the New Testament, Paul spent eighteen months in Corinth, approximately seventeen years after his conversion.&lt;ref name=Marrow45 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eerdsman1019 &gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' Amsterdam University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 1019&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#2:1|Galatians 2:1-10]] states that Paul went [[Paul the apostle#Visits to Jerusalem in Acts and the epistles|back to Jerusalem]] fourteen years after his conversion, and various missions (at times with [[Barnabas]]) such as those in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#11:25|Acts 11:25–26]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/2 Corinthians#11:23|2 Corinthians 11:23–33]] appear in the Book of Acts.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt; The generally accepted scholarly estimate for the date of conversion of Paul is AD&amp;nbsp;33–36, placing the death of Jesus before this date range.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riesner /&gt;

===Astronomical analysis===

====Newton's method====
[[File:Bolton-newton.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Newton]]]]
All four Gospels agree to within about a day that the crucifixion was at the time of Passover, and all four Gospels agree that Jesus died a few hours before the commencement of the Jewish Sabbath, i.e. he died before nightfall on a Friday (Matt 27:62, 28:1, Mark 15:42, Luke 23:54, John 19:31,42). In the official festival calendar of Judaea, as used by the priests of the temple, Passover time was specified precisely. The slaughtering of the lambs for Passover occurred between 3pm and 5pm on the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan (corresponding to March/April in our calendar). The Passover meal commenced at moonrise (necessarily a full moon) that evening, i.e., at the start of 15 Nisan (the Jewish day running from evening to evening) (Leviticus 23 v. 5; Numbers 28 v. 16). There is an apparent discrepancy of one day in the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion which has been the subject of considerable debate. In John's Gospel, it is stated that the day of Jesus' trial and execution was the day before Passover (John 18 v. 28 and 19 v. 14), Hence John places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan. Likewise the Apostle Paul, in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], implies Jesus died on a 14 Nisan ("sacrificed as a Passover lamb", 1 Cor 5:7), and was resurrected on the Jewish [[Shavuot|festival of the first fruits]], i.e. on a 16 Nisan (1 Cor 15:20).&lt;ref name=Humphreys68 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; The correct interpretation of the Synoptics is less clear. Thus some scholars believe that all 4 Gospels place the crucifixion on Friday, 14 Nisan, others believe that according to the Synoptics it occurred on Friday, 15 Nisan. The problem that then has to be solved is that of determining in which of the years of the reign of Pontius Pilate (AD 26–36) the 14th and 15th Nisan fell on a Friday.&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1985/JASA3-85Humphreys.html "The Date of the Crucifixion"], Colin Humphreys and W. Graeme Waddington, March 1985. American Scientific Affiliation website. Retrieved 17 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1733, [[Isaac Newton]] considered only the range AD&amp;nbsp;31–36 and calculated that the Friday requirement is met only on Friday 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, and 23 April AD&amp;nbsp;34. The latter date can only have fallen on a Friday if an exceptional leap month had been introduced that year, but this was favoured by Newton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00205]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pratt1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Humphreys45 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton &gt;[[Isaac Newton|Newton, Isaac]] (1733).

K. Fotheringham]], who in 1910 suggested 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 on the basis of its coincidence with a lunar eclipse.&lt;ref name=Humphreys45 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fotheringham, J.K. 1910"&gt;Fotheringham, J.K., 1910.

Schaefer]] and J. P. Pratt, following a similar method, arrived at the same date.&lt;ref name=Pratt1 &gt;{{cite journal |last=Pratt |first=J. P. |year=1991 |title=Newton's Date for the Crucifixion |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=301–304 |bibcode=1991QJRAS..32..301P }} [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991QJRAS..32..301P]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=B. E. |year=1990 |title=Lunar Visibility and the Crucifixion |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=53–67 |bibcode=1990QJRAS..31...53S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to [[Colin Humphreys|Humphreys]] and Waddington, the lunar Jewish calendar leaves only two plausible dates within the reign of Pontius Pilate for Jesus' death, and both of these would have been a 14 Nisan as specified in the Gospel of John: Friday 7 April AD&amp;nbsp;30, and Friday 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33.

A more refined calculation takes into account that the Jewish calendar was based not on astronomical calculation but on observation, following criticism that it is possible to establish the [[lunar phase|phase of the moon]] on a particular day two thousand years ago but not whether it was obscured by clouds or haze.&lt;ref&gt;C. Philipp E. Nothaft, ''Dating the Passion: The Life of Jesus and the Emergence of Scientific Chronology'' (200–1600) page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Sanders, ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'' (Penguin, 1993) 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Including the possibility of a cloudy sky obscuring the moon, and assuming that the Jewish authorities would be aware that lunar months can only be either 29 or 30 days long (the time from one new moon to the next is 29.53 days), then the refined calculation states that the Friday requirement might also have been met, during Pontius Pilate's term of office, on 11 April AD&amp;nbsp;27.  Another potential date arises if the Jewish authorities happened to add an irregular lunar leap month to compensate for a meteorologically delayed harvest season: this would yield one additional possibility during Pilate's time, which is Newton's favoured date of 23 April AD&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;ref name=Humphreys53 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 53–58&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Humphreys calculates but rejects these AD&amp;nbsp;27 and AD&amp;nbsp;34 dates on the basis that the former is much too early to be compatible with Luke 3:1–2, and spring AD&amp;nbsp;34 is probably too late to be compatible with Paul's timeline, confirming Friday 7 April AD&amp;nbsp;30, and Friday 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 as the two feasible crucifixion dates.&lt;ref name=Humphreys63 &gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, pages 63–66&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eclipse method====
[[File:Total_lunar_eclipse_May_4_2004-Jpeter_smith.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Lunar eclipse]], 4 May 2004. Red hue caused by diffraction of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere.]]
A [[lunar eclipse]] is potentially alluded to in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14–21]] ("The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come"), as pointed out by physicist [[Colin Humphreys]] and astronomer Graeme Waddington. There was in fact a lunar eclipse on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33,&lt;ref name="Fotheringham, J.K. 1910"/&gt;[https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCLEmap/0001-0100/LE0033-04-03P.gif] a date which coincides with one of Newton's astronomically possible crucifixion dates (see above). Humphreys and Waddington have calculated that in ancient Jerusalem this eclipse would have been visible at moonrise at 6.20pm as a 20% partial eclipse (a full moon with a potentially red "bite" missing at the top left of the moon's disc). They propose that a large proportion of the Jewish population would have witnessed this eclipse as they would have been waiting for sunset in the west and immediately afterwards the rise of the anticipated full moon in the east as the prescribed signal to start their household Passover meals.&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"/&gt; Humphreys and Waddington therefore suggest a scenario where Jesus was crucified and died at 3pm on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, followed by a red partial lunar eclipse at moonrise at 6.20pm observed by the Jewish population, and that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] recalls this event when preaching the resurrection to the Jews ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:14|Acts of the Apostles 2:14–21]]).&lt;ref name="The Date of the Crucifixion"/&gt; Astronomer [[Bradley Schaefer]] agrees with the eclipse date but disputes that the eclipsed moon would have been visible by the time the moon had risen in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, B.

A potentially related issue involves the reference in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] to a three-hour period of darkness over the whole land on the day of the crucifixion (according to Luke 23:45 τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος – the sun was darkened). Although some scholars view this as a literary device common among ancient writers rather than a description of an actual event,&lt;ref&gt;David E. Garland, ''Reading Matthew: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the First Gospel'' (Smyth &amp; Helwys Publishing,  1999) page 264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) page 108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; other writers have attempted to identify a meteorological event or a datable astronomical phenomenon which this could have referred to. It could not have been a [[solar eclipse]], since this could not take place during the crucifixion at Passover,&lt;ref name=Milone &gt;''Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy'' by David H. Kelley, Eugene F. Milone 2011 {{ISBN|1-4419-7623-X}} pages 250–251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomy: The Solar System and Beyond'' by Michael A. Seeds, Dana Backman, 2009 {{ISBN|0-495-56203-3}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt; and in any case solar eclipses take minutes, not hours.&lt;ref&gt;Meeus, J. (2003, December). ''The maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse''. Journal of the British Astronomical Association, 113(6), 343–348.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, astronomers [[Colin Humphreys|Humphreys]] and Waddington noted that the reference to a solar eclipse is missing in some versions of Luke and argued that the solar eclipse was a later faulty scribal amendment of what was actually the ''lunar'' eclipse of AD&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;ref name="HumWadJASA"/&gt; This is a claim which historian David Henige describes as 'undefended' and 'indefensible'.&lt;ref name="henige"&gt;{{cite book | last=Henige | first=David P. | authorlink=David Henige | title=Historical evidence and argument | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press | isbn=978-0-299-21410-4 | page=150| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humphreys and a number of scholars have alternatively argued for the sun's darkening to have been caused by a ''[[khamsin]]'', i.e. a sand storm, which can occur between mid-March and May in the Middle East and which does typically last for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review&lt;ref name="Telford"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Telford|first1=William R.|title=Review of The Mystery of the Last Supper: Reconstructing the Final Days of Jesus|journal=The Journal of Theological Studies|date=2015|volume=66|issue=1|pages=371–376|doi=10.1093/jts/flv005|url=http://jts.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/27/jts.flv005|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his lunar eclipse argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony, accepting uncritically statements such as the "three different Passovers in John" and Matthew's statement that Jesus died at the ninth hour. He also alleges that Humphreys uses two very dubious sources, namely Pilate's alleged letter to Tiberius and the writings of the fifth-century Bishop Cyril of Alexandria, which Humphreys however classifies as forgery or contemporary interpretation indicative of a tradition at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys 2011 p85 "Much apocryphal writing consists of highly theatrical literature, which cannot be used as historical evidence ... if [Pilate's report to Tertullian] is a Christian forgery, probably made up on the basis of Acts, as seems likely, then this suggests there was a tradition that at the crucifixion the moon appeared like blood."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Double Passover method====
[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|The rising full moon at sunset signals the start of the Passover meal. This is two weeks after the new moon has heralded the start of the month of Nisan (March/April).]]
In the crucifixion narrative, the synoptic gospels stress that Jesus celebrated a Passover meal (Mark 14:12ff, Luke 22:15) ''before'' his crucifixion, which contrasts sharply with the independent gospel of John who is explicit that the official "Jewish" Passover (John 11:55) started at nightfall ''after'' Jesus' death. In his 2011 book, Colin Humphreys proposes a resolution to this apparent discrepancy by positing that Jesus' "synoptic" Passover meal in fact took place two days before John's "Jewish" Passover because the former is calculated by the putative original Jewish lunar calendar (itself based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar putatively introduced to the Israelites by [[Moses]] in the 13th century BC, and still used today by the [[Samaritans]]). The official "Jewish" Passover in contrast was determined by a Jewish calendar reckoning which had been modified during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] in the 6th century BC. This modified Jewish calendar is in use among most Jews today. One basic difference lies in the determination of the first day of the new month: while the Samaritans use the calculated (because by definition invisible) new moon, mainstream Jews use the first observation of the thin crescent of the waxing moon which is on average 30 hours later. The other basic difference lies in the fact that the Samaritan calendar uses a sunrise-to-sunrise day, while the official Jewish calendar uses a sunset-to-sunset day. Due to these differences, the Samaritan Passover is normally one day earlier than the Jewish Passover (and in some years two or more days earlier). The crucifixion year of Jesus can then be calculated by asking the question in which of the two astronomically possible years of AD&amp;nbsp;30 and AD&amp;nbsp;33 is there a time gap between the last supper and the crucifixion which is compatible with the gospel timeline of Jesus' last 6 days. The astronomical calculations show that a hypothetical AD&amp;nbsp;30 date would require an incompatible Monday Last Supper, while AD&amp;nbsp;33 offers a compatible Last Supper on Wednesday, 1 April AD&amp;nbsp;33, followed by a compatible crucifixion on Friday, 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these assumptions he argues that the calculated date of Wednesday 1 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 for the Last Supper allows all four gospel accounts to be astronomically correct, with Jesus celebrating Passover two days before his death according to the original Mosaic calendar, and the Jewish authorities celebrating Passover just after the crucifixion, using the modified Babylonian calendar. In contrast, the Christian church tradition of celebrating the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday would be an anachronism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/135477/20110418/colin-humphreys-last-supper-challenge-biblical-calendar-jewish-calendar-final-days-of-jesus-good-fri.htm |author=Staff Reporter |title=Last Supper was on Wednesday, not Thursday, challenges Cambridge professor Colin Humphreys.| publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculated chronology incidentally supports John's narrative that Jesus died at the same hour (Friday 3pm) on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 that the Passover lambs were slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, page 192–195&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford counters that the separate day schema of the Gospel's Holy Week "is an artificial as well as an inconsistent construction".  As Telford had pointed out in his own book in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;WR Telford ''The Barren Temple and the Withered Tree: A Redaction-Critical Analysis of the Cursing of the Fig-Tree Pericope in Mark's Gospel and its Relation to the Cleansing of the Temple Tradition'' Bloomsbury, London, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; "the initial three-day structure found in [Mark 11] is occasioned by the purely redactional linkage of the extraneous fig-tree story with the triumphal entry and cleansing of the temple traditions, and is not a chronology upon which one can base any historical reconstructions."

===Scholarly debate on time of death===
[[File:Papyrus 90 (John 19.1-7).jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Papyrus 90]] fragment of [[Gospel of John|John 19]]]]
The estimation of the hour of the death of Jesus based on the New Testament accounts has been the subject of debate among scholars for centuries, since there was perceived to be&lt;ref name=RBrown959 /&gt; a clear difference between the accounts in the Synoptic Gospels and that in the Gospel of John. Also, some scholars have argued that it is unlikely that the many events of the Passion could have taken place in the span from midnight to about 9 o'clock in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Ruckstuhl (1965), ''Chronology of The Last Days of Jesus – A Critical Study'' [Trans. from German] (pp. 35–71 for ‘The Chronology of “More Than One Day”)&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus of modern scholarship agrees with the four Gospels that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, although a Wednesday crucifixion has also been proposed.&lt;ref name=Kellum142 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pages 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nis167 &gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Niswonger+%22which+meant+Friday%22&amp;btnG= ''New Testament History''] by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pages 167–168&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate can be summarised as follows. In the Synoptic account, the [[Last Supper]] takes place on the first night of [[Passover]], defined in the [[Torah]] as occurring after daylight on [[Quartodeciman|14 of Nisan]], and the crucifixion is on 15 Nisan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Lev|23:5–6|he}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[the Gospel of John]] the trial of Jesus takes place before the Passover meal&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barnett, ''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times'', page 21  (InterVarsity Press, 1999). {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2699-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sentencing takes place on the day of Preparation, before Passover. John's account places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan, since the law mandated the lamb had to be sacrificed between 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm and 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm and eaten before midnight on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Philo]] |title=''De Specialibus Legibus'' 2.145 |url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book28.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]].

It is problematic to reconcile the chronology presented by John with the Synoptic tradition that the [[Last Supper]] was a Passover meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:17–19}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:12–16}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Some scholars have presented arguments to reconcile the accounts,&lt;ref name= KEasley323 /&gt; although [[Raymond E.

Colin Humphreys' widely publicised "double passover" astronomical analysis, published in 2011 and outlined above, places the hour of death of Jesus at 3pm on 3 April AD&amp;nbsp;33 and claims to reconcile the Gospel accounts for the "six days" leading up to the crucifixion. His solution is that the synoptic gospels and John's gospel use two distinct calendars (the official Jewish lunar calendar, and what is today the Samaritan lunar calendar, the latter used in Jesus' day also by the Essenes of Qumran and the Zealots). Humphrey's proposal was preceded in 1957 by the work of Annie Jaubert&lt;ref&gt;La date de la cène, Gabalda, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that Jesus held his Last Supper at Passover time according to the Qumran ''solar'' calendar. Humphreys rejects Jaubert's conclusion by demonstrating that the Qumran solar reckoning would always place Jesus' Last Supper ''after'' the Jewish Passover, in contradiction to all four gospels. Instead, Humphreys points out that the Essene community at Qumran additionally used a lunar calendar, itself evidently based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar. Humphreys suggests that the reason why his two-calendar solution had not been discovered earlier is (a) widespread scholarly ignorance of the existence of the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar (used alongside the well-known Egyptian administrative solar calendar, and presumably the basis for the 13th-century BC Jewish lunar calendar), and (b) the fact that the modern surviving small community of [[Samaritans]] did not reveal the calculations underlying their lunar calendar (preserving the Egyptian reckoning) to outsiders until the 1960s.

In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony. In doing so, Telford says, Humphreys has built an argument upon unsound premises which "does violence to the nature of the biblical texts, whose mixture of fact and fiction, tradition and redaction, history and myth all make the rigid application of the scientific tool of astronomy to their putative data a misconstrued enterprise."&lt;ref name="Telford"/&gt;

==Ancient estimates==
Other estimates of the chronology of Jesus have been proposed over the centuries, e.g. [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], and [[Cassiodorus]] asserted that the death of Jesus occurred in AD&amp;nbsp;31.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The 3rd/4th century Roman historian [[Lactantius]] states that Jesus was crucified on a particular day in AD&amp;nbsp;29, but that did not correspond to a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''Of the Manner In Which the Persecutors Died'' 2: "In the latter days of the Emperor Tiberius, in the consulship of Ruberius (''sic'') Geminus and Fufius Geminus, and on the tenth of the kalends of April, as I find it written".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dalcroze eurhythmics''', also known as the '''Dalcroze method''' or simply '''eurhythmics''', is one of several developmental approaches including the [[Kodály method]], [[Orff Schulwerk]] and [[Suzuki Method]] used to [[music education|teach music]] to students. Eurhythmics was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. Dalcroze eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that takes place through all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic.

Eurhythmics often introduces a musical concept through movement before the students learn about its visual representation. This sequence translates to heightened body awareness and an association of rhythm with a physical experience for the student, reinforcing concepts kinesthetically. Eurhythmics has wide-ranging applications and benefits and can be taught to a variety of age groups. Eurhythmics classes for all ages share a common goal – to provide the music student with a solid rhythmic foundation through movement in order to enhance musical expression and understanding. The origin of the word "Eurhythmics" is "[[eurythmy]]" + "-ics".

==Émile Jaques-Dalcroze and the origins of eurhythmics==

Jaques-Dalcroze was appointed Professor of Harmony at the Conservatoire of Geneva in 1892, early in his career. As he taught his classes, he noticed that his students deeply needed an approach to learning music that included a kinesthetic component. He believed that in order to enhance and maximize musical expression, students needed to be trained early on to listen and appreciate music using both their minds and bodies. This coordination of mind and physical instincts formed the basis of his method.

Ready to develop and employ an improved, integrated style of music education at the Conservatoire, Dalcroze discovered some obstacles. He found that students with innate rhythmic abilities were rare, just as those with "perfect," or absolute pitch are. In response to his observations, he asserted that in order to develop rhythmic ability in his students, he must first, and as early as possible in their development, train them in exercises that utilized the entire body. Only when the student's muscles and motor skills were developed could they be properly equipped to interpret and understand musical ideas. As he mentioned in the foreword of his "Rhythm, Music, and Education," he sought the "connection between instincts for pitch and movement…time and energy, dynamics, and space, music and character, music and temperament, [and] finally the art of music and the art of dancing.”

Because of the nature of his goals in expanding music education, his ideas are readily applicable to young students. An objective of his was to "musicalize" young children in order to prepare them for musical expression in future instrumental studies. He believed exposure to music, an expanded understanding of how to listen, and the training of gross and fine motor skills would yield faster progress later on in students’ musical studies. Related to this was his goal to sow the seeds of musical appreciation for future generations.

As stated concisely by Claire-Lise Dutoit in her "Music Movement Therapy," successful eurhythmics lessons have the following three attributes in common:

“The vital enjoyment of rhythmic movement and the confidence that it gives; the ability to hear, understand and express music in movement; [and] the call made on the pupil to improvise and develop freely his own ideas.”

==Influences on the development of eurhythmics==

Before taking a post teaching theory, [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]] spent a year as a conductor in Algiers, where he was exposed to a rhythmic complexity that helped influence him to pay special attention to rhythmic aspects of music.

Jaques-Dalcroze also had an important friendship with [[Édouard Claparède]], the renowned psychologist. In particular, their collaboration resulted in eurhythmics often employing games of change and quick reaction in order to focus attention and increase learning.

==Current applications==

'''General Education'''

Eurhythmics classes are often offered as an addition to general education programs, whether in preschools, grade schools, or secondary schools. In this setting, the objectives of eurhythmics classes are to introduce students with a variety of musical backgrounds to musical concepts through movement without a specific performance-related goal.

For younger students, eurhythmics activities often imitate play. Games include musical storytelling, which associates different types of music with corresponding movements of the characters in a story. The youngest of students, who are typically experiencing their first exposure to musical knowledge in a eurhythmics class, learn to correlate types of notes with familiar movement; for example the quarter note is represented as a "walking note." As they progress, their musical vocabulary is expanded and reinforced through movement.

'''Performance-Based Applications'''

While eurhythmics classes can be taught to general populations of students, they are also effective when geared toward music schools, either preparing students to begin instrumental studies or serving as a supplement to students who have already begun musical performance.

==Aspects of a rhythmic curriculum==

'''Vocabulary'''

Eurhythmics classes for students in elementary school through college and beyond can benefit from a rhythmic curriculum that explores rhythmic vocabulary. This vocabulary can be introduced and utilized in a number of different ways, but the primary objective of this component is to familiarize students with rhythmic possibilities and expand their horizons. Activities such as rhythmic dictation, composition, and the performance of rhythmic canons and polyrhythms can accommodate a wide range of meters and vocabulary. In particular, vocabulary can be organized according to number of subdivisions of the pulse.

'''Movement'''

A key component of a rhythmic education, movement provides another way of reinforcing rhythmic concepts - kinesthetic learning serves as a supplement to visual and aural learning. While the study of traditional classroom music theory reinforces concepts visually and encourages students to develop aural skills, the study of eurhythmics solidifies these concepts through movement. In younger students, the movement aspect of a rhythmic curriculum also develops musculature and gross motor skills. Ideally, most activities that are explored in eurhythmics classes should include some sort of kinesthetic reinforcement.

'''Meter and Syncopation'''

Another element of a rhythmic curriculum is the exploration of meter and syncopation. In particular, the study of meter should incorporate an organization of pulses and subdivisions. This organization can be expressed in a "meter chart," which can include both equal-beat and unequal-beat meters.

The study of syncopation, a broad term that can involve a variety of rhythms that fall unexpectedly or somehow displace the pulse, is also essential in a rhythmic education. Eurhythmics classes can incorporate various activities to explore syncopation, including complex rhythmic dictations, the performance of syncopated rhythms, the exploration of syncopated rhythms in canon, and a general discussion of syncopated vocabulary.

==Sample activities==

Ages 3–6:
* Warm-up activities: The students isolate and shake each body part, each one accompanied by different music. 
* Notes: Students learn about musical notation through associated movements. For example, quarter notes would be taught as “walking notes”. After familiarity with associated movements, note names are then introduced.
* Storytelling: The teacher invents a story or uses a familiar storyline to incorporate rhythmic concepts
* Ball games: Students pass a ball around in different ways, exploring naturally occurring rhythm and developing motor skills
* Games with sticks: The students jump across a series of sticks on the floor, learning to coordinate body parts and their associated rhythm.
* Drum activities: The students participate with small drums, getting to reproduce rhythm in an instrumental context

Ages 7+ (activities can be adapted to different age groups) 
* Swings: The teacher plays music improvised in a preset metrical pattern. The students use prescribed body motions to determine the pattern.
* Rhythmic dictation: The teacher plays a number of measures of music repeatedly, the rhythm of which the students dictate.
* Rhythms: Students clap or step a predetermined rhythmic pattern. The teacher can experiment with augmentation and diminution.
* Small group activities: Students work together in small groups to accomplish rhythmic tasks, encouraging cooperation. 
* Ball games: Students pass a ball around in different ways, exploring naturally occurring rhythm and developing motor skills.
* Tempos: Students work to discover different tempos that can be applied to classical repertoire, familiar songs, or everyday movements. The teacher can also lead in experimenting with tempo relationships and adjustment.
* Polyrhythms: The teacher establishes two rhythms to be performed at once, one in the hands and one in the feet.
* Cross rhythms:  Students produce one even rhythm in the hands against another even rhythm in the feet. The teacher prompts them to switch which rhythm is produced in each body part.
* “Cosmic Whole Note”: Students listen to a slow pulse (an example would be 6 beats per minute), subdivide the space between sounds, and predict when the next pulse sounds by clapping.
* Canon: Students listen to rhythmic vocabulary performed by the teacher and step this vocabulary in canon. This activity can be executed in a variety of meters. 
* “Microbeats”: Students learn syllables to represent 1-9 subdivisions of a beat. Associated activities could include performing microbeats in prescribed patterns, at varying tempi, in canon, or as sight-reading.

==Effectiveness of Dalcroze eurhythmics==
A group of 72 pre-school children were tested on their rhythmic ability; half of the children had free-play (35–40 min.) twice a week for a 10-week period while the other half had rhythmic movement classes for the same amount of time. The group that had classes (experimental group) did significantly better than the group that just had free-play (control group). The experiment group scored four or more points better in every area tested than the control group in the final test. This shows that eurhythmic classes can benefit a child’s sense of rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;Zachopoulou, Evridiki, Vassiliki Drri, Dimitris Chatzopoulou, Theordoros Elinoudis.

'''e-engineering''' is a concept that results from the concatenation of two previous ideas: [[distance learning]] and [[remote laboratories]].
Distance learning education has been around since the XIX century when the development of the mail services in England enabled the delivering of correspondence courses by mail. In the second half of the XX century, audio and television players where the first technological means used to deliver new, more engaging distance learning courses. And despite keeping the same way to communicate with students, the now more fast and reliable postal services, the materials were then much more diversified, ranging from carefully constructed texts and audio and video records to conventional broadcast radio and television, in this case, open to all, students and non-students. These were complemented by live individual or group sessions over the phone, between instructor and students, or among students, enabling real interactive teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;Gericota M. et al. "Combining E-Technologies &amp; E-Pedagogies to Create Online Undergraduate Courses in Engineering – an Example of a Successful Experience". ''Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies'', Barcelona, July 2016, pp 4209-4218.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the breakthrough that represents a true turning point in distance learning was the introduction of the concept of e-learning during the 90s, boosted by the two most significant advances in the telecommunications area – the Internet network and the invention of the World Wide Web. With the Internet a fast, reliable and interactive channel of communication between instructor and students or among students was now available, enabling a degree of interaction never achieved before in distance learning and comparable to face-to-face classes. On the other hand, the World Wide Web with its hypertext links enabled the construction of much more diversified and engaging materials, supported by audio, image, and video, readily available and highly interactive. This revolution was accompanied by the massification of personal computers, which made them accessible and affordable. In a decade, from 1990 to 2000, these very expensive machines, complicated to operate and whose access was almost restricted to scientist and engineers and to technical university students, became an indispensable household equipment.
In spite of all these advances, the undergraduate courses on offer were nevertheless restricted. Engineering courses which require the access to specific chemistry, physics, mechanics, electrical machines, electronics or optics laboratories and real-time interaction with equipment and instrumentation, where not available at distance.
This reality is changing due to the creation of remotely accessible laboratories that enable students to perform hands-on lab work remotely, with a level of interactivity and realism never achieved before. A lot of work is being done in the past decade in the area of remote laboratories. In the specialized literature, it is possible to find many examples of different labs for different areas of physics and electrical engineering,&lt;ref&gt;Farah, S., A. Benachenhou, G. Neveux and D. Barataud. "Design of a Flexible Hardware Interface for Multiple Remote Electronic Practical Experiments of Virtual Laboratory". ''International Journal of Online Engineering'' 8(2), pp. 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Priem,F., R. De Craemer, J. Calu, F. Pedreschi, T. Zimmer, S. Saïghi and J. Lilja. "E-Learning in Science and Technology via a Common Learning Platform in a Lifelong Learning Project". ''European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning'' (1), 24 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sousa, N., G. R. Alves and M. Gericota. "An Integrated Reusable Remote Laboratory to Complement Electronics Teaching". ''IEEE Trans. on Learning Technologies'' 3(3), pp. 265-271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gravier, C., J. Fayolle, B. Bayard, M. Ates and J. Lardon. "State of the Art About Remote Laboratories Paradigms – Foundations of Ongoing Mutations". ''International Journal of Online Engineering'' 4(1), pp. 19-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tawfik, M., E. Sancristobal, S. Martin, G. Diaz and M. Castro. "State-of-the-art remote laboratories for industrial electronics applications". ''Proc. Technologies Applied to Electronics Teaching'', pp. 359-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albu, M. M., K. E. Holbert, G. T. Heydt, S. Dan Grigorescu and V. Truşcă. "Embedding Remote Experimentation in Power Engineering Education". ''IEEE Trans. on Power Systems'' 19(1), pp. 139-143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hercog, D., B. Gergič, S. Uran, K. Jezernik. "A DSP-Based Remote Control Laboratory". ''IEEE Trans. on Industrial Electronics'' 54(6), pp. 3057-3068.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restivo, M. T., J. Mendes, A. M. Lopes, C. M. Silva and F. Chouzal. "A Remote Laboratory in Engineering Measurement". ''IEEE Trans. on Industrial Electronics'' 56(12), pp. 4836-4843.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García-Zubia, J., I. Angulo, J. Irurzun, P. Orduña, J. Ruiz, U. Hernández, M. Castro and E. Sancristobal. "Easily Integrable Platform for the Deployment of a Remote Laboratory for Microcontrollers". ''International Journal of Online Engineering'' 6(3), pp. 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso, A. and P. Gil. "Online Learning in Engineering Courses Using Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks". ''International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy'' 3(1), pp. 76-80.&lt;/ref&gt; each one allowing different degrees of freedom in the configuration of the experiment by the remote user. 
The integration of these remote laboratories as part of fully online undergraduate programs in engineering areas enabled the creation of e-engineering courses. These are e-learning courses in engineering areas where students perform their hands-on laboratory work remotely interacting in real-time with equipment and instrumentation available online 24/7.
The first example of one such course is the L3-EOLES (Electronics and Optics e-Learning for Embedded Systems) course, an entirely online English-taught 3rd year bachelor's degree in Electronics and Optics for Embedded Systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gericota M. et al. "EOLES course - The first accredited online degree course in Electronics and Optics for Embedded Systems". ''Proceedings of the IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference'', Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia, March 2015, pp 410-417.&lt;/ref&gt; The course, that started being offered in the school year 2014/15, is currently in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;Andrieu G. et al. "Overview of the first year of the L3-EOLES training", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation'', Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia, Madrid, February 2016, pp 396-399.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed as a specialization year, this course is oriented towards a currently expanding field in the electrical and computer engineering area, the field of electronics and optics for embedded systems. This area of knowledge requires students to be able to perform experimental work to acquire the expected technical experimental skills. The execution of laboratory assignments over the Internet required the development of remotely accessible experimental laboratories enabling students to interact in real-time with real experimental setups. This innovative training has been accredited by the educational authorities in Tunisia, Morocco, and France.&lt;ref&gt;E-learning tools. L3-EOLES - The university of future at home!

Stavrakopoulou has served as writer and presenter for a number of media productions relating to her scholarly interests. She contributed to [[Channel 4]]'s series ''The Bible: A History'' (2010), regarding the historicity of [[Moses]].&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt; Her first primetime presentation was a three-part television series for the [[BBC2]] ''The Bible's Buried Secrets'' (2011;&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;&lt;ref name = RobertsRevoir_9Mar11/&gt; not to be confused with [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'s 2008 [[The Bible's Buried Secrets|programme of the same name]]).&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;

These popular presentations, while being widely presented (e.g., the [[BBC2]] production has been appearing in the U.S. as an offering of [[PBS]] stations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wycc.org/schedule/#page=search&amp;day=20160330&amp;provider=Broadcast&amp;search=Did%20King%20David's%20Empire%20Exist%3F&amp;sorted=relevance|title=WYCC PBS Chicago - Schedule|author= WYCC Staff | date= 2016-04-03 | work=WYCC PBS Chicago | access-date=4 April 2016}}{{better source|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2016}}), have met with mixed and some skeptical reviews, both in the U.K. popular press,&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;&lt;ref name = RobertsRevoir_9Mar11/&gt; and more broadly.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lucie-Smith, Alexander | date = 2011-03-23 | title=Theologians ought to love this BBC series on the Bible. Too bad it gives in to Dan Brown-style silliness | journal = [[The Catholic Herald]] | url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2011/03/23/theologians-ought-to-love-this-bbc-series-on-the-bible-too-bad-it-gives-in-to-dan-brown-style-silliness/ | access-date=17 March 2011 | quote = [Quoting subtitle, etc.] &lt;small&gt;In its closing moments the episode last night gave up fact for opinion. / …in the closing moments of the programme that scholarship seemed to be given up in favour of what was, in fact, mere opinion. First, the doctor suggested that the cult of the angels and the saints in contemporary Christianity was a hangover from polytheism. This is completely false. The Blessed Virgin is not some sort of lineal descendant of Asherah. The Blessed Virgin is a human being, not a goddess; she represents all that humanity is called to be; if she loses her humanity, she would have no appeal to her fellow human beings. But Mary is one of us—that is the whole point of her. Second, the doctor suggested that monotheism presents God as exclusively male, and men thus like God, which leads to the marginalisation and repression of women.With a charge like this, where can one start? The polytheistic Greeks and Romans denied females all political rights, despite the fact that Athens was under the protection of the goddess Athene, and Rome under the protection of Juno. The Julio-Claudian rulers claimed descent from Venus, but were not noted for their feminism. The idea that polytheism is more friendly to women is simply unsupported by the facts. It is easy to claim and sounds good, but as a serious thesis, it deserves to be dismissed. How on earth did it find itself in what purported to be a serious programme about the Bible?&lt;/small&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr. Alexander Lucie-Smith, consulting editor of ''The Catholic Herald'' and theologian, said that the BBC's ''…Buried Secrets'' series "is the sort of television programme that theologians ought to cherish…".&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt; He complained that in the second episode of the production, which addresses the origins of monotheism, that "…in [its] closing moments… scholarship seemed to be given up in favour of… mere opinion"; he took issue with Stavrakopoulou's suggestion that contemporary Christianity's views of Mary, saints, and angels were a holdover from the polytheistic religions, and that monotheism's presentation of God as exclusively male led to the marginalisation and repression of women.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt; He argues that the polytheistic Greeks and Romans religions featured female deities, but the cultures themselves denied females all political rights.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt;

[[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]], Oriel &amp; Laing Professor of Interpretation [of biblical texts] at the [[University of Oxford]], in his ''Ethics in Ancient Israel'', comments thus on the conclusions and general disputes in one area that Stavrakopoulou is writing as theologian and historian:{{quote|[Stavrakopoulou] argues that the idea of the king and his entourage as worshipping in an official way—that is, in practice, in accordance with the kind of religious customs the prophets approved of—while the populace at large indulged in illicit cults, is wishful thinking. A particularly striking example is child sacrifice, which (she has argued) was regarded as normal by everyone in pre-exilic and exilic times, except prophets such as Jeremiah and Ezekial.&lt;ref&gt;On these points, Barton cites Stavrakopoulou's ''King Manasseh'' (2004) and her  "'Popular' Religion and 'Official' Religion: Practice, Perception, Portrayal" (in ''Religious Diversity,'' 2010), unfortunately, without page numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; And indeed the Old Testament itself, while strongly condemning such a practice, makes it abundantly clear that it was very common. The idea that it was popular rather than official reflects Old Testament condemnation, but probably not the reality on the ground at the time. Similarly, polytheism was fairly obviously common in pre-exilic Israel, but there is no particular reason to think it was more common among 'the people' than in the king's palace and, indeed, in the temple. / ''These matters are widely disputed,'' but so-called popular religion may well have been much nearer to official religion…&lt;ref name = BartonEthics2014&gt;{{cite book |  author = Barton, John | year = 2014 | title = Ethics in Ancient Israel | chapter =  | ref =  | location = Oxford, ENG | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0199660433 | pages = 88f  | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0199660433 | access-date = 3 April 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;While this excerpt is not entirely an independent view—[[John Barton (theologian)|Barton]] is a fellow, more senior [[Oxonian]] who has collaborated with Stavrakopoulous (see '''Books''' subsection above)—it nevertheless indicates, according to this sympathetic colleague, that there is no preponderance of academic opinion on this matter, about which Stavrakopoulous writes (i.e., it is, in Barton's representation, "widely disputed").&lt;/ref&gt; [break in paragraph indicated, emphasis regarding disputed nature of views, added]}}

Christopher B.

{{Antisemitism}}
This is a list of countries where [[antisemitic]] sentiment has been experienced. This list is organized by country.

==Africa==

===Algeria===
{{Further|History of the Jews in Algeria}}
Upon independence in 1962 only Muslims were permitted [[Algeria]]n citizenship, and 95% of Algeria's 140,000 Jewish population left. Since 1870 (briefly revoked by Vichy France in 1940), most Jews in Algeria had French citizenship, and they mainly went to [[France]], with some going to [[Israel]].

After [[Houari Boumediene]] came to power in 1965, the remaining Jews were persecuted, facing social and political discrimination and heavy taxes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1967-68 the government seized all but one of the country's synagogues and converted them to mosques.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} By 1969, fewer than 1,000 Jews were still living in Algeria,&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Algeria.html "Algeria"], Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; and only 50 Jews remained in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="JVL" /&gt;

===Egypt===
{{Further|Antisemitism in the Arab world#Egypt|History of the Jews in Egypt}}
Professor Peter Schafer of the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie University of Berlin]] has argued that antisemitism was first spread by "the [[Greeks|Greek]] retelling of ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] prejudices". In view of the anti-Jewish writings of the Egyptian priest [[Manetho]], Schafer suggests that antisemitism may have emerged "in Egypt alone".&lt;ref name=Schafer&gt;Schafer, Peter. ''Judeophobia'', Harvard University Press, 1997, p 208.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1st century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/josephus/works/files/apion-1.htm ''Against Apion''] Bk 1.14, 1.26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manetho]], a [[Hellenistic]] [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] chronicler and priest, in his books on Egyptian history, alleges that in the 3rd century BCE, [[Moses]] was not a Jew, but an Egyptian renegade priest called [[Osarseph]], and portrays the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] as the expulsion of a [[leper]] colony. Josephus argues that Manetho's claims are inconsistent.

In 629 the Roman emperor [[Heraclius|Heraclius I]]. had driven the Jews from Jerusalem. This was followed by a massacre of Jews throughout the empire—in Egypt, aided by the Copts, who had old scores to settle with the Jews, dating from the Persian conquest of Alexandria at the time of Byzantine Emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] (502) and of the Persian general [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan|Shahin]] (617), when the Jews assisted the conquerors in fighting against the Christians.

The mad [[caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Al-Ḥakim]] (996-1020) vigorously applied the [[Pact of Omar]], and compelled the Jews to wear bells and to carry in public the wooden image of a calf. A street in the city, Al-Jaudariyyah, was inhabited by Jews. Al-Ḥakim, hearing that they were accustomed to mock him in verses, had the whole quarter burned down.

Under the [[Bahri dynasty]] (1250–1390), one of the M[[Mamelukes|amluk]] dynasties, the Jews led a comparatively quiet existence; though they had at times to contribute heavily toward the maintenance of the vast military equipment, and were harassed by the cadis and ulemas of these strict Muslims. [[Al-Maqrizi]] relates that the first great Mameluke, Sultan [[Baibars]] (Al-Malik al-Thahir (1260–77), doubled the tribute paid by the "ahl al-dhimmah." At one time he had resolved to burn all the Jews, a ditch having been dug for that purpose; but at the last moment he repented, and instead exacted a heavy tribute, during the collection of which many perished.

In 1324 the Jews were accused of [[arson]] at [[Fostat]] and Cairo; they had to exculpate themselves by a payment of 50,000 gold pieces. Under the [[Burji dynasty|Burji]] Mamelukes the [[Franks]] again attacked Alexandria (1416), and the laws against the Jews were once more strictly enforced by Sheik al-Mu'ayyid (1412–21); by Ashraf Bars Bey (1422–38), because of a plague which decimated the population in 1438; by Al-Ẓahir Jaḳmaḳ (1438–53); and by Ḳa'iṭ-Bey (1468–95). The lastnamed is referred to by Obadiah of Bertinoro.&lt;ref&gt;Obadiah of Bertinoro p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of Cairo were compelled to pay 75,000 gold pieces.

In 1948, approximately 75,000 Jews lived in [[Egypt]]. About 100 remain today, mostly in [[Cairo]]. In 1948, Jewish neighborhoods in Cairo suffered bomb attacks that killed at least 70 Jews. Hundreds of Jews were arrested and had their property confiscated. The 1954 [[Lavon Affair]], in which Israelis and Egyptian Jews were arrested for bombing Egyptian and American targets served as a pretext for further persecution of the remaining Jewish community in Egypt. After the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], Egypt expelled over 25,000 Jews, confiscated their property, and about 3,000 were imprisoned. About 1,000 more were imprisoned or detained. In 1967, Jews were detained and tortured, and Jewish homes were confiscated as emigration continued.

Egypt was once home of one of the most dynamic Jewish communities in their diaspora. Caliphs in the ninth-eleventh centuries CE exercised various repressive policies, culminating in the destruction and mass murder of the Jewish quarter in Cairo in 1012. Conditions varied between then and the advent of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517, when they deteriorated again. There were at least six blood libel persecutions in cities between 1870 and 1892.

In more recent times, the fraudulent ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' have been published and promoted as though they were authentic historical records, fueling antisemitic sentiments in Egyptian public opinion.

Also recently published in Egypt, has been [[Henry Ford]]'s antisemitic treatise, [[The International Jew]], with distinctly antisemitic imagery on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intelligence.org.il/eng/sib/4_04/as_egypt.htm Examples of antisemitism in the Arab and Muslim world] on intelligence.org.il, site of the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center

===Libya===
{{Further|History of the Jews in Libya}}
The area now known as Libya was the home of one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to at least 300 BCE.

The Shoah (Hebrew word for catastrophe; genocide of the Jews during World War II): In the late 1930s, the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime began passing antisemitic laws. As a result of these laws, Jews were fired from government jobs, some were dismissed from government schools, and their citizenship papers were stamped with the words "Jewish race." Despite this repression, 25% of the population of Tripoli was still Jewish in 1941 and 44 synagogues were maintained in the city. In 1942, German troops fighting the Allies in North Africa occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished.

In 1948, about 38,000 Jews lived there.

A series of pogroms started in November 1945, when more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted. The pogroms continued in June 1948, when 15 Jews were killed and 280 Jewish homes destroyed.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews cancelled.

Although the main synagogue in Tripoli was renovated in 1999, it has not reopened for services. The last Jew in Libya, [[Esmeralda Meghnagi]] died in February 2002. Israel is home to about 40,000 Jews of Libyan descent, who maintain unique traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/JewsofLibya/LibyanJews/thejews.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718035942/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/JewsofLibya/LibyanJews/thejews.html |archivedate=2006-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/libyajews.html Jews of Libya&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morocco ===
{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}

[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of 6,000 Jews in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and [[Marrakesh]] in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232)&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morocco"&gt;For the events of Fez see Cohen, 1995, pp 180-182. On Marrekesh, see the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' of 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years. During the 13th through the 15th centuries Jews were appointed to a few prominent positions within the government, typically to implement decisions. A number of Jews, fleeing the expulsion from [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], settled in Morocco in the 15th century and afterwards, many moving on to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The imposition of a French protectorate in 1912 alleviated much of the discrimination.

The Shoah in French Morocco. While the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime during [[World War II]] passed discriminatory laws against Jews, [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Muhammad]] prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)

In 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now, mostly in [[Casablanca]], but also in Fez and other cities.

In June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:

: ''...These Jews constitute the best and most suitable human element for settlement in Israel's absorption centers. There were many positive aspects which I found among them: first and foremost, they all know (their agricultural) tasks, and their transfer to agricultural work in Israel will not involve physical and mental difficulties. They are satisfied with few (material needs), which will enable them to confront their early economic problems.'' (Yehuda Grinker (an organizer of Jewish emigration from the Atlas), The Emigration of Atlas Jews to Israel, Tel Aviv, The Association of Moroccan Immigrants in Israel, 1973.[http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration12.htm])

In 1955, Morocco attained independence. Jews occupied several political positions, including three Members of Parliament and a Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. However, emigration to Israel jumped from 8,171 in 1954 to 24,994 in 1955, increasing further in 1956. Beginning in 1956, emigration to [[Israel]] was prohibited until 1963, when it resumed.[http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm] In 1961, the government informally relaxed the laws on emigration to Israel; over the three following years, more than 80,000 Moroccan Jews emigrated there. By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.

The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to [[Europe]] and [[North America]] rather than [[Israel]].

Despite their current small numbers, Jews continue to play a notable role in Morocco; the king retains a Jewish senior adviser, [[André Azoulay]], and Jewish schools and synagogues receive government subsidies. However, Jewish targets have sometimes been attacked (notably in [[Al-Qaeda]]'s bombing of a Jewish community center in [[Casablanca]], see [[2003 Casablanca bombings|Casablanca Attacks]]), and there is sporadic antisemitic rhetoric from radical Islamist groups. Late King [[Hassan II]]'s invitations for Jews to return have not been taken up by the people who emigrated.

=== South Africa ===
{{Further|History of the Jews in South Africa}}
While [[South Africa]] is better known for the [[apartheid]] system of [[racial discrimination]] against blacks, antisemitism has been a feature of that country's history since Europeans first set foot ashore on the [[Cape Peninsula]]. In the years 1652-1795 - a period twice as long as the 20th century reign of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] - Jews were not allowed to settle at the Cape. Subsequent [[Cape Colony|Cape administrations]] - [[Batavian Republic|Batavian]] and British - were more progressive. An 1868 Act would sanction religious discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Milton | first =Shain | title =The roots of antisemitism in South Africa | publisher =Wiwatersrand University Press | year =1994 | location =Johannesburg | pages =9–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although antisemitism did not disappear in the 19th century, it would reach its apotheosis in the years leading up to [[World War II]]. Inspired by the rise of [[national socialism]] in [[Germany]] the [[Ossewabrandwag]] (OB) - whose membership accounted for almost 25% of the 1940 [[Afrikaner]] population - and the National Party faction ''New Order'' would champion a more programmatic solution to the 'Jewish problem'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/23.htm South Africa - The Impact of World War II&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] reports that these two groups advocated three mechanisms: Jews who had entered the country after 1933 were to be repatriated; Jews who had arrived prior to 1933 would be regarded as foreign nationals; lastly, a system regulating Jewish numbers in business and the professions would be instituted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&amp;b=700897 Annual 4 Chapter 8 Part 2 - Simon Wiesenthal Center Multimedia Learning Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The same report lists some of the reasons South African gentiles gave for disliking Jews: too many of them in commerce and professions; profiteering; black market offences; loud and ostentatious; are apart and different; buy up the land; and most communists are Jews.

=== Tunisia ===
{{Further|History of the Jews in Tunisia}}

Jews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2300 years. In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.

The Shoah in French Tunisia. Tunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.

In 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. About 1,500 remain today, mostly in [[Djerba]], [[Tunis]], and [[Zarzis]]. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated. There were also attacks in 1982, 1985, and most recently in 2002 when a bomb in [[Djerba]] took 21 lives (most of them German tourists) near the local synagogue, in a terrorist attack claimed by [[Al-Qaeda]].

The Tunisian government makes an active effort to protect its Jewish minority now and visibly supports its institutions.

[[Bahrain]]'s tiny Jewish community, mostly the descendants of immigrants who entered the country in the early 1900s from Iraq, numbered 600 in 1948.

Relations between Jews and Muslims are generally considered good, with Bahrain being the only state on the Arabian Peninsula where there is a specific Jewish community and the only Gulf state with a synagogue. One member of the community, Rouben Rouben, who sells electronics and appliances from his downtown showroom, said “95 percent of my customers are Bahrainis, and the government is our No. 1 corporate customer. I’ve never felt any kind of discrimination.”&lt;ref name=Luxner/&gt;

Members play a prominent role in civil society: Ebrahim Nono was appointed in 2002 a member of Bahrain's upper house of parliament, the [[Consultative Council]], while a Jewish woman heads a human rights group, the [[Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society]].

India is home to several communities of [[Indian Jews|Jews]]. Over the course of the twentieth century, several important Hindu leaders, scholars and politicians, such as [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]], [[Sita Ram Goel]], [[Arun Shourie]] and others have vocally condemned antisemitism and have expressed support for Israel and the Jewish right to self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsf.org.uk/images/stories/HinduDharma/Interfaith/hinduzion.pdf |title=Hindu Pro-Zionism |accessdate=April 23, 2006 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423090103/http://www.nhsf.org.uk/images/stories/HinduDharma/Interfaith/hinduzion.pdf |archivedate=April 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antisemitism first came to India with the Portuguese Christian Missionaries in the 16th century. [[Christianity and antisemitism#Christian antisemitism in India|Christian antisemitism in India]] manifested itself through the [[Goa Inquisition]] that resulted in the depopulation of the Jews in [[Goa]], and the persecution of South Indian Jews by the Portuguese in [[Kerala]].

===Iraq===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2008}}
{{Further|History of the Jews in Iraq}}

During the [[Sassanid]] rule over [[Assyria]] ([[Assuristan]]) (225 to 634) both  [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians and Jews suffered occasional persecution, especially under Sassanian high-priest [[Kartir]]. The first legal expression of [[Islam]] toward the [[Jews]], Assyrian [[Christians]], [[Mandeans]] and [[Zoroastrians]] after the conquests of the 630s were the poll-tax ("[[jizyah]]"), the tax upon real estate ("kharaj") was instituted.

The [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]], [[Umar II]]. (717-720), persecuted the Jews. He issued orders to his governors: "Tear down no church, synagogue, or fire-temple; but permit no new ones to be built". It is said that the law requiring Jews to wear a yellow badge upon their clothing originated with Harun.

Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in Muslim countries. In 1828, there was a massacre of Jews in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=Morris10 /&gt;

In 1948, there were approximately 150,000 [[Jew]]s in [[Iraq]]. In 2003, there were 100 left, though there are reports that small numbers of Jews are returning in the wake of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

In 1941, following [[Rashid Ali]]'s pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] coup, riots known as the ''[[Farhud]]'' broke out in [[Baghdad]] in which approximately 200 Jews were murdered (some sources put the number higher), and up to 2,000 injured.

Like most [[Arab League]] states, Iraq forbade the emigration of its Jews for a few years after the 1948 war on the grounds that allowing them to go to Israel would strengthen that state. However, intense diplomatic pressure brought about a change of mind. At the same time, increasing government oppression of the Jews fueled by anti-Israeli sentiment, together with public expressions of antisemitism, created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

In March 1950, Iraq passed a law of one-year duration allowing Jews to emigrate on condition of relinquishing their Iraqi citizenship. Iraq apparently believed it would rid itself of those Jews it regarded as the most troublesome, especially the Zionists, but retain the wealthy minority who played an important part in the Iraqi economy. Israel mounted an operation called "[[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah|Ezra and Nehemiah]]" to bring as many of the Iraqi Jews as possible to Israel, and sent agents to Iraq to urge the Jews to register for immigration as soon as possible.

The initial rate of registration accelerated after a bomb injured three Jews at a café. Two months before the expiry of the law, by which time about 85,000 Jews had registered, a bomb at the Masuda Shemtov [[Synagogue]] killed three or five Jews and injured many. The law expired in March 1951, but was later extended after the Iraqi government froze the assets of departing Jews (including those already left). During the next few months, all but a few thousand of the remaining Jews registered for emigration, spurred on by a sequence of bombings that caused few casualties but had great psychological impact. In total, about 120,000 Jews left Iraq.

In May and June 1951, the arms caches of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] underground in Iraq, which had been supplied from Palestine/Israel since the [[Farhud]] of 1942, were discovered. Many Jews were arrested and two Zionist activists, Yusuf Basri and Ibrahim Salih, were tried and hanged for three of the bombings. A secret Israeli inquiry in 1960 reported that most of the witnesses believed that Jews had been responsible for the bombings, but found no evidence that they were ordered by Israel. The issue remains unresolved: Iraqi activists in Israel still regularly charge that Israel used violence to engineer the exodus, while Israeli officials of the time vehemently deny it. According to historian Moshe Gatt, few historians believe that Israel was actually behind the bombing campaign—based on factors such as records indicating that Israel did not want such a rapid registration rate and that bomb throwing at Jewish targets was common before 1950, making the Istiqlal Party a more likely culprit than the Zionist underground. In any case, the remainder of Iraq's Jews left over the next few decades, and had mostly gone by 1970.

===Japan===
{{Main|Antisemitism in Japan}}
[[Japan]] has no native Jewish population; therefore any anti-Semitism would seem to date from a point when it was introduced by western contact. Nazi ideology and propaganda left its influence on Japan during World War II, and the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' were subsequently translated into Japanese. Today, antisemitism and belief in Jewish manipulation of Japan and the world remains despite the small size of the Jewish community in Japan. Books about Jewish conspiracies are best sellers. According to a 1988 survey, 8% of Japanese have read one of these books.&lt;ref name=kowner&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kowner|first1=Rotem|title=On Ignorance, Respect and Suspicion: Current Japanese Attitudes toward Jews|url=http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/11kowner.htm|website=The Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism|publisher=The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem|accessdate=23 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111213321/http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/11kowner.htm|archivedate=11 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===
{{Further|History of the Jews in Syria|Antisemitism in the Arab world#Syria}}
In Roman times about 10,000 Jews lived at [[Damascus]], governed by an [[ethnarch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/acts/9-2.htm Acts 9-2]; [http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/9-32 II Cor. 9-32] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707063149/http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/9-32 |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the conflicts between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]] the city frequently suffered heavily. When Syria was conquered by the Persians (614), the Jews of Damascus, profiting by the presence of the invaders, joined with their coreligionists of Palestine to take vengeance on the Christians, especially those of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. During the [[Crusades]], a large number of Palestinian Jews sought refuge at Damascus from the enormous taxes imposed upon them by the Crusaders, thus increasing the community.

During the nineteenth century the Jews of Damascus were several times made the victims of calumnies, the gravest being those of 1840 and 1860, in the reign of the sultan [[Abdülmecit I]]. That of 1840, commonly known as the [[Damascus affair]], was an accusation of [[Blood libel against Jews|ritual murder]] brought against the Jews in connection with the death of Father Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla66/papers/106-144e.htm The Origins and the Development of German-Jewish Press in Germany till 1850] by Johannes Valentin Schwarz.

Five hundred Muslims, who had been involved in the affair, were hanged by the grand vizier [[Keçecizade Mehmet Fuat Pasha|Fuad Pasha]]. Two hundred Jews were awaiting the same fate, in spite of their innocence, and the whole Jewish community had been fined 4,000,000 piastres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=ia&amp;ID=IA9902 The Damascus Blood Libel (1840) as Told by Syria's Minister of Defense, Mustafa Tlass] (MEMRI Inquiry and Analysis Series - No. 99) June 27, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The condemned Jews were saved only by the official intervention of Fuad Pasha himself; that of the Prussian consul, Dr. Wetzstein; of Sir [[Moses Montefiore]] of London, and of the bankers [[Abraham Salomon Camondo]] of Constantinople and Shemaya Angel of Damascus. From that time to the end of the nineteenth century, several further blood accusations were brought against the Jews; these, however, never provoked any great excitement.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179/&gt;

There is a tiny Syrian [[Jewish]] community that is confined mainly to Damascus; remnants of a formerly 40,000 strong community. After the [[1947 UN Partition plan]] in Palestine, there were heavy [[pogroms]] against Jews in Damascus and Aleppo. The Jewish property was confiscated or burned and after the establishment of the State of [[Israel]], many fled to Israel and only 5000 Jews were left in Syria. Of these, 4000 more left after agreement with the United States in the 1990s. As of 2006, there are only 100-200 Jews left in Syria.

Rioters in Aleppo in 1947 burned the city's Jewish quarter and killed 75 people.&lt;ref name="Pipes"&gt;Daniel Pipes, Greater Syria: The History of an Ambition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990) p. 57, records 75 victims of the Aleppo massacre.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, there were approximately 30,000 Jews in [[Syria]]. The Syrian government placed severe restrictions on the Jewish community, including on emigration. Over the next decades, many Jews managed to escape, and the work of supporters, particularly [[Judy Feld Carr]],&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;Levin, 2001, pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt; in smuggling Jews out of Syria, and bringing their plight to the attention of the world, raised awareness of their situation. Following the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]] the [[United States]] put pressure on the Syrian government to ease its restrictions on Jews, and, in 1992, the government of Syria began granting exit visas to Jews on condition that they not emigrate to [[Israel]]. At that time, the country had several thousand Jews; today, under a hundred remain. The rest of the Jewish community have emigrated, mostly to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. There is a large and vibrant Syrian Jewish community in South [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 2004, the Syrian government attempted to establish better relations with the emigrants, and 12 Syrian-Jews visited Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/L/Joshua.M.Landis-1/syriablog/2005/10/jews-of-syria-by-robert-tuttle.htm SyriaComment.com: "The Jews of Syria," By Robert Tuttle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same vein, the 2005 bestselling book ''[[Metal fırtına]]'', which depicts a fictional war between Turkey and the United States, is described by the author, in an interview with ''[[Vatan]]'', as helping people understand the realities behind Israel and the Jews, and would see how the Jews betrayed Turkey.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2005/turkey.htm Antisemitism And Racism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60wMfwKs4?url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2005/turkey.htm |date=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact reason for the book's popularity is uncertain, it may reflect anger over the treatment of fellow Muslim in Palestine by Israelis, anti-western sentiments caused by the war in Iraq, or simply backlash caused by Turkey's bid to join the [[European Union]].

Antisemitic sentiments have also been observed in the Turkish media, such as in the nationalist ''Ortadogu'', where Selcuk Duzgun, in an article titled ''Here is the Real Jew'' stated: "We are surrounded. Wherever we look we see traitors. Wherever we turn we see impure, false converts. Whichever stone you turn over, there is a Jew under it. And we keep thinking to ourselves: Hitler did not do enough to these Jews."

In the ''[[Milli Gazete]]'', Turkish author [[Hakan Albayrak]] wrote an article accusing the Israeli Government of Genocide and stating Zionism itself constituted genocide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; On 8 January the Islamist daily [[Yeni Şafak]], published an article which alleged that the Israeli Government was attempting to set up farms in southeastern Turkey, and populate them with Russian and Ethiopian Jews whose integration into Israel they found difficult. In 2005, it was reported by journalists such as Ayhan Bilgin in ''[[Vakit]]'', that the Mossad and Israel were responsible for planting mines which killed Turkish soldiers in southeast Turkey. Such claims have created a very negative atmosphere against Israelis and Turkish Jews. Antisemitism has also recently been observed in the publications ''[[Anadoluda Vakit]]'' and ''[[Yeniçağ]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Several antisemitic [[conspiracy theories]] from Islamists and ultra-nationalists in Turkey have attempted to demonize Jews and Israel. These theories have been fed in part by [[Israel–Turkey relations|Turkish–Israeli]] arms modernization projects, agricultural projects in southeast Turkey connected to the [[South-East Anatolia Agricultural Irrigation Project]], which employ Israeli experts; mutual visits of Turkish and Israeli officials; and the alleged role of the [[Mossad]] in northern Iraq (the [[Iraq War]] was highly unpopular in Turkey) making statements such as "The Mossad is the boss in Northern Iraq" have all nourished these theories. The common conspiracy theory that Jews, the supposed chosen people who consider themselves superior, are trying to take over the world by creating internal problems has also been cited by Turkish newspapers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The well-known Turkish novelist [[Orhan Pamuk]], often criticized and accused of being a traitor due to his interpretation of certain events in Turkish history, has been criticized as being "the servant of Jews," and "a Jew-lover" by the ultra-nationalist newspaper ''[[Yeniçağ]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

{{Further|Yemenite Jews|Antisemitism in Yemen}}
Including [[Aden]], there were about 63,000 Jews in [[Yemen]] in 1948. Today, there are about 50 left. In 1947, riots killed at least 80 Jews in Aden. Increasingly hostile conditions led to the Israeli government's [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]], the evacuation of 50,000 Jews from Yemen to Israel in 1949 and 1950. Emigration continued until 1962, when the civil war in Yemen broke out. A small community remained unknown until 1976, but it appears that all infrastructure is lost now.

Jews in Yemen were long subject to a number of restrictions, ranging from attire, hairstyle, home ownership, marriage, etc. Under the [[Orphans' Decree|"Orphan's Decree"]], many Jewish orphans below puberty were raised as Muslims. This practice began in the late 18th century, was suspended under Ottoman rule, then was revived in 1918. Most cases occurred in the 1920s, but sporadic cases occurred until the 1940s. In later years, the Yemenite government has taken some steps to protect the Jewish community in their country.

==Europe==
{{Main|Antisemitism in Europe}}

The summary of a 2004 poll by the "[[Pew Global Attitudes Project]]" noted, "Despite concerns about rising antisemitism in Europe, there are no indications that anti-Jewish sentiment has increased over the past decade. Favorable ratings of Jews are actually higher now in France, Germany and Russia than they were in 1991. Nonetheless, Jews are better liked in the U.S. than in Germany and Russia."&lt;ref name=Pew&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=206 "A Year After Iraq War: Mistrust of America in Europe Even Higher, Muslim Anger Persists"], [[Pew Research Center|Pew Global Attitudes Project]], accessed March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to 2005 survey results by the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]],&lt;ref name=ADL2&gt;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASInt_13/4726_13.htm "ADL Survey in 12 European Countries Finds Antisemitic Attitudes Still Strongly Held"], [[Anti-Defamation League]], 2005, accessed March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; antisemitic attitudes remain common in Europe. Over 30% of those surveyed indicated that Jews have too much power in business, with responses ranging from lows of 11% [[#Denmark|in Denmark]] and 14% [[#United Kingdom|in England]] to highs of 66% [[#Hungary|in Hungary]], and over 40% [[#Poland|in Poland]] and [[#Spain|Spain]]. The results of religious antisemitism also linger and over 20% of European respondents agreed that Jews were [[deicide|responsible for the death of Jesus]], with France having the lowest percentage at 13% and Poland having the highest number of those agreeing, at 39%.&lt;ref name=flashmap&gt;[http://www.philosophistry.com/specials/europe/question_1.html Flash Map of Attitudes Toward Jews in 12 European Countries (2005)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415030419/http://www.philosophistry.com/specials/europe/question_1.html |date=2008-04-15 }}, Philo. Sophistry, accessed March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vienna-based [[European Union Monitoring Centre]] (EUMC), for 2002 and 2003, identified France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands as EU member countries with notable increases in incidents. Many of these incidents can be linked to immigrant communities in these countries and result from heightened tensions in the Middle East. As these nations keep reliable and comprehensive statistics on antisemitic acts, and are engaged in combating antisemitism, their data was readily available to the EUMC. &lt;!--UNSOURCED: Governments and leading public figures condemned the violence, passed new legislation, and mounted positive law enforcement and educational efforts.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} --&gt;

In western Europe, traditional far-right groups still account for a significant proportion of the attacks against Jews and Jewish properties; disadvantaged and disaffected Muslim youths increasingly were responsible for most of the other incidents. In Eastern Europe, (despite having a larger native Muslim population), neo-Nazis, fascists and others members of the radical political fringe were responsible for most antisemitic incidents. Antisemitism remained a serious problem [[#Russia|in Russia]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} and [[#Belarus|Belarus]], and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, with most incidents carried out by ultra-nationalist and other far-right elements. The stereotype of Jews as manipulators of the global economy continues to provide fertile ground for antisemitic aggression.

{{Further|History of the Jews in the United States}}

In the mid-1600s, [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the last Dutch Director-General of the colony of [[New Amsterdam]], sought to bolster the position of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] by trying to reduce religious competition from denominations such as Jews, [[Lutheran]]s, Catholics and [[Quakers]]. He stated that the Jews were "deceitful", "very repugnant", and "hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of Christ". He warned in a subsequent letter that in "giving them liberty we cannot (then) refuse the Lutherans and Papists". However, religious plurality was already a legal-cultural tradition in New Amsterdam and in the [[Netherlands]]. His superiors at the [[Dutch West India Company]] in [[Amsterdam]] overruled him in all matters of intolerance.

In 1939 a [[Elmo Roper|Roper]] poll found that only thirty-nine percent of Americans felt that Jews should be treated like other people. Fifty-three percent believed that "Jews are different and should be restricted" and ten percent believed that Jews should be deported.&lt;ref name=Smitha&gt;Smitha, Frank E. [http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch22.htm "Roosevelt and Approaching War: The Economy, Politics and Questions of War, 1937-38"], accessed March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Several surveys taken from 1940 to 1946 found that Jews were seen as a greater threat to the welfare of the United States than any other national, religious, or racial group. [https://web.archive.org/web/20031028053419/http://etd-submit.etsu.edu/etd/theses/available/etd-0322102-113418/unrestricted/Greear040102.pdf#search='charles%20coughlin%20Jews']
It has been estimated that 190,000 - 200,000 Jews could have been saved during the [[Second World War]] had it not been
for bureaucratic obstacles to immigration deliberately created by [[Breckinridge Long]] and others.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/peopleevents/pandeAMEX90.html "Breckinridge Long (1881-1958)"], [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), accessed March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech at an [[America First Committee|America First]] rally on September 11, 1941 in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] entitled "Who Are the War Agitators?", [[Charles Lindbergh]] claimed that three groups had been "pressing this country toward war": the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] Administration, the [[United Kingdom|British]], and the Jews - and complained about what he insisted was the Jews' "large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/perilousfight/social/antisemitism/ PBC: The Perilous Fight. Antisemitism] Accessed October 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The antisemitism of Lindbergh is one of the subjects of the novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' (2004) by [[Philip Roth]].

Unofficial antisemitism was also widespread in the first half of the century. For example, to limit the growing number of Jewish students between 1919-1950s a number of private liberal arts universities and medical and dental schools employed [[Numerus clausus#Numerus clausus in the United States|Numerus clausus]]. These included [[Harvard University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Cornell University]], and [[Boston University]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. In 1925 [[Yale University]], which already had such admissions preferences as "character", "solidity", and "physical characteristics" added a program of [[legacy preference]] admission spots for children of Yale alumni, in an explicit attempt to put the brakes on the rising percentage of Jews in the student body. This was soon copied by other Ivy League and other schools{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, and admissions of Jews were kept down to 10% through the 1950s. Such policies were for the most part discarded during the early 1960s.

Some [[cult]]s also support conspiracy theories regarding Jews as dominating and taking over the world. These cults are often vitriolic and severely anti-semitic. For instance, the [[Necedah Shrine]] Cult from the 1950s on to the mid-1980s, has [[Mary Ann Van Hoof]] receiving antisemitic "visions" from the [[Virgin Mary]] telling her that the Rothschilds, a prominent Jewish banking family, are "mongrel yids(Jews)" bent on dominating the entire world economy through international banking. Most of the worlds problems, from poverty to world wars, are the cause of International Banking Jews and their "satanic secret society," according to Van Hoof.[http://www.jesusphoto.org/devilfish1.jpg]

American antisemitism underwent a modest revival in the late twentieth century. The [[Nation of Islam]] under [[Louis Farrakhan]] claimed that Jews were responsible for slavery, economic exploitation of black labor, selling alcohol and drugs in their communities, and unfair domination of the economy. [[Jesse Jackson]] issued his infamous "Hymietown" remarks during the 1984 Presidential primary campaign.

According to ADL surveys begun in 1964, African-Americans are "significantly more likely" than white Americans to hold antisemitic beliefs, although there is a strong correlation between education level and the rejection of anti-Semitic stereotypes.&lt;ref name=ADL&gt;[http://www.adl.org/antisemitism_survey/survey_print.asp "Anti-Semitism and Prejudice in America: Highlights from an ADL Survey - November 1998"], [[Anti-Defamation League]], accessed March 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eric Enstrom - Grace - bw.jpg|thumb|300px|Photograph with window light added to original.]]
'''''Grace''''' is a [[photograph]] by [[Eric Enstrom]]. It depicts an elderly man with hands folded, saying [[Grace (prayer)|a prayer over a table]] with a simple meal. In [[82nd Minnesota Legislature|2002]], an act of the [[Minnesota State Legislature]] established it as the state photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mn.gov/portal/about-minnesota/state-symbols/photograph.jsp |title=''Grace'', official state photograph |publisher=[[State of Minnesota]] |accessdate=Feb 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
The original photograph was taken at Enstrom's photography studio in [[Bovey, Minnesota]]. Most sources indicate 1918 as the year, though Enstrom's daughter Rhoda, born in 1917, claimed to remember being present when the photograph was taken, which might have been around 1920. The man depicted in the photograph is Charles Wilden, who earned a meager living as a [[peddler]] and lived in a [[sod house]]. While the photograph conveys a sense of piety, the book seen in the photo is actually a [[dictionary]] not a [[the Bible|Bible]],{{disputed inline|date=June 2018}} and local stories about Wilden "centered more around drinking and not accomplishing very much."&lt;ref name="grandforks"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee |first1=Stephen J. |title=Man in famous ''Grace'' photo mystifies historians |url=http://www.bakkentoday.com/event/article/id/230720/publisher_ID/40/ |work=Grand Folks Herald |date=27 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101163418/http://www.bakkentoday.com/event/article/id/230720/publisher_ID/40 |archivedate=1 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What happened to Wilden after the photograph is unknown. In 1926, he was paid $5 by Enstrom in return for waiving his rights to the photograph; he disappeared thereafter. After the photograph became popular Enstrom attempted to track Wilden down but was unsuccessful. Numerous family members and local historians have also attempted to determine what became of Wilden but have not been able to locate definitive evidence.&lt;ref name="grandforks" /&gt;

Enstrom first licensed the photograph to [[Augsburg Fortress]] in 1930. In the 1940s, his daughter, Rhoda Nyberg, [[hand-colouring of photographs|colorized]] the photo by hand. This version was featured in prints produced during the 1940s onward and became the more widespread and popularly known version of the photo.&lt;ref name=startribune&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Paul|title=Iron Range artist brought ''Grace'' photo to fame|url=http://www.startribune.com/iron-range-artist-brought-grace-photo-to-fame/140587173/|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enstrom earned a modest sum from the photograph for the remainder of his life until his death in 1968. Nyberg died in 2012.&lt;ref name="grandforks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=startribune/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 2014 the stage play ''Picturing Grace'' premiered,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Picturing Grace' has successful opening, looks forward to future audiences|url = http://www.grandrapidsmn.com/news/picturing-grace-has-successful-opening-looks-forward-to-future-audiences/article_046a0012-5490-11e4-b428-bb29a33f4e87.html|website = Grand Rapids Herald-Review|access-date = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which presents a dramatized retelling of the story behind the photograph, its photographer and subject. The play premiered in [[Itasca County, Minnesota|Itasca County]], the same region in which the photograph was captured.

SUNY Press.{{ISBN|0791439798}}. p.59&lt;/ref&gt; or '''hand partialism''' or also '''Quirofilia''' is the [[sexual fetish]] for hands. This may include the sexual attraction to a specific area such as the fingers, palm or [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]], or the attraction to a specific action performed by the hands; which may otherwise be considered non-sexual—such as washing or drying dishes. This fetish may manifest itself as a desire to experience physical interaction, or as a source of sexual fantasy.

Hand fetishism is recognized by the porn industry; however, it is one of the least common fetishes, despite [[foot fetishism]] being the most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studlife.com/scene/2009/11/04/foot-fetishes-fun-or-freaky/|title=Foot fetishes: Fun or freaky?|author=Moore, Lucy|date=November 4, 2009|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand fetishism is usually based in the biological indication that a partner is healthy and a good potential mate.

==Characteristics==
A hand fetish is a sexual attraction to the hands. This attraction is most commonly expressed with fingering, handjobs, sucking on the fingers and licking the palms.

Fingernail fetishism, a sub-type of hand fetishism is often expressed with scratching with the fingernails and painting the fingernails.

==Frequency==
In 2007, a study was conducted by the [[University of Bologna]] on around 5000 fetishist participants to see the prevalence of fetishes. The study analyzed the content inside online fetish communities and found only 669 participants referring to nails, an extension of hand fetishism.    This did not refer to fingernails specifically, and the amount of 669 was less than 1% of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drmarkgriffiths.wordpress.com/tag/hand-fetishism/|title=Handy crafts: A brief look at fingernail fetishes|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2016|author=Griffiths, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Regular_hexagon_as_intersection_of_two_triangles.png|thumb|A regular ''hexagram'', [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Two_dimensional_compounds|{6}[2{3}]{6}]], can be seen as a [[compound polygon|compound]] composed of an upwards (blue here) and downwards (pink) facing [[equilateral triangle]], with their intersection as a regular [[hexagon]] (in green).]]
A '''hexagram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]) or '''sexagram''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]) is a six-pointed geometric [[star figure]] with the [[Schläfli symbol]] {6/2}, 2{3}, or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams, the term is instead used to refer to the compound figure of two [[equilateral triangle]]s shown to the right. The intersection is a regular [[hexagon]].

The hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]]. In three dimensions, [[Compound of two tetrahedra|the analogous compound]] is the [[stellated octahedron]], and in four dimensions the [[compound of two 5-cells]] is obtained.

It has been historically used in religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs; for example by medieval [[Muslims]], especially [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] dynasties,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Delhi: Adventures in a Megacity]]'' (PB) - Page 91, Sam Miller, Sam - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Judaism]] and [[occultism]]. The symbol was used merely as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue.{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=244|ps=:"It is not to be found at all in medieval synagogues or on medieval ceremonial objects, although it has been found in quite a number of medieval Christian churches again, not as a Christian symbol but only as a decorative motif. The appearance of the symbol in Christian churches long before its appearance in our synagogues should warn the overzealous interpreters. "}} It was first used as a religious symbol by Arabs in the medieval period, known as the [[Seal of Solomon]], depicted as either a hexagram or [[pentagram]], and which was later adopted by Jewish [[Kabbalists]].{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=246|ps=:"In the beginning these designs had no special names or terms, and it is only in the Middle Ages that definite names began to be given to some of those most widely used. There is very little doubt that terms like these first became popular among the Arabs, who showed a tremendous interest in all the occult sciences, arranging and ordering them systematically long before the Practical Cabalists thought of doing so.{{pb}}It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that for a long time both the five-pointed and the six-pointed stars were called by one name, the "Seal of Solomon," and that no distinction was made between them. This name is obviously related to the Jewish legend of Solomon's dominion over the spirits, and of his ring with the Ineffable Name engraved on it. These legends expanded and proliferated in a marked fashion during the Middle Ages, among Jews and Arabs alike, but the name, "Seal of Solomon," apparently originated with the Arabs."}}&lt;ref&gt;Leonora Leet, "The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science" in :''The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah'', 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=61hpoogearsC&amp;pg=PA212 pp. 212-217].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the [[root system]] for the simple [[Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.&lt;br/&gt;

*Without changing the radius of the compass, set its pivot on the circle's circumference, and find one of the two points where a new circle would intersect the first circle.
*With the pivot on the last point found, similarly find a third point on the circumference, and repeat until six such points have been marked.
*With a straight edge, join alternate points on the circumference to form two overlapping equilateral triangles.

== Construction by linear algebra ==
[[File:Hexagram-cube.png|thumb]]
A regular hexagram can be constructed by [[orthographic projection|orthographically projecting]] any [[cube]] onto a plane through three vertices that are all adjacent to the same vertex.  The twelve midpoints to edges of the cube form a hexagram.  For example, consider the projection of the unit cube with vertices at the eight possible binary vectors in three dimensions &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt; onto the plane &lt;math&gt;x+y+z=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The midpoints are &lt;math&gt;(0,0,1/2),(0,1/2,1/2),(0,1,1/2),(1,1,1/2)&lt;/math&gt;, and all points resulting from these by applying a permutation to their entries.  These 12 points project to a hexagram: six vertices around the outer hexagon and six on the inner.

==Origins and shape==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
It is possible that as a simple geometric shape, like for example the triangle, circle, or square, the hexagram has been created by various peoples with no connection to one another.

The hexagram is a [[mandala]] symbol called ''satkona yantra'' or ''sadkona yantra'' found on ancient South [[India]]n [[Hindu]] temples. It symbolizes the [[nara-narayana]], or perfect [[meditative]] state of balance achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in "[[moksha]]," or "[[nirvana]]" (release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some researchers have theorized that the hexagram represents the [[astrological]] chart at the time of David's birth or [[anointment]] as king. The hexagram is also known as the "King's Star" in astrological circles.

In antique [[papyri]], [[pentagram]]s, together with stars and other signs, are frequently found on [[amulet]]s bearing the Jewish names of [[God]], and used to guard against fever and other diseases. Curiously the hexagram is not found among these signs. In the [[Greek Magical Papyri]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (Wessely, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;31, 112) at Paris and London there are 22 signs side by side, and a circle with twelve signs, but neither a pentagram nor a hexagram.

==Usage in Dharmic religions==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Jain Cosmology0007small.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the two mystic syllables Om and Hrim]]
Six-pointed stars have also been found in cosmological diagrams in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. The reasons behind this symbol's common appearance in Indic religions and the West are unknown. One possibility is that they have a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.

Within Indic lore, the shape is generally understood to consist of two triangles—one pointed up and the other down—locked in harmonious embrace. The two components are called "Om" and the "Hrim" in Sanskrit, and symbolize man's position between earth and sky. The downward triangle symbolizes [[Shakti]], the sacred embodiment of femininity, and the upward triangle symbolizes [[Shiva]], or [[Agni Tattva]], representing the focused aspects of masculinity. The mystical union of the two triangles represents Creation, occurring through the divine union of male and female. The two locked triangles are also known as 'Shanmukha'—the six-faced, representing the six faces of Shiva &amp; Shakti's progeny [[Kartikeya]]. This symbol is also a part of several yantras and has deep significance in Hindu ritual worship and history.

In [[Buddhism]], some old versions of the [[Bardo Thodol]], also known as The "Tibetan Book of the Dead", contain a hexagram with a [[Swastika]] inside. It was made up by the publishers for this particular publication. In Tibetan, it is called the "origin of phenomenon" (chos-kyi 'byung-gnas). It is especially connected with [[Vajrayogini]], and forms the center part of Her [[mandala]]. In reality, it is in three dimensions, not two, although it may be portrayed either way.

The [[Shatkona]] is a symbol used in [[Hindu]] [[yantra]] that represents the union of both the [[male]] and [[Female|feminine]] form. More specifically it is supposed to represent [[Purusha]] (the supreme being), and [[Prakriti]] (mother nature, or causal matter). Often this is represented as [[Shiva]] - [[Shakti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sivasakti.com/articles/intro-yantra.html sivasakti.com: ''Iintroduction to Yantra'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shatkona is a hexagram and looks exactly like the [[Star of David]].

===Anahata: The Heart Chakra===
{| border="0"
|width=170 valign=top|[[File:Anahata Mandala.svg|center|170px]]
|valign=top|'''[[Anahata]]''' (also known as '''Anahata-puri''', or '''Padma-sundara''') is symbolized by a lotus flower with twelve petals. (See also [[bodhicitta|heartmind]]). Anahata is related to the colors green or pink. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;
|-

In the [[endocrine system]], [[Anahata]] is associated with the [[thymus]] gland, located in the chest. This gland produces [[T-cells]], that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the [[thymus]] is greatest before [[puberty]] and is impaired by the appearance of [[sex hormones]] in the blood stream from [[puberty]] onwards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Usage by the Abrahamic religions==

===Usage by Jews===
{{Main|Star of David}}
[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]
The ''Magen David'' is a generally recognized symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity and is also known colloquially as the Jewish Star or "Star of David." Its usage as a sign of Jewish identity began in the Middle Ages, though its religious usage began earlier, with the current earliest archeological evidence being a stone bearing the shield from the arch of a 3–4th century synagogue in the Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;"King Solomon's Seal", ''MFA'', [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/King%20Solomon-s%20Seal King Solomon-s Seal].&lt;/ref&gt; A more enduring symbol of Judaism, the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], has been in use since about 1300 BC according to the [[Torah]] {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:31-40|HE}}.

===Usage by Christians===
The hexagram may be found in some Churches and stained-glass windows. In Christianity it is sometimes called the star of creation.  A very early example, noted by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], can be found in [[Winchester Cathedral]], England in one of the canopies of the choir stalls, circa 1308.&lt;ref&gt;Buildings of England: Hampshire and the North (now second edition) {{ISBN|978 0 300 12084 4}}, p.604. &lt;/ref&gt;

In Balkan countries, hexagrams can be found more often in Orthodox Christian churches than in Roman Catholic churches.  
 
====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
[[File:Salt Lake Assembly Hall Star of David.jpg|thumb|Star of David on the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall]]]]
{{Main|Mormonism and Judaism}}
The Star of David is also used less prominently by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]] and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.

====Rastafari====
A black star of David is used to identify the black population, in Africa or otherwise, with one of the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Due to the culture of Rastafari emerging out of the Judeo-Christian Ethiopian history, dating back to Solomonic dynastic rule, the star of David, or the Seal of Solomon is a prevalent symbol amongst its adherents. Rastafari has adherents from every race across the globe, rooted in Christian doctrine, it is not an African or bloodline doctrine.

===Usage by Muslims===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The symbol is known in Arabic as ''Khātem Sulaymān'' ([[Seal of Solomon]]; {{lang|ar|خاتم سليمان}}) or ''Najmat Dāwūd'' ([[Star of David]]; {{lang|ar|نجمة داوود}}). The "Seal of Solomon" may also be represented by a five-pointed star or [[pentagram]].

In the [[Qur'an]], it is written that David and [[King Solomon]] (Arabic, ''Suliman'' or ''Sulayman'') were prophets and kings, and are figures revered by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman [[Hanafi]] [[Anatolian beyliks]] of the [[Karamanids]] and [[Jandarids]] used the star on their flag.&lt;ref name="Muwahhidists"&gt;The Muslim Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, By Stephen F. Dale, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol also used on [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] flag. Today the six-pointed star can be found in [[mosques]] and on other [[Arabic Art|Arabic]] and [[Islamic art]]ifacts.

Professor [[Gershom Sholem|Gershom Scholem]] theorizes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-curious-history-of-the-six-pointed-starhow-the-magen-david-became-the-jewish-symbol/|title=The Curious History of the Six-Pointed Star:How the “Magen David” Became the Jewish Symbol - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the "Star of David" originates in the writings of [[Aristotle]], who used triangles in different positions to indicate the different basic elements. The superposed triangles thus represented combinations of those elements. From Aristotle's writings those symbols made their ways into early, pre-Muslim Arab literature.

==Usage in heraldry==
In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a hexagram is a fairly common charge employed, though it is rarely called by this name. In Germanic regions it is known simply as a "star." In English and French heraldry, however, the hexagram is known as a "mullet of six points," where ''mullet'' is a French term for a [[spur|spur rowel]] which is shown with five pointed arms by default unless otherwise specified. In [[Albania]]n heraldry and vexillology, hexagram has been used since [[classical antiquity]] and it is commonly referred to as ''sixagram''. [[:File:Coa Kastrioti Family.svg|Coa Kastrioti Family]] of the [[House of Kastrioti]] depicts the hexagram on a '''[[pile (heraldry)|pile]]''' argent over the double headed eagle. A hexagram also appears on the '''Dardania''' Flag, proposed for [[Kosovo]] by the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]].

==Usage in theosophy==
The Star of David is used in the seal and the emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]] (founded in 1875). Although it is more pronounced, it is used along with other religious symbols. These include the [[Swastika]], the [[Ankh]], the [[Om|Aum]], and the [[Ouroboros]]. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon that was its original name until around 50 years ago.

==Usage in occultism==
The hexagram, like the [[pentagram]], was and is used in practices of the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]] and is attributed to the 7 "old" planets outlined in [[astrology]].

The six-pointed star is commonly used both as a [[talisman]]&lt;ref&gt;P299 (and throughout) of ''The Complete Goldendawn'' by Israel Regardie. {{ISBN|978-0875426631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for conjuring spirits and spiritual forces in diverse forms of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult magic]]. In the book [[The History and Practice of Magic, Vol. 2]], the six-pointed star is called the talisman of Saturn and it is also referred to as the Seal of Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;"The History and Practice of Magic" (Secaucus, NJ: University Books, published by arrangement with Lyle Stewart, 1979), Vol. II, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Details are given in this book on how to make these symbols and the materials to use.
[[File:Star of David GGNC grave marker engraving.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Double hexagram.]]
Traditionally, the Hexagram can be seen as the combination of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. When you combine the symbols of Fire and Water, a hexagram (six-pointed star) is created. The same follows for when you combine the symbols of Air and Earth.  When you combine both hexagrams, you get the double-hexagram. Thus, a combination of the elements is created.&lt;ref&gt;P315-316 of ''The Wicca Bible'' by Ann-Marie Gallagher. {{ISBN|978-1-84181-250-2}}. Same information also found in many other books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] Magic, the seven Traditional Planets correspond with the angles and the center of the Hexagram as follows, in the same patterns as they appear on the [[Sephiroth]] and on the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. Saturn, although formally attributed to the Sephira of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], within this frame work nonetheless occupies the position of [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Daath]].&lt;ref&gt;P31 of ''The Ritual Magic Manual: A Complete Course in Practical Magic'' by David Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0965840897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Freemasonry==
{{quote|"The interlacing triangles or deltas symbolize the union of the two principles or forces, the active and passive, male and female, pervading the universe ... The two triangles, one white and the other black, interlacing, typify the mingling of apparent opposites in nature, darkness and light, error and truth, ignorance and wisdom, evil and good, throughout human life." –&amp;nbsp;Albert G. Mackey: ''Encyclopedia of [[Freemason]]ry''}}

The hexagram is featured within and on the outside of many [[Masonic temple]]s as a decoration. It may have been found within the structures of [[King Solomon]]'s temple, from which [[Freemasons]] are inspired in their philosophies and studies. Like many other symbols in Freemasonry, the deciphering of the hexagram is non-dogmatic and left to the interpretation of the individual.

A '''hickey''', '''hickie''' or '''love bite''' in [[British English]], is a [[bruise]] or bruise-like mark caused by the [[kissing]] or sucking of the [[skin]], usually on the [[neck]] or [[arm]]. While biting might be part of giving a hickey, sucking is sufficient to burst small superficial [[blood vessels]] under the skin. 

The origin of the word is from its earlier meaning of "pimple, skin lesion" (c. 1915); perhaps a sense extension and spelling variation from the earlier word meaning "small gadget, device; any unspecified object" which has an unknown origin (1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/hickie|title=hickie - Origin and meaning of hickie by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hickeys typically last from 5 to 12 days and may be treated in the same way as other bruises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ownarticles.com/how-long-do-hickeys-last |title=How Long Do Hickeys Last |date=April 15, 2016|website=ownarticles.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520071039/http://ownarticles.com/how-long-do-hickeys-last |archivedate=2016-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ways to reduce the appearance of hickeys include icing recent hickeys to reduce swelling, rubbing them with a chilled spoon to remove the bruise, and applying a [[warm compress]] to older hickeys to dilate vessels and promote blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life/relationships/man-woman/Ouch-Thats-a-lovebite/articleshow/4680691.cms|title=Ouch!

Alternatively, articles of clothing such as [[scarf|scarves]], [[snood (headgear)|snoods]], [[polo neck|turtle necks]], or [[sleeve]]s may be used to conceal hickeys.

A '''historical figure''' is a famous person in [[history]], such as [[Catherine the Great]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Washington]], or [[Napoleon]].

The significance of such figures in human progress has been debated. Some think they play a crucial role, while others say they have little impact on the broad currents of thought and social change.  The concept is generally used in the sense that the person really existed in the past, as opposed to being legendary.  However, the legends that can grow up around historical figures may be hard to distinguish from fact.  Sources are often incomplete and may be inaccurate, particularly those from early periods of history. Without a body of personal documents, the more subtle aspects of personality of a historical figure can only be deduced. With historical figures who were also religious figures attempts to separate fact from belief may be controversial.

In education, presenting information as if it were being told by a historical figure may give it greater impact. Since classical times, students have been asked to put themselves in the place of a historical figure as a way of bringing history to life. Historical figures are often represented in fiction, where fact and fancy are combined. In earlier traditions, before the rise of a critical historical tradition, authors took less care to be as accurate when describing what they knew of historical figures and their actions, interpolating imaginary elements intended to serve a moral purpose to events: such is [[Notker the Stammerer|the Monk of St. Gall]]'s anecdotal account of [[Charlemagne]], ''De Carolo Magno''. More recently there has been a tendency once again for authors to freely depart from the "facts" when they conflict with their creative goals.

==Significance==
The significance of historical figures has long been the subject of debate by philosophers. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) considered that "world-historical figures" played a pivotal role in human progress, but felt that they were bound to emerge when change was needed. [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1795–1881) saw the study of figures such as [[Muhammad]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]] as key to understanding history. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903), an early believer in evolution and in the universality of natural law, felt that historical individuals were of little importance.

===Hegel's world-historical figure===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] introduced the concept of the "world-historical figure".]]
The German philosopher Hegel defined the concept of the world-historical figure, who embodied the ruthless advance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s World Spirit, often overthrowing outdated structures and ideas.  To him, [[Napoleon]] was such a figure.{{sfn|Hagen|2012|p=125}}
Hegel proposed that a world-historical figure essentially posed a challenge, or thesis, and this would generate an antithesis, or opposing force. Eventually a synthesis would resolve the conflict.{{sfn|Van Doren|2008|p=277}}
Hegel viewed [[Julius Caesar]] as a world historical figure, who appeared at a stage when Rome had grown to the point it could no longer continue as a republican city state but had to become an empire.  Caesar failed in his bid to make himself an emperor, and was assassinated, but the empire came into existence soon afterward, and Caesar's name has become synonymous with "emperor" in forms such as "[[kaiser]]" or "[[czar]]".{{sfn|Karatani|2011|p=20}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]], in his early essay ''The Concept of Irony'', generally agrees with Hegel's views, such as his characterization of [[Socrates]] as a world-historical figure who acted as a destructive force on Greek received views of morality.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=179}}
In Hegel's view, Socrates broke down social harmony by questioning the meaning of concepts like "justice" and "virtue".
Eventually, the Athenians quite rightly *(Name source) condemned Socrates to death. But they could not stop the evolution of thought that Socrates had begun, which would lead to the concept of individual conscience.{{sfn|Magee|2001|p=192}}
Hegel said of world-historical figures,
{{blockquote|It was theirs to know this nascent principle; the necessary, directly sequent step in progress, which their world was to take; to make this their aim, and to expend their energy in promoting it ... They die early like Alexander; they are murdered, like Caesar; transported to St. Helena, like Napoleon ... They are ''great'' men, because they willed and accomplished something great; not a mere fancy, a mere intention, but that which met the case and fell in with the needs of the age.{{sfn|Cramer|2007|p=272}}}}

However, Hegel, [[Thomas Carlyle]] and others noted that the great historical figures were just representative men, expressions of the material forces of history.  Essentially they have little choice about what they do. This is in conflict with the views of [[George Bancroft]] or [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who praised self-reliance and individualism, and in conflict with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who also felt that individuals can determine their destiny.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=5}}
Engels found that Hegel's system contained an "internal and incurable contradiction", resting as it does on both [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical relativism]] and idealistic absolutism.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=xv}}

===Spencerian view===
[[File:Spencer1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]], who considered events in the lives of kings "historic trivalities"]]
The Scottish philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], who was highly influential in the latter half of the nineteenth century, felt that historical figures were relatively unimportant.
He wrote to a friend, "I ignore utterly the personal element in history, and, indeed, show little respect for history altogether as it is ordinarily conceived."
He wrote, "The births, deaths,  and marriages of kings, and other like historic trivialities, are committed to memory, not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them:  but because society considers them parts of a good education."{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188}}
In his essay ''What Knowledge Is of Most Worth?'' he wrote:
{{blockquote|That which constitutes History,  properly so called, is in great part omitted from works on the subject. Only of late years have historians commenced giving us, in any considerable quantity, the truly valuable information. As in past ages the king was everything and the people nothing; So, in past histories, the doings of the king fill the entire picture, to which the national life forms but an obscure background. While only now, when the welfare of nations rather than of rulers is becoming the dominant idea, are historians beginning to occupy themselves with the phenomena of social progress. The thing it really concerns us to know is the natural history of society.{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188-189}}}}

===Inevitability or determinism===
Taken to an extreme, one may consider that what Hegel calls the "world spirit" and [[T. S. Eliot]] calls "those vast impersonal forces" hold us in their grip.  What happens is predetermined.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}} 
Both Hegel and Marx advocated historical inevitability in contrast to the doctrine of contingency, allowing for alternative outcomes, that was advocated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]] and others.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2011|p=chapter 9}}
However, Marx argued against the use of the  "historical inevitability" argument when used to explain the destruction of early communes in Russia.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2009|p=158}}
As an orthodox Marxist, [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the laws of history that Marx had discovered, including the historical inevitability of capitalism followed by a transition to socialism.
Despite this, Lenin also believed the transition could be effected faster by voluntary action.{{sfn|Chen|2007|p=37}}

In 1936 [[Karl Popper]] published an influential paper on ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', published as a book in 1957, that attacked the doctrine of historical inevitability.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=218}}
The historian [[Isaiah Berlin]], author of ''Historical Inevitability'', also argued forcibly against this view, going as far as to say that some choices are entirely free and cannot be predicted scientifically.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}}
Berlin presented his views in a 1953 lecture at the [[London School of Economics]], published soon afterwards.  When speaking he referred to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s views, but the published version speaks approvingly of Karl Popper, which caused a stir among academics.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=152}}

===Heroic view===
[[File:Carlyle by Elliott &amp; Fry c1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Carlyle]], champion of study of great men]]
[[Thomas Carlyle]] has espoused the "heroic view" of history, famously saying in his essay on the Norse god [[Odin]] in his book ''On heroes, hero-worship, &amp; the heroic in history'' that "No great man lives in vain. The History of the world is but the Biography of great men ... We do not now call our great men Gods, nor admire ''without'' limit; ah no, ''with'' limit enough! But if we have no great men, or do not admire at all,— that were a still worse case."{{sfn|Carlyle|1841|p=47}}
Carlyle's historical philosophy was based on the "[[Great Man theory]]", saying, "Universal History, the history of what man has accomplished in the world ... [is] at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here."
An extreme believer in individuality, he also believed that the masses of people should let themselves be guided by the great leaders of men.{{sfn|Carlyle|2007|p=9}}
Talking of poets he said,
{{blockquote|That ideal outline of himself, which a man unconsciously shadows forth in his writings, and which, if rightly deciphered, will be truer than any other representation of him, it is the task of the Biographer to fill-up into an actual coherent figure, and to bring him to our experience, or at least our clear undoubted admiration, thereby to instruct and edify us in many ways. Conducted on such principles, the Biography of great men, especially of great Poets, that is, of men in the highest degree noble-minded and wise, might become one of the most dignified and valuable species of composition.{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=138}}}}
More recently, in his 1943 book ''The Hero in History'', the [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] scholar [[Sidney Hook]] asserts:
{{blockquote|That history is made by men and women is no longer denied except by some theologians and mystical metaphysicians.  And even they are compelled indirectly to acknowledge this commonplace truth, for they speak of historical personages as 'instruments' of Providence, Justice, Reason, Dialectic, the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', or Spirit of the Times.  Men agree more readily about the consequences of the use of 'instruments' in history than they do about the ultimate ends 'instruments' allegedly serve, or the first causes by which they are allegedly determined.{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xi}}}}
Hook recognizes the relevance of the environment within which the "great man" or "hero" acted, but asserts that this can provide the backdrop but never the plot of the "dramas of human history". and distinguish life and species{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xiii}}

===Ranking===
[[File:Crucifixion by Jacob Jordaens.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The crucifixion of Jesus, the founder of [[Christianity]], painted by [[Jacob Jordaens]] in the 17th century.]]
There have been rankings of the significance of major historical figures.  For example, [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] and colleagues at the [[MIT Media Lab]] has calculated the memorability of historical figures using data such as the number of language editions for which there are articles for each person, the pageviews received, and other factors.  These lists are available at MIT's [http://pantheon.media.mit.edu Pantheon ] project.

==Historical truth==
It is sometimes hard to discern whether apparently historical figures from the earliest periods did in fact exist, due to the lack of records.  Even with more recent personages, stories or anecdotes about the person often accumulate that have no basis in fact.  Although the external aspects of a historical figure may be well documented, their inner nature can only be a subject of speculation.  With religious figures, often the subjects of voluminous literature, separating "fact" from "belief" can be difficult if not impossible.

===Ancient figures===
With older texts it can be difficult to be sure whether a person in the text is, in fact, a historical figure. "Wisdom literature" from early middle-eastern cultures (such as the [[Book of Job]]), mainly consist of verbal expositions or discussions that must be considered the work of the author, rather than the character supposedly speaking. It may still be possible to identify a figure in such texts with a historical figure known from some other context, and the text may be taken as informative about this figure, even if not verified by an independent source.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=335}} On the other hand, a text may include realistic settings and references to historical people, while the central character may or may not be a historical figure.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=336}}

===Fables===
[[File:Lady Godiva (John Collier, c. 1897).jpg|thumb|[[Lady Godiva]] was a historical figure, but there is no evidence that the legend of her riding naked through the streets is true (''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'' painting, 1897 by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]])]]

Napoleon spoke of history as being a [[fable]] which had been agreed upon:– "''la fable convenue qu'on appellera l'histoire''".{{sfn|Napoleon &amp; Auguste-Dieudonné 1823|p=242}} Great figures of the past have stories told about them which grow in the telling, and so become [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s which may dominate or displace the more prosaic historical facts about them. For example, some ancient chroniclers said that the Emperor [[Nero]] fiddled while Rome burned, but [[Tacitus]] disputed this by saying the stories were just malicious rumours. Similarly, there is no good evidence that [[Marie-Antoinette]] ever said "let them eat cake", or that [[Lady Godiva]] rode naked through the streets of [[Coventry]].{{sfn|Andrews|2012}}

===Personality===
[[Thomas Carlyle]] pointed out that even to the person living it, every life "remains in so many points unintelligible".  The historian must struggle when writing biographies, "the very facts of which, to say nothing of the purport of them, we know not, and cannot know!"{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=133-134}}
Some psychologists have sought to understand the personalities of historical figures through clues about the way in which they were raised. However, this theoretical psychoanalytic approach is not supported empirically. An alternative approach, favored by [[Psychobiography|psychobiographers]] such as [[William Runyan]], is to explain the personality of the historical figure in terms of their life history. This approach has the advantage of recognizing that personality may evolve over time in response to events.{{sfn|Roberts|1996|p=208}}

[[File:Confucius Laozi Buddha.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Three great historical figures — [[Confucius]] presenting the [[Buddha]] to [[Lao Tsu]]. They are all of such antiquity that the historical facts about them are now overlaid with centuries of myth and legend.]]

===Religious figures===
With historical religious figures, fact and belief may be difficult to disentangle.
There are cultural differences in the treatment of historical figures. Thus the Chinese can recognise that [[Mencius]] or [[Confucius]] were historical individuals, while also endowing them with sanctity. In Indian [[Hinduism]], on the other hand, figures such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]] are almost always seen as embodiments of gods rather than as historical people. The [[Nirvana Sutra]] states: "Do not rely on the man but on the Dharma." A teacher such as [[Gautama Buddha]] is thus treated almost exclusively as a lesser god rather than a historical figure.{{sfn|Yuasa|Kasulis|1987|p=128}}

[[E. P. Sanders]], author of ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'', called Jesus of Nazareth "one of the most important figures in human history".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=1}} Various writers have struggled to present [[Historical Jesus|"historical" views of Jesus]], as opposed to views distorted by belief.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}} When writing about this subject, a historian who relies only on sources other than the [[New Testament]] may be criticized for implying that it is not a sufficient source of information about the subject.{{sfn|Habermas|1996|p=11}}

The theologian [[Martin Kähler]] is known for his work ''Der sogenannte historische Jesus und der geschichtliche, biblische Christus'' (The so-called historical Jesus, and the historic, biblical Christ). He clearly distinguished between "the Jesus of history" and "the Christ of faith".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=4}} Some historians openly admit bias, which may anyway be unavoidable. Paul Hollenback says he writes about the historical Jesus, "...in order to overthrow, not simply correct, the mistake called Christianity."  Another historian who has written about Jesus, Frederick Gaiser, says, "historical investigation is part and parcel of biblical faith."{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}}

{{clear}}

==Political appropriation==
[[File:Stilke Hermann Anton - Joan of Arc's Death at the Stake.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1843 view of a heroic [[Joan of Arc]] at the stake.]]
A historical figure may be interpreted to support political aims.
In France in the first half of the seventeenth century,&lt;!--didn't the big Joan thing take place around the time of Napoleon?--&gt; there was an outpouring of writing about [[Joan of Arc]], including seven biographies, three plays and an epic poem. Joan had become a symbol of national pride and the Catholic faith, helping unite a country that had been divided by the recent [[French Wars of Religion|wars of religion]].  The reality of the historical Joan was subordinated to the need for a symbol of feminine strength, Christian virtue and resistance to the English.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=1}}
[[George Bernard Shaw]], introducing his 1923 play ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', discussed representations of Joan by other authors.
He felt that [[William Shakespeare]]'s depiction in ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' was constrained from making her a "beautiful and romantic figure" by political considerations. [[Voltaire]]'s version in his poem ''[[La Pucelle d'Orléans]]'' was also flawed by Voltaire's biases and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s play ''[[Die Jungfrau von Orleans]]'' "is not about Joan at all, and can hardly be said to pretend to be."{{sfn|Innes|1998|p=208}}

A historical figure may be used to validate a politician's claim to authority,
where the modern leader shapes and exploits the ideas associated with the historical figure,
which they are presumed to have inherited.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=60}}
Thus [[Jesse Jackson]] has frequently evoked the spirit of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=51}}
[[Fidel Castro]] often presented himself as following the path defined by [[José Martí]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=64}}
[[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela has frequently identified himself with the historical figure [[Simón Bolívar]], the liberator of South America from Spanish rule.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=125}}

Hegel believed in the role of the state in guaranteeing individual liberties, and his views were therefore rejected by the German National Socialists, who considered him dangerously liberal and perhaps a proto-Marxist. On the other hand, [[Adolf Hitler]] identified himself as a Hegelian world historical figure, and justified his actions on this basis.{{sfn|Cobley|2002|p=278}}

==In education==
[[Plato]] used historical figures in his writing, but only to illustrate his points. [[Xenophon]] used [[Cyrus the Great]] in the same way.
When Plato apparently quotes [[Socrates]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', it is only to add dramatic effect to the presentation of his own thought.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} For this reason, Plato's writings on Socrates tell us little, at least directly, about Socrates. The historical figure is used only as a device for communicating Plato's ideas.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} In classical Rome, students of rhetoric had to master the ''[[suasoria]]'' — a form of [[declamation]] in which they wrote the soliloquy of a historical figure who was debating a critical course of action.  For example, the poet [[Juvenal]] wrote a speech for the dictator [[Sulla]], in which he was counselled to retire. The poet [[Ovid]] enjoyed this exercise more than the other final challenge — the ''[[controversia]]''.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics|p=212}}

The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote an influential essay "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life". He said "the unhistorical and historical are necessary in equal measure for the health of an individual, of a people and of a culture."{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=2}}
Nietzsche identifies three approaches to history, each with dangers.
The monumental approach describes the glories of the past, often focusing on heroic figures like [[Elizabeth I of England]] or [[Louis Pasteur]]. 
By treating these figures as models, the student is tempted to consider that there can be nobody of such stature today.
The antiquarian view examines the past in minute and reverent detail, turning its back on the present.
The critical approach challenges traditional views, even though they may be valid.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=3}}

Historical figures may today be simulated as [[animated pedagogical agent]]s to teach history and foreign culture. An example is [[Freudbot]], which acted the part of [[Sigmund Freud]] for psychology students. When a variety of simulated character types were tried as educational agents, students rated historical figures as the most engaging.{{sfn|Veletsianos|2010|p=16}}
There are [[gender difference]]s in the perception of historical figures.  When modern US schoolchildren were asked to roleplay or illustrate historical stereotypes, boys tended to focus upon male figures exclusively while girls showed more varied family groupings.{{sfn|Fournier|Wineburg|1997|p=160-185}}

==In branding==
Using historical figures in marketing communicationsn and in branding is a new area of marketing research but historical figures’ names were used to promote products as early as in the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;Madow M., Private Ownership of Public Image: Popular Culture and Publicity Rights, vol. 81, California Law Review 125, 1993, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Historical figure brand is using famous historical person in branding, for instance [[Mozartkugel]], [[Chopin (vodka)]] or Café Einstein https://www.cafeeinstein.com/. 

Historical figure is a person who lived in the past and whose deeds exerted a significant impact on other people’s lives and consciousness. These figures are attributed with certain features that are a compilation of the actual values they proclaimed and the manner they were perceived by others. This perception evolves and subsequent generations read the biography of a given historical figure in their own way through their own knowledge and experience. In order to determine the popularity of the commercialisation of historical figures, a study was conducted at the beginning of 2014 on the number of trademark protection applications filed with the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland as a measure of entrepreneurs’ interest in this activity. The names of 300 most prominent Polish historical figures &lt;ref&gt;Grygiel A.(ed.), Encyklopedia sławnych Polaków, Publicat S.A., Poznań 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; were considered. The study showed that over 21% of the names analysed were recorded in the trademark register. 1,033 trademark protection applications were filed for 64 names out of the 300 historical figures investigated [Aldona Lipka, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Lipka Aldona, Ograniczona racjonalność i heurystyki w zachowaniach nabywców [w:] G. Wolska (red.), Współczesne problemy ekonomiczne, Zeszyty Naukowe nr 858, Wyd. Uniwersytet Szczeciński, Szczecin 2015. p. 265.(https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=8g7DDDkAAAAJ&amp;hl=pl&amp;oi=ao)&lt;/ref&gt;]. The greatest number of trademark protection applications were recorded for [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]] (295), followed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (250), [[John III Sobieski]] (94) and [[Chopin]] (81).

==In art and literature==
[[File:Henry IV 1 title page.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Shakespeare]] wrote a number of plays that dramatized the lives of historical figures, but introduced fictional characters such as [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]].]]

===Realist historical fiction===
There is a huge body of historical fiction, where the text includes both imaginary and factual elements. In early English literature, [[Robin Hood]] was a fictional character, but the historical King [[Richard I of England]] also appears.{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xviii}}
[[William Shakespeare]]{{efn|William Shakespeare was a historical figure himself, but as a biographer said, "Such materials as there are for Shakespeare's personal history, or for the history of anyone connected with him, have been gathered with the most loving and persevering industry. Unhappily, they amount to very little.  Entries in municipal records, names in a will, a lease, or an inventory, tell hardly anything of the life or character of the man.  That orange has now been squeezed dry."{{sfn|Smith|1899|p=7}}}} wrote [[List of historical figures dramatised by Shakespeare|plays about people who were historical figures in his day]], such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. He did not present these people as pure history, but dramatised their lives as a commentary about the people and politics of his own time.{{sfn|Hattaway|2002|p=16}}
Napoleon figured in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 classic ''[[Les Misérables]]''.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=65}}
There are many more examples.

The compiler of a survey of historical novels in the 1920s claimed that the "appearance of reality ... is the great charm of the historical novel." He went on to assert, regarding novels about periods of which little is known, that "the danger is that the very elements which add to our interest in the tale as such will go far to mislead us in our conception of the period dealt with".{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xix}}
Traditionally the treatment of historical figures in fiction was realistic in style and respectful of fact. A historical novel would be true to the facts known about the period in which the novel is set, a [[biographical novel]] would follow the facts that are known about the protagonist's life, and a "[[roman à clef]]" would try to give an accurate interpretation of what is known about a public figure's private life. In each genre, the novelist would avoid introducing any elements that were clearly in conflict with the facts.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}

A writer may be handicapped by his readers' preconceptions about a historical person, which may or may not be accurate, and the facts about the historical person may also conflict with the novelist's plot requirements.{{sfn|Lukacs|1937|p=168}}
According to the Marxist philosopher [[György Lukács]] in his 1937 book on ''The Historical Novel'', "The 'world-historical individual' can only figure as a minor character in the [historical] novel because of the complexity and intricacy of the whole social-historical process."{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=113}}
As Jacobs observes, the "realist aesthetic" of the historical novel "assumes that a recognizable historical figure in fiction must not 'do things' its model did not do in real life; it follows that historical figures can be used only in very limited ways."{{sfn|Wyile|2002|p=16}}
The author of a traditional historical novel should therefore focus more on the people who have been lost to history.{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=112}}
A novelist such as Sir [[Walter Scott]] or [[Leo Tolstoy]] (''[[War and Peace]]'') would describe historical events accurately. They would give rein to their imagination only in scenes that were not significant historically, when interactions with fictional characters could safely be introduced.{{sfn|Wachtel|1995|p=114}}

===Modern fiction===
More recently, however, starting with works such as ''[[The Confessions of Nat Turner]]'', and ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]'' by [[William Styron]],
the novelist has felt more free to introduce much larger amounts of purely imaginary detail about historical people.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}
[[E. L. Doctorow]] illustrates this different attitude when discussing his book ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'': "Certain details were so delicious that I was scrupulous about getting them right. Others&amp;nbsp;... demanded to be mythologized."  This reflects a changing attitude about the distinction between "fact" and "truth", expressed by [[Ursule Molinaro]] when he makes his [[Cassandra]] say, "I've come as close to the truth as facts would let me ... facts oppress the truth, which can breathe freely only in poetry &amp; art."{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xvii}}

===Other media===
Many films have depicted historical figures.  Often the way in which the films interpret these figures and their times reflects the social and cultural values of the period in which the film was made.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=1}}
Historical figures are familiar to the general reader and so may be used in [[speculative fiction]] so that readers marvel at their appearance in novel settings or with a fresh perspective.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=111ff}}
For example, the time traveler [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] has encountered numerous historical figures such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in his adventures.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gee|2012}}
They appeared most frequently when the television series first started, as it was directed at children and the use of historical figures in historical settings was intended to be educational.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=19}}

[[File:Ur_chariot.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[wheel]], invented sometime before the 4th millennium BC, is one of the most ubiquitous and important technologies. This detail of the "Standard of Ur", c. 2500 BC., displays a Sumerian [[chariot]]]]

The '''history of technology''' is the history of the [[invention]] of [[tool]]s and techniques and is one of the categories of the [[Human history|history of humanity]]. Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as [[stone tools]] to the complex [[genetic engineering]] and [[information technology]] that has emerged since the 1980s. The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech. It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used to described advancements and changes which affect the environment around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/history-of-technology|title=history of technology – Summary &amp; Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely, many scientific endeavors are made possible by [[technologies]] which assist humans in [[travel|traveling]] to places they could not previously reach, and by [[scientific instrument]]s by which we study nature in more detail than our natural senses allow.

Since much of technology is [[applied science]], technical history is connected to the [[history of science]]. Since technology uses [[resource]]s, technical history is tightly connected to [[economic history]]. From those [[Resource (Windows)|resources]], technology produces other resources, including ''technological artifacts'' used in [[everyday life]].

[[Technological change]] affects and is affected by, a society's cultural [[tradition]]s. It is a force for [[economic growth]] and a means to develop and project economic, political, military power and wealth.

== Measuring technological progress ==
{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}
Many [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have created [[social theory|social theories]] dealing with [[social evolution|social]] and [[cultural evolution]]. Some, like [[Lewis H. Morgan]], [[Leslie White]], and [[Gerhard Lenski]] have declared [[technological progress]] to be the primary factor driving the development of human civilization. Morgan's concept of three major stages of social evolution (savagery, [[Primitive culture|barbarism]], and [[civilization]]) can be divided by technological milestones, such as [[fire]]. White argued the measure by which to judge the evolution of culture was [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Elliot|last2=Smith|first2=Karen|title=American Materialism|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=American%20Materialism|website=The University of Alabama – Department of Anthropology|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For White, "the primary function of [[culture]]" is to "harness and control energy." White differentiates between five stages of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]: In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use the energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants ([[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of [[natural resource]]s: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of the efficiency of technical factors using the energy. In his own words, "culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased". [[Nikolai Kardashev]] extrapolated his theory, creating the [[Kardashev scale]], which categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations.

Lenski's approach focuses on [[information]]. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of [[natural environment]]) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He identifies four stages of human development, based on advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through experience. In the third, the humans start using signs and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s, develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in [[communications technology]] translate into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], [[distribution of wealth]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy:
* [[hunter-gatherer]],
* simple [[Agriculture|agricultural]],
* advanced agricultural,
* [[Industry|industrial]],
* special (such as fishing societies).

In economics, [[productivity]] is a measure of technological progress. Productivity increases when fewer inputs (classically labor and capital but some measures include energy and materials) are used in the production of a unit of output. Another indicator of technological progress is the development of new products and services, which is necessary to offset unemployment that would otherwise result as labor inputs are reduced. In developed countries productivity growth has been slowing since the late 1970s; however, productivity growth was higher in some economic sectors, such as manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way It Worked and Why It Won't: Structural Change and the Slowdown of U.S. Economic Growth |last=Bjork |first= Gordon J.|authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher =Praeger|location= Westport, CT; London|isbn=978-0275965327 |pages=2, 67| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, employment in [[manufacturing in the United States]] declined from over 30% in the 1940s to just over 10% 70 years later. Similar changes occurred in other developed countries. This stage is referred to as ''post-industrial''.

In the late 1970s sociologists and anthropologists like [[Alvin Toffler]] (author of ''[[Future Shock]]''), [[Daniel Bell]] and [[John Naisbitt]] have approached the theories of [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]], arguing that the current era of [[industrial society]] is coming to an end, and [[Service (economics)|services]] and information are becoming more important than [[industry]] and [[good (economics)|goods]]. Some extreme visions of the post-industrial society, especially in [[Fictional technology|fiction]], are strikingly similar to the visions of near and post-[[Technological singularity|Singularity]] societies.

[[File:Prehistoric Tools - Les Combarelles - Les Eyzies de Tayac - MNP.jpg|thumb|left|A variety of [[stone tool]]s]]
During most of the '''[[Paleolithic]]''' – the bulk of the Stone Age – all humans had a lifestyle which involved limited tools and few permanent settlements. The first major technologies were tied to survival, hunting, and food preparation. [[Stone tools]] and weapons, [[control of fire by early humans|fire]], and [[History of clothing and textiles|clothing]] were technological developments of major importance during this period.

Human ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' approximately 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501000000*/http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/ha/sap.htm | title=Human Ancestors Hall: Homo sapiens | accessdate=8 December 2007 | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest methods of [[stone tool]] making, known as the [[Oldowan]] "industry", date back to at least 2.3 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/336555.stm | title=Ancient 'tool factory' uncovered | accessdate=18 February 2007 | publisher=BBC News | date=6 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in [[Ethiopia]] within the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]], dating back to 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Environment and Behavior of 2.5-Million-Year-Old Bouri Hominids | last=Heinzelin | first=Jean de | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=April 1999 | volume=284 | issue=5414 | pages=625–629 | doi= 10.1126/science.284.5414.625 | pmid=10213682 | last2=Clark | first2=JD | last3=White | first3=T | last4=Hart | first4=W | last5=Renne | first5=P | last6=Woldegabriel | first6=G | last7=Beyene | first7=Y | last8=Vrba | first8=E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This era of stone tool use is called the ''[[Paleolithic]]'', or "Old stone age", and spans all of human history up to the development of [[agriculture]] approximately 12,000 years ago.

To make a stone tool, a "[[lithic core|core]]" of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as [[flint]]) was struck with a [[hammerstone]]. This flaking produced sharp edges which could be used as tools, primarily in the form of [[chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] or [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]].&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=17 May 2008|url=http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04|title=Archaeology|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Americana]]|author=Burke, Ariane |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080521022936/http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools greatly aided the early humans in their [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to perform a variety of tasks including [[butcher]]ing carcasses (and breaking bones to get at the [[Bone marrow|marrow]]); chopping wood; cracking open nuts; skinning an animal for its [[Hide (skin)|hide]], and even forming other tools out of softer materials such as bone and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flaked Stones and Old Bones: Biological and Cultural Evolution at the Dawn of Technology|author= Plummer, Thomas|publisher=[[Yearbook of Physical Anthropology]]|year=2004|issue=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest stone tools were irrelevant, being little more than a fractured rock. In the [[Acheulian]] era, beginning approximately 1.65 million years ago, methods of working these stone into specific shapes, such as [[hand axe]]s emerged. This early Stone Age is described as the [[Lower Paleolithic]].

The [[Middle Paleolithic]], approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the [[prepared-core technique]], where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone.&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology" /&gt; The [[Upper Paleolithic]], beginning approximately 40,000 years ago, saw the introduction of [[pressure flaking]], where a wood, bone, or antler [[punch (engineering)|punch]] could be used to shape a stone very finely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|author= Haviland, William A.|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0534624873|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the last Ice Age about 10,000 years ago is taken as the end point of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the beginning of the [[Epipaleolithic]] / [[Mesolithic]]. The Mesolithic technology included the use of [[microliths]] as composite stone tools, along with wood, bone, and antler tools.

The later Stone Age, during which the rudiments of agricultural technology were developed, is called the [[Neolithic]] period. During this period, polished [[stone tool]]s were made from a variety of hard rocks such as [[flint]], [[jade]], [[jadeite]], and [[Greenschist|greenstone]], largely by working exposures as quarries, but later the valuable rocks were pursued by tunneling underground, the first steps in mining technology. The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared. These stone axes were used alongside a continued use of stone tools such as a range of [[Projectile point|projectiles]], knives, and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], as well as tools, made organic materials such as wood, bone, and antler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Zsuzsanna|last1=Tóth | editor1-first=Alexandra |editor1-last=Anders | editor2-first=Zsuzsanna |editor2-last=Siklósi | year=2012 | title=Bone, Antler, and Tusk tools of the Early Neolithic Körös Culture | contribution=The First Neolithic Sites in Central/South-East European Transect, Volume III: The Körös Culture in Eastern Hungary | page= | location=Oxford | publisher=BAR International Series 2334 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone Age cultures developed [[Prehistoric music|music]] and engaged in organized [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. Stone Age humans developed ocean-worthy [[outrigger canoe]] technology, leading to [[History of Papua New Guinea|migration]] across the [[Malay archipelago]], across the Indian Ocean to [[Madagascar]] and also across the Pacific Ocean, which required knowledge of the ocean currents, weather patterns, sailing, and [[celestial navigation]].

Although Paleolithic cultures left no written records, the shift from nomadic life to settlement and agriculture can be inferred from a range of archaeological evidence. Such evidence includes ancient tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lovgren|first1=Stefan|title=Ancient Tools Unearthed in Siberian Arctic|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/01/0114_040114_siberianhumans.html|website=National Geographic News|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cave painting]]s, and other [[prehistoric art]], such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. Human remains also provide direct evidence, both through the examination of bones, and the study of [[mummy|mummies]]. Scientists and historians have been able to form significant inferences about the lifestyle and culture of various prehistoric peoples, and especially their technology.

==== Copper and bronze Ages ====
{{Main|Bronze Age}}

[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|upright|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade]]

Metallic copper occurs on the surface of weathered copper ore deposits and copper was used before copper [[smelting]] was known.  Copper smelting is believed to have originated when the technology of pottery [[kiln]]s allowed sufficiently high temperatures.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  The concentration of various elements such as arsenic increase with depth in copper ore deposits and smelting of these ores yields [[arsenical bronze]], which can be sufficiently work hardened to be suitable for making tools.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  [[Bronze]] is an alloy of copper with tin; the latter being found in relatively few deposits globally caused a long time to elapse before true tin bronze to became widespread. (See: [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]]) [[Bronze]] was a major advance over stone as a material for making tools, both because of its mechanical properties like strength and ductility and because it could be cast in molds to make intricately shaped objects.  

Bronze significantly advanced shipbuilding technology with better tools and bronze nails.  Bronze nails replaced the old method of attaching boards of the hull with cord woven through drilled holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC|location= New York|isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Better ships enabled long distance trade and the advance of civilization. 
   
This technological trend apparently began in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and spread outward over time. These developments were not, and still are not, universal. The [[three-age system]] does not accurately describe the technology history of groups outside of [[Eurasia]], and does not apply at all in the case of some isolated populations, such as the [[Spinifex People]], the [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]], and various Amazonian tribes, which still make use of Stone Age technology, and have not developed agricultural or metal technology.

==== Iron Age ====
{{Main|Iron Age}}
[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|An [[axe]]head made of iron, dating from the Swedish [[Iron Age]]]]
Before iron smelting was developed the only iron was obtained from meteorites and is usually identified by having nickel content.  [[Meteoric iron]] was rare and valuable, but was sometimes used to make tools and other implements, such as fish hooks.

The '''[[Iron age]]''' involved the adoption of iron [[bloomery|smelting]] technology. It generally replaced bronze and made it possible to produce tools which were stronger, lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents. The raw materials to make iron, such as ore and limestone, are far more abundant than copper and especially tin ores. Consequently, iron was produced in many areas. 

It was not possible to mass manufacture steel or pure iron because of the high temperatures required.  Furnaces could reach melting temperature but the crucibles and molds needed for melting and casting had not been developed.  [[Steel]] could be produced by [[forging]] bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a somewhat controllable way, but steel produced by this method was not homogeneous.

In many Eurasian cultures, the Iron Age was the last major step before the development of written language, though again this was not universally the case.

In Europe, large [[hill fort]]s were built either as a refuge in time of war or sometimes as permanent settlements. In some cases, existing forts from the Bronze Age were expanded and enlarged. The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increased, providing more farmland to support the growing population.

==== Egyptians ====
The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many simple machines, such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] to aid construction processes. Egyptian society made significant advances during dynastic periods in areas such as astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. They also made paper and monuments. The Egyptians made significant advances in shipbuilding. Astronomy was used by Egyptian leaders to govern people.

==== Indus Valley ====
The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area, is notable for its early application of city planning and sanitation technologies. Indus Valley construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding of materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation.

==== Mesopotamians ====
The peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkad (region)|Akkadians]], [[Assyria]]ns, and [[Babylonia]]ns) have been credited with the invention of the [[wheel]], but this is no longer certain. They lived in cities from c. 4000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;JN Postgate, ''Early Mesopotamia'', Routledge (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a sophisticated architecture in mud-brick and stone,&lt;ref&gt;See entries under [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of the true arch. The walls of Babylon were so massive they were quoted as a [[Wonder of the World]]. They developed extensive water systems; canals for transport and irrigation in the alluvial south, and catchment systems stretching for tens of kilometers in the hilly north. Their palaces had sophisticated drainage systems.&lt;ref name=Dalley2013&gt;S Dalley, ''The Mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon'', Oxford University Press(2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing was invented in Mesopotamia, using the [[cuneiform]] script. Many records on clay tablets and stone inscriptions have survived. These civilizations were early adopters of bronze technologies which they used for tools, weapons and monumental statuary. By 1200&amp;nbsp;BC they could cast objects 5 m long in a single piece. The Assyrian King [[Sennacherib]] (704–681&amp;nbsp;BC) claims to have invented automatic sluices and to have been the first to use water screws, of up to 30 tons weight, which were cast using two-part clay molds rather than by the 'lost wax' process.&lt;ref name=Dalley2013/&gt; The Jerwan Aqueduct (c. 688&amp;nbsp;BC) is made with stone arches and lined with waterproof concrete.&lt;ref&gt;T Jacobsen and S Lloyd, ''Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan'', Chicago University Press, (1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]] spanned 800 years. They enabled meticulous astronomers to plot the motions of the planets and to predict eclipses.&lt;ref&gt;CBF Walker, ''Astronomy before the telescope,'' British Museum Press, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chinese ====
The Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early [[Seismometer|seismological detectors]], matches, [[paper]], sliding calipers, the double-action piston pump, [[cast iron]], the iron plough, the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the wheelbarrow, the [[suspension bridge]], the parachute, natural gas as fuel, the [[compass]], the [[raised-relief map]], the propeller, the [[crossbow]], the [[South Pointing Chariot]] and [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|coauthors= Joseph Needham|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=| postscript = &lt;Based on the works of Joseph Needham&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period include [[block printing]], [[movable type|movable type printing]], phosphorescent paint, endless power [[chain drive]] and the clock escapement mechanism. The solid-fuel [[rocket]] was invented in China about 1150, nearly 200 years after the invention of [[gunpowder]] (which acted as the rocket's fuel). Decades before the West's age of exploration, the Chinese emperors of the [[Ming Dynasty]] also sent [[Treasure voyages|large fleets]] on maritime voyages, some reaching Africa.

==== Greek ====
[[File:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[aeolipile]], the earliest steam-powered device]]

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] engineers [[Ancient Greek technology|were responsible for myriad inventions and improvements to existing technology]]. The [[Hellenistic period]], in particular, saw a sharp increase in technological advancement, fostered by a climate of openness to new ideas, the blossoming of a mechanistic philosophy, and the establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] and its close association with the adjacent [[museion]]. In contrast to the typically anonymous inventors of earlier ages, ingenious minds such as [[Archimedes]], [[Philo of Byzantium]], [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]], [[Ctesibius]], and [[Archytas]] remain known by name to posterity.

Ancient Greek innovations were particularly pronounced in mechanical technology, including the ground-breaking invention of the [[watermill]] which constituted the first human-devised motive force not to rely on muscle power (besides the [[sail]]). Apart from their pioneering use of waterpower, Greek inventors were also the first to experiment with wind power (see [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]]'s windwheel) and even created the earliest steam engine (the [[aeolipile]]), opening up entirely new possibilities in harnessing natural forces whose full potential would not be exploited until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The newly devised right-angled [[gear]] and [[screw]] would become particularly important to the operation of mechanical devices. That is when the age of mechanical devices started.

[[File:Overshot water wheel schematic.svg|thumb|left|The compartmented water-wheel, here its overshot version, was invented in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]].]]

Ancient agriculture, as in any period prior to the modern age the primary mode of production and subsistence, and its irrigation methods, were considerably advanced by the invention and widespread application of a number of previously unknown water-lifting devices, such as the vertical [[water-wheel]], the compartmented wheel, the water [[turbine]], [[Archimedes' screw]], the bucket-chain and pot-garland, the [[force pump]], the [[suction pump]], the double-action [[piston pump]] and quite possibly the [[chain pump]].&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f."&gt;{{Cite book

In music, the [[water organ]], invented by Ctesibius and subsequently improved, constituted the earliest instance of a [[keyboard instrument]]. In time-keeping, the introduction of the inflow [[Water clock|clepsydra]] and its mechanization by the dial and pointer, the application of a [[feedback|feedback system]] and the [[escapement]] mechanism far superseded the earlier outflow clepsydra.

The famous [[Antikythera mechanism]], a kind of analogous computer working with a [[differential gear]], and the [[astrolabe]] both show great refinement in astronomical science.

Greek engineers were also the first to devise [[automata]] such as [[vending machine]]s, suspended ink pots, automatic [[washstand]]s, and doors, primarily as toys, which however featured many new useful mechanisms such as the [[cam]] and [[gimbal]]s.

In other fields, ancient Greek inventions include the [[catapult]] and the [[gastraphetes]] crossbow in warfare, hollow bronze-casting in metallurgy, the [[dioptra]] for surveying, in infrastructure the [[lighthouse]], [[central heating]], the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos|tunnel excavated from both ends by scientific calculations]], the [[Diolkos|ship trackway]], the [[dry dock]], and plumbing. In horizontal, vertical and transport, great progress resulted from the invention of the [[crane (machine)|crane]], the [[winch]], the [[wheelbarrow]] and the [[odometer]].

Further newly created techniques and items were [[List of ancient spiral stairs|spiral staircases]], the [[chain drive]], [[caliper|sliding calipers]] and [[shower]]s.

==== Roman ====
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created [[Roman law|laws]] providing for individual ownership, advanced stone masonry technology, advanced [[Roman road|road-building]] (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the [[reaper|Gallic reaper]] that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. Roman engineers were the first to build monumental arches, [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[reservoir]]s and [[dam]]s, vaults and domes on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day.

==== Inca, Maya, and Aztec ====
The engineering skills of the [[Inca]] and the [[Mayans]] were great, even by today's standards. An example of this great engineering is the use of pieces weighing upwards of one ton in their stonework placed together so that not even a blade can fit into the cracks. Inca villages used irrigation canals and [[drainage]] systems, making agriculture very efficient. While some claim that the Incas were the first inventors of [[hydroponics]], their agricultural technology was still soil based, if advanced.

Though the [[Maya civilization]] did not incorporate metallurgy or wheel technology in their architectural constructions, they developed complex writing and astronomical systems, and created beautiful sculptural works in stone and flint. Like the Inca, the Maya also had command of fairly advanced agricultural and construction technology. The Maya are also responsible for creating the first pressurized water system in Mesoamerica, located in the Maya site of [[Palenque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.livescience.com/5959-ancient-mayans-fountains-toilets.html|title=Ancient Mayans Likely Had Fountains and Toilets|date=December 23, 2009|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main contribution of the [[Aztec]] rule was a system of communications between the conquered cities and the ubiquity of the ingenious agricultural technology of [[chinampas]]. In [[Mesoamerica]], without draft animals for transport (nor, as a result, wheeled vehicles), the roads were designed for travel on foot, just as in the Inca and Mayan civilizations. The Aztec, subsequently to the Maya, inhereted many of the technologies and intellectual advancements of their predecessors: the [[Olmec]] (see [[Native American inventions and innovations]]).

=== Medieval to early modern ===
One of the most significant development of the Medieval era was the development of economies where water and wind power were more significant than animal and human muscle power.&lt;ref name="Stark_2005"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism and Western Success|last= Stark|first= Rodney |year= 2005 |publisher =Random House Trade Paperbacks|location= New York |isbn=0-8129-7233-3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}} Most water and wind power was used for milling grain.  Water power was also used for blowing air in [[blast furnace]], pulping rags for paper making and for felting wool.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' recorded 5,624 water mills in Great Britain in 1086, being about one per thirty families.&lt;ref name="Stark_2005"/&gt;

As earlier empires had done, the Muslim [[caliphate]]s united in trade large areas that had previously traded little. The conquered sometimes paid lower taxes than in their earlier independence, and ideas spread even more easily than goods. Peace was more frequent than it had been. These conditions fostered improvements in agriculture and other technology as well as in sciences which largely adapted from earlier Greek, Roman and Persian empires, with improvements.

==== Medieval Europe ====

[[File:Trebuchet.jpg|thumb|Medieval [[trebuchet|counterweight trebuchet]] (reconstruction)]]

{{Main|Medieval technology}}

While medieval technology has been long depicted as a step backwards in the evolution of Western technology, sometimes willfully so by modern authors intent on denouncing the church as antagonistic to scientific progress (see e.g. [[Myth of the Flat Earth]]), a generation of medievalists around the American historian of science [[Lynn White]] stressed from the 1940s onwards the innovative character of many medieval techniques. Genuine medieval contributions include for example [[mechanical clock]]s, [[spectacles]] and vertical [[windmill]]s. Medieval ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of seemingly inconspicuous items like the [[watermark]] or the [[push button|functional button]]. In navigation, the foundation to the subsequent [[age of exploration]] was laid by the introduction of pintle-and-gudgeon [[rudder]]s, [[lateen sail]]s, the [[dry compass]], the horseshoe and the [[astrolabe]].

Significant advances were also made in military technology with the development of [[plate armour]], steel [[crossbow]]s, [[trebuchet|counterweight trebuchets]] and [[cannon]]. The Middle Ages are perhaps best known for their architectural heritage: While the invention of the [[rib vault]] and [[arch|pointed arch]] gave rise to the high rising [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], the ubiquitous medieval fortifications gave the era the almost proverbial title of the 'age of castles'.

[[Papermaking]], a 2nd-century Chinese technology, was carried to the Middle East when a group of Chinese papermakers were captured in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Timeline: 8th century|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191735516.timeline.0001|website=Oxford reference|publisher=HistoryWorld|accessdate=9 April 2015|doi=10.1093/acref/9780191735516.timeline.0001|doi-broken-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papermaking technology was spread to Europe by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Safita|first1=Neathery|title=A Brief History Of Paper.|url=http://users.stlcc.edu/nfuller/paper/|accessdate=9 April 2015|date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper mill was established in Sicily in the 12th century. In Europe the fiber to make pulp for making paper was obtained from linen and cotton rags. [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] credited the spinning wheel with increasing the supply of rags, which led to cheap paper, which was a factor in the development of printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Renaissance technology ====
{{Main|Renaissance technology}}
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|left|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]
Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

Due to the casting of cannon, the [[blast furnace]] came into widespread use in France in the mid 15th century.  The blast furnace had been used in China since the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last1=Merson |first1= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, NY |isbn= 978-0879513979|page=69| postscript = A companion to the PBS Series “The Genius That Was China”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the movable cast metal type [[printing press]], whose pressing mechanism was adapted from an olive screw press, (c. 1441) lead to a tremendous increase in the number of books and the number of titles published.  Movable ceramic type had been used in China for a few centuries and woodblock printing dated back even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=}}Based on the works of Joseph Needham&lt;/ref&gt;

The era is marked by such profound technical advancements like [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perceptivity]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] or [[Bastion fortress]]es. Note books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as [[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied. Architects and engineers were inspired by the structures of [[Ancient Rome]], and men like [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] created the large dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] as a result. He was awarded one of the first [[patent]]s ever issued in order to protect an ingenious [[crane (machine)|crane]] he designed to raise the large masonry stones to the top of the structure. Military technology developed rapidly with the widespread use of the [[cross-bow]] and ever more powerful [[artillery]], as the city-states of Italy were usually in conflict with one another. Powerful families like the [[Medici]] were strong patrons of the arts and sciences. [[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement.

==== Age of Exploration ====
{{Main|Age of Exploration}}

An improved sailing ship, the (nau or [[carrack]]), enabled the [[Age of Exploration]] with the [[European colonization of the Americas]], epitomized by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[New Atlantis]]''. Pioneers like [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Cabral]], [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] and [[Christopher Columbus]] explored the world in search of new trade routes for their goods and contacts with Africa, India and China to shorten the journey compared with traditional routes overland. They produced new maps and charts which enabled following mariners to explore further with greater confidence. Navigation was generally difficult, however, owing to the [[History of longitude|problem of longitude]] and the absence of accurate [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]]. European powers rediscovered the idea of the [[civil code]], lost since the time of the Ancient Greeks.

Mines were becoming increasingly deep and were expensive to drain with horse powered bucket and chain pumps and wooden piston pumps. Some mines used as many as 500 horses. Horse-powered pumps were replaced by the [[Thomas Savery#First steam engine mechanism|Savery steam pump]] (1698) and the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engine]] (1712).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Industrial Revolution]] is characterized by developments in the areas of textile machinery, [[mining]], [[metallurgy]] and [[transport]] the [[steam engine]] and the invention of [[machine tool]]s.

Before invention of machinery to spin yarn and weave cloth, spinning was done the spinning wheel and weaving done on a hand and foot operated loom. It took from three to five spinners to supply one weaver.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David. S.|year= 1969|publisher =Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location= Cambridge, NY|isbn=  978-0521094184|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ayres| first = Robert | title =Technological Transformations and Long Waves| year = 1989 |page= | url = http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] in 1733 doubled the output of a weaver, creating a shortage of spinners. The [[spinning frame]] for wool was invented in 1738. The [[spinning jenny]], invented in 1764, was a machine that used multiple spinning wheels; however, it produced low quality thread. The [[water frame]] patented by Richard Arkwright in 1767, produced a better quality thread than the spinning jenny. The [[spinning mule]], patented in 1779 by [[Samuel Crompton]], produced a high quality thread.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"/&gt; The [[power loom]] was invented by Edmund Cartwright in 1787.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"/&gt;

In the mid 1750s the steam engine was applied to the water power-constrained iron, copper and lead industries for powering blast bellows. These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping. Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768. Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed. (Lime rich slag was not free-flowing at the previously used temperatures.) With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron. Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel. As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution was driven by cheap energy in the form of [[coal]], produced in ever-increasing amounts from the abundant resources of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Coal converted to [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] fueled higher temperature [[blast furnace]]s and produced [[cast iron]] in much larger amounts than before, allowing the creation of a  range of structures such as [[The Iron Bridge]]. Cheap coal meant that industry was no longer constrained by water resources driving the mills, although it continued as a valuable source of power. The steam engine helped drain the mines, so more coal reserves could be accessed, and the output of coal increased. The development of the high-pressure steam engine made locomotives possible, and a transport revolution followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title='The Mechanical Age': technology, innovation and industrialisation|url=https://eastanglia.academia.edu/EmmaGriffin/Books|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|publisher=Palgrave|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[steam engine]] which had existed since the early 18th century, was practically applied to both [[steamboat]] and [[railway]] transportation. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], the first purpose built railway line, opened in 1830, the [[Rocket locomotive]] of [[Robert Stephenson]] being one of its first working [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] used.

Manufacture of ships' pulley [[Block and tackle|blocks]] by all-metal machines at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in 1803 instigated the age of sustained [[mass production]]. [[Machine tools]] used by engineers to manufacture parts began in the first decade of the century, notably by [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. The development of [[interchangeable parts]] through what is now called the [[American system of manufacturing]] began in the firearms industry at the U.S Federal arsenals in the early 19th century, and became widely used by the end of the century.

=== Second Industrial Revolution (1860s–1914) ===
{{main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Stephenson's Rocket.jpg|thumb|left|The preserved ''Rocket'']]

The 19th century saw astonishing developments in transportation, construction, manufacturing and communication technologies originating in Europe. After a recession at the end of the 1830s and a general slowdown in major inventions, the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] was a period of rapid innovation and industrialization that began in the 1860s or around 1870 and lasted until [[World War I]]. It included rapid development of chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel technologies connected with highly structured technology research.

[[Telegraphy]] developed into a practical technology in the 19th century to help run the railways safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Visible Hand: The Management Revolution in American Business |last=Chandler Jr. |first= Alfred D. |year= 1993|publisher =Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn= 978-0674940529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the development of telegraphy was the patenting of the first [[telephone]]. March 1876 marks the date that Alexander Graham Bell officially patented his version of an "electric telegraph". Although Bell is noted with the creation of the telephone, it is still debated about who actually developed the first working model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-greatest-inventions-of-the-19th-century.php|title=Top 10 Greatest Inventions of the 19th Century |date=2010-08-09|work=Toptenz.net|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on improvements in vacuum pumps and materials research, [[incandescent light bulb]]s became practical for general use in the late 1870s. This invention had a profound effect on the workplace because factories could now have second and third shift workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA, USA and London, England |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoe production was mechanized during the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States|last=Thomson |first= Ross |authorlink= |year= 1989|publisher =University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0807818671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass production of [[sewing machine]]s and [[agricultural machinery]] such as reapers occurred in the mid to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles were mass-produced beginning in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"/&gt;

Steam-powered factories became widespread, although the conversion from water power to steam occurred in England before in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ironclad warship]]s were found in battle starting in the 1860s, and played a role in the opening of Japan and China to trade with the West.

=== 20th century ===

[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11|Landing on the Moon]]]]

20th-century technology developed rapidly. Broad teaching and implementation of the [[scientific method]], and increased research spending contributed to the advancement of modern science and technology. New technology improved communication and transport, thus spreading technical understanding.

[[Mass production]] brought [[automobile]]s and other high-tech goods to masses of consumers. [[Military research]] and development sped advances including electronic [[computing]] and [[jet engine]]s. [[Radio]] and [[telephony]] improved greatly and spread to larger populations of users, though near-universal access would not be possible until [[mobile phones]] became affordable to [[developing world]] residents in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

Energy and engine technology improvements included [[nuclear power]], developed after the [[Manhattan project]] which heralded the new [[Atomic Age]]. [[Rocket]] development led to long range missiles and the first [[space age]] that lasted from the 1950s with the launch of Sputnik to the mid-1980s.

[[Electrification]] spread rapidly in the 20th century. At the beginning of the century electric power was for the most part only available to wealthy people in a few major cities such as New York, London, Paris, and Newcastle upon Tyne, but by the time the [[World Wide Web]] was invented in 1990 an estimated 62 percent of homes worldwide had electric power, including about a third of households in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyfordevelopment.com/2014/11/rural-electrification-by-numbers-1970_2.html|title=Two Billion People Gain Electricity Access: 1970–2010|website=www.energyfordevelopment.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rural developing world.

[[Birth control]] also became widespread during the 20th century. [[Electron microscopes]] were very powerful by the late 1970s and genetic theory and knowledge were expanding, leading to developments in [[genetic engineering]].

The first "[[test tube baby]]" [[Louise Brown]] was born in 1978, which led to the first successful [[gestational surrogacy]] pregnancy in 1985 and the first pregnancy by [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] in 1991, which is the implanting of a single sperm into an egg. [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] was first performed in late 1989 and led to successful births in July 1990. These procedures have become relatively common.

The massive data analysis resources necessary for running transatlantic research programs such as the [[Human Genome Project]] and the [[Large Electron-Positron Collider]] led to a necessity for distributed communications, causing Internet protocols to be more widely adopted by researchers and also creating a justification for [[Tim Berners-Lee]] to create the [[World Wide Web]].

[[Vaccination]] spread rapidly to the developing world from the 1980s onward due to many successful humanitarian initiatives, greatly reducing childhood mortality in many poor countries with limited medical resources.

The US [[National Academy of Engineering]], by expert vote, established the following ranking of the most important technological developments of the 20th century:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greatest Engineering Achievements of the 20th Century|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/|website=greatachievements.org|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===

[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|thumb|The [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s have provided huge amounts of information by functioning well beyond NASA's original lifespan estimates.]]

{{Main|2000s in science and technology}}

In the early 21st century research is ongoing into [[quantum computers]], [[gene therapy]] (introduced 1990), [[3D printing]] (introduced 1981), [[nanotechnology]] (introduced 1985), [[bioengineering]]/[[biotechnology]], [[nuclear technology]], [[Materials science|advanced materials]] (e.g., graphene), the [[scramjet]] and [[Unmanned combat air vehicle|drones]] (along with [[railgun]]s and high-energy laser beams for military uses), [[superconductivity]], the [[memristor]], and green technologies such as [[alternative fuel]]s (e.g., [[fuel cells]], self-driving electric and plug-in hybrid cars), [[augmented reality]] devices and [[wearable electronics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and more efficient and powerful [[LEDs]], [[solar cells]], [[integrated circuits]], [[wireless power]] devices, engines, and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].

Perhaps the greatest research tool built in the 21st century is the [[Large Hadron Collider]], the largest single machine ever built. The understanding of [[particle physics]] is expected to expand with better instruments including larger [[particle accelerator]]s such as the LHC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Largest Science Experiment comes to Northern Ireland|url=https://www.stfc.ac.uk/2668.aspx|website=Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council|accessdate=9 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413064023/https://www.stfc.ac.uk/2668.aspx|archivedate=13 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and better [[neutrino detector]]s. [[Dark matter]] is sought via underground detectors and observatories like [[LIGO]] have started to detect [[gravitational wave]]s.

Genetic engineering technology continues to improve, and the importance of [[epigenetics]] on development and inheritance has also become increasingly recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/nov/cover|title=DNA Is Not Destiny: The New Science of Epigenetics |publisher=DiscoverMagazine.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New [[spaceflight]] technology and [[spacecraft]] are also being developed, like the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] and [[Dragon V2|Dragon]]. New, more capable [[Space observatory|space telescopes]], such as the [[James Webb Space Telescope|James Webb Telescope]], to be launched to orbit in early 2021, and the [[Extremely large telescope#Colossus Telescope|Colossus Telescope]] are being designed. The [[International Space Station]] was completed in the 2000s, and [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] plan a [[manned mission to Mars]] in the 2030s. The [[Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket]] (VASIMR) is an electro-magnetic thruster for spacecraft propulsion and is expected to be tested in 2015.

[[Breakthrough Initiatives]], together with famed physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], plan to send [[Breakthrough Starshot|the first ever spacecraft to visit another star]], which will consist of numerous super-light chips driven by [[Electric propulsion]] in the 2030s, and receive images of the [[Proxima Centauri]] system, along with, possibly, the [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets|potentially habitable planet]] [[Proxima Centauri b]], by midcentury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3|title=Breakthrough Initiatives|website=breakthroughinitiatives.org|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2004 saw the [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|first manned commercial spaceflight]] when [[Mike Melvill]] crossed the [[boundary of space]] on June 21, 2004.

}}'''ICBA''' (International Center for Biosaline Agriculture) is an international, non-profit agricultural research and development center which focuses on the closely linked issues of water, environment, income, and [[food security]]. ICBA conducts research and development programs that aim to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability in marginal environments.

Its headquarters are in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and it is a founding member of the [[Association of International Research and Development Centers for Agriculture]] (AIRCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airca.org/index.php/airca-members|title=AIRCA Members|website=www.airca.org|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a member of Middle East and North Africa Network of Water Centers of Excellence&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://menanwc.org/about-network/current-members/international-center-biosaline-agriculture-icba|title=International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA)|website=Middle East and North Africa Network of Water Centers of Excellence|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apaari.org/about/members/|title=Members : APAARI|website=Asia Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1992, the [[Islamic Development Bank]] (IDB) initiated a series of expert consultations which outlined the objectives and activities of the new institute. In November 1992, the IDB Board of Executive Directors approved financing for start-up operations. Subsequent consultations between the Bank and the General Secretariat of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] led to the selection of the United Arab Emirates as a host country for the new center.

In 1996, the IDB and the Government of the UAE signed an agreement to establish ICBA as a formal entity. In 1997, the Municipality of Dubai donated 100 hectares of land at Al Ruwayyah, where ICBA's head office is now based. The center became operational in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319057675|title=Environmental Cost and Face of Agriculture in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries|last=Shahid|first=Shabbir A.|last2=Ahmed|first2=Mushtaque|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-3-319-05768-2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICBA’s founding donors were the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the [[OPEC Fund for International Development]] (OFID), the [[Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development]] (AFESD), and the [[Politics of the United Arab Emirates|Government of the United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).

Currently the Center is funded by the three core donors: the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment of the UAE (formerly the Ministry of Environment and Water); the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi; and the Islamic Development Bank. The Center has additional support from several development agencies and international donors such as&amp;nbsp;the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), the UAE Government, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Municipalities, and the private sector in Oman and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470290187.ch16/summary|title=The Role of Biosaline Agriculture in Managing Freshwater Shortages and Improving Water Security|last=Al-Attar|first=Mohammad|date=2003|publisher=Iowa State Press|isbn=9780470290187|editor-last=Scanes|editor-first=Colin G.|pages=271–280|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470290187.ch16|editor-last2=Miranowski|editor-first2=John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inayatullah|first=Sohail|last2=Elouafi|first2=Ismahane A.|date=2014|title=The alternative futures of the International Centre for Biosaline Agriculture: from salinity research to greening the desert|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/FS-08-2013-0030|journal=Foresight|volume=16|issue=5|pages=389–409|doi=10.1108/FS-08-2013-0030|issn=1463-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and development focus ==
[[file:Ismahane Elouafi (cropped).jpg|thumb|Dr Ismahane Elouafiis the center's director (2015)]]
Initially ICBA focused solely on biosaline environments but its applied research for development now aims to address agricultural challenges in all marginal environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Its tasks include assessment of natural resources, [[Adaptation to global warming|climate change adaptation]], [[Agricultural productivity|crop productivity]] and diversification, [[aquaculture]], [[bioenergy]] and policy analysis.

ICBA works on a number of technological developments, including the use of conventional and non-conventional water (such as saline, [[Wastewater|treated wastewater]], [[Industrial water treatment|industrial water]], [[agricultural drainage]], and seawater);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/Scientists_finding_ways_to_help_farmers_maximise_ground_water-GN_29032015_300309/|title=Scientists finding ways to help farmers maximise ground water|last=Ponce de Leon|first=Janice|date=29 March 2015|website=Thomson Reuters ZAWYA|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muslim-science.com/icba-oasis-desert/|title=ICBA – An Oasis in the Desert|date=2 August 2014|website=Muslim Science|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; water and land management technologies; and [[remote sensing]] and modeling for climate change adaptation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Center conducts research on a variety of food crops which hold promise of being resilient, salt tolerant and water efficient. For example, ICBA has been conducting widespread research on [[quinoa]], a multi-purpose, high-protein grain crop which is drought and salt tolerant. ICBA initiated research on a number of quinoa germplasm accessions since 2006–07. The selections from these trials are being introduced to farmers in several countries, e.g. in the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://raconteur.net/sustainability/more-meat-eaters-means-uk-farmers-can-cash-in|title=UK farming addresses global meat demand|last=Wale|first=Michael|date=29 July 2015|website=Raconteur|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icbawebsiteyn6lbe9b4h.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/GulfTimes_quinoa_19072015.pdf|title=Proper value chain needed for Quinoa|last=Banerjee|first=Thirtho|date=19 July 2015|work=The Gulf Time|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICBA scientists are also working to increase the salinity tolerance of hardier traditional crops such as [[date palm]]s, [[sorghum]] and [[millet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/saltwater-saviors/30923|title=Saltwater Saviours|last=Cadei|first=Emily|date=15 April 2014|website=OZY|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another field of research lies with ''[[Salicornia]]'' and other [[halophyte]]s (salt-loving plants) that remove salts from saline soils and water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Salicornia’s'' oil-bearing seeds produce biofuel, cosmetic oil and edible vegetable oil. Its straws can also be used as animal fodder, and its vegetable tips can be harvested for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://technologyreview.me/en/materials/salicornia-biofuel/|title=Why research won’t give up on Salicornia|last=Hashem|first=Heba|date=25 March 2015|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414091919/http://technologyreview.me/en/materials/salicornia-biofuel/|archivedate=14 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reach ==
The geographic scope of ICBA has grown since its inception. It now focusses its work on water-scarce countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) including Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC), Central Asia and the Caucasus (CAC) and South and Southwest Asia. It is currently expanding to include countries of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-0519-7_3|title=Turning Adversity into an Advantage for Food Security Through Improving Soil Quality and Providing Production Systems for Marginal Saline Lands: ICBA Perspectives and Approach|last=Shahid|first=Shabbir A.|last2=Taha|first2=Faisal K.|last3=Ismail|first3=Shoaib|last4=Dakheel|first4=Abdullah|last5=Abdelfattah|first5=Mahmoud|date=2011|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400705180|editor-last=Behnassi|editor-first=Mohamed|pages=43–67|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-0519-7_3|editor-last2=Shahid|editor-first2=Shabbir A.|editor-last3=D'Silva|editor-first3=Joyce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">The '''International Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English''' ('''ICAME''') is an international group of linguists and data scientists working in [[corpus linguistics]] to digitise [[English language|English]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corpus Linguistics and Beyond: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on English Language Research on Computerized Corpora|volume=59|page=vi|publisher=Rodopi|year=1987|isbn=978-9-062-03569-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was founded in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] in 1977 as the International Computer Archive of Modern English, before being renamed to its current title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Corpus Linguistics|first=Graeme|last=Kennedy|publisher=Routledge|p=85|isbn=978-1-317-89258-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portal to their materials is hosted at the [[University of Bergen]], where they have set out the aim of the organization to "collect and distribute information on English language material available for computer processing and on linguistic research to compile an archive of English text corpora in [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] form, and to make material available to research institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://clu.uni.no/icame/|title = ICAME|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating computer corpora, i.e. collections of texts in machine-readable form, is the most accessible way to study both transcribed spoken language and various genres of written texts for modern scholars, including both "descriptive and more theoretically-minded linguists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = ICAME-Quo Vadis? Reflections on the use of computer corpora in linguistics|last = Johansson|first = Stig|authorlink=Stig Johansson (linguist)|date = 1994|journal = Computers and the Humanities |volume=28 |issue=4-5 |pages=243–252|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICAME group hosts academic conferences that focus on corpus linguistic studies of historical changes and contemporary grammatical descriptions of English, and makes corpora of different varieties of English available to scholars, starting with editions of the 1960s [[Brown Corpus]]. Their first academic conference was held in [[Bergen, Norway]] in 1979, and scholars who were interested in corpus linguistics continued to meet each spring in different European and English-speaking countries. At these meetings, the compilation and distribution of corpora they enabled played a key role in the creation of the field of corpus linguistics in the 20th century, a precursor to current big data analytics. In summarizing the field, Kennedy's ''Introduction to Corpus Linguistics'' notes that "for corpus linguists with an interest in the description of English, the International Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English has been the major resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Corpus Linguistics|last = Kennedy|first = Graeme|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014 |isbn = |location = |pages = ch. 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of ICAME on the field has also be laid out in Facchinetti's history, ''Corpus Linguistics Twenty-five Years On''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Corpus Linguistics Twenty-Five Years On|last = Facchinetti|first = Roberta|publisher = Brill / Rodopi|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One influential resource that ICAME made available was a CD of 20 different corpora, including those covering different regional Englishes (such as the [[Australian Corpus of English]], the [[Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English]], the [[Kolhapur Corpus of Indian English]], the [[Bergen Corpus of London Teenage Language]] (COLT), the [[Helsinki Corpus of Older Scots]], and the [[International Corpus of English]]—East-African component), as well as versions of the Brown Corpus and the [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus|Lancaster-Bergen-Oslo]] (LOB) corpus tagged for [[part of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = ICAME collection of English language corpora [CD]|last = Hofland|first = K.|publisher = |year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICAME also published an annual journal, the ''ICAME Journal'', formerly ''ICAME News'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/supplement/s15025462_International_Computer_Archive_of_Modern_and_Medieval_English.pdf|title = degruyter ICAME supplement|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that contains articles, conference reports, reviews and notices related to corpus linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://linguistlist.org/pubs/journals/get-journals.cfm?JournalID=6657|title = The LinguistList--ICAME Journal|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current editors of the ''ICAME Journal'' are Merja Kytö and [[Anna-Brita Stenström]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://clu.uni.no/icame/journal.html|title = ICAME Journal|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism|Aspects}}

'''Marxist geography''' is a strand of [[critical geography]] that uses the theories and philosophy of [[Marxism]] to examine the [[Spatial analysis|spatial relations]] of [[human geography]]. In Marxist geography, the relations that geography has traditionally analyzed — natural environment and spatial relations — are reviewed as outcomes of the mode of material production. To understand geographical relations, on this view, the social structure must also be examined. Marxist geography attempts to change the basic structure of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peet |first1=J. Richard |title=An Introduction to Marxist Geography |journal=Journal of Geography |date=1985 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=5–10 |doi=10.1080/00221348508979261|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ312759&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ312759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and methodology==

Marxist geography is [[Political_radicalism|radical]] in nature and its primary criticism of the positivist [[spatial science]] centered on the latter's methodologies, which failed to consider the characteristics of [[capitalism]] and abuse that underlie socio-spatial arrangements. As such, early Marxist geographers were explicitly political in advocating for social change and activism; they sought, through application of geographical analysis of social problems, to alleviate [[poverty]] and exploitation in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David. 1973. "Social Justice and the City"&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist geography makes exegetical claims regarding how the deep-seated structures of capitalism act as a determinant and a constraint to human agency. Most of these ideas were developed in the early 1970s by dissatisfied quantitative geographers; [[David Harvey]] is generally regarded as the primary trail-blazer of the Marxist movement in human geography.

In order to accomplish such philosophical aims, these geographers rely heavily upon Marxist social and economic theory, drawing on [[Marxian economics]] and the methods of [[historical materialism]] to tease out the manner in which the means of [[production control]] human spatial distribution in capitalist structures. [[Karl Marx|Marx]] is also invoked to examine how spatial relationships are affected by [[social class|class]]. The emphasis is on structure and structural mechanisms.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}} 
A '''mathematical model''' is a description of a [[system]] using [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and [[Language of mathematics|language]]. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed '''mathematical modeling'''. Mathematical models are used in the [[natural science]]s (such as [[physics]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], [[chemistry]]) and [[engineering]] disciplines (such as [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]]), as well      as in the [[social sciences]] (such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]]). 

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.

== Elements of a mathematical model ==

Mathematical models can take many forms, including [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].  These and other types of models can overlap, with a given  model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include [[model theory|logical models]].  In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments.  Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.

In the [[physical sciences]], a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements:
# [[Governing equation|Governing equations]]
# Supplementary sub-models
## [[Defining equation (physics)|Defining equations]]
## [[Constitutive equation|Constitutive equations]]

== Classifications ==
Mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and ''[[variable (mathematics)|variables]]''. Relationships can be described by ''[[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]'', such as algebraic operators, functions, differential operators, etc. Variables are abstractions of system [[parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] of interest, that can be [[Quantification (science)|quantified]]. Several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure:
* '''Linear vs. nonlinear:''' If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit [[linear]]ity, the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear. A model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise. The definition of linearity and nonlinearity is dependent on context, and linear models may have nonlinear expressions in them.  For example, in a [[Linear model|statistical linear model]], it is assumed that a relationship is linear in the parameters, but it may be nonlinear in the predictor variables.  Similarly, a differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written with linear [[differential operator]]s, but it can still have nonlinear expressions in it.  In a [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] model, if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by [[linear equation]]s, then the model is regarded as a linear model.  If one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] equation, then the model is known as a nonlinear model.&lt;br&gt;Nonlinearity, even in fairly simple systems, is often associated with phenomena such as [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and [[irreversibility]].  Although there are exceptions, nonlinear systems and models tend to be more difficult to study than linear ones.  A common approach to nonlinear problems is [[linearization]], but this can be problematic if one is trying to study aspects such as irreversibility, which are strongly tied to nonlinearity.
* '''Static vs. dynamic:''' A ''dynamic'' model  accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system, while a ''static'' (or steady-state) model calculates the system in equilibrium, and thus is time-invariant.  Dynamic models typically are represented by [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s.
* '''Explicit vs. implicit:''' If all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations, the model is said to be ''explicit''. But sometimes it is the ''output'' parameters which are known, and the corresponding inputs must be solved for by an iterative procedure, such as [[Newton's method]] (if the model is linear) or [[Broyden's method]] (if non-linear). In such a case the model is said to be ''implicit''. For example, a [[jet engine]]'s physical properties such as turbine and nozzle throat areas can be explicitly calculated given a design [[thermodynamic cycle]] (air and fuel flow rates, pressures, and temperatures) at a specific flight condition and power setting, but the engine's operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties.
* '''Discrete vs. continuous:''' A [[discrete modeling|discrete model]] treats objects as discrete, such as the particles in a [[molecular model]] or the states in a [[statistical model]]; while a [[continuous model]] represents the objects in a continuous manner, such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows, temperatures and stresses in a solid, and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge.
* '''Deterministic vs. probabilistic (stochastic):''' A [[deterministic system|deterministic]] model is one in which every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables; therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions. Conversely, in a stochastic model—usually called a "[[statistical model]]"—randomness is present, and variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by [[probability]] distributions.
* '''Deductive, inductive, or floating:''' A deductive model is a logical structure based on a theory. An inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them. The floating model rests on neither theory nor observation, but is merely the invocation of expected structure. Application of mathematics in social sciences outside of economics has been criticized for unfounded models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stanislav Andreski |first=Stanislav |last=Andreski |year=1972 |title=Social Sciences as Sorcery |publisher=[[St. Martin’s Press]] |isbn=0-14-021816-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[catastrophe theory]] in science has been characterized as a floating model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Clifford Truesdell |first=Clifford |last=Truesdell |year=1984 |title=An Idiot’s Fugitive Essays on Science |pages=121–7 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-90703-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance in the natural sciences ==
Mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences, particularly in [[physics]]. Physical [[theory|theories]] are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models.

Throughout history, more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] accurately describe many everyday phenomena, but at certain limits [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]] must be used; even these do not apply to all situations and need further refinement{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Examples|date=September 2017}}. It is possible to obtain the less accurate models in appropriate limits, for example relativistic mechanics reduces to Newtonian mechanics at speeds much less than the [[speed of light]]. Quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics when the quantum numbers are high. For example, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] of a tennis ball is insignificantly small, so classical physics is a good approximation to use in this case.

It is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things. Massless ropes, point particles, [[ideal gases]] and the [[particle in a box]] are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by [[molecular orbital]] models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In [[engineering]], physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as [[finite element analysis]].

Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe. [[Euclidean geometry]] is much used in classical physics, while [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] are examples of theories that use [[geometry|geometries]] which are not Euclidean.

== Some applications==&lt;!--whatever this section is, it isn't background (original heading), and isn't general--&gt;
Since [[prehistory|prehistorical times]] simple models such as [[map]]s and [[Mathematical diagram|diagrams]] have been used.

Often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized, they use a mathematical model. In analysis, engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work, or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system. Similarly, in control of a system, engineers can try out different control approaches in [[simulation]]s.

A mathematical model usually describes a system by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables. Variables may be of many types; [[Real number|real]] or [[integer]] numbers, [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values or [[String (computing)|strings]], for example. The variables represent some properties of the system, for example, measured system outputs often in the form of [[Signal (electronics)|signals]], [[Chronometry|timing data]], counters, and event occurrence (yes/no). The actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables.

== Building blocks ==
In [[business]] and [[engineering]], mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output. The system under consideration will require certain inputs. The system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too: [[decision theory|decision variables]], [[state variable]]s, [[Exogeny|exogenous]] variables, and [[random variable]]s.

Decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables.  Exogenous variables are sometimes known as [[parameter]]s or [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s.
The variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision, input, random, and exogenous variables.  Furthermore, the output variables are dependent on the state of the system (represented by the state variables).

[[Goal|Objective]]s and [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s of the system and its users can be represented as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the output variables or state variables.  The [[objective function]]s will depend on the perspective of the model's user.  Depending on the context, an objective function is also known as an ''index of performance'', as it is some measure of interest to the user.  Although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have, using or optimizing the model becomes more involved (computationally) as the number increases.

For example, [[economist]]s often apply [[linear algebra]] when using [[input-output model]]s. Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of [[vector space|vectors]] where one symbol represents several variables.

== A priori information ==
[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|480px|To analyse something with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.]]

Mathematical modeling problems are often classified into [[black box]] or [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] models, according to how much [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]] information on the system is available. A black-box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available. A white-box model (also called glass box or clear box) is a system where all necessary information is available. Practically all systems are somewhere between the black-box and white-box models, so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take.

Usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate. Therefore, the white-box models are usually considered easier, because if you have used the information correctly, then the model will behave correctly. Often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables. For example, if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system, we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an [[exponential decay|exponentially decaying]] function. But we are still left with several unknown parameters; how rapidly does the medicine amount decay, and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood? This example is therefore not a completely white-box model. These parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model.

In black-box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions. Using a priori information we could end up, for example, with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately. If there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models. An often used approach for black-box models are [[artificial neural network|neural networks]] which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data. Alternatively the NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs) algorithms which were developed as part of [[nonlinear system identification]] &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. (2013), ''Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to select the model terms, determine the model structure, and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise. The advantage of NARMAX models compared to neural networks is that NARMAX produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process, whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque.

=== Subjective information ===
Sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model.  This can be done based on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[experience]], or [[expert opinion]], or based on convenience of mathematical form.  [[Bayesian statistics]] provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis: we specify a [[prior probability distribution]] (which can be subjective), and then update this distribution based on empirical data.

An example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once, recording whether it comes up heads, and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads.  After bending the coin, the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown; so the experimenter would need to make a decision (perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin) about what prior distribution to use.  Incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability.

== Complexity ==
In general, model complexity involves a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the model.  [[Occam's razor]] is a principle particularly relevant to modeling, its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power, the simplest one is the most desirable.  While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including [[numerical instability]].  [[Thomas Kuhn]] argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a [[paradigm shift]] offers radical simplification {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[classical mechanics]] is an approximated model of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the [[speed of light]], and we study macro-particles only.

== Training and tuning ==
Any model which is not pure white-box contains some [[parameter]]s that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe. If the modeling is done by an [[artificial neural network]] or other [[machine learning]], the optimization of parameters is called ''training''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Why|date=September 2017}}, while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called ''tuning'' and often uses [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. In more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions, parameters are often determined by ''[[curve fitting]]''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

== Model evaluation ==
A crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately.  This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation.

=== Fit to empirical data ===
Usually the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model fits experimental measurements or other empirical data.  In models with parameters, a common approach to test this fit is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters.  An accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model's parameters. This practice is referred to as [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] in statistics.

Defining a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool of assessing model fit.  In statistics, decision theory, and some [[economic model]]s, a [[loss function]] plays a similar role.

While it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters, it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model.  In general, more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of [[statistical model]]s than models involving [[differential equations]].  Tools from [[non-parametric statistics]] can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form.

=== Scope of the model ===
Assessing the scope of a model, that is, determining what situations the model is applicable to, can be less straightforward.  If the model was constructed based on a set of data, one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a "typical" set of data.

The question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called [[interpolation]], and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called [[extrapolation]].

As an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model, in evaluating Newtonian [[classical mechanics]], we can note that Newton made his measurements without advanced equipment, so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light.  Likewise, he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles, but macro particles only. It is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains, even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics.

=== Philosophical considerations ===
Many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about [[causality]].  This is usually (but not always) true of models involving differential equations.  As the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world, the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations, but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model. One can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions. One can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied.

An example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of [[optimal foraging theory]] do not offer insight that goes beyond the common-sense conclusions of [[evolution]] and other basic principles of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pyke | first1 = G. H. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515 | title = Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 15 | pages = 523–575 | year = 1984 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* One of the popular examples in [[computer science]] is the mathematical models of various machines, an example is the [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) which is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but due to the deterministic nature of a DFA, it is implementable in hardware and software for solving various specific problems. For example, the following is a DFA M with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s.

[[File:DFAexample.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[state diagram]] for ''M'']]
''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F'') where
*''Q'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;},
*Σ = {0, 1},
*''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
*''F'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, and
*δ is defined by the following [[state transition table]]:
:{| border="1" cell padding="1" cell spacing="0"
| || &lt;center&gt;'''0'''&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;'''1'''&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

The state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, ''M'' will finish in state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.

The language recognized by ''M'' is the [[regular language]] given by the [[regular expression]] 1*( 0 (1*) 0 (1*) )*, where "*" is the [[Kleene star]], e.g., 1* denotes any non-negative number (possibly zero) of symbols "1".

* Many everyday activities carried out without a thought are uses of mathematical models. A geographical [[map projection]] of a region of the earth onto a small, plane surface  is a model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landinfo.com/resources_dictionaryMP.htm landinfo.com, definition of map projection]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for many purposes such as planning travel.
* Another simple activity is predicting the position of a vehicle from its initial position, direction and speed of travel, using the equation that distance traveled is the product of time and speed. This is known as [[dead reckoning]] when used more formally. Mathematical modeling in this way does not necessarily require formal mathematics; animals have been shown to use dead reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallistel |first= |title=The Organization of Learning |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1990 |ISBN=0-262-07113-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whishaw | first1 = I.

* ''[[Population]] Growth''. A simple (though approximate) model of population growth is the [[Malthusian growth model]]. A slightly more realistic and largely used population growth model is the [[logistic function]], and its extensions. 
* ''Model of a particle  in a potential-field''. In this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass which describes a trajectory in space which is modeled by a function giving its coordinates in space as a function of time. The potential field is given by a function &lt;math&gt;V\!:\mathbb{R}^3\!\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the trajectory, that is a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\!:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, is the solution of the [[differential equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt; -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}m=\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial x}\mathbf{\hat{x}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial y}\mathbf{\hat{y}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}, &lt;/math&gt;

that can be written also as:

::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\nabla V[\mathbf{r}(t)]. &lt;/math&gt;

:Note this model assumes  the particle is a point mass, which is certainly known to be false in many cases in which we use this model; for example, as a model of planetary motion.

* ''Model of rational behavior for a consumer''.  In this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of ''n'' commodities labeled 1,2,...,''n'' each with a market price ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The consumer is assumed to have an [[ordinal utility]] function ''U'' (ordinal in the sense that only the sign of the differences between two utilities, and not the level of each utility, is meaningful), depending on the amounts of commodities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed.  The model further assumes that the consumer has a budget ''M'' which is used to purchase a vector ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in such a way as to maximize ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  The problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem, that is:
:: &lt;math&gt; \max U(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:: subject to:
:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i \leq M.&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; x_{i} \geq 0   \; \; \; \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n \} &lt;/math&gt;
: This model has been used in a wide variety of economic contexts, such as in [[general equilibrium theory]] to show existence and [[Pareto efficiency]] of economic equilibria.

"Narrative Analysis" (Newbury Park: Sage Publications).&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative inquiry uses field texts, such as stories, autobiography, journals, field notes, letters, conversations, [[interview]]s, family stories, photos (and other artifacts), and life experience, as the units of analysis to research and understand the way people create meaning in their lives as [[narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Jean Clandinin and F. Michael Connelly, Narrative Inquiry: Experience and Story in Qualitative Research (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 2000), 98–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative inquiry has been employed as a tool for analysis in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[organizational studies]], [[knowledge]] theory, [[sociology]], [[occupational science]] and [[education]] studies, among others. Other approaches include the development of [[quantitative methods]] and tools based on the large volume capture of fragmented anecdotal material, and that which is self signified or indexed at the point of capture.&lt;ref&gt;Snowden D (2010) Naturalizing Sensemaking' in Mosier and Fischer (eds) Informed by Knowledge: Expert Performance pp 223-234&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative Inquiry challenges the philosophy behind quantitative/grounded data-gathering and questions the idea of “objective” data, however, it has been criticized for not being “theoretical enough."&lt;ref&gt;David M. Boje,'' Narrative Methods for Organizational and Communication Research'' (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2001), 83, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clandinin and Connelly, 42. See also Laurel Richardson, “Narrative and Sociology,” in ''Representation in Ethnography'', edited by John Van Maanen (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Narrative inquiry is a form of [[qualitative research]], that emerged in the field of [[management science]] and later also developed in the field of [[knowledge management]], which shares the sphere of [[Information Management]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Harlan Cleveland]], ''The Knowledge Executive: Leadership in an Information Society'' (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus Narrative Inquiry focuses on the organization of human knowledge more than merely the collection and processing of [[data]]. It also implies that knowledge itself is considered valuable and noteworthy even when known by only one person.

[[Knowledge management]] was coined as a discipline in the early 1980s as a method of identifying, representing, sharing, and communicating [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nico Stehr]] and Richard V. Ericson, eds., ''The Culture and Power of Knowledge: Inquiries into Contemporary Societies'' (New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1992); and, [[Fritz Machlup]], ''Knowledge and Knowledge Production'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge management]] and Narrative Inquiry share the idea of [[Knowledge transfer]], a theory which seeks to transfer unquantifiable elements of knowledge, including [[experience]].  Knowledge, if not communicated, becomes arguably useless, literally unused.

Philosopher [[Andy Clark]] speculates that the ways in which minds deal with [[narrative]] (second-hand information) and [[memory]] (first-hand perception) are cognitively indistinguishable.  Narrative, then, becomes an effective and powerful method of transferring knowledge.

== Narrative ways of knowing ==

[[Narrative]] is a powerful tool in the transfer, or sharing, of knowledge, one that is bound to cognitive issues of [[memory]], constructed memory, and perceived memory. [[Jerome Bruner]] discusses this issue in his 1990 book, ''Acts of Meaning'', where he considers the narrative form as a non-neutral [[rhetorical]] account that aims at “illocutionary intentions,” or the desire to [[communicate]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome S. Bruner]], Acts of Meaning (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990), 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique might be called “[[narrative]]” or defined as a particular branch of [[storytelling]] within the narrative method.  Bruner’s approach places the narrative in time, to “assume an experience of time” rather than just making reference to historical time.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Polkinghorne, ''Narrative Knowing and the Human Sciences'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1988), 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

This narrative approach captures the emotion of the moment described, rendering the event active rather than passive, infused with the latent meaning being communicated by the teller.  Two concepts are thus tied to narrative storytelling: memory and notions of time, both as time as found in the past and time as re-lived in the present.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Jacques Le Goff]], ''History and Memory'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative method accepts the idea that knowledge can be held in stories that can be relayed, stored, and retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald E. Fry, ''Appreciative Inquiry and Organizational Transformation: Reports from the Field'' (Westport: CN: Quorum Books, 2002), 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
1. '''Develop''' a [[research question]]
*A qualitative study seeks to learn why or how, so the writer’s research must be directed at determining the why and how of the research topic. Therefore, when crafting a research question for a qualitative study, the writer will need to ask a why or how question about the topic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Research question]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
2. '''Select''' or produce raw data 
*The raw data tend to be [[interview]] transcriptions, but can also be the result of field notes compiled during [[participant observation]] or from other forms of data collection that can be used to produce a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, Amanda &amp; Paul Atkinson (1996). "Making Sense of Qualitative Data." Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. '''Organize''' data
*According to psychology professor Donald Polkinghorne, the goal of organizing data is to refine the research question and separate irrelevant or redundant information from that which will be eventually analyzed, sometimes referred to as "narrative smoothing."&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative studies in education, Vol. 8, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some approaches to organizing data are as follows: 
:(When choosing a method of organization, one should choose the approach best suited to the research question and the goal of the project. For instance, Gee's method of organization would be best if studying the role language plays in narrative construction whereas Labov's method would more ideal for examining a certain event and its effect on an individual's experiences.)&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis". Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. ''Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology''. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Labov]]'s: Thematic organization&lt;ref&gt;William Labov (1972). Some principles of linguistic methodology. Language in Society, 1, pp 97-120 doi:10.1017/S0047404500006576&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Synchronic Organization''. 
::This method is considered useful for understanding major events in the narrative and the effect those events have on the individual constructing the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach utilizes an "evaluation model" that organizes the data into an abstract (What was this about?), an orientation (Who? What? When? Where?), a complication (Then what happened?), an evaluation (So what?), a result (What finally happened?), and a coda (the finished narrative).&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Said narrative elements may not occur in a constant order; multiple or reoccurring elements may exist within a single narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Polkinghorne's: Chronological Organization or ''Diachronic Organization''
::also related to the sociology of stories approach that focuses on the contexts in which narratives are constructed. This approach attends to the "embodied nature" of the person telling the narrative, the context from which the narrative is created, the relationships between the narrative teller and others within the narrative, historical continuity, and the chronological organization of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story with a clear beginning, middle, and end is constructed from the narrative data. Polkinghorne makes the distinction between narrative analysis and analysis of narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative analysis utilizes "narrative reasoning" by shaping data in a narrative form and doing an in-depth analysis of each narrative on its own, whereas analysis of narratives utilizes [[paradigmatic]] reasoning and analyzes themes across data that take the form of narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]]'s functional approach focuses on what roles narratives serve for different individuals. In this approach, narratives are viewed as the way in which individuals construct and make sense of reality as well as the ways in which meanings are created and shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered a functional approach to narrative analysis because the emphasis of the analysis is focused on the work that the narrative serves in helping individuals make sense of their lives, particularly through shaping random and chaotic events into a coherent narrative that makes the events easier to handle by giving them meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of this form of analysis is on the interpretations of events related in the narratives by the individual telling the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[James Paul Gee|Gee]]'s approach of structural analysis focuses on the ways in which the narrative is conveyed by the speaker with particular emphasis given to the interaction between speaker and listener.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In this form of analysis, the language that the speaker uses, the pauses in speech, discourse markers, and other similar structural aspects of speech are the focus. In this approach, the narrative is divided into [[stanzas]] and each stanza is analyzed by itself and also in the way in which it connects to the other pieces of the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daiute|first=Colette &amp; Cynthia Lightfoot|title=Narrative Analysis: Studying the Development of Individuals in Society|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Jaber F. Gubrium's]] form of narrative ethnography features the storytelling process as much as the story in analyzing narrativity.  Moving from text to field, he and his associate James A. Holstein present an analytic vocabulary and procedural strategies for collecting and analyzing narrative material in everyday contexts, such as families and care settings. In their view, the structure and meaning of texts cannot be understood separate from the everyday contexts of their production.  Their two books--"Analyzing Narrative Reality" and "Varieties of Narrative Analysis" provide dimensions of an institutionally-sensitive, constructionist approach to narrative production.

*There are a multitude of ways of organizing narrative data that fall under narrative analysis; different types of research questions lend themselves to different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C. K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the approach, qualitative researchers organize their data into groups based on various common traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. '''Interpret''' data
*Some paradigms/theories that can be used to interpret data:

*While interpreting qualitative data, researchers suggest looking for patterns, themes, and regularities as well as contrasts, paradoxes, and irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:(The research question may have to change at this stage if the data does not offer insight to the inquiry.)
 
*The interpretation is seen in some approaches as co-created by not only the interviewer but also with help from the interviewee, as the researcher uses the interpretation given by the interviewee while also constructing their own meaning from the narrative. 
:With these approaches, the researcher should draw upon their own knowledge and the research to label the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

* According to some qualitative researchers, the goal of data interpretation is to facilitate the interviewee's experience of the story through a narrative form.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative studies in education, Vol. 8, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretive research ==
The idea of imagination is where narrative inquiry and [[storytelling]] converge within narrative methodologies. Within narrative inquiry, storytelling seeks to better understand the “why” behind human action.&lt;ref&gt;Nona Lyons and Vicki Kubler LaBoskey, ''Narrative Inquiry in Practice: Advancing the Knowledge of Teaching'' (New York: Teachers College Press, 2002), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Story collecting as a form of narrative inquiry allows the research participants to put the [[data]] into their own words and reveal the latent “why” behind their assertions.

“[[Interpretive research]]” is a form of field research methodology that also searches for the subjective "why."&lt;ref&gt;H. Klein and M. D. Myers, “A Set of Principles for Conducting and Evaluating Interpretive Field Studies” ''MIS Quarterly'' 23, no. 1 (1999): 67–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretive research, using methods such as those termed “storytelling” or “narrative inquiry,” does not attempt to predefine [[independent variables]] and [[dependent variables]], but acknowledges context and seeks to “understand phenomena through the meanings that people assign to them.”&lt;ref&gt;Heinz K. Klein and Michael D. Myers, “A Set of Principles for Conducting and Evaluating Interpretive Field Studies in Information Systems,” ''MIS Quarterly'' 23, no. 1 (March 1999): 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two influential proponents of a narrative research model are [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. In his work on experiential, embodied metaphors, Johnson encourages the researcher to challenge “how you see knowledge as embodied, embedded in a culture based on narrative unity,” the “construct of continuity in individual lives.”&lt;ref&gt;Clandinin and Connelly, ''Narrative Inquiry'', 3. See also George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, ''Metaphors We Live By'' (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven “functions of narrative work” as outlined by Riessman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riessman|first1=Catherine|title=Narrative Methods for the Human Sciences|date=2008|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1. Narrative constitutes past experiences as it provides ways for individuals to make sense of the past. 
2. Narrators argue with stories.
3. Persuading. Using rhetorical skill to position a statement to make it persuasive/to tell it how it “really” happened. To give it authenticity or ‘truth’.
4. Engagement, keeping the audience in the dynamic relationship with the narrator. 
5. Entertainment.
6. Stories can function to mislead an audience.
7. Stories can mobilize others into action for progressive change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riessman|first1=Catherine|title=Narrative Methods for the Human Sciences|date=2008|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Narrative analysis therefore can be used to acquire a deeper understanding of the ways in which a few individuals organize and derive meaning from events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
. It can be particularly useful for studying the impact of social structures on an individual and how that relates to identity, intimate relationships, and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=David M.|title=Stigma and Intimacy in Same Sex Relationships: A Narrative Approach|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2011|volume=25|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

*[[Feminist]] scholars have found narrative analysis useful for data collection of perspectives that have been traditionally [[marginalized]]. The method is also appropriate to [[cross-cultural]] research.  As Michael Brecher and Frank P. Harvey advocate, when asking unusual questions it is logical to ask them in an unusual manner.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brecher and Frank P. Harvey (2002). ''Millennial Reflections on International Studies'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press), 326.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Developmental Psychology]] utilizes narrative inquiry to depict a child's experiences in areas such as self-regulation, problem-solving and development of self.&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personality uses the narrative approach in order to illustrate an individual's identity over a lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;McAdams, D.P. &amp; Zeldow, P.B. (1993). Construct validity and content analysis. Journal of Personality Assessment, 61. 243-245.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social movements have used narrative analysis in their persuasive techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Polkinghorne (1995). Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Political practices. Stories are connected to the flow of power in the wider world. Some narratives serve different purposes for individuals and others, for groups. Some narratives overlap both individual experiences and social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leave|first1=Patricia|title=Method Meets Art: Arts Based Research Practice|date=2009|publisher=Guliford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promulgation of a culture: Narratives and storytelling are used to remember past events, reveal morals, entertain, relate to one another, and engage a community. Narrative inquiry helps to create an identity and demonstrate/carry on cultural values/traditions. Stories connect humans to each other and to their culture. These cultural definitions aid to make social knowledge accessible to people who are unfamiliar with the culture/situation. An example of this is how children in a given society learn from their parents and the culture around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leave|first1=Patricia|title=Method Meets Art: Arts Based Research Practice|date=2009|publisher=Guliford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Undersea Research Program''' (NURP) is a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] program that operates six facilities for undersea research, including the world's only permanent undersea research facility, [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius]]. The program is operated under the auspices of the [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]], a division of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). Each center is funded by a grant from NOAA. Projects are chosen based upon peer review.

'''Organisational semiotics''' examines the nature, characteristics and features of [[information]], and studies how information can be best used in the context of organised activities and business domains. Organisational semiotics treats organisations as [[information systems]] in which information is created, processed, distributed, stored and used. It benefits from the research of [[semiotics]] in various schools, and further develops its theoretical frameworks, methods and techniques for understanding, analysing, modelling, designing and implementing of information systems.

==History==

Organizational semiotics started around 1973 with [[Ronald Stamper]]’s seminal book on Information (Stamper, 1973), a book that was intended to be the first chapter of a book on information systems design called ‘organizational semiotics’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Featured as an interdisciplinary undertaking, researchers working in the community of organisational semiotics come from different backgrounds and work together on the theoretical and practical issues relating to organisational and technical problems. From the first international meeting on organisational semiotics in 1995, the community aims to develop the subject into a science of information systems, as claimed at the IFIP 8.1 Working Conference.&lt;ref&gt;“Organisational Semiotics: Evolving a science of information systems”, book edited by [[Kecheng Liu]], Rodney J.

'''Perceptual computing''' is an application of [[Lotfi A. Zadeh|Zadeh]]'s theory of [[Computing with words and perceptions|computing with words]] on the field of assisting people to make subjective judgments.

==Perceptual computer==

The ''perceptual computer'' – ''Per-C'' – an instantiation of perceptual computing – has the architecture that is depicted in Fig. 1 [2]–[6]. It consists of three components: encoder, CWW engine and decoder. Perceptions – words – activate the Per-C and are the Per-C output (along with data); so, it is possible for a human to interact with the Per-C using just a vocabulary.

[[File:PerC.jpg|below|Figure 1. Architecture for the perceptual computer.]]

A vocabulary is application (context) dependent, and must be large enough so that it lets the end-user interact with the Per-C in a user-friendly manner. The encoder transforms words into [[fuzzy set]]s (FSs) and leads to a ''codebook'' – words with their associated FS models. The outputs of the encoder activate a Computing With Words&lt;ref&gt;Lotfi Zadeh [7], the father of fuzzy logic, coined the phrase computing with words, and stated: ''“CWW is a methodology in which the objects of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language. [It is] inspired by the remarkable human capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. CWW may have an important bearing on how humans … make perception-based rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth.”'' He did not mean that computers would actually compute using words—single words or phrases—rather than numbers. He meant that computers would be activated by words, which would be converted into a mathematical representation using fuzzy sets (FSs), and that these FSs would be mapped by a CWW engine into some other FS, after which the latter would be converted back into a word. Zadeh’s definition of CWW is very general and does not refer to a specific field in which CWW would be used. ''Perceptual computing'' focuses on CWW for making subjective judgments.&lt;/ref&gt; (CWW) engine, whose output is one or more other FSs, which are then mapped by the decoder into a recommendation (subjective judgment) with supporting data. The recommendation may be in the form of a word, group of similar words, rank or class.

Although there are lots of details needed in order to implement the Per-C’s three components – encoder, decoder and CWW engine – and they are covered in [5], it is when the Per-C is applied to specific applications, that the focus on the methodology becomes clear. Stepping back from those details, the ''methodology of perceptual computing'' is:

# Focus on an application (''A'').
# Establish a vocabulary (or vocabularies) for ''A''.
# Collect interval end-point data from a group of subjects (representative of the subjects who will use the Per-C) for all of the words in the vocabulary.
# Map the collected word data into word-FOUs by using the ''Interval Approach'' [1], [5, Ch. 3]. The result of doing this is the ''codebook'' (or codebooks) for ''A'', and completes the design of the encoder of the Per-C.
# Choose an appropriate CWW engine for ''A''. It will map IT2 FSs into one or more IT2 FSs. Examples of CWW engines are: IF-THEN rules [5, Ch. 6] and Linguistic Weighted Averages [6], [5, Ch. 5].
# If an existing CWW engine is available for ''A'', then use its available mathematics to compute its output(s). Otherwise, develop such mathematics for the new kind of CWW engine. The new CWW engine should be constrained&lt;ref&gt;This (new) constraint is the major difference between perceptual computing and function approximation applications of FSs and systems.&lt;/ref&gt; so that its output(s) resemble the FOUs in the codebook(s) for ''A''.
# Map the IT2 FS outputs from the CWW engine into a recommendation at the output of the decoder. If the recommendation is a word, rank or class, then use existing mathematics to accomplish this mapping [5, Ch. 4]. Otherwise, develop such mathematics for the new kind of decoder.

==Applications of Per-C==

To-date a Per-C has been implemented for the following four applications: (1) investment decision-making, (2) social judgment making, (3) distributed decision making, and (4) hierarchical and distributed decision-making. A specific example of the fourth application is the so-called ''Journal Publication Judgment Advisor'' [5, Ch. 10] in which for the first time only words are used at every level of the following hierarchical and distributed decision making process:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''n'' reviewers have to provide a subjective recommendation about a journal article that has been sent to them by the Associate Editor, who then has to aggregate the independent recommendations into a final recommendation that is sent to the Editor-in-Chief of the journal. Because it is very problematic to ask reviewers to provide numerical scores for paper-evaluation sub-categories (the two major categories are ''Technical Merit'' and ''Presentation''), such as importance, content, depth, style, organization, clarity, references, etc., each reviewer will only be asked to provide a linguistic score for each of these categories. They will not be asked for an overall recommendation about the paper because in the past it is quite common for reviewers who provide the same numerical scores for such categories to give very different publishing recommendations. By leaving a specific recommendation to the associate editor such inconsistencies can hope to be eliminated. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How words can be aggregated to reflect each reviewer’s recommendation as well as the expertise of each reviewer about the paper’s subject matter is done using a linguistic weighted average. Although the journal publication judgment advisor uses reviewers and an associate editor, the word “reviewer” could be replaced by judge, expert, low-level manager, commander, referee, etc., and the term “associate editor” could be replaced by control center, command center, higher-level manager, etc. So, this application has potential wide applicability to many other applications.

Recently, a new Per-C based [[Failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) methodology was developed, with its application to [[edible bird's nest]] farming, in [[Borneo]], has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chai K.C.|author2=Tay K. M.|author3=Lim C.P. | title=A perceptual computing-based method to prioritize failure modes in failure mode and effect analysis and its application to edible bird nest farming |journal=Applied Soft Computing |volume=49|year=2016|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494616304379 |doi=10.1016/j.asoc.2016.08.043
 |pages= 734–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Per-c fmea.png|center|thumb|A Perceptual Computing Based Failure Mode and Effect Analysis Methodology]]

In summary, the Per-C (whose development has taken more than a decade) is the first complete implementation of Zadeh’s CWW paradigm, as applied to assisting people to make subjective judgments.

[[File:Pratt Institute - Report of students enrolled for Library Department for 1890.jpg|thumb|right|A listing of the students from 1890 enrolled in the morning and afternoon cataloging classes, as well as a list of students enrolled in the Library training class.]]
[[Charles Pratt]], founder of [[Pratt Institute]], recognized the need for a library that served both the faculty and students of the Institute as well as [[Brooklyn]] residents. He also recognized the need to have a facility for training of library staff. In June 1890, Pratt Institute offered courses in cataloging and library economics.&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;Richardson Jr., John V.

''The Origins of the American Library School.'' New York: Scarecrow Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mary Wright Plummer]], who was a graduate of [[Melvil Dewey]]’s class of 1888 from [[Columbia University]], led it.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt; In 1896, the Library School relocated to Pratt's new library building designed by [[William Tubby]], which continues to act as Pratt Institute’s primary library.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;

Under Plummer's leadership, the school enacted a stiff entrance exam and exams in German and French.&lt;ref name="brand"&gt;Brand, Barbara B.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcT2xjeOEQoC&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;ots=tuZGPdabTR&amp;dq=margaret%20healy%20pratt&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Pratt Institute Library School: The Perils of Professionalization."]  In Suzanne Hildenbrand (Ed.), ''Reclaiming the American Library Past: Writing the Women In'', pp. 251-278.  Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  The entering class was consistently around 25 students.&lt;ref name="brand" /&gt; In 1911 when Plummer left to direct the Training School at New York Public Library, [[Josephine Adams Rathbone]] was appointed vice-director. Both Plummer and Rathbone were elected as presidents of the [[American Library Association]].

Notable alumni from this early period include [[Anne Carroll Moore]], who was a student of [[Mary Wright Plummer]], and became a faculty member and the first children’s librarian at [[New York Public Library]], serving in that position for 35 years (1906–1941).&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;

''Encyclopædia Britannica. '' http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/647365/Mary-Elizabeth-Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Pratt began to grant the degree of [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor of science]] in library science and, in 1950, the master of library science degree.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt; Notable figures from the twentieth century include [[Nasser Sharify]], who worked to develop the field of international librarianship as dean and professor from 1968 to 1987.&lt;ref name="sharify_papers"&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf309n99dt/entire_text/ Scope and content of collection], Nasser Sharify papers, Hoover Institution Archives. Accessed March 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Nasser Sharify stepped into the role of Dean in 1968, the school’s name changed to the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS).  This would reflect the advances in technology and information science and Pratt’s embrace of these changes.  “This action went far beyond a mere change in nomenclature,” Dean Sharify wrote in his 1978 history of the school. “Rather, the new designation gave recognition to an emerging and important new discipline [Information Science].”&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;

In the aftermath of Pratt’s name change, the school rewrote its goals and objectives and began to expand its technology holdings.  In need of more space for computer labs, GSLIS moved from the library on the Brooklyn campus to its own building, the Information Science Center (ISC), in 1974.  It included laboratories built for more hands-on technical computer study, including an instructional materials lab, an information science lab, and a technical processes lab.

[[File:A class in the Pratt Institute Library School, 1897.jpg|thumb|A class in the Pratt Institute Library School, 1897.]]The school celebrated its centennial in 1990. In the [[United States House of Representatives]], New York Congressman [[Major Owens]] (first librarian to serve in Congress) gave a salute to Pratt Institute's library school "both for its 100th anniversary, and for being the oldest such library program in the country."&lt;ref&gt;101st Congress, 2nd Session, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:E16OC0-431:/ A Salute to Pratt Institute's Library Science Department on Its 100th Anniversary].

In art and archaeology, in sculpture as well as in painting, a '''register''' is a horizontal level in a work that consists of several levels arranged one above the other, especially where the levels are clearly separated by lines.  Modern [[comic books]] typically use similar conventions. It is thus comparable to a row, or a line in modern texts. In the study of ancient writing, such as [[cuneiform]] and Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]s, "register" may be used of vertical compartments like columns containing writing that are arranged side by side and separated by lines, especially in [[cylinder seal]]s, which often mix text and images.  Normally, when dealing with images it only refers to row compartments stacked vertically.  

Among many other cultures, the use of registers is common in [[Ancient Egyptian art]], from the [[Narmer Palette]] onwards, and in [[medieval art]] in large [[fresco]]s and [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  [[Narrative art]], especially covering the lives of sacred figures, is often presented as a sequence of small scenes arranged in registers.  

Sculpted [[Luwian language hieroglyphs]] were also usually arranged in registers one above the other. The direction of reading ran from one of the top corners, and reversed direction in each lower register, so that the reader did not have to start at the other end of each new row.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Peter T., ''The World's Writing Systems'', pp. 120-121, 1996, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0195079930}}, 9780195079937, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ospMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples, in the [[art of Mesopotamia]], are [[Kudurru]], or boundary stones, which often had registers of [[god]]s on the upper registers of the scenes.

'''Rhizome''' is a philosophical concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (1972–1980) project. It is what Deleuze calls an "image of thought," based on the [[rhizome|botanical rhizome]], that apprehends [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicities]].

==As a mode of knowledge and model for society==
Deleuze and Guattari use the terms "rhizome" and "rhizomatic" to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation. In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', they oppose it to an [[arborescent]] (hierarchic, tree-like) conception of knowledge, which works with dualist categories and binary choices. A rhizome works with planar and trans-species connections, while an arborescent model works with vertical and linear connections. Their use of the "orchid and the wasp" is taken from the biological concept of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], in which two different species interact together to form a [[multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] (i.e. a unity that is multiple in itself). [[Hybridisation (biology)|Hybridization]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]] would also be good illustrations.

"As a model for culture, the rhizome resists the organizational structure of the root-tree system which charts causality along chronological lines and looks for the original source of 'things' and looks towards the pinnacle or conclusion of those 'things.' A rhizome, on the other hand, is characterized by 'ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.' Rather than narrativize history and culture, the rhizome presents history and culture as a map or wide array of attractions and influences with no specific origin or genesis, for a 'rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo.' The planar movement of the rhizome resists chronology and organization, instead favoring a nomadic system of growth and propagation.

"In this model, culture spreads like the surface of a body of water, spreading towards available spaces or trickling downwards towards new spaces through fissures and gaps, eroding what is in its way. The surface can be interrupted and moved, but these disturbances leave no trace, as the water is charged with pressure and potential to always seek its equilibrium, and thereby establish smooth space."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhizomes.net/issue5/poke/glossary.html Rhizomes.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

Deleuze and Guattari introduce ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' by outlining the concept of the rhizome (quoted from ''A Thousand Plateaus''):

*1 and 2. Principles of connection and heterogeneity: "...any point of a rhizome can be connected to any other, and must be";
*3. Principle of multiplicity: it is only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, "multiplicity", that it ceases to have any relation to the One;
*4. Principle of asignifying rupture: a rhizome may be broken, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines;
*5 and 6. Principle of cartography and [[decalcomania]]: a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model; it is a "map and not a tracing".

'''Richard Sylvan''' (13 December 1935 – 16 June 1996) was a [[philosopher]], [[logician]], and [[environmentalist]].

== Biography ==
Sylvan was born '''Francis Richard Routley''' in [[Levin, New Zealand]], and his early work is cited with this surname. He studied at Victoria University College of the University of New Zealand (now [[Victoria University of Wellington]]), and then [[Princeton University]], before taking positions successively at several Australian institutions, including the [[University of Sydney]]. From 1971 until his death in [[Bali, Indonesia]], he was a fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]]. 

Sylvan was married to the philosopher/environmentalist [[Val Plumwood|Val Routley]] (later, Val Plumwood), with whom he worked closely for twenty years before their separation in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, Dominic (2014). Eco-Logical Lives. The Philosophical Lives of Richard Routley/Sylvan and Val Routley/Plumwood. Cambridge: White Horse Press.&lt;/ref&gt; After his divorce from Plumwood, he married Louise Sylvan (née Mirlin) in 1983 and adopted the last name ''Sylvan'' (an English word meaning "of the forest") to reflect his love of the forest and commitment to [[environmentalism]].

== Work in logic and metaphysics ==
Sylvan was instrumental in the development and study of [[relevance logic]]. In 1972, Sylvan (in a paper co-authored with Plumwood) proposed a semantics for certain relevant logics that had been developed by American philosophers [[Nuel Belnap]] and [[Alan Ross Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Routley, R. and V. Routley (1972). “Semantics of First Degree Entailment”, Noûs, 3: 335-359.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Robert K. Meyer, Routley turned this into a semantics for a large number of logical systems.
Their work in logic work helped make ANU a center for the study of non-classical logic in general. Routley's work had particular influence for [[Graham Priest]], a well-known proponent of non-classical logic; Sylvan and Priest edited a well-regarded volume on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, G., Routley, R., and Norman, J. (eds.) (1989). Paraconsistent Logic: Essays on the Inconsistent, München: Philosophia Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Priest in turn influenced Sylvan; they met in 1976 at the Australasian Association of Logic conference in Canberra at a time when Sylvan was doing novel work on [[dialetheism]] — the view that some contradictions are true.&lt;ref&gt;See Routley, Richard and Meyer, Robert K. (1976), "Dialectical Logic, Classical Logic and the Consistency of the World", Studies in Soviet Thought 16: 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after meeting Priest, then investigating a logic capable of handling such true contradictions, Sylvan also endorsed the view.&lt;ref&gt;Routley, Richard (1979), "Dialectical Logic, Semantics and Metamathematics", Erkenntnis 14: 301-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylvan's studies ranged over a variety of topics in [[logic]] and the [[philosophy of logic]]. He wrote important papers on [[free logic]], general [[modal logic]],&lt;ref&gt;"Existence and identity in quantified modal logics," Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic 10: 113-149 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[natural deduction]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;"A simple natural deduction system," Logique et Analyse 12: 129-152 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of his most important work in logic was dedicated to relevant logic, for which he authored numerous papers (both technical and expository).

From early in his career (and for many years after), Sylvan defended a sophisticated [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]]-inspired ontology (which he called "noneism"), first presented in his 1966 paper, "Some Things Do Not Exist."&lt;ref&gt;Routley, Richard (1966): “Some Things Do Not Exist”. Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic 7, 251–276.&lt;/ref&gt; After several more papers in the 1970s, the theory was given a book-length treatment in 1980, ''Exploring Meinong's Jungle and Beyond''.&lt;ref&gt;Routley, Richard (1982). Exploring Meinong's Jungle and Beyond. Ridgeview Pub Co&lt;/ref&gt; The view—also defended in recent years by Priest&lt;ref&gt;Priest, Graham (2005): Towards Non-Being. The Logic and Metaphysics of Intentionality. Oxford: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt;—utilizes a [[modal logic|modal theory]] including "impossible worlds" to deal with supposed objects, like the "round square." Sylvan's formulation is logically consistent, and avoids certain paradoxes associated with Meinong's original ontology; although, like many Meinongian views, it faces criticism due to its presumed ontological implausibility.&lt;ref&gt;Reicher., "Non-Existent Objects", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2006), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonexistent-objects/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, Dominic (2001), ‘Richard (Routley) Sylvan: Writings on Logic and Metaphysics’,  History and Philosophy of Logic 22: 181-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental ethics and politics ==

Outside of logic and metaphysics, Sylvan was a proponent of so-called deep environmental ethics in the study of [[environmental ethics]] (following shallow/deep distinction formulated by [[Arne Næss]]). In his important 1973 paper "Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental, Ethic?",&lt;ref&gt;Routley, Richard (1973), "Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental, Ethic?", Proceedings of the XVth World 
Congress of Philosophy, Varna, 1: 205-10. Reprinted in "Environmental Philosophy: from Animal Rights to Radical Ecology", (ed. M. Zimmerman et al.), Prentice Hall: New Jersey, 1993, pp.12-21.&lt;/ref&gt; he defended a then-unorthodox account of the intrinsic value of the non-human, natural world. For this he was sometimes considered a defender of [[deep ecology]], but he was in fact very critical of much of the domain.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan, Richard (1985), "A Critique of Deep Ecology", Discussion Papers in Environmental Philosophy #12, Department of Philosophy, Research School of the Social Sciences, Australian National University: Canberra, 60 pages. Also in serialised form: ‘A Critique of Deep Ecology, Part I’, Radical Philosophy 40 (1985): 2-12; and ‘A Critique of Deep Ecology, Part II’, Radical Philosophy 41 (1985): 10-22.  Reprinted in M. Redelift and G. Woodgate (eds), The Sociology of the Environment, Edward Elgar: London, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s, Sylvan published several other notable articles and books on environmental ethics and issues,&lt;ref&gt;Beginning with: Routley, R., 1973. “Is there a need for a new, an environmental ethic?” Proceedings of the 15th World congress of Philosophy, vol. 1 pp. 205-10, Sophia: Sophia Press; and Routley, R. and Routley, V. (1973), "The Fight for the Forests: the Takeover of Australian Forests for Pines, Wood Chips and Intensive Forestry", Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra. Subsequently: Routley, Richard and Routley, Val (1979), "Against the Inevitability of Human Chauvinism" in K.E. Goodpaster and K.M. Sayre (eds), Ethics and the Problems of the 21st Century, Notre Dame University Press: South Bend, Indiana; Routley, R. and V. (1980), "Human Chauvinism and Environmental Ethics" in D. Mannison, M. McRobbie and R. Routley (eds), Environmental Philosophy, Department of Philosophy Monograph Series #2, Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University, pp. 96-189; Routley, R. and Routley, V. (1980), "Destructive Forestry in Melanesia and Australia", The Ecologist 10: 56-67; Routley, R. and Routley, V. (1985), "An Expensive Repair-Kit for Utilitarianism", Discussion Papers in Environmental Philosophy #7, Department of Philosophy, Research School of the Social Sciences, Australian National University: Canberra, pp. 21-55; and Sylvan, R. (1994), "Mucking With Nature" in ''Against the Main Stream: Critical Environmental Essayes, Discussion Papers in Environmental Philosophy'' {{sic}} #20, Department of Philosophy, Research School of the Social Sciences, Australian National University: Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt; and he co-authored the 1994 book ''The Greening of Ethics'' with David Bennett.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan, Richard, Bennett, David, 1994. The Greening of Ethics, Cambridge: White Horse Press.&lt;/ref&gt; From his work in environmental ethics, Sylvan took an interest in [[anarchism]], contributing an often-cited entry on the subject to ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvan, Richard (1995). "Anarchism". in Goodwin, Robert E. and Pettit. A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy. Philip. Blackwell Publishing. p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Sibelius Museum''' ([[Finnish language|'''Finnish''']]: ''&lt;span lang="fi" dir="ltr"&gt;Sibelius-museo&lt;/span&gt;'', '''[[Swedish language|Swedish]]''': ''&lt;span lang="sv" dir="ltr"&gt;Sibeliusmuseum&lt;/span&gt;'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/|title=Home - Sibeliusmuseum|website=Sibeliusmuseum|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[museum]] of [[music]], named after the [[Finland|Finnish]] composer [[Jean Sibelius]]. The museum is located close to [[Turku Cathedral]] in the historical city centre of [[Turku]] on the [[Southwest Finland|southwest coast of Finland]]. It is the only museum devoted to [[Music of Finland|music in Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kansanmusiikkikansantanssi.fi/yhteiso/sibeliusmuseum-sibelius-museo|title=Sibeliusmuseum / Sibelius-museo|date=2012-01-04|work=Kansanmusiikki.fi|access-date=2018-07-25|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum houses a wide collection of historical music instruments from around the world. The archives of the museum include documents (sheet music, manuscripts, recordings, photographs, concert programmes, etc.) The museum was first founded during the 1920s as a seminar for the Department of [[Musicology]] at [[Åbo Akademi University]], and has later developed into its own department. The Museum is currently organised and funded by the Åbo Akademi Foundation. The current building was built and opened in 1968 and it was designed by architect Woldemar Baeckman.

== General information about the Museum ==
The museum consists of two primary exhibitions: the instrument collection and the Sibelius exhibition. The instrument collections circles around the concert hall of the museum, The Sibelius Hall, and continues to the second floor downstairs. The Sibelius exhibition is located at the furthest left corner seen from the ticket counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/exhibitions/|title=Exhibitions - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also organises thematic exhibitions. In 2018, these exhibitions are “''Sibbe50”'' and ''“A cantata for the doctors – Music at academic ceremonies”. “´Sibbe50”'' celebrates the architecture of Woldemar Baeckman and the 50th anniversary of the current museum building. The exhibition “''A cantata for the doctors – Music at academic” ceremonies'' covers music performed at conferment ceremonies in [[Education in Finland|Finnish]] [[University|universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/exhibitions/news/|title=Thematic exhibitions - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sibelius Museum also organises concerts at the museum, of which the most notable is the museum’s own concert series, the Wednesday series that has been organised since 1968. In addition to these concerts, there are also other concerts organised at the museum. The programme of the concert varies depending on the performer, but mostly the music played at The Sibelius Museum is focused on [[jazz]], [[folk music]] and [[Classical music|classical]] [[chamber music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/concerts/|title=Concerts - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sibbe_yksityiskohta.jpg|alt=|thumb|381x381px|Details of the facade]]

The archives of The Sibelius Museum dates back to the collections of professor [[Otto Andersson (musicologist)|Otto Andersson]] of the Musicological Department at Åbo Akademi University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/archive/|title=Archive - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives contain material from several different aspects of musical life in Finland, such as manuscripts, photographs and recordings. There are additionally several special collections in the archives. These collections include an extensive collection about Jean Sibelius, the Otto Andersson archival collection and the archive of the Musical Society of [[Turku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/archive/collections/|title=Collections - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the exhibitions and the archives, there are also a couple of auditoriums and classrooms in the premises of the museum. For instance, the auditoriums [[Per Brahe the Younger|Brahe]] and Flora that have been named after the student choirs of Åbo Akademi University, [[Brahe Djäknar]] and [[Florakören]].&lt;ref name="Berggren &amp; Landen 2017 256"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Väggarna talar: Åbo Akademis byggnader under hundra år|last=Berggren &amp; Landen|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Flyygeli_Sibelius-salissa.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|347x347px|A grand piano in The Sibelius Hall]]

=== Time before the museum: Pehr Kalm and the botanical garden ===
At the site of The Sibelius Museum, the botanical garden of the [[Royal Academy of Turku]] ('''[[Swedish language|Swedish]]''': ''&lt;span lang="sv" dir="ltr"&gt;Kungliga Akademien I Åbo&lt;/span&gt;'', '''[[Finnish language|Finnish:]]''' &lt;span lang="fi" dir="ltr"&gt;Kuninkaallinen Turun Akatemia&lt;/span&gt;) was located. [[Pehr Kalm]], a pupil of [[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linné]], founded the garden in 1757.&lt;ref name="Berggren &amp; Landen 2017 254"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Väggarna talar: Åbo Akademis byggnader under hundra år|last=Berggren &amp; Landen|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the garden, he planted plants from his trips to [[North America]] and [[Russia]]. After the [[Great Fire of Turku|great fire of Turku]] in 1827, the only plant that survived was an [[Oak|oak tree]] that stands between the bank of the [[Aura (Archipelago Sea)|river Aura]] and the current museum building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Väggarna talar: Åbo Akademis byggnader under hundra år|last=Berggren &amp; Landen|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turun seudun arkkitehtuuriopas|last=Laaksonen &amp; Nummelin|first=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fire, printer Christian Ludvig Hjelt bought the site of the garden in 1831 and built a couple of wooden houses on the plot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Väggarna talar: Åbo Akademis byggnader under hundra år|last=Berggren &amp; Landen|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Åbo Akademi University ===
In 1923, Ellen and [[Magnus Dahlström]] donated the site of the garden to the Åbo Akademi Foundation in a will.&lt;ref name="Berggren &amp; Landen 2017 254"/&gt; Attempts to restore the garden to its original state were made during the 1930s, during which Justus Montell aimed at planting his collections next to the oak from Kalm’s era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After he died in [[1954]] the attempts were ended, which lead to the decaying of the garden and demolitions of the houses built by Hjelt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Otto Andersson as the founder of the Musicological Department and Archives ===
[[File:Sibelius-museo,_yksityiskohta.jpg|alt=|thumb|376x376px|Further details on the wall]]
The foundations of the proper historical music museum were already made in 1926, when [[Otto Andersson (musicologist)|Otto Andersson]] was granted the professorship of the recently established Department of [[Musicology]] and [[Folklore]] at [[Åbo Akademi University]].&lt;ref name="History - Sibeliusmuseum"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sibeliusmuseum.fi/en/museum/history/|title=History - Sibeliusmuseum|work=Sibeliusmuseum|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship-owner [[Robert Mattson (businessman)|Robert Mattson]] donated the necessary funds to fund the professorship and to purchase materials for the collection and the seminar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farbror Otto: Över bygden skiner sol|last=Andersson|first=Matts|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Mattson’s son, Curt, had donated a notable collection of instruments from all around the world for the collections of professor Andersson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farbror Otto: Över bygden skiner sol|last=Andersson|first=Matts|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea behind the collections was, however, to form a seminar for the Department of Musicology that would have as large of a [[library]] as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farbror Otto: Över bygden skiner sol|last=Andersson|first=Matts|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Museum receives its current name ===
Before the year 1949, The Sibelius Museum did not yet have a proper name, and it was simply known as ''“The historical music collections of Åbo Akademi University”.''&lt;ref name="Andersson 2018 182"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farbror Otto: Över bygden skiner sol|last=Andersson|first=Matts|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History - Sibeliusmuseum"/&gt; In the late 1940s, an exhibition about the composer [[Jean Sibelius]] was organised. There were several items placed in the exhibition varying from sheet music to letters and manuscripts. Some journalist miscalled the exhibition “The Sibelius Museum”, which aroused controversy between professor Andersson and the rector of Åbo Akademi University G.O. Rosenqvist. To avoid any further confusion about the exhibition, professor Andersson sent a letter to the composer, in which he asked a formal permission to use the name of Sibelius in official contexts. The composed replied in 16 January 1949 with the following words:&lt;ref name="Andersson 2018 182"/&gt;{{Quote|text=“It is with great pleasure I agree on that the historical music collections of the school of Åbo Akademi shall bear the name “Sibelius Museum”. To you, I am deeply grateful for the friendly interest you have always shown towards my life and my art. It has followed something unique from this; from that, Åbo Akademi University has the greatest collection in existence. It gives me pride and joy to accept this.”|sign=Jean Sibelius|source=}}After the name change, the museum received its first permanent premises in the house that currently works as the restaurant Hus Lindman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://huli.fi/historia|title=Historia - Hus Lindman - Ravintola Turku|work=Hus Lindman - Ravintola Turku|access-date=2018-07-25|language=fi-FI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the manor at Piispankatu 15, “''The Sibelius Museum”'' had seven rooms in use, to which the collections and the administrative areas were placed. At the same time, new acquisitions were increased. For example, Andersson travelled with these purposes in America during the 1950s. The years in this building turned out to be long and hard, and hopes for an exclusive building for the museum were arisen.&lt;ref name="Andersson 2018 182"/&gt;

=== The planning of the current building ===
Towards the end of the 1950s, several discussions were made between the city of [[Turku]] and [[Åbo Akademi University]] to build a joint museum about [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Wäinö Aaltonen]]. The idea was put forward with the thought of using the site of the garden from Kalm’s era as the base for the museum. This joint venture, however, dissolved and only the plans to build The Sibelius Museum advanced. Regardless of this, the city of Turku still funded the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Väggarna talar: Åbo Akademis byggnader under hundra år|last=berggren &amp; Landen|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pilareita_Sibelius-salissa.jpg|alt=|thumb|Pilars in The Sibelius Hall]]
Architect Woldemar Baeckman was during the 1960s assigned to design the building for the museum for Åbo Akademi University. In his original plans, he had planned a separate wing for the choir activities of the university. Before the final plans, a couple of investigations were made in 1963 and 1966. The conclusion of these investigations was to give up this thought of building a separate wing and the focus was put on the main building. During the autumn of 1966, the final plans were finished and during the next year, the construction work started. The construction of the building was completed in February 1968, during which the building was put in use.&lt;ref name="Berggren &amp; Landen 2017 256"/&gt;

==Architectural design==
[[File:Sibbe_atrium.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|358x358px|The Atrium of The Sibelius Museum]]
The building is a notable example of the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] concrete architecture of its time, though Baeckman's earlier architecture was more classically modernist in style, most notably the extension to the Åbo Akademi University Library. The exterior architecture is notable for the grains of the timber [[formwork]] being visible in the prefabricated concrete facades. The interior is particularly notable for the large hyperbolic paraboloid-shaped concrete shell structure, said to have been influenced by the then contemporaneous architecture of the Mexican architect [[Félix Candela]]. In the centre of the building is a hidden courtyard which originally had a garden (since demolished) designed by noted Finnish garden designer Maj-Lis Rosenbröijer.

A '''sign''' is an [[Physical body|object]], [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], event, or [[entity]] whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, [[thunder]] is a sign of storm, or medical [[symptom]]s signify a disease. A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a [[full stop]] signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a [[language]], as well as bodily [[gesture]]s, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, [[road sign]]s, etc., collectively known as [[signage]]) generally inform or instruct using [[written text]], [[symbol]]s, [[picture]]s or a combination of these.

The philosophical study of signs and [[symbol]]s is called [[semiotics]]; this includes the study of [[semiosis]], which is the way in which [[sign (semiotics)|signs (in the semiotic sense)]] operate.

[[Semiotics]], [[epistemology]], logic, and [[philosophy of language]] are concerned about the nature of signs, what they are and how they signify.  The nature of signs and symbols and significations, their definition, elements, and types, is mainly established by [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Aquinas]]. According to these classic sources, significance is a relationship between two sorts of things: signs and the kinds of things they signify (intend, express or mean), where one term necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. Distinguishing natural signs and conventional signs, the traditional theory of signs ([[Augustine]]) sets the following threefold partition of things:
all sorts of indications, evidences, symptoms, and physical signals, there are signs which are ''always'' signs (the entities of the mind as ideas and images, thoughts and feelings, constructs and intentions); and there are signs that ''have'' to get their signification (as linguistic entities and cultural symbols). So, while natural signs serve as the source of signification, the human mind is the agency through which signs signify naturally occurring things, such as objects, states, qualities, quantities, events, processes, or relationships. Human [[language]] and [[discourse]], [[communication]], [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[poetry]], [[theology]], and [[religion]] are only some of fields of human study and activity where grasping the nature of signs and symbols and patterns of signification may have a decisive value. Communication takes place without words but via the mind as a result of signs and symbols; They communicate/pass across/ messages to the human mind through their pictorial representation.

===St. Augustine and signs===
[[St. Augustine]] was the first man who synthesized the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs. For him a sign is a thing which is used to signify other things and to make them come to mind (''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (hereafter DDC) 1.2.2; 2.1.1). The most common signs are spoken and written words (DDC 1.2.2; 2.3.4-2.4.5). Although God cannot be fully expressible, Augustine gave emphasis to the possibility of God’s communication with humans by signs in Scripture (DDC 1.6.6).  Augustine endorsed and developed the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs.  Among the mainstream in the theories of signs, i.e., that of Aristotle and that of Stoics, the former theory filtered into the works of Cicero (106-43 BC, ''De inventione rhetorica'' 1.30.47-48) and Quintilian (circa 35-100, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 5.9.9-10), which regarded the sign as an instrument of inference.  In his commentary on Aristotle’s ''De Interpretatione'', Ammonius said, "according to the division of the philosopher Theophrastus, the relation of speech is twofold, first in regard to the audience, to which speech signifies something, and secondly in regard to the things about which the speaker intends to persuade the audience." If we match DDC with this division, the first part belongs to DDC Book IV and the second part to DDC Books I-III. Augustine, although influenced by these theories, advanced his own theological theory of signs, with whose help one can infer the mind of God from the events and words of Scripture.

Books II and III of DDC enumerate all kinds of signs and explain how to interpret them. Signs are divided into natural (''naturalia'') and conventional (''data''); the latter is divided into animal (''bestiae'') and human (''homines''); the latter is divided into non-words (''cetera'') and words (''verba''); the latter is divided into spoken words (''voces'') and written words (''litterae''); the latter is divided into unknown signs (''signa ignota'') and ambiguous signs (''signa ambigua''); both the former and the latter are divided respectively into particular signs (''signa propria'') and figurative signs (''signa translata''), among which the unknown figurative signs belong to the pagans.
In addition to exegetical knowledge (Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 1.4.1-3 and 1.8.1-21) which follows the order of reading (''lectio''), textual criticism (''emendatio''), explanation (''enarratio''), and judgment (''iudicium''),  one needs to know the original language (Hebrew and Greek) and broad background information on Scripture (DDC 2.9.14-2.40.60).

Augustine’s understanding of signs includes several hermeneutical presuppositions as important factors. First, the interpreter should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (DDC 2.41.62). Second, the interpreter must have a spirit of active inquiry and should not hesitate to learn and use pagan education for the purpose of leading to Christian learning,  because all truth is God’s truth (DDC 2.40.60-2.42.63). Third, the heart of interpreter should be founded, rooted, and built up in love which is the final goal of the entire Scriptures (DDC 2.42.63).

The sign does not function as its own goal, but its purpose lies in its role as a signification (''res significans'', DDC 3.9.13). God gave signs as a means to reveal himself; Christians need to exercise hermeneutical principles in order to understand that divine revelation. Even if the Scriptural text is obscure, it has meaningful benefits. For the obscure text prevents us from falling into pride, triggers our intelligence (DDC 2.6.7), tempers our faith in the history of revelation (DDC 3.8.12), and refines our mind to be suitable to the holy mysteries (DDC 4.8.22). When interpreting signs, the literal meaning should first be sought, and then the figurative meaning (DDC 3.10.14-3.23.33). Augustine suggests the hermeneutical principle that the obscure Scriptural verse is interpreted with the help of plain and simple verses, which formed the doctrine of "scriptura scripturae interpres" (Scripture is the Interpreter of Scripture) in the Reformation Era. Moreover, he introduces the seven rules of Tyconius the Donatist to interpret the obscure meaning of the Bible, which demonstrates his understanding that all truth belongs to God (DDC 3.3.42-3.37.56). In order to apply Augustine's hermeneutics of the sign appropriately in modern times, every division of theology must be involved and interdisciplinary approaches must be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.

The concept of the word, but not the word itself, first appears in [[Aristophanes]]'s ''[[The Frogs]]'' (405 BC) lines 389–393, in a scene where the [[Greek chorus|Chorus]], who are devoted to [[Demeter]], pray for victory: ''καὶ πολλὰ μὲν γελοῖά μ’ εἰπεῖν, πολλὰ δὲ σπουδαῖα, καὶ τἡς σἡς ὲορτἡς ὰείως παίσαυτα και σκώψαυτα υικήσαυτα ταιῦιοθαι.''

Spoudaiogeloion was often used in satirical poems or folktales, which were funny, but had a serious, often ethical, theme.{{sfn|Fain|2010|p=73}} The serio-comic style became a rhetorical mainstay of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], and the Romans gave it its own genre in the form of [[satire]], contributed to most notably by the poets [[Horace]] and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]].{{sfn|Amir|2013|p=11}}{{sfn| Ferriss-Hill|2015|p=15}} It was the most common tone of the works made by [[Menippus]] and [[Meleager of Gadara]].{{sfn|Fain|2010|p=201}}

'''Subjectivity''' is a central [[philosophical]] concept, related to [[consciousness]], [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[personhood]], [[reality]], and [[truth]], which has been variously defined by sources. Three common definitions include that subjectivity is the quality or condition of:
* Something being a ''[[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]'', narrowly meaning an individual who possesses conscious experiences, such as perspectives, feelings, beliefs, and desires.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon|Solomon, Robert C.]] "Subjectivity," in Honderich, Ted. ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]] (Oxford University Press, 2005), p.900.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Something being a ''subject'', broadly meaning an entity that has [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], meaning that it acts upon or wields power over some other entity (an ''[[Object (philosophy)|object]]'').&lt;ref name=Allen2002&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09672550210121432 |title=Power, Subjectivity, and Agency: Between Arendt and Foucault |journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=131–49 |year=2002 |last1=Allen |first1=Amy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some information, idea, situation, or physical thing considered true only from the perspective of a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] or subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 |title=Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography |journal=Geoforum |volume=75 |pages=249–52 |year=2016 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These various definitions of subjectivity are sometimes joined together in philosophy. The term is most commonly used as an explanation for that which influences, informs, and biases people's judgments about truth or reality; it is the collection of the perceptions, experiences, expectations, personal or cultural understanding, and beliefs specific to a person. 

Subjectivity is contrasted to the philosophy of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], which is described as a view of truth or reality that is free of any individual's biases, interpretations, feelings, and imaginings.&lt;ref name="solomon" /&gt; 

==Philosophy==
The rise of the notion of subjectivity has its philosophical roots in the thinking of [[Descartes]] and [[Kant]], and its articulation throughout the modern era has depended on the understanding of what constitutes an individual. There have been various interpretations of such concepts as the self and the soul, and the identity or [[self-consciousness]] which lies at the root of the notion of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strazzoni |first1=Andrea |year=2015 |title=Subjectivity and individuality: Two strands in early modern philosophy: Introduction |journal=Societate si Politica |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=5–9 |hdl=1765/92270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjectivity is, for instance, frequently the implicit topic of [[existentialism]], Sartre as one of its main proponents emphasizing subjectivity in his phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.ophen.org/2016/11/02/jean-paul-sartre-subjectivity-2/ |title=Jean-Paul Sartre: What is Subjectivity?
 |last=Thalos |first=Mariam |date=2016 |website=http://reviews.ophen.org/ |publisher=(Article review of Sartre's 'What is Subjectivity' published byVerso Books) |access-date=11/10/18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his colleague [[Merleau-Ponty]], Sartre believed that, even within the material force of human society, the ego was an essentially transcendent being- posited, for instance, in his opus ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' through his arguments about the 'being-for-others' and the 'for-itself' (i.e., an objective and subjective human being).

==Sociology==
Subjectivity is an inherently social mode that comes about through innumerable interactions within society. As much as subjectivity is a process of [[individuation]], it is equally a process of socialization, the individual never being isolated in a self-contained environment, but endlessly engaging in interaction with the surrounding world.
Culture is a living totality of the subjectivity of any given society constantly undergoing transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, H.J. ed., 2014. Questioning foundations: truth, subjectivity and culture. Routledge.{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectivity is both shaped by it and shapes it in turn, but also by other things like the economy, political institutions, communities, as well as the natural world.

Though the boundaries of societies and their cultures are indefinable and arbitrary, the subjectivity inherent in each one is palatable and can be recognized as distinct from others. Subjectivity is in part a particular experience or organization of [[reality]], which includes how one views and interacts with humanity, objects, consciousness, and nature, so the difference between different cultures brings about an alternate experience of existence that forms life in a different manner. A common effect on an individual of this disjunction between subjectivities is [[culture shock]], where the subjectivity of the other culture is considered alien and possibly incomprehensible or even hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00330124.2012.693876 |title=Learning Wisdom Through Geographical Dislocations |journal=The Professional Geographer |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=390–5 |year=2013 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political subjectivity]] is an emerging concept in social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref name=Allen2002/&gt; Political subjectivity is a reference to the deep embeddedness of subjectivity in the socially intertwined systems of power and meaning.  "Politicality," writes [http://artsandscience.usask.ca/profile/SRahimi Sadeq Rahimi] in ''[http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/ Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity]'', "is not an added aspect of the subject, but indeed the mode of being of the subject, that is, precisely what the subject ''is''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rahimi|first1=Sadeq|title=Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity: A Study of Schizophrenia and Culture in Turkey|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxford &amp; New York|isbn=1138840823|page=8|url=http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/|ref=Rahimi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48393">Testicular Immunology is the study of the [[immune system]] within the [[testis]]. It includes an investigation of the effects of [[infection]], [[inflammation]] and immune factors on testicular function. Two unique characteristics of '''testicular immunology''' are evident: (1) the testis is described as an [[immunologically privileged site]], where suppression of immune responses occurs; and, (2) some factors which normally lead to inflammation are present at high levels in the testis, where they regulate the development of [[sperm]]  instead of promoting inflammation.

==Immune cells found in the testis==

Immune cells of the human testis are not as well characterized as those from rodents, due to the rarity of normal human testes available for experiment. The majority of experiments have studied the rat testis due to its convenience: it is of relatively large size and is easily extracted from experimental animals.

=== Macrophages ===
[[Macrophages]] are directly involved in the fight against invading micro-organisms as well as being [[antigen-presenting cells]] which activate [[lymphocytes]]. Early studies demonstrated the presence of macrophages in the rat testis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/aja.1001680102 | volume=168 | title=Structure, cytochemistry, endocytic activity, and immunoglobulin (Fc) receptors of rat testicular interstitial-tissue macrophages | journal=American Journal of Anatomy | pages=1–13 | author=Miller SC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testicular macrophages are the largest population of immune cells in the rodent testis.&lt;ref name=Hume&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hume DA, Halpin D, Charlton H, Gordon S |title=The mononuclear phagocyte system of the mouse defined by immunohistochemical localization of antigen F4/80: macrophages of endocrine organs |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=81 |pages=4174–4177 |year=1984 |pmid=6377311 |doi=10.1073/pnas.81.13.4174 |issue=13 |pmc=345391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Niemi&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Niemi M, Sharpe RM, Brown WR |title=Macrophages in the interstitial tissue of the rat testis |journal=Cell Tissue Res. |volume=243 |pages=337–344 |year=1986 |pmid=2418975 |doi=10.1007/BF00251049 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Macrophages have also been found in the testes of humans,&lt;ref name=Frungieri&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frungieri MB, Calandra RS, Lustig L, Meineke V, Köhn FM, Vogt HJ, Mayerhofer A |title=Number, distribution pattern, and identification of macrophages in the testes of infertile men |journal=Fertil.

=== B-Lymphocytes ===
[[B-lymphocytes]] take part in the [[adaptive immune response]] and produce antibodies. These cells are not normally found in the testis, even during inflammatory conditions. The lack of B-lymphocytes in the testis is significant, since these are the antibody-producing cells of the immune system. Since anti-sperm antibodies can cause infertility, it is important that antibody-producing B-lymphocytes are kept separated from the testis.

=== T-lymphocytes ===
[[T-lymphocytes]] (T-cells) are white blood cells which take part in cell-mediated immunity. They are often found within tissues where they can be activated by antigen-presenting cells upon infection.

=== Mast cells ===
[[Mast cells]] are regulators of immune responses, particularly those against [[parasitism|parasites]]. They are also involved in the development of [[autoimmune diseases]] and [[allergy|allergies]].

===Neutrophils===
[[Neutrophils]] are white blood cells which are present in the blood but not normally in tissues. They move out from the blood into tissues and organs upon infection or damage. They directly fight invading pathogens such as bacteria.

==Immune privilege in the testis==

Sperm are immunogenic - that is they will cause an autoimmune reaction if transplanted from the testis into a different part of the body. This has been demonstrated in experiments using rats by Landsteiner (1899) and Metchinikoff (1900),&lt;ref name="HedgerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fijak/&gt; mice &lt;ref name=Kohno&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kohno S, Munoz JA, Williams TM, Teuscher C, Bernard CC, Tung KS |title=Immunopathology of murine experimental allergic orchitis |journal= Journal of Immunology |volume=130 |pages=2675–2682 |year=1983 |pmid=6682874 |issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and guinea pigs.&lt;ref name=Teuscher&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teuscher C, Wild GC, Tung KS |title=Immunochemical analysis of guinea pig sperm autoantigens |journal= Biol.

Therefore, mechanisms for their protection must exist in this organ to prevent any autoimmune reaction. The [[blood-testis barrier]] is likely to contribute to the survival of sperm. However, it is believed in the field of testicular immunology that the blood-testis barrier cannot account for all immune suppression in the testis, due to (1) its incompleteness at a region called the [[rete testis]] &lt;ref name=Fijak/&gt; and (2) the presence of immunogenic molecules outside the blood-testis barrier, on the surface of [[spermatogonia]].&lt;ref name="HedgerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fijak/&gt;  Another mechanism which is likely to protect sperm is the suppression of immune responses in the testis.&lt;ref name=Kern/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Bryana"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Bryan MK, Gerdprasert O, Nikolic-Paterson DJ, Meinhardt A, Muir JA, Foulds LM, Phillips DJ, de Kretser DM, Hedger MP |title=Cytokine profiles in the testes of rats treated with lipopolysaccharide reveal localized suppression of inflammatory responses |journal=Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol |volume=288 |pages=R1744–R1755 |year=2005 |pmid=15661966 |issue=6 |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00651.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the suppression of immune responses and the increased survival of grafts in the testis have led to its recognition as an [[immunologically privileged site]].

The two main features of immune privilege in the rat testis are;

The presence of immune-privilege in the human testis is controversial and insufficient evidence exists to either confirm or rule out this phenomenon.

===How does the testis suppress immune responses?===

How the testicular environment suppresses the immune response is only partially understood. Recent experiments have uncovered a number of biological processes that most likely contribute to immune privilege in the testes of rodents:
* 1.  Experiments in the rat have shown that [[Sertoli cells]] can help protect from graft rejection. These cells were isolated from the testis, then added to transplants of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas ([[islets of Langerhans]]), resulting in increased graft survival.&lt;ref name=Korbutt&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Korbutt GS, Elliott JF, Rajotte RV |title=Cotransplantation of allogeneic islets with allogeneic testicular cell aggregates allows long-term graft survival without systemic immunosuppression |journal= Diabetes |volume=46 |pages=317–322 |year=1997 |pmid=9000711 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.46.2.317 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecules released by the Sertoli cells are predicted to protect the graft.&lt;ref name=Selawry/&gt;
* 2.  It is likely that the testicular environment itself is inhibiting the activation of T-cells, in order to protect the developing sperm which are immunogenic.&lt;ref name=Hedgerc&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hedger, MP, Meinhardt, A |title=Local regulation of T cell numbers and lymphocyte-inhibiting activity in the interstitial tissue of the adult rat testis |journal= J Reprod Immunol. |volume=48 |pages=69–80 |year=2000 |pmid=11011073 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(00)00071-1 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerna&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kern S, Maddocks S |title=Indomethacin blocks the immunosuppressive activity of rat testicular macrophages cultured in vitro |journal= J Reprod Immunol. |volume=28 |pages=189–201 |year=1995 |pmid=7473430 |doi=10.1016/0165-0378(95)91391-Q |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fluid present in the testis is a potent inhibitor of the activation of T-cells under laboratory conditions.&lt;ref name=Hedgerc/&gt;
* 3.  The diminishment of the testis inflammatory response is likely to result from relatively low levels of inflammatory cytokines released by activated testicular macrophages.&lt;ref name=Kern/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Bryana" /&gt;

Since protection of developing sperm is so important to the survival of a species, it would not be surprising if more than one mechanism were in use.

==Immune factors regulate normal testis function==

Curiously, the testis contains factors such as [[cytokines]], which are usually only produced upon infections and tissue damage. The cytokines interleukin-1α ([[Interleukin 1|IL-1]]α), [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] and [[Activin]] A are found in the testis, often at high levels.&lt;ref name=Gustafsson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson K, Sultana T, Zetterström CK, Setchell BP, Siddiqui A, Weber G, Söder O |title=Production and secretion of interleukin-1alpha proteins by rat testis|journal= Biochem Biophys Res Commun |volume=297 |pages=492–497 |year=2002 |pmid=12270120 |doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(02)02239-8 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Syed&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Syed V, Gérard N, Kaipia A, Bardin CW, Parvinen M, Jégou B |title=Identification, ontogeny, and regulation of an interleukin-6-like factor in the rat seminiferous tubule |journal= Endocrinology |volume=132 |pages=293–299 |year=1993 |pmid=8380379 |doi=10.1210/en.132.1.293 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerard&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gérard N, Syed V, Bardin W, Genetet N, Jégou B |title=Sertoli cells are the site of interleukin-1 alpha synthesis in rat testis |journal= Mol Cell Endocrinol |volume=82 |pages=R13–R16 |year=1991 |pmid=1761160 |doi=10.1016/0303-7207(91)90019-O |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee W, Mason AJ, Schwall R, Szonyi E, Mather JP |title=Secretion of activin by interstitial cells in the testis |journal= Science |volume=243 |pages=396–398 |year=1989 |pmid=2492117 |doi=10.1126/science.2492117 |issue=4889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deKretser&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Kretser DM, Robertson DM |title=The isolation and physiology of inhibin and related proteins |journal= Biol.

Further research is required to define the functional roles of these immune factors in the testis.

==The effects of infections and immune responses on the testis==

===Mumps===

[[Mumps]] is a viral disease which causes swelling of the salivary glands and testes. The mumps virus lives in the upper respiratory tract and spreads through direct contact with saliva.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/mumps/in-short-adult.htm]''Mumps In-Short''.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to widespread vaccination programs, it was a common childhood disease. Mumps is generally not serious in children, but in adults, where sperm have matured in the testis, it can cause more severe complications, such as infertility.

===Sexually transmitted diseases===

[[Gonorrhea]] is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacteria ''Niesseria gonorrhea'' which can lead to testicular pain and swelling. Gonorrhea also infects the female reproductive system around the cervix and uterus, and can grow in the mouth, throat, eyes and anus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/std/Gonorrhea/STDFact-gonorrhea.htm]''Gonorrhea - CDC Fact Sheet''.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be effectively treated with antibiotics, however, if untreated, gonorrhea can cause infertility in men. [[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]] is caused by the sexually transmitted bacteria ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' which infects the genitals. It more commonly affects women, and if untreated, can lead to [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] and infertility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/STDFact-Chlamydia.htm]''Chlamydia - CDC Fact Sheet''.&lt;/ref&gt; Serious symptoms in men are rare, but include swollen testicles and an unusual discharge from the penis. It is effectively treated with antibiotics.

===Antisperm antibodies===

[[Antisperm antibodies]] (ASA) have been considered as infertility cause in around 10–30% of infertile couples.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Restrepo|first=B.|last2=Cardona-Maya|first2=W.|date=October 2013|title=Antisperm antibodies and fertility association|journal=Actas Urologicas Espanolas|volume=37|issue=9|pages=571–578|doi=10.1016/j.acuro.2012.11.003|issn=1699-7980|pmid=23428233}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and [[acrosome reaction]], impaired [[Fertilisation|fertilization]], influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the [[embryo]]. Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, [[varicocele]], infections, [[prostatitis]], [[testicular cancer]], failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfK8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA311|title=Principles &amp; Practice of Assisted Reproductive Technology (3 Vols)|last=Rao|first=Kamini|date=2013-09-30|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=9789350907368|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testicular torsion===

[[Testicular torsion]] is a condition of physical twisting of the testis which results in cutting off the blood supply. It leads to damage that, if not treated within a few hours, causes the death of testicular tissue, and requires removal of the testis to prevent [[gangrene]], and therefore can cause infertility.&lt;ref name=Ringdahl&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ringdahl E, Teague L |title=Testicular torsion |journal= Am Fam Physician |volume=74 |pages=1739–1743 |year=2006 |pmid=17137004 |issue= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autoimmune orchitis===

[[Orchitis]] is a condition of testicular pain involving swelling, inflammation and possibly infection. Orchitis can be caused by an [[autoimmune reaction]] (autoimmune orchitis) leading to a reduction in fertility. Autoimmune orchitis is rare in humans, compared to anti-sperm antibodies.&lt;ref name="HedgerBook"/&gt; To study orchitis in the testis, autoimmune orchitis has been induced in the rodent testis. The disease starts with the appearance of testicular antibodies, then movement of [[macrophages]] and [[lymphocytes]] from the blood stream into the testis, breaking of the physical interactions between the developing sperm and [[Sertoli cells]], entry of [[neutrophils]] or [[eosinophils]], and finally death of the developing sperm, leading to infertility.&lt;ref name=Kohno2&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kohno S, Munoz JA, Williams TM, Teuscher C, Bernard CC, Tung KS |title= Immunopathology of murine experimental allergic orchitis|journal= Journal of Immunology |volume=130 |pages=2675–2682 |year=1983 |pmid=6682874 |issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Doncel&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doncel GF, Di Paola JA, Lustig L |title=Sequential study of the histopathology and cellular and humoral immune response during the development of an autoimmune orchitis in Wistar rats |journal= Am J Reprod Immunol |volume=20 |pages=44–51 |year=1989 |pmid=2803528 |issue= 2 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0897.1989.tb00638.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhou ZZ, Zheng Y, Steenstra R, Hickey WF, Teuscher C |title=Actively-induced experimental allergic orchitis (EAO) in Lewis/NCR rats: sequential histo- and immunopathologic analysis|journal= Autoimmunity |volume=3 |pages=125–134 |year=1989 |pmid=2491624 |doi=10.3109/08916938909019961 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflammation models in the rodent===

Experiments in rats have examined, in fine detail, the course of testicular events during a bacterial infection. In the short term (3 hours) multiple inflammatory factors are produced and released by testicular [[macrophages]].

'''''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''''' ({{lang-de|Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus}}) is a book written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[sociologist]], economist, and politician. Begun as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by American sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="WeberBaehr2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Max Weber|author2=Peter R.

In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in [[Northern Europe]] evolved when the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprise]]s and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinnon | first1 = AM | year = 2010 | title = Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism | url = http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sociological Theory | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 108–126 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.01367.x| hdl = 2164/3035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses [[Lutherans]] (especially [[Pietists]], but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), [[Methodists]], [[Baptists]], [[Quakers]], and [[Moravians]] (specifically referring to the [[Herrnhut]]-based community under [[Count von Zinzendorf]]'s spiritual lead).

In 1998, the [[International Sociological Association]] listed this work as the fourth most important sociological book of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="isa-sociology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/|title=ISA - International Sociological Association: Books of the Century|publisher=International Sociological Association|year=1998 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the 8th most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Elliott|title=What are the most-cited publications in the social sciences (according to Google Scholar)?|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-publications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/|website=LSE Imact Blog|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

===Basic concepts===
Although not a detailed study of Protestantism but rather an introduction to Weber's later studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economics (''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]],'' ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]],'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]),'' ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' argues that [[Puritan]] [[ethic]]s and [[idea]]s influenced the development of capitalism. The 'spirit of capitalism' does not refer to the spirit in the metaphysical sense but rather a set of values, the spirit of hard work and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Michael Shea |url=http://discoversociety.org/2015/10/06/the-protestant-ethic-and-the-language-of-austerity/ |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Language of Austerity |date=6 October 2015 |publisher=[[Discover Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious devotion, Weber argues, is usually accompanied by a rejection of worldly affairs, including the pursuit of wealth and possessions. To illustrate his theory, Weber quotes the ethical writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]]:

{{quote|sign=|source=|Remember, that ''time is money''.  He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon ''that'' the only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides. [...] Remember, that money is the ''prolific, generating nature''. Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on. Five shillings turned is six, turned again is seven and threepence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding feline taint, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds.}}

Weber notes that this is not a philosophy of mere greed, but a statement laden with moral language. Indeed, Franklin claims that God revealed the usefulness of virtue to him.&lt;ref name="protestant"&gt;Weber, Max "The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism" (Penguin Books, 2002) translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9–12}}

The Reformation profoundly affected the view of work, dignifying even the most mundane professions as adding to the common good and thus blessed by God, as much as any "sacred" calling (German: ''Ruf''). A common illustration is that of a cobbler, hunched over his work, who devotes his entire effort to the praise of God.

To emphasize the [[work ethic]] in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer. However, in precapitalist societies this often results in laborers spending ''less'' time harvesting. Laborers judge that they can earn the same, while spending less time working and having more leisure. He also notes that societies having more Protestants are those that have a more developed capitalist economy.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|15–16}}

It is particularly advantageous in technical occupations for workers to be extremely devoted to their craft.  To view the craft as an end in itself, or as a "calling" would serve this need well. This attitude is well-noted in certain classes which have endured religious education, especially of a [[Pietist]] background.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

He defines spirit of capitalism as the ideas and ''esprit'' that favour the [[Rationalization (sociology)|rational]] pursuit of [[Wealth|economic gain]]: "We shall nevertheless provisionally use the expression 'spirit of capitalism' for that attitude which, ''in the pursuit of a calling [berufsmäßig]'', strives systematically for profit for its own sake in the manner exemplified by Benjamin Franklin."&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

Weber points out that such a [[spirit]] is not limited to [[Western culture]] if one considers it as the attitude of [[Person|individual]]s, but that such individuals – heroic entrepreneurs, as he calls them – could not by themselves establish a new economic order (capitalism).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'',  University of California Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54–55}} He further noted that the spirit of capitalism could be divorced from religion, and that those passionate capitalists of his era were either passionate against the Church or at least indifferent to it.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Desire for profit with minimum effort and seeing work as a burden to be avoided, and doing no more than what was enough for modest life, were common attitudes.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|55}} As he wrote in his essays:

:{{quote|In order that a manner of life well adapted to the peculiarities of the capitalism… could come to dominate others, it had to originate somewhere, and not in isolated individuals alone, but as a way of life common to the whole groups of man.}}

After defining the "spirit of capitalism," Weber argues that there are many reasons to find its origins in the religious ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Many others like [[William Petty]], [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[John Keats]] have noted the [[Affinity (sociology)|affinity]] between Protestantism and the development of [[commercialism]].&lt;ref name="Bendix54"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber shows that certain branches of Protestantism had supported worldly activities dedicated to economic gain, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance. This recognition was not a goal in itself; rather they were a byproduct of other doctrines of faith that encouraged planning, hard work and self-denial in the pursuit of worldly riches.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

===Origins of the Protestant work ethic===

Weber traced the origins of the Protestant ethic to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], though he acknowledged some respect for secular everyday labor as early as the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|28}} The Roman Catholic Church assured salvation to individuals who accepted the church's sacraments and submitted to the clerical authority. However, the Reformation had effectively removed such assurances. From a [[psychological]] viewpoint, the average person had difficulty adjusting to this new worldview, and only the most devout believers or "religious geniuses" within Protestantism, such as [[Martin Luther]], were able to make this adjustment, according to Weber.

In the absence of such assurances from religious authority, Weber argued that Protestants began to look for other "signs" that they were saved. Calvin and his followers taught a doctrine of [[Predestination|double predestination]], in which from the beginning God chose some people for salvation and others for damnation. The inability to influence one's own salvation presented a very difficult problem for Calvin's followers. It became an absolute duty to believe that one was chosen for salvation, and to dispel any doubt about that: lack of self-confidence was evidence of insufficient faith and a sign of damnation. So, self-confidence took the place of priestly assurance of God's grace.

Worldly success became one measure of that self-confidence. Luther made an early endorsement of Europe's emerging divisions. Weber identifies the applicability of Luther's conclusions, noting that a "vocation" from God was no longer limited to the clergy or church, but applied to any occupation or trade. Weber had always detested Lutheranism for the servility it inspired toward the bureaucratic state. When he discussed it in the ''Protestant Ethic'', he used Lutheranism as the chief example of the ''[[unio mystica]]'' that contrasted sharply with the ascetic posture. Later he would associate "Luther, the symbolic exponent of [[bureaucratic despotism]], with the ascetic hostility to [[Eros]] — an example of Weber's sporadic tendency to link together bureaucratic and ascetic modes of life and to oppose both from mystical and aristocratic perspectives."&lt;ref name="Mitzman1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Mitzman|title=The Iron Cage: An Historical Interpretation of Max Weber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mayilngcerQC&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=1970|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3745-3|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Weber saw the fulfillment of the Protestant ethic not in [[Lutheranism]], which was too concerned with the reception of divine spirit in the soul, but in [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] forms of Christianity.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|32–33}} The trend was carried further still in Pietism.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|90}} The [[Baptists]] diluted the concept of the calling relative to Calvinists, but other aspects made its congregants fertile soil for the development of capitalism—namely, a lack of paralyzing ascetism, the refusal to accept state office and thereby develop ''un''politically, and the doctrine of control by conscience which caused rigorous honesty.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|102–104}}

What Weber argued, in simple terms:
* According to the new Protestant religions, an individual was religiously compelled to follow a secular vocation (German: ''Beruf'') with as much zeal as possible. A person living according to this world view was more likely to accumulate money.
* The new religions (in particular, Calvinism and other more austere Protestant sects) effectively forbade wastefully ''using'' hard earned money and identified the purchase of luxuries as a [[sin]]. Donations to an individual's church or congregation were limited due to the rejection by certain Protestant sects of [[icon]]s. Finally, donation of money to the poor or to [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] was generally frowned on as it was seen as furthering beggary. This social condition was perceived as laziness, burdening their fellow man, and an affront to God; by not working, one failed to glorify God.

The manner in which this paradox was resolved, Weber argued, was the investment of this money, which gave an extreme boost to [[Primitive accumulation|nascent capitalism]].

===The Protestant work ethic in Weber's time===

By the time Weber wrote his essay, he believed that the religious underpinnings of the Protestant ethic had largely gone from society. He cited the writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]], which emphasized frugality, hard work and thrift, but were mostly free of spiritual content. Weber also attributed the success of mass production partly to the Protestant ethic. Only after expensive luxuries were disdained could individuals accept the uniform products, such as clothes and furniture, that industrialization offered.

In his remarkably prescient conclusion to the book, Weber lamented that the loss of religious underpinning to capitalism's spirit has led to a kind of involuntary servitude to mechanized industry.

{{quote|The Puritan wanted to work in calling; we are forced to do so.  For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order.  This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force.  Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter’s view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the 'saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment.' But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage. (Page 181, 1953 Scribner's edition.)}}

Weber maintained that while Puritan religious ideas had significantly impacted the development of economic system in Europe and United States, there were other factors in play, as well. They included a closer relationship between mathematics and [[observation]], the enhanced value of scholarship, rational systematization of government administration, and an increase in entrepreneurship ventures. In the end, the study of Protestant ethic, according to Weber, investigated a part of the detachment from [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], that ''disenchantment of the world'' that could be seen as a unique characteristic of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

===Conclusions===

In the final endnotes Weber states that he abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague [[Ernst Troeltsch]], a professional [[theology|theologian]], had begun work on ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area, which is laying groundwork for comparative analysis of religion and society. Weber moved beyond Protestantism with his research but would continue research into [[sociology of religion]] within his later works (the study of [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Judaism]] and the religions of [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|China]] and [[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Budhism|India]]).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"/&gt;{{rp|49}}

This book is also Weber's first brush with the concept of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]. His idea of modern capitalism as growing out of the religious pursuit of wealth meant a change to a rational means of existence, wealth. That is to say, at some point the Calvinist rationale informing the "spirit" of capitalism became unreliant on the underlying religious movement behind it, leaving only rational capitalism. In essence then, Weber's "Spirit of Capitalism" is effectively and more broadly a Spirit of Rationalization.

==Reception==
The essay can also be interpreted as one of Weber's criticisms of [[Karl Marx]] and his theories. While Marx's [[historical materialism]] held that all human institutions – including religion – were based on economic foundations, many have seen ''The Protestant Ethic'' as turning this theory on its head by implying that a religious movement fostered capitalism, not the other way around.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Other scholars have taken a more nuanced view of Weber's argument. Weber states in the closing of this essay, "it is, of course, not my aim to substitute for a one-sided materialistic an equally one-sided spiritualistic causal interpretation of culture and history. Each is equally possible, but each if it does not serve as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation, accomplishes equally little in the interest of historical truth." Weber's argument can be understood as an attempt to deepen the understanding of the cultural origins of capitalism, which does not exclude the historical materialist origins described by Marx: modern capitalism emerged from an elective affinity of 'material; and 'ideal' factors.&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Economic criticism===
The economist and historian [[Henryk Grossman]] criticises Weber's analysis on two fronts, firstly with reference to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s extensive work which showed that the stringent legal measures taken against poverty and vagabondage was a reaction to the massive population shifts caused by the [[enclosure]] of the [[commons]] in England.  And, secondly, in Grossman's own work showing how this "bloody legislation" against those who had been put off their land was effected across Europe and especially in France.  For Grossman this legislation, the outlawing of [[idleness]] and the [[poorhouses]] they instituted physically forced people from [[serfdom]] into [[wage-labor]].  For him, this general fact was not related to Protestantism and so capitalism came largely by force and not by any vocational training regarding an inner-worldliness of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Henryk (2006) ‘The Beginnings of Capitalism and the New Mass Morality’ Journal of Classical Sociology 6 (2): July&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that the Protestant "work ethic" reinforced or legitimized these legal measures within a larger cultural context.

In a paper published on 10 November 2009, Harvard economist Davide Cantoni tested Weber's Protestant hypothesis using population and economic growth in second-millennium Germany as the data set, with negative results. Cantoni writes:

{{quote|Using population figures in a dataset comprising 276 cities in the years 1300–1900, I find no effects of Protestantism on economic growth. The finding is robust to the inclusion of a variety of controls, and does not appear to depend on data selection or small sample size. In addition, Protestantism has no effect when interacted with other likely determinants of economic development. I also analyze the endogeneity of religious choice; instrumental variables estimates of the effects of Protestantism are similar to the OLS results.&lt;ref&gt;David Cantoni, "The Economic Effects of the Protestant Reformation: Testing the Weber Hypothesis in the German Lands," November 2009, {{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205143318/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |archivedate=5 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Cantoni uses city size, and not relative real wage growth, which was the Weber thesis, as his "main dependent variable" (Cantoni, 2).

Other recent scholarship continues to find valid Protestant Ethic effects both in historical and contemporary development patterns.

Dudley and Blum write:
{{quote|Evidence of falling wages in Catholic cities and rising wages in Protestant cities between 1500 and 1750, during the spread of literacy in the vernacular, is inconsistent with most theoretical models of economic growth. In The Protestant Ethic, Weber suggested an alternative explanation based on culture. Here, a theoretical model confirms that a small change in the subjective cost of cooperating with strangers can generate a profound transformation in trading networks. In explaining urban growth in early-modern Europe, specifications compatible with human-capital versions of the neoclassical model and endogenous-growth theory are rejected in favor of a "small-world" formulation based on the Weber thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807123042/http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archivedate=2003-08-07  |title=Religion and Economic Growth: Was Weber Right? |first1=Ulrich |last1=Blum |first2=Leonard |last2=Dudley |date=February 2001 |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=207–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Revisionist criticism===
H. M. Robertson, in his book ''Aspects of Economic Individualism'', argued against the historical and religious claims of Weber. Robertson points out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in 14th century Italy, a decidedly different epoch. Since this is true, then the rise of capitalism cannot be attributed to [[Adam Smith]], the Protestant Reformation, etc. In fact, Robertson goes further, and states that what happened in Britain was rather a retrogression from what was achieved in Italy centuries earlier.

Looking at the history of the development of economic thought, Robertson shows that Adam Smith and [[David Ricardo]] did not found economic science ''de novo''. In fact, liberal economic theory was developed by French and Italian Catholics, who were influenced by the [[Scholastics]]. The British economic thought was rather a step backwards since it espoused the [[Labor Theory of Value]], which had already been proved incorrect by the [[School of Salamanca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313191910/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-13 |title=Catholicism, Protestantism, and Capitalism |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |author-link=Murray Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=February 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===
It has recently been suggested that Protestantism has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the "Protestant ethics" but rather through the promotion of literacy.&lt;ref name="urss.ru"&gt;[[Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'', Moscow: URSS, {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}} [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14&amp;page=Book&amp;id=34250] ([http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=187&amp;Itemid=70 Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and "the Spirit of Capitalism"]).

The results were supported even under a concentric diffusion model of Protestantism using distance from Wittenberg as a model.&lt;ref name="epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de"/&gt;

In 1958, American sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]] conducted an empirical inquiry into "religion's impact on politics, economics, and family life" in the [[Detroit]], Mich., area. It revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with respect to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported basic hypotheses of Weber's work ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''. According to Lenski, "the contribution of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory." Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, [[John Wesley]], one of the founders of the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church, had observed that "diligence and frugality" made Methodists wealthy. "In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics. and Family Life'', Revised Edition, Garden City, N.Y., pp. 350-352&lt;/ref&gt;

German theologian Friedrich Wilhelm Graf notes: "Sociologists of religion like [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] have interpreted the Protestant revolution in [[Latin America]] as implicit support of basic elements of Weber's thesis. [...] At any rate, many pious persons there interpret their transition from the Roman Catholic church to Protestant [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations in terms of a moral idea that promises long-term economic gains through strong innerworldly asceticism. The strict ascetic self-discipline that has been successfully institutionalized in the Pentecostal congregations, the readiness to work more and with greater effort and to take less leisurely attitudes lead many Pentecostal Christians to believe that their new faith in God is supported by their economic successes."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Graf (2010), ''Der Protestantismus. Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Second, Revised Edition, Munich (Germany), pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosalind Mary Owens''' (born 12 November 1944), known as '''Tuppy Owens''', is an English sex therapist, consultant, campaigner, writer and former adult model.&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt;&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18669012.html|title=BBC under fire for porn star's Viagra love-making|date=19 August 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tuppy Owens was born in [[Cambridge]]. She gained a degree in [[zoology]] from [[Exeter University]], and then worked in [[ecology]] in [[Africa]] and [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt; She settled in [[London]], and worked as a scientific administrator at the [[Natural Environment Research Council]].&lt;ref name=observer19720924/&gt; Then, in the late 1960s, she established a sex education book publishing company, for which she wrote and published ''The Sex Maniac’s Diary''&lt;ref name=paulharris/&gt; successfully between 1972 and 1995, and which she operated as a thriving business from her [[Mayfair]] flat&lt;ref name=observer19720924/&gt; — for example, the 1975 ''Sex Maniac's Diary'' was launched in August 1974 with a reception at the Bristol Hotel in London which was reported on the following day in the [[Financial Times]].&lt;ref name=ft19740822/&gt;

==Work==

From 1974, Tuppy Owens also began lecturing on the subject of sex.&lt;ref name=es19740409/&gt;  In 1975, she appeared in the Dutch pornographic film ''Sensations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pre-cert.co.uk/display.php?vId=UK13009|title=Sensations (1975) on Video Blue|website=Pre-Certification Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1984, the ''Sex Maniac's Diary'' was published as ''The Safer Sex Maniac's Diary'' and provided the first visual instructions to the public on how to put a [[condom]] on securely; it also reviewed condoms and offered [[Safe sex|safer sex]] advice, all at the beginning of the outbreak of [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=thediary/&gt;

In 1979, Owens started the Outsiders Club for socially and physically disabled people to find partners. She was helped by Nigel Verbeek, who had recently lost his sight. Both worked voluntarily, which Tuppy continues to do today. Outsiders is a warm and friendly club providing peer support to members, a beautiful online Clubhouse, and lovely monthly lunches around the country.

In order to ensure that she answered the members' questions with accuracy, Owens trained as a [[sex therapist]] at [[St George's Hospital Medical School]] in London, where she gained a diploma in Human Sexuality in 1986.&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt; She was also subsequently awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the Institute of Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=theskinny20080617/&gt; In 2009, Owens was named one of the Family Planning Association‘s 80 most influential achievers in the field of family planning.

For disabled men and women who want to learn what pleasures their bodies are capable of enjoying, and how to please a partner, Owens set up the TLC Trust website, where they can find responsible, safe sexual services.

In 1981, Owens appeared in the English pornographic film ''Lady Victoria's Training'', which was produced by Mike Freeman/Videx and featured Simon Linsday Honey, who went on to work as a porn producer and actor in 1990's under the pseudonym [[Ben Dover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pre-cert.co.uk/display.php?vId=UK09550|title=Lady Victoria's Training (1981) on Videx|website=Pre-Certification Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"/&gt;

In the 1990s, after more than 30 years living in London, Tuppy Owens moved away from that city. Since then, she has lived in a croft in the north of Scotland.&lt;ref name=highladnews20060608/&gt;

In 2005, Tuppy Owens founded the Sexual Health and Disability Alliance (SHADA)&lt;ref name=sexis1118103/&gt; to bring together health professionals interested in sex and disability. In November 2009, a conference with the title "Disability: Sex, Relationships and Pleasure" was held by SHADA with the [[Royal Society of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=rsm20091113/&gt; Tuppy produced the Sexual Respect Tool Kit, and started the sexual advocacy service, ASAP. Tuppy also answers the Sex and Disability Helpline. Her book "Supporting Disabled People with their Sexual Lives" was published by [[Jessica Kingsley Publishers|Jessica Kingsley]] on 19 November 2014.

Tuppy Owens remains active in running Outsiders.&lt;ref name=realist136/&gt; At the same time, she also advises the promoter of the Sexual Freedom Ball to fund Outsiders, and the organisers of the fundraiser, The [[Erotic Awards]],&lt;ref name=thetimes1085069/&gt; now called The Sexual Services and Entertainment Awards. 

Owens is now the chair of the Sexual Freedom Coalition.&lt;ref name=marieclaire200903/&gt; Back in the 90s Owens worked campaigning with Prostitution Pride, parades through London, which were funded by Arcadia events in North London.

Owens has been working with the Bath Institute of Medical Engineering in the hope that they will be able to create sex toys that can be used by disabled people who, without them, cannot masturbate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owens|first1=Tuppy|title=Supporting disabled residents to enjoy masturbation and sexual services|url=http://shadainternational.com/all-impairments/pioneers/|website=Shada International|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens will be the editor of a forthcoming website, The School of Sex for Disabled People, which is being created by sexually experienced disabled people and those who provide them with sexual services. She is currently writing her autobiography.

==Award==
Owens has won the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award from the European Lifestyles Awards. She is also a Winner of the Innovation Award of Sexual Health and Human Rights UNESCO 2015.
She was a finalist (Lifetime Achievement) in the Directory of Social Change Awards 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: 2015 Social Change Awards Ceremony|url=https://www.dsc.org.uk/content/2015-social-change-awards-ceremony/|website=Directory of Social Change|accessdate=11 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HeatIsland Kanto en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Tokyo]], an example of an urban heat island. Normal temperatures of Tokyo go up more than those of the surrounding area.]]

An '''urban heat island''' ('''UHI''') is an [[urban area]] or [[metropolitan area]] that is significantly warmer than its surrounding [[rural area]]s due to human activities.  The [[temperature]] difference usually is larger at night than during the day, and is most apparent when [[wind]]s are weak. UHI is most noticeable during the [[summer]] and [[winter]]. The main cause of the urban heat island effect is from the modification of land surfaces.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solecki | first1 = William D. | last2 = Rosenzweig | first2 = Cynthia | last3 = Parshall | first3 = Lily | last4 = Pope | first4 = Greg | last5 = Clark | first5 = Maria | last6 = Cox | first6 = Jennifer | last7 = Wiencke | first7 = Mary | year = 2005 | title = Mitigation of the heat island effect in urban New Jersey | url = | journal = Global Environmental Change Part B: Environmental Hazards | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 39–49 | doi = 10.1016/j.hazards.2004.12.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States. Environmental Protection Agency. Reducing Urban Heat Islands: Compendium of Strategies - Urban Heat Island Basics. By EPA. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waste heat]] generated by energy usage is a secondary contributor.&lt;ref name="liyan2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Y. | last2 = Zhao | first2 = X. | doi = 10.1029/2012JD018132 | title = An empirical study of the impact of human activity on long-term temperature change in China: A perspective from energy consumption | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 117 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2012JGRD..11717117L }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a population center grows, it tends to expand its area and increase its average temperature. The less-used term '''heat island''' refers to any area, populated or not, which is consistently hotter than the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|accessdate=2009-06-19|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=urban-heat-island1|title=Urban Heat Island|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monthly [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] is greater downwind of cities, partially due to the UHI. Increases in heat within urban centers increases the length of [[growing season]]s, and decreases the occurrence of weak [[tornado]]es. The UHI decreases [[air quality]] by increasing the production of pollutants such as [[ozone]], and decreases water quality as warmer waters flow into area streams and put stress on their [[ecosystem]]s.

Not all cities have a distinct urban heat island. Mitigation of the urban heat island effect can be accomplished through the use of [[green roof]]s and the [[reflective surfaces (climate engineering)|use of lighter-colored surfaces]] in urban areas, which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat.

Concerns have been raised about possible contribution from urban heat islands to [[global warming]]. While some lines of research did not detect a significant impact, other studies have concluded that heat islands can have measurable effects on climate phenomena at the global scale. 

==History==
The phenomenon was first investigated and described by [[Luke Howard]] in the 1810s, although he was not the one to name the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luke Howard]], ''The climate of London, deduced from Meteorological observations, made at different places in the neighbourhood of the metropolis'', 2 vol., London, 1818-20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:newyork heat island.jpg|thumb|Thermal (top) and vegetation (bottom) locations around [[New York City]] via infrared satellite imagery. A comparison of the images shows that where vegetation is dense, temperatures are cooler.]]

There are several causes of an urban heat island (UHI); for example, dark surfaces absorb significantly more [[solar radiation]], which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day;&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as [[concrete]] and [[asphalt]], have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including [[specific heat capacity|heat capacity]] and [[thermal conductivity]]) and surface radiative properties ([[albedo]] and [[emissivity]]) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes a change in the [[Earth's energy budget|energy budget]] of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas.&lt;ref name="Okeljnljn"&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. R. Oke|year=1982|title=The energetic basis of the urban heat island|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=108|pages=1–24|bibcode = 1982QJRMS.108....1O |doi = 10.1002/qj.49710845502|issue=455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major reason is the lack of [[evapotranspiration]] (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. The U.S. Forest Service found in 2018 that cities in the United States are losing 36 million trees each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larsson|first1=Naomi|title=US cities losing 36 million trees a year, researchers find|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/10/us-cities-losing-millions-of-trees-a-year|accessdate=10 May 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, Fabiane. Trees – the Natural Air Conditioners. Scientific Scribbles. The University of Melbourne, 23 Aug. 2013. Web. 27 Sept. 2013. &lt;http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/sciencecommunication/2013/08/23/trees-the-natural-air-conditioners/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States. NASA. Air Pollution Prevention Through Urban Heat Island Mitigation: An Update on the Urban Heat Island Pilot Project. By Virginia Gorsevski, Haider Taha, Dale Quattrochi, and Jeff Luvall. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes of a UHI are due to geometric effects. The tall buildings within many urban areas provide multiple surfaces for the reflection and absorption of sunlight, increasing the efficiency with which urban areas are heated. This is called the "[[Urban canyon|urban canyon effect]]". Another effect of buildings is the blocking of wind, which also inhibits cooling by [[convection]] and prevents pollutants from dissipating. Waste heat from automobiles, air conditioning, industry, and other sources also contributes to the UHI.&lt;ref name="liyan2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sailor | first1 = D.

"Rising Temperatures, Worsening Ozone Pollution." Climate Change and Your Health (2011): n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UHI can be defined as either the air temperature difference (the canopy UHI) or the surface temperature difference (surface UHI) between the urban and the rural area. These two show slightly different diurnal and seasonal variability and have different causes &lt;ref name="Chakra"&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. Chakraborty; C. Sarangi; S. N.

The air temperature difference between the UHI and the surrounding environment is large at night and small during the day. The opposite is true for skin temperatures of the urban landscape within the UHI.&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Roth |author2=T. R. Oke |author3=W. J. Emery  |last-author-amp=yes | title=Satellite-derived urban heat islands from three coastal cities and the utilization of such data in urban climatology | journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing | year=1989 | volume=10 | pages=1699–1720 | doi = 10.1080/01431168908904002|bibcode = 1989IJRS...10.1699R | issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the daytime, particularly when the skies are free of clouds, urban surfaces are warmed by the absorption of [[solar radiation]]. Surfaces in the urban areas tend to warm faster than those of the surrounding rural areas. By virtue of their high [[heat capacity|heat capacities]], urban surfaces act as a giant reservoir of heat energy. For example, concrete can hold roughly 2,000 times as much heat as an equivalent volume of air. As a result, the large daytime surface temperature within the UHI is easily seen via thermal remote sensing.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite journal|author=H.-Y. Lee|year=1993|title=An application of NOAA AVHRR thermal data to the study or urban heat islands|journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=27B|pages=1–13|doi=10.1016/0957-1272(93)90041-4 |bibcode = 1993AtmEB..27....1L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As is often the case with daytime heating, this warming also has the effect of generating [[convection|convective]] winds within the urban [[boundary layer]]. It is theorized that, due to the atmospheric mixing that results, the air temperature perturbation within the UHI is generally minimal or nonexistent during the day, though the surface temperatures can reach extremely high levels.&lt;ref name="Cam"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=I. Camilloni  |author2=V.

At night, the situation reverses. The absence of solar heating causes the atmospheric convection to decrease, and the urban boundary layer begins to stabilize. If enough stabilization occurs, an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion layer]] is formed. This traps urban air near the surface, and keeping surface air warm from the still-warm urban surfaces, forming the nighttime warmer air temperatures within the UHI. Other than the heat retention properties of urban areas, the nighttime maximum in urban canyons could also be due to the blocking of "sky view" during cooling: surfaces lose heat at night principally by radiation to the comparatively cool sky, and this is blocked by the buildings in an urban area. Radiative cooling is more dominant when wind speed is low and the sky is cloudless, and indeed the UHI is found to be largest at night in these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~jon/WWW/uhi-melb.html |author=C.J.G.

==Seasonal behavior==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
The urban heat island temperature difference is not only usually larger at night than during the day, but also larger in winter than in summer. This is particularly so in regions where snow is pervasive, as cities generally retain snow for much shorter time periods than the surrounding countryside (due to higher capacity to retain heat, as well as human-activity such as plowing). This decreases the albedo of the city and thereby magnifies the heating effect. Higher wind speeds in rural areas, particularly in winter, can also function to make them cooler than urban areas. Regions with distinct wet and dry seasons will exhibit a larger urban heat island effect during the dry season. The [[Time constant|thermal time constant]] of moist soil is much higher than that of dry soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swaid|first1=Hanna|title=NOCTURNAL VARIATION OF AIR-SURFACE TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS FOR TYPICAL URBAN AND RURAL SURFACES|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/095712729190005Y?via%3Dihub|website=ScienceDirect|accessdate=7 December 2017|doi=10.1016/0957-1272(91)90005-Y|volume=25|pages=333–341|year=1991|bibcode=1991AtmEB..25..333S}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, moist rural soils will cool slower than dry rural soils and act to minimize the nocturnal temperature difference between urban and rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Imamura|first1=I.R.|title=Role of soil moisture in the determination of urban heat island intensity in different climate regimes|url=https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/AIR93/AIR93031FU.pdf|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction==
If a city or town has a good system of taking weather observations the UHI can be measured directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steeneveld | first1=G.J.|title=Quantifying urban heat island effects and human comfort for cities of variable size and urban morphology in the Netherlands|doi=10.1029/2011JD015988|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=116|pages=D20129|year=2011|bibcode=2011JGRD..11620129S}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative is to use a complex simulation of the location to calculate the UHI, or to use an approximate empirical method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kershaw | first1 = T.

Leonard O. Myrup published the first comprehensive numerical treatment to predict the effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in 1969.  His paper surveys UHI and criticizes then-existing theories as being excessively qualitative. A general purpose, numerical energy budget model is described and applied to the urban atmosphere. Calculations for several special cases as well as a sensitivity analysis are presented. The model is found to predict the correct order of magnitude of the urban temperature excess. The heat island effect is found to be the net result of several competing physical processes. In general, reduced evaporation in the city center and the thermal properties of the city building and paving materials are the dominant parameters. It is suggested that such a model could be used in engineering calculations to improve the climate of existing and future cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1175/1520-0450(1969)008&lt;0908:ANMOTU&gt;2.0.CO;2 | volume=8 | title=A Numerical Model of the Urban Heat Island | journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology | pages=908–918|bibcode = 1969JApMe...8..908M | year=1969 | last1 = Myrup | first1 = Leonard O.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on animals==
[[Ant]] colonies in urban heat islands have an increased heat tolerance at no cost to cold tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000258|title=Urban Physiology: City Ants Possess High Heat Tolerance|author=Michael J.

Species that are good at colonizing can utilize conditions provided by urban heat islands to thrive in regions outside of their normal range.  Examples of this include [[grey-headed flying fox]] (''Pteropus poliocephalus'') and the [[common house gecko]] (''Hemidactylus frenatus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shochat|first1=Eyal|last2=Warren|first2=Paige S.|last3=Faeth|first3=Stanley H.|last4=Mclntyre|first4=Nancy E.|last5=Hope|first5=Diane|title=From Patterns to Emerging  Processes in Mechanistic Urban Ecology|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=April 2006|volume=21|page=3|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.11.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grey-headed flying foxes, found in [[Melbourne, Australia]], colonized urban habitats following increase in temperatures there. Increased temperatures, causing warmer winter conditions, made the city more similar in climate to the  more northerly wildland habitat of the species.

With attempts to mitigate and manage urban heat islands, temperature changes and availability of food and water are reduced.  With temperate climates, urban heat islands will extend the growing season, therefore altering breeding strategies of inhabiting species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shochat|first1=Eyal|last2=Warren|first2=Paige S.|last3=Faeth|first3=Stanley H.|last4=Mclntyre|first4=Nancy E.|last5=Hope|first5=Diane|title=From Patterns to Emerging  Processes in Mechanistic Urban Ecology|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=April 2006|volume=21|page=3|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.11.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be seen the best in the effects that urban heat islands have on water temperature.  With the temperature of the nearby buildings sometimes reaching over 50 degrees different from the near-surface air temperature, precipitation will warm rapidly, causing runoff into nearby streams, lakes and rivers (or other bodies of water) to provide excessive thermal pollution.  The increase in the thermal pollution has the ability to increase water temperature by 20 to 30 degrees.  This increase will cause the fish species inhabiting the body of water to undergo thermal stress and shock due to the rapid change in temperature to their climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islands in the Sun|url=http://islands.environment.umn.edu/research/themes/|website=Institute on the Environment|publisher=University of Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban heat islands caused by cities have altered the [[natural selection]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shochat|first1=Eyal|last2=Warren|first2=Paige S.|last3=Faeth|first3=Stanley H.|last4=Mclntyre|first4=Nancy E.|last5=Hope|first5=Diane|title=From Patterns to Emerging  Processes in Mechanistic Urban Ecology|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=April 2006|volume=21|page=4|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.11.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Selective pressures like temporal variation in food, predation and water are relaxed causing for a new set of selective forces to roll out.  For example, within urban habitats, insects are more abundant than in rural areas.  Insects are [[ectotherms]]. This means that they depend on the temperature of the environment to control their body temperature, making for the warmer climates of the city perfect for their ability to thrive.  A study done in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] conducted on [[Parthenolecanium quercifex]] (oak scales), showed that this particular species preferred warmer climates and were therefore found in higher abundance in the urban habitats than on [[oak]] trees in rural habitats.  Over time of living in urban habitats, they have adapted to thrive in warmer climates than in cooler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tang|first1=Teri|title=Where are the Insects?|url=https://askabiologist.asu.edu/plosable/where-are-insects|website=School of Life Sciences|publisher=Arizona State University|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of non-native species is heavily dependent on the amount of human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonnell|first1=Mark J.|title=Ecosystem processes along an urban-to-rural gradient|journal=Urban ecosystems|date=1997|volume=1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this can be seen in the populations of [[American cliff swallow|cliff swallows]] seen taking nests under the eaves of homes in urban habitats.  They make their homes using the shelter provided  by the humans in the upper regions of homes, allowing for an influx in their populations due to added protection and reduced predator numbers.

==Other impacts on weather and climate==
Aside from the effect on temperature, UHIs can produce secondary effects on local meteorology, including the altering of local wind patterns, the development of [[cloud]]s and [[fog]], the [[humidity]], and the rates of precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Climate – Climate Study and UHI via the Internet Wayback Machine |url=http://asusmart.com/urbanclimate.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20071123091726/http://asusmart.com/urbanclimate.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-11-23 |publisher=[[Arizona State University]] |year=2006 |author=Arizona Board of Regents |accessdate=2007-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extra heat provided by the UHI leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity. In addition, the UHI creates during the day a local low pressure area where relatively moist air from its rural surroundings converges, possibly leading to more favorable conditions for cloud formation.&lt;ref name="Hee"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chiel C. van Heerwaarden  |author2=J.

UHIs have the potential to directly influence the health and welfare of urban residents.

Research in the United States suggests that the relationship between extreme temperature and mortality varies by location. Heat is more likely to increase the risk of mortality in cities in the northern part of the country than in the southern regions of the country. For example, when [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], or [[New York City|New York]]  experience unusually hot summertime temperatures, elevated levels of illness and death are predicted. In contrast, parts of the country that are mild to hot year-round have a lower public health risk from excessive heat. Research shows that residents of southern cities, such as [[Miami]], [[Tampa]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], tend to be acclimated to hot weather conditions and therefore less vulnerable to heat related deaths. However, as a whole, people in the United States appear to be adapting to hotter temperatures further north each decade. However, this might be due to better infrastructure, more modern building design, and better public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Changing heat-related mortality in the United States|author1=Robert E.

Increased temperatures have been reported to cause [[heat stroke]], [[heat exhaustion]], [[heat syncope]], and [[heat cramps]].&lt;ref name=Review1/&gt; Some studies have also looked at how severe heat stroke can lead to permanent damage to organ systems.&lt;ref name=Review1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kovats|first=R.

A researcher found that high UHI intensity correlates with increased concentrations of air pollutants that gathered at night, which can affect the next day's [[Air pollution|air quality]].&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt; These pollutants include [[volatile organic compounds]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]], and [[Particulates|particulate matter]].&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; The production of these pollutants combined with the higher temperatures in UHIs can quicken the production of [[ozone]].&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt; Ozone at surface level is considered to be a harmful pollutant.&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt; Studies suggest that increased temperatures in UHIs can increase polluted days but also note that other factors (e.g. [[Atmospheric pressure|air pressure]], [[cloud cover]], [[wind speed]]) can also have an effect on pollution.&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] notes that it "is difficult to make valid projections of heat-related illness and death under varying climate change scenarios" and that "heat–related deaths are preventable, as evidenced by the decline of all-cause mortality during heat events over the past 35 years".&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat-Related Morbidity and Mortality|url=https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/effects/heat_related.htm|work=U.S. Center for Disease Control|publisher=USA Government|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some studies suggest the possibility that health impacts from UHIs are disproportionate because the impacts can be unevenly distributed based on a variety of factors (e.g. age,&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Díaz|first=J.|author2=Jordán, A. |author3=García, R. |author4=López, C. |author5=Alberdi, J. |author6=Hernández, E. |author7= Otero, A. |title=Heat waves in Madrid 1986–1997: effects on the health of the elderly|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|date=1 February 2014|volume=75|issue=3|pages=163–170|doi=10.1007/s00420-001-0290-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ethnicity and socioeconomic status&lt;ref name="Harlan article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harlan|first=Sharon L.|author2=Brazel, Anthony J. |author3=Prashad, Lela |author4=Stefanov, William L. |author5= Larsen, Larissa |title=Neighborhood microclimates and vulnerability to heat stress|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=December 2006|volume=63|issue=11|pages=2847–2863|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.07.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This raises the possibility of health impacts from UHIs being an [[environmental justice]] issue.

===Inequality of tree canopy cover===

;Relationship between neighborhood income and tree canopy cover

In recent years, researchers have discovered a strong correlation between neighborhood income and tree canopy cover. In 2010, researchers at Auburn University and University of Southern California found that the presence of trees are "highly responsive to changes in [neighborhood] income."&lt;ref name=Demand&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Pengyu|author2=Zhang Yaoqui |title=Demand for Urban Forests in United States Cities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204607002174|accessdate=7 May 2014|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2007.09.005|volume=84|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|pages=293–300|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Low-income neighborhoods tend to have significantly fewer trees than neighborhoods with higher incomes. They described this unequal distribution of trees as a demand for "luxury," rather than "necessity."&lt;ref name="Income Inequality"&gt;{{cite web|last=De Chant|first=Tim|title=Urban Trees Reveal Income Inequality|url=http://persquaremile.com/2012/05/17/urban-trees-reveal-income-inequality/|publisher=Per Square Mile|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the study, "for every 1 percent increase in per capita income, demand for forest cover increased by 1.76 percent. But when income dropped by the same amount, demand decreased by 1.26 percent."&lt;ref name="Income Inequality"/&gt;

Trees are a necessary feature in combating the urban heat island effect because they reduce air temperatures by 10&amp;nbsp;°F or 5.5&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 22 Benefits of Trees|url=http://www.treepeople.org/top-22-benefits-trees|website=Tree People|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and surface temperatures by up to 20-45&amp;nbsp;°F or 11-25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trees and Vegetation|url=http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/mitigation/trees.htm|website=EPA.gov|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers hypothesized that less-well-off neighborhoods do not have the financial resources to plant and maintain trees. [[Affluent]] neighborhoods can afford more trees, on "both public and private property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chant|first1=Tim|title=Urban Trees reveal income inequality|url=http://persquaremile.com/2012/05/17/urban-trees-reveal-income-inequality/|website=Per Square Mile|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this is also that wealthier homeowners and communities can afford more land, which can be kept open as [[green belt|green space]], whereas poorer ones are often rentals, where landowners try to maximize their [[profit (economics)|profit]] by putting as much [[population density|density]] as possible on their land.

Additionally, many [[blogging]] sites overlay [[satellite imagery]] provided by [[Google Maps]] and [[census]] data to confirm or debunk the aforementioned research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sutroforest.com/2012/06/04/trees-and-income-inequality/ |title=Save Mount Sutro Forest |accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on nearby water bodies==
UHIs also impair water quality. Hot pavement and rooftop surfaces transfer their excess heat to stormwater, which then drains into storm sewers and raises water temperatures as it is released into streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes. Additionally, increased urban water body temperatures lead to a decrease in diversity in the water.&lt;ref&gt;NYS DEC. "Streams Tributary to Onondaga Lake Biological Assessment." Dec.ny.gov. N.p., 2008. Web. 12 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001, rains over [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], led to a 10.5C (18.9F) rise in the nearby stream within one hour, which led to a fish kill. Since the temperature of the rain was comparatively cool, it could be attributed to the hot pavement of the city. Similar events have been documented across the American Midwest, as well as Oregon and California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BMVR37-8Jh0C&amp;pg=PA686&amp;lpg=PA686&amp;dq=satellite+temperature+urban+heat+island+book#v=onepage&amp;q=satellite%20temperature%20urban%20heat%20island%20book&amp;f=false|author1=Paul A.

==Impact on energy usage==

The reflective vinyl roof, not absorbing solar radiation, is shown in blue surrounded by other hot spots.]]Another consequence of urban heat islands is the increased energy required for [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]] in cities that are in comparatively hot climates. The Heat Island Group estimates that the heat island effect costs [[Los Angeles]] about [[US$]]100&amp;nbsp;million&lt;!-- What year's dollars? --&gt; per year in energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/EnergyUse/ |title=Energy Use |date=2000-06-23 |author=Sheng-chieh Chang |publisher=Environmental Energies Technology Division |accessdate=2009-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311050754/http://eetd.lbl.gov/heatisland/EnergyUse/ |archivedate=March 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, those that are in cold climates such as [[Moscow|Moscow, Russia]] would have less demand for heating. However, through the implementation of heat island reduction strategies, significant annual net energy savings have been calculated for northern locations such as Chicago, Salt Lake City, and Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Aging and Weathering of Cool Roofing Membranes | url=http://vinylroofs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/aging_weathering.pdf | publisher=[[Cool Roofing Symposium]] | date=2005-08-23| accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==
[[File:20080708 Chicago City Hall Green Roof.JPG|thumb|right|Green roof of [[Chicago City Hall|City Hall]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].]]
The temperature difference between urban areas and the surrounding suburban or rural areas can be as much as {{convert|5|C-change|abbr=on}}. Nearly 40 percent of that increase is due to the prevalence of dark roofs, with the remainder coming from dark-colored pavement and the declining presence of vegetation. The heat island effect can be counteracted slightly by using white or reflective materials to build houses, roofs, pavements, and roads, thus increasing the overall [[albedo]] of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Albers, R. A. W., Bosch, P. R., Blocken, B., Van Den Dobbelsteen, A. A. J. F., Van Hove, L. W. A., Spit, T. J. M., ... &amp; Rovers, V. (2015). Overview of challenges and achievements in the Climate Adaptation of Cities and in the Climate Proof Cities program. Building and environment, 83, 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to remedying the other sources of the problem, replacing dark roofing requires the least amount of investment for the most immediate return. A [[cool roof]] made from a reflective material such as vinyl reflects at least 75 percent of the sun's rays, and emit at least 70 percent of the solar radiation absorbed by the building envelope. Asphalt built-up roofs (BUR), by comparison, reflect 6 percent to 26 percent of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comprehensive Cool Roof Guide from the Vinyl Roofing Division of the Chemical Fabrics and Film Association |url=http://vinylroofs.org/resources/coof-roofing-codes-programs-standards/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054154/http://vinylroofs.org/resources/coof-roofing-codes-programs-standards/index.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using light-colored concrete has proven effective in reflecting up to 50% more light than asphalt and reducing ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="coolpave 2"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cool Pavement Report | url=http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/resources/pdf/CoolPavementReport_Former%20Guide_complete.pdf | format=PDF | date=June 2005 | publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]] | page=14| accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low albedo value, characteristic of black asphalt, absorbs a large percentage of solar heat creating warmer near-surface temperatures. Paving with light-colored concrete, in addition to replacing asphalt with light-colored concrete, communities may be able to lower average temperatures.&lt;ref name="worldchange"&gt;{{cite book | author=Al Gore |author2=A. Steffen  | title=World Changing: A User's Guide for the 21st Century | publisher=Abrams | location=New York | year=2008 | pages= 258}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research into the interaction between reflective pavements and buildings has found that, unless the nearby buildings are fitted with reflective glass, solar radiation reflected off light-colored pavements can increase building temperatures, increasing air conditioning demands.&lt;ref name=Yaghoobian&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yaghoobian | first1 = N. | last2 = Kleissl | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.uclim.2012.09.002 | title = Effect of reflective pavements on building energy use | journal = Urban Climate | volume = 2 | pages = 25 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A second option is to increase the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of [[green roof]]s. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green (Planted) Roofs |url=http://vinylroofs.org/resources/green-planted-roofs/index.html |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/programs/environment/emep/project/6681_25/06-06%20Complete%20report-web.pdf|title=Mitigating New York City's Heat Island With Urban Forestry, Living Roofs, and Light Surfaces|author=New York City Regional Heat Island Initiative|date=October 2006|accessdate=2009-06-18|publisher=New York State Energy Research and Development Authority|page=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hypothetical "cool communities" program in [[Los Angeles]] has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately {{convert|3|C-change|0|abbr=on}} after planting ten million trees, reroofing five million homes, and painting one-quarter of the roads at an estimated cost of US$1&amp;nbsp;billion, giving estimated annual benefits of US$170&amp;nbsp;million from reduced air-conditioning costs and US$360&amp;nbsp;million in smog related health savings.&lt;ref name="Heat Islands"&gt;{{cite web| author=Arthur Rosenfeld|author2=[[Joseph Romm]] |author3=Hashem Akbari |author4= Alana Lloyd | title=Painting the Town White – and Green| publisher=MIT Technology Review|date=February–March 1997|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/PUBS/PAINTING/| accessdate=2007-09-29| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714173907/http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/PUBS/PAINTING/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitigation strategies include:

*'''White roofs''': Painting rooftops white has become a common strategy to reduce the heat island effect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Zinzi, M., and S. Agnoli. "Cool and green roofs. An energy and comfort comparison between passive cooling and mitigation urban heat island techniques for residential buildings in the Mediterranean region." Energy and Buildings. 55. (2012): 66-76. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In cities, there are many dark colored surfaces that absorb the heat of the sun in turn lowering the [[albedo]] of the city.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; White rooftops allow high solar reflectance and high solar emittance, increasing the albedo of the city or area the effect is occurring.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
*'''Green roofs''': Green roofs are another method of decreasing the urban heat island effect. Green roofery is the practice of having vegetation on a roof; such as having trees or a garden. The plants that are on the roof  increase the albedo and decreases the urban heat island effect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; This method has been studied and criticized for the fact that green roofs are affected by climatic conditions, green roof variables are hard to measure, and are very complex systems&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
*'''Planting trees in cities''': Planting trees around the city can be another way of increasing albedo and decreasing the urban heat island effect. Trees absorb [[carbon dioxide]] and provide shade. It is recommended to plant [[deciduous]] trees because they can provide many benefits such as more shade in the summer and not blocking warmth of winter&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfield, Arthur, Joseph Romm, Hashem Akbari, and Alana Lloyd.

*'''[[Green parking lot]]s:''' Green parking lots use surfaces other than asphalt and vegetation to limit the impact urban heat island effect.

==Mitigation policies, measures and other strategies==

===AB32 scoping plan===

AB32 required the California Air Resources Board to create a scoping plan. This plan is California's approach on how to carry out their goal of  combatting climate change by reducing greenhouse emissions by 2020 to levels from the 1990s. The scoping plan had four primary programs, advanced clean cars, cap and trade, renewables portfolio standard and [[low-carbon fuel standard]] all geared toward increased energy efficiency. The plan has main strategies to reduce green house gases such as having monetary incentives, regulations and voluntary actions. Every five years the scoping plan is updated.&lt;ref&gt;AB 32 Scoping Plan." Scoping Plan. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Apr. 2014.   &lt;http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/scopingplan/scopingplan.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''The advanced clean car rules program''' was made to reduce tail pipe emissions. The Air Resources Board approved the program to control emissions for newer models from the year 2017 to 2025. Some of their goals by 2025 are to have more environmentally superior cars to be available in different models and different types of cars. New automobiles will emit 34 percent fewer global warming gases and 75 percent fewer smog-forming emissions. And if fully implemented consumers can save an average of $6,000 over the life of the car.&lt;ref&gt;"California's Advanced Clean Cars Program." Advanced Clean Cars. N.p., n.d.

*'''The renewable portfolio standard''' mandates to increase [[renewable energy]] from a variety of sources such as [[solar power]] and wind. Investor-owned utilities, community choice aggregators and electric service providers are required to increase [[procurement]] to 33% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;"California Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS)." California Publics Utilities Commission. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/Renewables/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Low carbon fuel standards''' is administered by the [[California Air Resources Board]] and attempts to make wider choice of cleaner fuels to Californians. Producers of petroleum-based fuels are required to reduce the [[carbon intensity]] of their products to 10 percent in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;"Low Carbon Fuel Standard." Low Carbon Fuel Standard. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.energy.ca.gov/low_carbon_fuel_standard/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Cap and trade''' is designed to reduce the effects of [[climate change]] by setting a cap on [[greenhouse gases]] released into the [[atmosphere]]. The cap will decline approximately three percent each year in 2013. The trading will create incentives to reduce the effects of climate change in California communities by reducing greenhouse gases through investments in clean technologies.&lt;ref&gt;"Cap-and-Trade Program."

'''Clean Air Act'''

The [[EPA]] has initiated several air quality requirements that help reduce [[ground-level ozone]] that leads to urban heat islands. In the Clean Air Act, one of the EPA's chief policies, there are certain regulations that are put in place to ensure the state's emissions stay below a certain level. Included in the Clean Air Act, all states must set forth a [[State Implementation Plan]] (SIP) which is designed to guarantee all states meet a central air quality standard.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;"Reducing Urban Heat Islands: Compendium of Strategies | Heat Island Effect | US EPA." EPA. Environmental Protection Agency, n.d. Web. 16 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/resources/pdf/ActivitiesCompendium.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''State implementation plans and policies'''

*'''The Emerging and Voluntary Measures Policy''' allows a state to add unconventional forms of heat island mitigation. This can include removing [[pollution]] after it has already been emitted into air, water, or soil. These measures are not implemented into law, but they do make it possible for certain parties to voluntarily become more efficient. The purpose of this policy is for all polluting sources to follow by example and use the most successful forms of mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;"Roadmap for Incorporating Energy

*'''The Guidance on State Implementation Plan Credits for Emissions Reductions from Electric-Sector Energy Efficiency or Renewable Energy Measures''' is an educational tool for states to create an up-to-date and well-organized SIP. It allows states to include plans that meet the guidelines or plans that exceed expectations. Based on the success of their SIP, some states can have their plans incorporated into other SIPs.&lt;ref&gt;"Incorporating Emerging And Voluntary Measures In A State Implementation Plan (SIP).

*'''The Bundled Measures Policy''' authorizes different factions within the state to collaborate on mitigation projects. This policy takes a more of a community-based approach by adding several groups for the purpose of multiple perspectives and inventive approaches. The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co-benefits for both parties.&lt;ref&gt;"Page, Stephen, "Guidance on Incorporating Bundled Measures in a State Implementation Plan." EPA.

==Implementation of policies==

The Seattle Green Factor, a multifaceted system for urban [[landscaping]], has seen much success in the mitigation of urban heat islands. The program focuses on areas that are prone to high pollution, such as business districts. There are strict guidelines for any new [[construction]] that exceeds roughly 20 parking spaces, and this platform helps developers physically see their levels of pollution while trying different methods of construction to figure out the most effective course of action. Seattle has correspondingly produced a "score sheet" for cities to use in their city planning.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;

==AB32 and urban heat islands==
*Urban heat islands increase demand for energy consumption during the summer when temperatures rise. As a result of increased energy consumption, there is an increase in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This policy focuses on lowering greenhouse emissions, which contributes to lowering the heat island effect.&lt;ref&gt;AB 32 Scoping Plan." Scoping Plan. N.p., n.d.

==Incentives==
*'''[[Sacramento Municipal Utility District]]''' (SMUD) and the Sacramento Tree Foundation have partnered to provide the city of Sacramento shade trees for free. The program allows citizens to receive trees from four to seven feet tall. They also give them fertilizer, and delivery, all at no cost. They encourage citizens to plant their trees to benefit their home by reducing air conditioning costs. Approximately more than 450,000 shade trees have been planted in the Sacramento area.&lt;ref&gt;"SMUD." SMUD Video Player. N.p., n.d.

*'''The Eco-Roof Incentive Program''': In Canada, [[grants]] are distributed throughout Toronto for installing green and cool roofs on residential and commercial buildings. This will reduce usage of energy and lower green house gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Ecoroof Incentive Program." Live Green Toronto, n.d. Web. &lt;http://www.greenroofs.org/resources/EcoRoofBrochure_Email_2013.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Tree vitalize''': This program is a partnership with multiple entities that focuses on helping restore tree cover in the city, it also educates citizens about the positive effects of trees on climate change and the urban heat island effect. And another goal they have is to build capacity among local governments to understand, protect and restore their urban trees. Because there is a need for educating citizens about the maintenance of trees, Treevitalize provides nine hours of classroom and field training to community residents.  The classes cover a variety of topics such as tree identification, pruning, tree biology, and proper species selection.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;"TreeVitalize." TreeVitalize. N.p., n.d.

==Weatherization==
[[U.S. Department of Energy]] Weatherization Assistance Program helps low income recipients by covering their heating bills and helping the families to make their homes energy efficient. In addition, this program allows states to also use the funds to install cooling efficiency measures such as shading devices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Tree protection ordinances==
*A variety of local governments have implemented tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to [[prune]] or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of [[Glendale, California]]: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the [[California sycamore]], the [[coast live oak]], mesa oak, [[valley oak]], [[scrub oak]], [[California bay]]. Anyone who is planning on removing or [[Pruning|trimming]] the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they have to provide detailed information about the number of trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself. They also have to submit photographs of the site, and a site plan sketch.&lt;ref&gt;"Indigenous Tree Program." City of Glendale, CA :. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.glendaleca.gov/government/city-departments/public-works/indigenous-tree-program&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another example is the city of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California. The tree protection ordinance prohibits the removal of [[coast live oak]] trees and any excessive [[pruning]] that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited. The only exception is if the tree is poses a danger to life or limb and danger to the property.&lt;ref&gt;"Tree Protection Program - City of Berkeley, CA." Planning and Development-City of Berkeley, CA. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/Planning_and_Development/Home/Tree_Protection_Program.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The city of [[Visalia, California]], has implemented a street tree ordinance intended to promote and regulate the [[planting]], maintenance, and protection of street trees within the city. Their [[Local ordinance|ordinance]] does not allow street trees to be altered, [[pruned]] or removed. Street trees are also protected during construction.&lt;ref&gt;"City of Visalia - Street Tree Ordinance." Street Tree Ordinance. N.p., n.d.

==Co-benefits of mitigation strategies==

===Trees and gardens aid mental health===
*A large percentage of people who live in [[urban area]]s have access to parks and gardens in their areas, which are probably the only connections they have with nature. A study shows that having contact with nature helps promote our [[health]] and well-being. People who had access to gardens or parks were found to be healthier than those who did not.&lt;ref&gt;Maller, C. "Healthy Nature Healthy People: 'contact with Nature' as an Upstream Health Promotion Intervention for Populations." Health Promotion International 21.1 (2005): 45-54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another study done investigating whether or not the viewing of natural scenery may influence the recoveries of people from undergoing surgeries, found that people who had a window with a scenic view had shorter postoperative hospital stays and fewer negative comments from nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ulrich | first1 = R | year = 1984 | title = View through a Window May Influence Recovery from Surgery | url = | journal = Science | volume = 224 | issue = 4647| pages = 420–21 | doi=10.1126/science.6143402| bibcode = 1984Sci...224..420U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree planting as empowerment and community building===
*Los Angeles [[TreePeople]], is an example of how [[tree planting]] can empower a community. Tree people provides the opportunity for people to come together, build capacity, community pride and the opportunity to collaborate and [[Social network|network]] with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmsen, Carl. Partnerships for Empowerment: Participatory Research for Community-based Natural Resource Management. London: Earthscan, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green roofs as food production===
*Growing food on rooftops could be an option for fast growing communities. Popular plants grown for food include, [[chives]], [[oregano]] and [[lavender]] these plants are [[suitable]] for [[green roofs]] because they are [[evolutionarily]] equipped for [[Mediterranean climate]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Dunnett, Nigel. Small Green Roofs: Low-tech Options for Greener Living. Portland, Or.: Timber, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green roofs and wildlife biodiversity===
*Green roofs are important for [[wildlife]] because they allow organisms to inhabit the new garden. To maximize opportunities to attract wildlife to a green roof, one must aid the garden to be as diverse as possible in the plants that are added. By planting a wide array of plants, different kinds of [[invertebrate]] species will be able to colonize, they will be provided with [[foraging]] sources and  habitat opportunities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Urban forests and a cleaner atmosphere===
*Trees provide benefits such as absorbing carbon dioxide, and other pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;Hilltop Arboretum. "Nature the Changing Climate and You: Act Locally!" 5.4 (2007). Web. &lt;http://hilltop.lsu.edu/hilltop/hilltop.nsf/$Content/Newsletters/$file/07winter.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Trees also provide shade and reduce ozone emissions from vehicles. By having many trees, we can cool the city heat by approximately 10 degrees to 20 degrees, which will help reducing ozone and helping communities that are mostly affected by the effects of climate change and urban heat islands.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Gregory, James Simpson, Paula Peper, Shelley Gardner, Kelaine Vargas, Scott Maco, and Qingfu Xiao. "Coastal Plain Community Tree Guide: Benefits, Costs, and Strategic Planting". USDA, Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station. (2006). Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green building programs===
Voluntary green building programs have been promoting the mitigation of the heat island effect for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://vinylroofs.org/resources/coof-roofing-codes-programs-standards/voluntary-green-building-programs/index.html|title=   Voluntary Green Building Programs|deadurl=   yes|archiveurl=   https://web.archive.org/web/20120321035335/http://www.vinylroofs.org/resources/coof-roofing-codes-programs-standards/voluntary-green-building-programs/index.html|archivedate=   2012-03-21|df=   }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the ways for a site to earn points under the US Green Building Council's (USGBC) [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System is to take action that reduces heat islands, minimizing impacts on microclimates and human and wildlife habitats. Credits associated with reflective roofing or planted roofs can help a building achieve LEED certification. Buildings also receive credits by providing shade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=LEED 2009 for New Construction and Major Renovations Rating System |publisher=US Green Building Council|date=November 2008 |url=http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=5546 | accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, The [http://www.thegbi.org/ Green Building Initiative] (GBI)'s [[Green Globes]] program awards points to sites that take measures to decrease a building's energy consumption and reduce the heat island effect. As many as 10 points may be awarded to sites with roof coverage from vegetation, highly reflective materials, or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Globes |url=http://vinylroofs.org/resources/coof-roofing-codes-programs-standards/voluntary-green-building-programs/index.html |accessdate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321035335/http://www.vinylroofs.org/resources/coof-roofing-codes-programs-standards/voluntary-green-building-programs/index.html |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost analysis==
Every year in the U.S. 15% of energy goes towards the [[air conditioning]] of buildings in these urban heat islands. According to Rosenfeld et al., "the air conditioning demand has risen 10% within the last 40 years."&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld, Arthur H. 1998"&gt;Rosenfeld, Arthur H., et al. "Cool communities: strategies for heat island mitigation and smog reduction." Energy and Buildings 28.1 (1998): 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Home and business owners alike can benefit from building a cool community. A decrease in energy usage directly correlates to cost efficiency. Areas with substantial [[vegetation]] and reflective surface materials used for roofs of houses, pavement, and roads are proven to be more effective and cost efficient.

In a case study of the [[Los Angeles Basin]], simulations showed that even when trees are not strategically placed in these urban heat islands, they can still aid in minimization of pollutants and energy reduction. It is estimated that with this wide-scale implementation, the city of Los Angeles can annually save $100M with most of the savings coming from cool roofs, lighter colored pavement, and the planting of trees. With a citywide implementation, added benefits from the lowering smog-level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld, Arthur H. 1998"/&gt;

The cost efficiency of [[green roofs]] is quite high because of several reasons. According to Carter, "A conventional roof is estimated to be $83.78/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; while a green roof was estimated at $158.82/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carter | first1 = Timothy | last2 = Keeler | first2 = Andrew | year = 2008 | title = Life-cycle cost–benefit analysis of extensive vegetated roof systems | url = | journal = Journal of environmental management | volume = 87 | issue = 3| pages = 350–363 | doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.01.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; For one, green roofs have over double the lifespan of a conventional roof, effectively decelerating the amount of roof replacements every year. In addition to roof-life, green roofs add [[stormwater]] management reducing fees for utilities. The cost for green roofs is more in the beginning, but over a period of time, their efficiency provides financial as well as health benefits.

In Capital E Analysis' conclusions of the financial benefits of green buildings, it was determined that green roofs successfully lowered energy usage and raised health benefits. For every square foot of green roof used in one study the savings amounted to $5.80 energy-wise. There were also savings seen in the emissions, water, and maintenance categories. Overall, the savings amounted to $52.90-$71.30 on average while the cost of going green totaled -$3.00-$5.00.&lt;ref&gt;Kats, Gregory. Green building costs and financial benefits. Boston, MA: Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global warming==
Because some parts of some cities may be hotter than their surroundings, concerns have been raised that the effects of [[urban sprawl]] might be misinterpreted as an increase in [[global warming|global temperature]]. Such effects are removed by [[homogenization (climate)|homogenization]] from the raw climate record by comparing urban stations with surrounding stations. While the "heat island" warming is an important local effect, there is no evidence that it biases ''trends'' in the homogenized [[historical temperature record]]. For example, urban and rural trends are very similar.&lt;ref name="grida.no"/&gt;

{{anchor |Third Assessment Report from the IPCC}}
The [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report from the IPCC]] says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, over the Northern Hemisphere land areas where urban heat islands are most apparent, both the trends of lower-[[troposphere|tropospheric]] temperature and surface air temperature show no significant differences. In fact, the lower-tropospheric temperatures warm at a slightly greater rate over North America (about 0.28°C/decade using satellite data) than do the surface temperatures (0.27°C/decade), although again the difference is not statistically significant.&lt;ref name="grida.no"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{anchor |Ground temperature measurements}}
Ground temperature measurements, like most weather observations, are logged by location. Their siting predates the massive sprawl, roadbuilding programs, and high- and medium-rise expansions which contribute to the UHI. More importantly, station logs allow sites in question to be filtered easily from data sets. Doing so, the presence of heat islands is visible, but overall trends change in magnitude, not direction.
The effects of the urban heat island may be overstated. One study stated, "Contrary to generally accepted wisdom, no statistically significant impact of [[urbanization]] could be found in annual temperatures." This was done by using satellite-based night-light detection of urban areas, and more thorough homogenisation of the time series (with corrections, for example, for the tendency of surrounding rural stations to be slightly higher in elevation, and thus cooler, than urban areas). If its conclusion is accepted, then it is necessary to "unravel the mystery of how a global temperature time series created partly from urban [[in situ#Earth and atmospheric sciences|in situ]] stations could show no contamination from urban warming."  The main conclusion is that [[microscale meteorology|microscale]] and local-scale impacts dominate the [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] impact of the urban heat island. Many sections of towns may be warmer than rural sites, but [[surface weather observation]]s are likely to be made in park "cool islands."&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/wmo/ccl/rural-urban.pdf|author=T. C. Peterson|year=2003|title=Assessment of Urban Versus Rural In Situ Surface Temperatures in the Contiguous United States: No Difference Found|journal=Journal of Climate|volume=16|pages=2941–2959 | doi = 10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016&lt;2941:AOUVRI&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2003JCli...16.2941P|issue=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all cities show a warming relative to their rural surroundings. After trends were adjusted in urban [[weather station]]s around the world to match rural stations in their regions, in an effort to homogenise the temperature record, in 42&amp;nbsp;percent of cases, cities were getting ''cooler'' relative to their surroundings rather than warmer. One reason is that urban areas are heterogeneous, and weather stations are often sited in "cool islands" – parks, for example – within urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J.

A view often held by those who reject the evidence for [[global warming]] is that much of the temperature increase seen in land based thermometers could be due to an increase in urbanization and the siting of measurement stations in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Black2004 /&gt; For example, [[Ross McKitrick]] and [[Patrick J.

The preliminary results of an independent assessment carried out by the [[Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature]] group, and made available to the public in October 2011, found that among other scientific concerns raised by skeptics, the urban heat island effect did not bias the results obtained by NOAA, the Hadley Centre and NASA's GISS.

{{anchor |Climate Change 2007}}
''Climate Change 2007'', the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report from the IPCC]] states the following.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Studies that have looked at hemispheric and global scales conclude that any urban-related trend is an order of magnitude smaller than decadal and longer time-scale trends evident in the series (e.g., Jones et al., 1990; Peterson et al., 1999). This result could partly be attributed to the omission from the gridded data set of a small number of sites (&lt;1%) with clear urban-related warming trends. In a worldwide set of about 270 stations, Parker (2004, 2006) noted that warming trends in night minimum temperatures over the period 1950 to 2000 were not enhanced on calm nights, which would be the time most likely to be affected by urban warming. Thus, the global land warming trend discussed is very unlikely to be influenced significantly by increasing urbanisation (Parker, 2006). ... Accordingly, this assessment adds the same level of urban warming uncertainty as in the TAR: 0.006°C per decade since 1900 for land, and 0.002°C per decade since 1900 for blended land with ocean, as ocean UHI is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter3.pdf|page=244|year=2007|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report - Chapter 3 - Observations: Surface and Atmospheric Climate Change|author1=Kevin E.

A 2014 study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] looks at the potential of large-scale urban adaptation to counteract the effects of long-term global [[climate change]]. The researchers calculate that without any adaptive urban design, by 2100 the expansion of existing U.S. cities into regional [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolises]] could raise near-surface temperatures between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius over large regions, "a significant fraction of the 21st-century greenhouse gas-induced climate change simulated by global climate models." Large-scale adaptive design could completely offset this increase, however. For example, the temperature increase in California was calculated to be as high as 1.31 degrees Celsius, but a 100% deployment of "cool roofs" would result in a temperature drop of 1.47 degrees Celsius—more than the increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Georgescu | first1 = Matei | last2 =  Morefield | first2 = Philip E. | last3 = Bierwagen | first3 = Britta G. | last4 = Weaver | first4 = Christopher P. | year = 2014 | title =Urban Adaptation Can Roll Back Warming of Emerging Megapolitan Regions | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |doi=10.1073/pnas.1322280111 | laysummary=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/climate-change/urban-adaptation-global-warming | laysource=JournalistsResource.org | volume=111 | pages=2909–2914|bibcode = 2014PNAS..111.2909G | pmid=24516126 | pmc=3939866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, the same urban area that is hotter in the day, can be colder than surrounding rural areas at ground level at night, leading to a new term ''urban cold island''.   Snow cover in rural areas, for example, insulates plants.  This was an unexpected discovery when studying the response of plants to urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://phys.org/news/2016-12-urban-cold-islands-evolution-cities.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urethral intercourse''' or ''coitus per urethram'' is [[sexual penetration]] of the female [[urethra]] by an object such as a [[Human penis|penis]] or a finger.  It is not the same thing as [[urethral sounding]], the act of inserting a specialized medical tool into the urethra as a form of sexual or fetishistic activity.

The untrained [[Urethral foreign body|insertion]] of foreign bodies into the urethra carries a significant risk that subsequent medical attention may be required.  Documented cases of urethral intercourse appear to have occurred between heterosexual couples;  a survey of the global medical literature available in 1965 reported accounts of thirteen separate cases.&lt;ref name=JAMA1965&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">"'''Viruses of the Mind'''" is an essay by British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], first published in the book ''Dennett and His Critics: Demystifying Mind'' (1993).  Dawkins originally wrote the essay in 1991 and delivered it as a [[Voltaire Lecture]] on 6 November 1992 at the [[Conway Hall Humanist Centre]].  The essay discusses how religion can be viewed as a [[meme]], an idea previously expressed by Dawkins in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976).  Dawkins analyzes the propagation of religious ideas and behaviors as a memetic virus, analogous to how  [[virus|biological]] and [[computer virus]]es spread.  The essay was later published in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and its ideas are further explored in the television programme, ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'' (2006).

==Content==
Dawkins defines the "symptoms" of being infected by the "virus of religion", providing examples for most of them, and tries to define a connection between the elements of religion and its survival value (invoking [[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi]]'s [[handicap principle]] of [[sexual selection]], applied to believers of a religion). Dawkins also describes religious beliefs as "mind-parasites", and as "gangs &lt;nowiki&gt;[that]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will come to constitute a package, which may be sufficiently stable to deserve a collective name such as Roman Catholicism ... or ... component parts to a single virus".

Dawkins suggests that religious belief in the "faith-sufferer" typically shows the following elements:
* It is impelled by some deep, inner conviction that something is true, or right, or virtuous: a conviction that doesn't seem to owe anything to [[evidence]] or reason, but which, nevertheless, the believer feels as totally compelling and convincing.
* The believer typically makes a positive virtue of faith's being strong and unshakable, despite it not being based upon evidence.
* There is a conviction that "mystery", ''per se'', is a good thing; the belief that it is not a virtue to solve mysteries but to enjoy them and revel in their insolubility.
* There may be intolerant behaviour towards perceived rival faiths, in extreme cases even the killing of opponents or advocating of their deaths. Believers  may be similarly violent in disposition towards [[Apostasy|apostates]] or [[Heresy|heretics]], even if those espouse only a slightly different version of the faith.
* The particular convictions that the believer holds, while having nothing to do with evidence, are likely to resemble those of the believer's parents.
* If the believer is one of the rare exceptions who follows a different religion from his parents, the explanation may be cultural transmission from a charismatic individual.
* The internal sensations of the 'faith-sufferer' may be reminiscent of those more ordinarily associated with sexual love.

Dawkins stresses his claim that religious beliefs do not spread as a result of evidence in their support, but typically by cultural transmission, in most cases from parents or from charismatic individuals. He refers to this as involving "[[epidemiology]], not evidence". Further Dawkins distinguishes this process from the spread of scientific ideas, which, he suggests, is constrained by the requirement to conform with certain virtues of standard methodology: "testability, evidential support, precision, quantifiability, consistency, intersubjectivity, repeatability, universality, progressiveness, independence of cultural milieu, and so on". He points out that faith "spreads despite a total lack of every single one of these virtues".

==Critical reactions==
[[Alister McGrath]], a Christian theologian, has also commented critically on Dawkins' analysis, suggesting that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' p. 125 quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] is support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p.  126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than Darwinian,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests there is no evidence that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' (pp. 137–138)&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that "If religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?"&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 136 citing Koenig and Cohen ''The Link between Religion and Health'' OUP 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vorarephilia''' (often shortened to '''vore''') is a [[paraphilia]] characterized by the erotic desire to be consumed by, or sometimes to personally consume, another person or creature, or an erotic attraction to the process of eating in general practice.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="straightDope"&gt;{{cite web| last = Adams |first= Cecil | authorlink = Cecil Adams | date = 2004-07-02 | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/040702.html | title=Eat or be eaten: Is cannibalism a pathology as listed in the DSM-IV? | publisher=[[The Straight Dope]] | accessdate=2007-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Functional and dysfunctional sexual behavior: a synthesis of neuroscience and comparative psychology | first=Anders | last=Ågmo | publisher=Academic Press | year=2007 | isbn=0-12-370590-8 | page=454 | doi=10.1016/B978-012370590-7/50013-X  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brundage2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Brundage |first= Sandy |journal= The Wave Magazine| volume= 2 |issue= 15 |title= Fetish Confessions |date= 2002-07-31 | url= http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?articleid=22026&amp;pagename=article |accessdate= 2007-04-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927061721/http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?articleid=22026&amp;pagename=article &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since vorarephilic fantasies cannot usually be acted out in reality, they are often expressed in stories or drawings shared on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Lykins"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lykins|first1=Amy D.|last2=Cantor|first2=James M.|title=Vorarephilia: A Case Study in Masochism and Erotic Consumption|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=21 September 2013|volume=43|issue=1|pages=181–186|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0185-y|pmid=24057211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''vorarephilia'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''vorare'' (to "[[Swallowing|swallow]]" or "devour"), and [[Ancient Greek]] φιλία (''philía'', "[[love]]").

The fantasy usually involves the victim being swallowed whole, though occasionally the victims are chewed up, and digestion may or may not be included.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brundage2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NP" /&gt; Vore fantasies are separated from sexual [[cannibalism]] because the living victim is normally swallowed whole.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt; Sometimes the consumers are human, but [[Anthropomorphism|anthropormorphized animals]], normal animals, dragons, and enormous snakes also appear frequently in these fantasies.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt; After consumption, the enlarged belly of the consumer is often described with great care.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt; Vorarephiles sometimes prefer to differentiate between ''soft vore'' and ''hard vore''; soft vore means the victim is swallowed whole and alive, and may possibly come back out in the case of a "non-fatal" scenario, while in hard vore the victim goes through a more gruesome, realistic digestion process, often getting chewed up beforehand.

Vore is most often enjoyed through pictures, stories, videos, and [[video games]], and it can appear in mainstream media.&lt;ref name=brathwaite&gt;{{cite book | title=Sex in video games | series=Advances in computer graphics and game development | first=Brenda | last=Brathwaite | place=London | publisher=Charles River Media | year=2007 | isbn=1-58450-459-5 | page=20 | url=http://www.charlesriver.com/resrcs/chapters/1584504595_1stChap.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180711/http://www.charlesriver.com/resrcs/chapters/1584504595_1stChap.pdf | chapter = Defining sex | archivedate = 2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, vorarephilia may be described as a variation of [[macrophilia]] and may combine with other paraphilias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Weirdly Beloved: Tales of Strange Bedfellows, Odd Couplings, and Love Gone Bad | first=Cynthia | last=Ceilán | publisher=Globe Pequot | year=2008 | isbn=1-59921-403-2 | page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from macrophilia, vore fantasies often have themes of [[BDSM]], [[microphilia]], [[pregnancy fetishism]], [[Furry fandom#Sexual aspects|furry fetishism]], "unbirthing" (a desire to be swallowed whole into the vagina and returned to the uterus), and sexual cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt;

One [[case study]] analysis connected the fantasy with [[sexual masochism]], and suggested that it could be motivated by a desire to merge with a powerful other or permanently escape loneliness.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt; With "no known treatment" for vorarephiles who feel ill at ease with their sexuality, psychologists at Toronto's [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] have recommended trying to "adjust to, rather than change or suppress" the sexual interest.&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;{{cite news | author = Brean, Joseph | date = 1 October 2013 | url = http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/10/01/man-who-desired-to-be-eaten-by-a-large-dominant-woman-a-baffling-case-for-toronto-psychiatric-hospital-doctors/ | title = Man who desired to be eaten by a 'large, dominant woman' a baffling case for Toronto psychiatric hospital doctors | work = National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medication for libido reduction could be used if deemed necessary.&lt;ref name="Lykins" /&gt;

'''''Witching Culture: Folklore and Neo-Paganism in America''''' is a [[folkloristics|folkloric]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of the [[Wicca]]n and wider [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] community in the United States. It was written by the American anthropologist and folklorist [[Sabina Magliocco]] of [[California State University, Northridge]] and first published in 2004 by the [[University of Pennsylvania Press]]. It was released as a part of a series of academic books titled 'Contemporary Ethnography', edited by the anthropologists [[Kirin Narayan]] of the [[University of Wisconsin]] and Paul Stoller of [[West Chester University]].

Magliocco became interested in studying the American Pagan movement in the mid-1990s, following the culmination of her fieldwork research in a Sicilian village. From 1995 through to 1997, she began studying the Pagan community in the San Francisco Bay Area, joining a Wiccan group, the Coven Trismegiston, which was led by the high priest [[Don Frew]] and high priestess Anna Korn. Becoming involved with the faith, Magliocco noted that she no longer remained an objective outsider, but became an active participant after experiencing [[altered states of consciousness]] during several Pagan rituals. In 2002 she published her first book on the subject, ''Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work'', which was followed by the more general ''Witching Culture'' two years later.

''Witching Culture'' provides an anthropological study of the Wiccan and wider Pagan community in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on the role that [[folklore]] has within the movement; in this it looks both at how Pagans have adopted pre-existing folklore and how unique Pagan folklore actually develops within the community. It deals with the influence of folkloristic on the early development of Wicca, in particular the influence of figures like [[Sir James Frazer]], [[Charles Leland]] and [[Margaret Murray]].

The reviews published in specialist academic journals were predominantly positive, with [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] and [[Jacqueline Simpson]] being particularly praiseworthy, although some reviewers opined that Magliocco's openly Pagan beliefs had some negative repercussions for the study.

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===
Contemporary Paganism, or Neo-Paganism, is a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]] influenced by the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s that was influenced by [[second wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book that helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]].&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 then saw the publication of ''[[Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia]]'', authored by the anthropologist Lynne Hume.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Next came the work of the American sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] with her ''[[A Community of Witches|A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt; Then there was Jone Salomonsen's study of the Reclaiming tradition in San Francisco, ''[[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sal02|Salomonsen 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magliocco and her research===

Magliocco became interested in Paganism in the mid-1990s, intending to explore "the confluence of ritual, festival, gender and politics &amp;ndash; the subject of my earlier research in Italy &amp;ndash; in a new context". Initially she was interested in Paganism as a "folk revival, in issues surrounding the use of folklore from academic sources, cultural appropriation, and the construction of authenticity in the invention of rituals" rather than in any actual spiritual capacity.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1995, Magliocco attended the first Pantheacon conference, a meeting of practicing Pagans and academics held at a hotel in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California. It was at the conference that she took part in a ritual led by members of the [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wiccan]] tradition, later characterizing it as "my first powerfully affecting ritual experience in a Neo-Pagan context".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="My decision was not motivated only by expedience. I was aesthetically pleased and genuinely moved by some of the rituals I attended, and as a result of these experiences, I changed in significant ways. Because I decided to remain open and vulnerable during rituals, I gained access to imaginative experiences I had banished from my consciousness since reaching adulthood. These were crucial in helping me understand the essence of the culture I was studying; had I ''not'' had them, I would have failed to grasp the importance of religious ecstasy in the Neo-Pagan experience."|source=—Sabina Magliocco, on why she became a Pagan, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Magliocco had initially intended to conduct a long-term period of fieldwork among a single Pagan group, with a focus on understanding their "dynamics of ritual creation", but ultimately was unable to do this; from 1994 through to 1997, she held a series of temporary academic appointments at universities across the United States, preventing her from staying in one area for any lengthy period of time and studying any one particular group there.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"/&gt; However, from 1995 through to 1997, she was living in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California, where she immersed herself in the one of "the country's oldest and most active Neo-Pagan communities", that of the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"/&gt; Here, she befriended Holly Tannen, a folklorist and ballad performer who was well known and respected among the Pagan community of northern California. It was through Trennan that she was introduced to many other members of the Pagan community, including to a local Gardnerian Wiccan coven.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"/&gt;

In 1996, she moved into a "small rental house" in the Berkeley Flats along a line of houses that were nicknamed "Witch Row" (a fact that she was unaware of at the time), and it was here that she befriended further members of the Pagan community; her neighbors were elders in the Fellowship of the Spiral Path, while another neighboring house was the home of Judy Foster, a founding member of the [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn]]. Several streets away lived [[Don Frew]] and Anna Korn, the high priest and high priestess of a Gardnerian group known as the Coven Trismegiston.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 11"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding that she wanted to actively participate in the religions she was studying, Magliocco was initiated into the Coven Trismegiston, and went on to begin training in the Reclaiming tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 she published her first academic study of American Paganism, ''Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work''. ''Witching Culture'' was published in the "Contemporary Ethnography" series of books, edited by the anthropologists Kirin Narayan of the [[University of Wisconsin]] and Paul Stoller of [[West Chester University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ConEth|University of Pennsylvania Press]]. undated.&lt;/ref&gt; Magliocco dedicated the book to the memory of Andrew Vázsonyi (1906&amp;ndash;1986),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. unnumbered opening page.&lt;/ref&gt; a Hungarian folklorist and novelist who had worked for two decades at the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Döm86|Dömötör 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In her introduction, "The Ethnography of Magic and the Magic of Ethnography", Magliocco discusses how she first became involved with the Pagan movement, and includes extracts from the field notes that she made at the time. Going on to lay out the objectives of the book, Magliocco discusses the [[history of Wicca]], and the influence that early anthropologists like [[Edward Taylor]] and [[James Frazer]] had on it as a burgeoning movement. Proceeding to discuss the pre-existing academic studies of the Pagan movement, she explains her own approach to the subject and how it differs from those of her predecessors, in particular focusing on her own spiritual experiences and altered states of consciousness that she experienced while taking part in Pagan ritual and her insider-outsider perspective on the Pagan movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part I: Roots and Branches===
Chapter one, "The Study of Folklore and the Reclamation of Paganism", offers a historical introduction to Contemporary Paganism, looking at its roots in the Classical World of Greece and Rome, and then the successive influences of [[Neoplatonism]], Renaissance magic, the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment. Magliocco then looks at the influence that 18th and 19th century folkloristics and anthropology had on the Romanticists and then Pagan movement, in particular the work of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Sir James Frazer]]. Proceeding to look at this relationship, she highlights the work of [[Charles Leland]], [[Margaret Murray]] and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who drew from folklore in their own books, all of which heavily influenced modern Paganism. Magliocco argues that Contemporary Paganism can be viewed as a "folk tradition" on two levels; firstly, because it continues to work with and propagate the spiritual traditions of [[western esotericism]], and secondly, because it acts as a form of "resistance culture" in opposition to dominant trends in western culture. Finally, she borrows the concept of "textual poachers" from the French sociologist [[Michel de Certeau]], arguing that the Pagan community fit this model well, collating elements from a wide variety of sources and composing them into something new, in this case a religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 23&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter two, "Boundaries and Borders: Imagining Community", opens with a discussion of how Pagans distinguish themselves from one another and from the wider society around them, before delving into the idea that folklore is vital to Pagan "group formation". Magliocco goes on to describe the Pagan community, with a particular emphasis on those in the United States, dealing with such subjects as ethnicity, education, gender and sexual orientation. Moving on to look at how Pagans forge their own identities, she highlights factors such as costume and use of language, and whether such Pagan coding is explicit, complicit or implicit. Magliocco discusses the various different Pagan traditions, and the community division between those who call themselves "witches" and those who do not. She then rounds off the chapter with a discussion of the anthropological fieldwork that she undertook among the San Francisco Bay Area Pagan community between 1995 and 2000, the Coven Trismegiston that she worked with, and the local [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]], [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming]] and [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn|NROOGD]] traditions that she encountered there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 57&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: Religions of Experience===
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
The third chapter, "Making Magic: Training the Imagination", begins with Magliocco's assertion that the unifying feature of the Pagan movement is the ritual experiences that its practitioners undertake. Devoting the rest of the chapter to an examination of how Pagans "conceive of and practice magic", she argues that they do not do so in order to escape [[rationality]], but rather they adopt a belief in magic in order to reclaim "traditional ways of knowing that privilege the imagination". Noting that within Paganism, artists are viewed as magicians, she suggests that magic should itself viewed as an art, with both having the goal of bringing about emotional reactions and changes of consciousness. Exploring the various different definitions of "magic" developed within anthropology, Magliocco notes that most contemporary North Americans equate "magic" with superstition and irrational behavior. She then looks at Pagan understandings of magic, highlighting that Pagans typically try to rationalize magic, viewing it as an energy force in an interconnected universe, one that must obey natural laws, rather than as some un-explainable "[[supernatural]]" force. Moving on, Magliocco discusses the Pagan concept of a sacred universe, looking at the veneration of the natural world and the [[Wheel of the Year|celebration of seasonal Sabbats]], and the relevance that that has for Pagan magical beliefs. Exploring Pagan ethics surrounding the practice of magic, in particular the [[Wiccan Rede]] and the [[Law of Threefold Return]], Magliocco also studies the manner in which Pagans have re-adopted vernacular magic as a part of their religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 95&amp;ndash;121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Insider/outsider dichotomy===
{{Quote box

|quote     = "My absorption into the Neo-Pagan community and my subjective spiritual experiences during fieldwork beg the question that always bedevils ethnologists: to what extent did my participation in the culture cause me to "go native", to adopt the beliefs, attitudes, and worldviews of the people I studied? Am I an insider or an outsider, and how can I be "objective" about a culture if I have adopted an emic, or insider's perspective?"
|salign    = right
|source    = Sabina Magliocco, 2004.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In undertaking her fieldwork, Magliocco discussed whether she took an "outsider" perspective, thereby being [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] about those whom she was researching, or whether she had adopted an "insider" perspective, thereby being [[subjectivity|subjective]] in her views of Pagans and Paganism.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"/&gt; She claimed that the question as to whether she was an insider or outsider researcher was akin to a question that she had been posed as a child; being an [[Italian American]], Magliocco had often been asked whether she was Italian or American, to which she would respond that she was both.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"/&gt; As she noted:

:My answer to readers who want to know whether I am "really" an insider or an outsider to the Pagan community is that I am neither and both &amp;ndash; that how I look at things depends very much upon context, but contains both anthropological ''and'' Pagan perspectives at the same time. The ethnographic perspective is ''not'' about being an objective observer of a culture, but rather about containing within one body multiple, simultaneous frames of reference with which to interpret experience, and being able to shift easily from one to the other.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"/&gt;

In this position, Magliocco was in agreement with Jone Salomonsen, the feminist theologian and ethnographer who had performed fieldwork among the Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco in order to gain research for her book ''[[Enchanted Feminism]]'' (2002).&lt;ref name="Magliocco 16"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Salomonsen had called this mixed insider/outsider approach the "method of compassion" and wrote that it "does not refer to a wholesale positive embracement, nor to passionate criticisms and arguing, but to something in between... Engagement is more than participation, and something other than pretending. To allow oneself to become engaged is to take the ritual seriously. It is [being] willing to let the trance induction take you into trance, to be willing to be emotionally moved as is intended by certain ritual elements, and [to] go with what happens."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sal02|Salomonsen 2002]]. pp. 4, 9, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altered states of consciousness===
Magliocco also saw herself as an insider because she allowed herself to experience the [[altered states of consciousness]] that contemporary Pagan rituals are reported to induce. As she stated, "I take an experiential approach to the extraordinary experiences" that occur in ritual, and that the "essence of this approach is twofold". The first part of this involved the "conscious, willing, and full participation in ritual experiences intended to induce alternate states of consciousness, and the interpretation of visions and dreams" as different ways of interpreting life. The second part of this "mandates that I consider informants' experiences seriously" when they discuss altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magliocco highlighted the work of the anthropologists David Young and Jean-Guy Goulet in their ''Being Changed: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experience'' (1994), who had argued that spiritual experiences were relatively common among anthropologists, but that most of those working in the discipline fail to speak publicly about their experiences because of a fear of "ridicule and ostracism" by their peers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#You94|Young and Goulet 1994]]. pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to highlight the work of other anthropologists who have discussed their own spiritual experiences that occurred while taking part in rituals in the midst of their fieldwork,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 13&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Bruce Grindal's experience among the [[Sisala]] in Ghana,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gri83|Grindal 1983]]. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Lee's experience with Malay spirit possession rites,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lee87|Lee 1987]]. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; and Edith Turner's experience in a [[Ndembu]] healing ritual.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tur94|Turner 1994]]. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

This highly personal lead-in story and the author's subsequent reflections in the Introduction provide readers with a clear sense of the perspective from which she approaches her topic. Magliocco makes effective use of this narrative structure—evocative personal story followed by academic reflection—throughout her book. I found her initial discussion of how contemporary ethnography has struggled to renegotiate the boundary between engagement and distance fascinating."

}}

Reviewing ''Witching Culture'' in ''[[The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies]]'', the American religious studies scholar [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] described the work as "the best survey to date" of modern Paganism, "particularly if the focus of one's interest is North American Paganism". In his opinion, ''Witching Culture'' "breaks important new ground in Pagan Studies. In fact, I anticipate that in the near future it will come to be regarded as a groundbreaking book—one to which all future studies of Paganism will refer." He went on to describe it as "my first choice for a textbook in any university class with a significant component on contemporary Paganism" and felt that "Almost every chapter contains either new insights or original analyses that extend prior discussions to a new depth."&lt;ref name="Lewis 2005"/&gt; Lewis noted that although he didn't have "any real criticism" of the book, he wished that it had discussed the role of solitary practitioners and teenage Wiccans, two significant sectors of the Pagan community whom Magliocco only mentioned in passing, and the infighting among the Wiccan community, which Magliocco hadn't even mentioned. Ultimately, Lewis remarked that "I can heartily recommend this book as a 'must read' for anyone in this field, whether academic observers or reflective participants."&lt;ref name="Lewis 2005"/&gt;

In her review for the ''Folklore'' journal, the English folklorist [[Jacqueline Simpson]] described ''Witching Culture'' as offering a "fascinating analysis" of how U.S. Pagans have "adopted and adapted elements of European folk practice to fit the Gardnerian framework of their rituals and spells". Ultimately, she characterised the work as being "a very informative and well-researched study, and a most interesting read".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sim05|Simpson 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; Roman I. Shiyan of the [[University of Alberta]] reviewed ''Witching Culture'' in the journal ''Ethnologies'', stating that the work was "lucid evidence of the growing popularity of neo-pagan topics in North America and the academic world in particular" and that Magliocco "raises several important theoretical issues" regarding the topic. In conclusion, he felt that the book "takes us deep into a largely obscure and often misunderstood culture, which offers a very different perspective of the world and the place of humans in it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shi05|Shiyan 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Journal of American Folklore'', the sociologist [[Gary Alan Fine]] published a review of Magliocco's work in which he described it as "a richly textured ethnography, as fine a participant-observation account of an American scene as folklore has been gifted with since [[Leslie Prosterman]]'s ''Ordinary Life, Festival Days''". Believing that Magliocco's analysis had revealed Paganism to be the most "politically progressive and postmodern" religion in existence "despite [its] considerable borrowings of traditional themes", Fine felt that ''Witching Culture'' was "an effective and affectionate guide in mapping the development of Neo-Paganism in America and the multiple &amp;ndash; and occasionally conflicting &amp;ndash; strains from which it draws". He did however note that in his opinion the author had failed to "stand sufficiently back from the movement to gain the analytic purchase that comes from skepticism. Granted, all religions appear gawky in their adolescence, but sometimes disciplinary agnosticism permits us to discount desired but undeserved self-presentations. While no researcher should scorn the belief system of a group that she encounters, neither is it necessary to nuzzle. This attachment may cause Magliocco to downplay sexuality, drug use, and posturing in the community. These seekers often appear in her telling to be, frankly, rather puritanical." He went on to remark that a "more distanced view would emphasize the struggles over political correctness that challenge the movement as it staggers toward a consensual theology", in particular its controversial cultural borrowings from Native American cultures. Ultimately however, he felt that as an "account of the folkloric practices of a burgeoning social scene", ''Witching Culture'' warrants "high praise".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fin05|Fine 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review, published in the ''History of Religions'' journal, Stefanie von Schnurbein of the Nordeuropa-Institut, [[Humboldt-Universität]], Berlin, wrote that Magliocco dealt with "a sadly understudied issue" in her study, but that "To the disappointment of a reader who expects a theoretically advanced discussion of these relations [between religious culture and academic thinking], the historical argument and material do not go far beyond [[Ronald Hutton]]'s in-depth study of the history of modern pagan witchcraft, ''[[The Triumph of the Moon]]''." Continuing with her review, Von Schnurbein opines that Magliocco manages to create a "vivid impression of, and informed insights into, the different facets and contradictions of a contemporary religious movement", one that "allows for well-informed critiques of the problem of rooting spirituality in ethnic or cultural heritage and of the problem of cultural exploitation through borrowing". Nonetheless, she notes that because Magliocco herself is a practicing Pagan, it "limits to a certain degree the author's ability to scrutinize further some of the problems intrinsic to the reception and resignification of ideologically questionable concepts and theories". She also notes that in Magliocco's work, "art, creativity, and imagination are depicted as exclusively positive forces that are rooted in experience and are responsible for the potential of resistance to be found in neopagan ritual and religion". In Von Schnurbein's opinion, "The next step of critical investigation would be to analyze this concept of art as a construction as well."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Von08|Von Schnurbein 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from the Pagan community===
Writing on ''The Cauldron'' website, a practicing Pagan using the pseudonym of "Pitch" described the work as "thoughtful, insightful, fruitful, grounded, and, maybe, provocative" as well as being a "Must Have, Double Bag!" book that "all of us should be proud to add to our libraries".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pit|Pitch. undated.]]&lt;/ref&gt;
