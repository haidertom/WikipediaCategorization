In [[stellar astronomy]], the '''Algol paradox'''  is a [[paradox]]ical situation when elements of a [[binary star]] seem to evolve in discord with the established theories of [[stellar evolution]].&lt;ref name=Pustylnik&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pustylnik | first1 = I. | year = 1998 | title = The Early History of Resolving the Algol Paradox | journal = Astronomical and Astrophysical Transactions | volume = 15 | pages = 357&amp;ndash;362 | doi = 10.1080/10556799808201791 | accessdate = 2012-07-09 | url = http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1998A%26AT...15..357P/0000357.000.html|bibcode = 1998A&amp;AT...15..357P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fundamental feature of these theories is that the rate of [[Stellar evolution|evolution of stars]] depends on their mass:  The greater the mass, the faster this evolution, and the more quickly it leaves the [[main-sequence]], entering either a [[subgiant]] or [[Giant star|giant]] phase.

In the case of [[Algol]] and other binary stars, something completely different is observed: The less massive star is already a subgiant while the star with much greater mass is still on the main-sequence.  Since the partner stars of the binary are thought to have formed at approximately the same time and so should have similar ages, this appears paradoxical. The more massive star, rather than the less massive one, should have left the main sequence.

The paradox is resolved by the fact that in many binary stars, there can be a flow of material between the two, disturbing the normal process of stellar evolution.  As the flow progresses, their evolutionary stage will advance, even as the relative masses change.  Eventually, the originally more massive star will reach the next stage in its evolution despite having lost much of its mass to its companion.

ASPE is the publisher of ''Estimating Today'', a periodical technical journal. They also publish an estimating manual named ''Standard Estimating Practice''.  

ASPE offers a professional certification for building estimators named Certified Professional Estimator, or CPE. This program began in 1976, when 233 CPEs were awarded in 11 of the then 16 divisions of building construction defined by the Construction Specifications Institute in their MasterFormat system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="115578">'''Ancestral reconstruction''' (also known as '''''Character Mapping''''' or '''''Character Optimization''''') is the extrapolation back in time from measured characteristics of individuals (or populations) to their [[Common descent|common ancestors]].  It is an important application of [[phylogenetics]], the reconstruction and study of the [[evolution]]ary relationships among individuals, populations or [[species]] to their ancestors. In the context of [[evolutionary biology]], ancestral reconstruction can be used to recover different kinds of ancestral character states of organisms that lived millions of years ago.&lt;ref name=Omland1999 /&gt; These states include the [[Nucleic acid sequence|genetic sequence]] ([[ancestral sequence reconstruction]]), the [[Peptide sequence|amino acid sequence]] of a [[protein]], the composition of a [[genome]] (e.g., gene order), a measurable characteristic of an organism ([[phenotype]]), and the [[species distribution|geographic range]] of an ancestral population or species (ancestral range reconstruction). This is desirable because it allows us to examine parts of [[phylogenetic tree]]s corresponding to the distant past, clarifying the evolutionary history of the species in the tree. Since modern [[genetic sequence]]s are essentially a variation of ancient ones, access to ancient sequences may identify other variations and organisms which could have arisen from those sequences.&lt;ref name=CaiPei2004 /&gt; In addition to genetic sequences, one might attempt to track the changing of one character trait to another, such as fins turning to legs.

Non-biological applications include the reconstruction of the vocabulary or phonemes of [[ancient language]]s,&lt;ref name=PlatnickCameron1977 /&gt; and cultural characteristics of ancient societies such as oral traditions&lt;ref name=BentleyTehrani2013 /&gt; or marriage practices.&lt;ref name=MichalakWalker2011 /&gt;

Ancestral reconstruction relies on a sufficiently realistic [[statistical model|statistical]] [[Substitution model|model of evolution]] to accurately recover ancestral states. These models use the genetic information already obtained through methods such as [[phylogenetics]] to determine the route that [[evolution]] has taken and when evolutionary events occurred.&lt;ref name=Brooks1999 /&gt; No matter how well the model approximates the actual evolutionary history, however, one's ability to accurately reconstruct an ancestor deteriorates with increasing evolutionary time between that ancestor and its observed descendants. Additionally, more realistic models of evolution are inevitably more complex and difficult to calculate.  Progress in the field of ancestral reconstruction has relied heavily on the [[Moore's law|exponential growth of computing power]] and the concomitant development of efficient [[Algorithm|computational algorithms]] (e.g., a [[dynamic programming]] algorithm for the joint [[maximum likelihood]] reconstruction of ancestral sequences.&lt;ref name=PupkoPe2000 /&gt;) Methods of ancestral reconstruction are often applied to a given [[Phylogeny|phylogenetic tree]] that has already been inferred from the same data.  While convenient, this approach has the disadvantage that its results are contingent on the accuracy of a single phylogenetic tree.  In contrast, some researchers &lt;ref name=PagelMeade2004 /&gt; advocate a more computationally intensive [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] approach that accounts for uncertainty in tree reconstruction by evaluating ancestral reconstructions over many trees.

==History==

The concept of ancestral reconstruction is often credited to [[Emile Zuckerkandl]] and [[Linus Pauling]].  Motivated by the development of techniques for determining the [[Peptide sequence|primary (amino acid) sequence]] of proteins by [[Frederick Sanger]] in 1955,&lt;ref name=SangerThompson1955 /&gt; Zuckerkandl and Pauling postulated&lt;ref name=PaulingZuckerkandl1963 /&gt; that such sequences could be used to infer not only the [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] relating the observed protein sequences, but also the ancestral protein sequence at the earliest point (root) of this tree.  However, the idea of reconstructing ancestors from measurable biological characteristics had already been developing in the field of [[cladistics]], one of the precursors of modern phylogenetics.  Cladistic methods, which appeared as early as 1901, infer the evolutionary relationships of species on the basis of the distribution of shared characteristics, of which some are inferred to be descended from common ancestors. Furthermore, [[Theodoseus Dobzhansky]] and [[Alfred Sturtevant]] articulated the principles of ancestral reconstruction in a phylogenetic context in 1938, when inferring the evolutionary history of [[chromosomal inversion]]s in ''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]''.&lt;ref name=DobzhanskySturtevant1937 /&gt;

Thus, ancestral reconstruction has its roots in several disciplines. Today, computational methods for ancestral reconstruction continue to be extended and applied in a diversity of settings, so that ancestral states are being inferred not only for biological characteristics and the molecular sequences, but also for the structure &lt;ref name=HarmsThornton2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WilliamsPollock2006 /&gt; or [[Catalyst|catalytic]] properties &lt;ref name=Ronquist2004 /&gt; of ancient versus modern [[protein]]s, the geographic location of populations and species ([[phylogeography]])&lt;ref name=ReeSmith2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FraserLemey2009 /&gt; and the higher-order structure of genomes.&lt;ref name=WattersonEwens1982 /&gt; One of the most prominent examples is tracing the evolution that took place from ape to man {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

==Methods and algorithms==

Any attempt at ancestral reconstruction begins with a [[phylogeny]].  In general, a phylogeny is a tree-based [[hypothesis]] about the order in which populations (referred to as [[Taxon|taxa]]) are related by descent from common ancestors.  Observed taxa are represented by the ''tips'' or ''terminal nodes'' of the tree that are progressively connected by branches to their common ancestors, which are represented by the branching points of the tree that are usually referred to as the ''ancestral'' or ''internal nodes''.  Eventually, all lineages converge to the [[most recent common ancestor]] of the entire sample of taxa.  In the context of ancestral reconstruction, a phylogeny is often treated as though it were a known quantity (with Bayesian approaches being an important exception).  Because there can be an enormous number of phylogenies that are nearly equally effective at explaining the data, reducing the subset of phylogenies supported by the data to a single representative, or point estimate, can be a convenient and sometimes necessary simplifying assumption.

Ancestral reconstruction can be thought of as the direct result of applying a hypothetical model of evolution to a given phylogeny.  When the model contains one or more free parameters, the overall objective is to estimate these parameters on the basis of measured characteristics among the observed taxa (sequences) that descended from common ancestors.  [[Occam's razor|Parsimony]] is an important exception to this paradigm: though it has been shown that there are circumstances under which it is the maximum likelihood estimator,&lt;ref name=TuffleySteel1997 /&gt; at its core, it is simply based on the heuristic that changes in character state are rare, without attempting to quantify that rarity.

There are three different classes of method for ancestral reconstruction. In chronological order of discovery, these are [[maximum parsimony]], [[maximum likelihood]], and [[Bayesian Inference]]. Maximum parsimony considers all evolutionary events equally likely; maximum likelihood accounts for the differing likelihood of certain classes of event; and Bayeisan inference relates the conditional probability of an event to the likelihood of the tree, as well as the amount of uncertainty that is associated with that tree. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood yield a single most probable outcome, whereas Bayesian inference accounts for uncertainties in the data and yields a sample of possible trees.

===Maximum parsimony===
{{main|Maximum Parsimony}}

Parsimony, known colloquially as "[[Occam's razor]]", refers to the principle of selecting the simplest of competing hypotheses.  In the context of ancestral reconstruction, parsimony endeavours to find the distribution of ancestral states within a given tree which minimizes the total number of character state changes that would be necessary to explain the states observed at the tips of the tree.  This method of [[maximum parsimony]]&lt;ref name=SwoffordMaddison1987 /&gt; is one of the earliest formalized algorithms for reconstructing ancestral states, as well as one of the simplest.&lt;ref name=WilliamsPollock2006 /&gt;

Maximum parsimony can be implemented by one of several algorithms.  One of the earliest examples is [[Walter M. Fitch|Fitch's method]],&lt;ref name=Fitch1971 /&gt; which assigns ancestral character states by parsimony via two traversals of a rooted [[binary tree]]. The first stage is a [[Tree traversal#Post-order 2|post-order traversal]] that proceeds from the tips toward the root of a tree by visiting descendant (child) nodes before their parents.  Initially, we are determining the set of possible character states ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the ''i''-th ancestor based on the observed character states of its descendants.  Each assignment is the [[Intersection (set theory)|set intersection]] of the character states of the ancestor's descendants; if the intersection is the empty set, then it is the [[Union (set theory)|set union]].  In the latter case, it is implied that a character state change has occurred between the ancestor and one of its two immediate descendants. Each such event counts towards the algorithm's cost function, which may be used to discriminate among alternative trees on the basis of maximum parsimony.  Next, a [[Tree traversal#Pre-order 2|pre-order traversal]] of the tree is performed, proceeding from the root towards the tips. Character states are then assigned to each descendant based on which character states it shares with its parent. Since the root has no parent node, one may be required to select a character state arbitrarily, specifically when more than one possible state has been reconstructed at the root.

For example, consider a phylogeny recovered for a genus of plants containing 6 species A - F (Figure 1), where each plant is pollinated by either a "bee", "hummingbird" or "wind". One obvious question is what the pollinators at deeper nodes were in the phylogeny of this genus of plants. Under maximum parsimony, an ancestral state reconstruction for this clade reveals that "hummingbird" is the most parsimonious ancestral state for the lower clade (plants D, E, F), that the ancestral states for the nodes in the top clade (plants A, B, C) are equivocal and that both "hummingbird" or "bee" pollinators are equally plausible for the pollination state at the root of the phylogeny. Supposing we have strong evidence from the fossil record that the root state is "hummingbird". Resolution of the root to "hummingbird" would yield the pattern of ancestral state reconstruction depicted by the symbols at the nodes (Figure 1) with the state requiring the fewest number of changes circled.

[[File:Parsimony.Anc.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 1. Phylogeny of a hypothetical genus of plants with pollination states of either "bees", "hummingbirds" or "wind" denoted by pictures at the tips. Pollination state nodes in the phylogenetic tree inferred under maximum parsimony are coloured on the branches leading into them (yellow represents "bee" pollination, red representing "hummingbird" pollination, and black representing "wind" pollination, dual coloured branches are equally parsimonious for the two states coloured). Assignment of "hummingbird" as the root state (because of prior knowledge from the fossil record) leads to the pattern of ancestral states represented by symbols at the nodes of the phylogeny, the state requiring the fewest number of changes to give rise to the pattern observed at the tips is circled at each node.]]

Parsimony methods are intuitively appealing and highly efficient, such that they are still used in some cases to seed maximum likelihood optimization algorithms with an initial phylogeny.&lt;ref name=Stamatakis2006 /&gt; However, the underlying assumption that evolution attained a certain end result as fast as possible is inaccurate. Natural selection and evolution do not work towards a goal, they simply select for or against randomly occurring genetic changes. Parsimony methods impose six general assumptions: that the phylogenetic tree you are using is correct, that you have all of the relevant data, in which no mistakes were made in coding, that all branches of the phylogenetic tree are equally likely to change, that the rate of evolution is slow, and that the chance of losing or gaining a characteristic is the same.&lt;ref name=Omland1999 /&gt; In reality, assumptions are often violated, leading to several issues:

# ''Variation in rates of evolution.''  Fitch's method assumes that changes between all character states are equally likely to occur; thus, any change incurs the same cost for a given tree.  This assumption is often unrealistic and can limit the accuracy of such methods.&lt;ref name=PagelMeade2004 /&gt; For example, [[Transition (genetics)|transitions]] tend to occur more often than [[transversion]]s in the evolution of nucleic acids. This assumption can be relaxed by assigning differential costs to specific character state changes, resulting in a weighted parsimony algorithm.&lt;ref name=Sankoff1975 /&gt;
# ''Rapid evolution.'' The upshot of the "minimum evolution" heuristic underlying such methods is that such methods assume that changes are ''rare'', and thus are inappropriate in cases where change is the norm rather than the exception.&lt;ref name=SchluterPrice1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Felsenstein1973 /&gt;  
# ''Variation in time among lineages.''  Parsimony methods implicitly assume that the same amount of evolutionary time has passed along every branch of the tree. Thus, they do not account for variation in branch lengths in the tree, which are often used to quantify the passage of evolutionary or chronological time.  This limitation makes the technique liable to infer that one change occurred on a very short branch rather than multiple changes occurring on a very long branch, for example.&lt;ref name=CunninghamOmland1998 /&gt;  In addition, it is possible that some branches of the tree could be experiencing higher selection and change rates than others, perhaps due to changing environmental factors. Some periods of time may represent more rapid evolution than others, when this happens parsimony becomes inaccurate.&lt;ref name=Schluter1999 /&gt; This shortcoming is addressed by model-based methods (both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods) that infer the stochastic process of evolution as it unfolds along each branch of a tree.&lt;ref name=LiSteel2008 /&gt;
# ''Statistical justification.''  Without a statistical model underlying the method, its estimates do not have well-defined uncertainties.&lt;ref name=SchluterPrice1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CunninghamOmland1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Felsenstein1985 /&gt;
# ''Convergent evolution.'' When considering a single character state, parsimony will automatically assume that two organisms that share that characteristic will be more closely related than those who don’t. For example, just because dogs and apes have fur does not mean that they are more closely related than apes are to humans.

===Maximum likelihood===

[[Maximum likelihood]] (ML) methods of ancestral state reconstruction treat the character states at internal nodes of the tree as parameters, and attempt to find the parameter values that maximize the probability of the data (the observed character states) given the hypothesis (a model of evolution and a phylogeny relating the observed sequences or taxa). In other words, this method assumes that the ancestral states are those which are statistically most likely, given the observed phenotypes. Some of the earliest ML approaches to ancestral reconstruction were developed in the context of [[molecular evolution|genetic sequence evolution]];&lt;ref name=YangKumarNei1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=KoshiGoldstein1996 /&gt; similar models were also developed for the analogous case of discrete character evolution.&lt;ref name=Pagel1999 /&gt;

The use of a model of evolution accounts for the fact that not all events are equally likely to happen. For example, a [[transition (genetics)|transition]], which is a type of point mutation from one purine to another, or from one pyrimidine to another is much more likely to happen than a [[transversion]], which is the chance of a purine being switched to a pyrimidine, or vice versa. These differences are not captured by maximum parsimony. However, just because some events are more likely than others does not mean that they always happen.  We know that throughout evolutionary history there have been times when there was a large gap between what was most likely to happen, and what actually occurred. When this is the case, maximum parsimony may actually be more accurate because it is more willing to make large, unlikely leaps than maximum likelihood is. Maximum likelihood has been shown to be quite reliable in reconstructing character states, but it does not do as good of a job at giving accurate estimations of the stability of proteins. Maximum likelihood always overestimates the stability of proteins, which makes sense since it assumes that the proteins that were made and used were the most stable and optimal.&lt;ref name=WilliamsPollock2006 /&gt; The merits of maximum likelihood have been subject to debate, with some having concluded that maximum likelihood test represents a good medium between accuracy and speed.&lt;ref name=GuindonGascuel2003 /&gt; However, other studies have complained that maximum likelihood takes too much time and computational power to be useful in some scenarios.&lt;ref name=DoornikOoms2003 /&gt;

These approaches employ the same probabilistic framework as used to infer the phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name=Felsenstein1981 /&gt; In brief, the evolution of a genetic sequence is modelled by a time-reversible continuous time [[Models of DNA evolution#DNA evolution as a continuous-time Markov chain|Markov process]]. In the simplest of these, all characters undergo independent state transitions (such as nucleotide substitutions) at a constant rate over time. This basic model is frequently extended to allow different rates on each branch of the tree. In reality, mutation rates may also vary over time (due, for example, to environmental changes); this can be modelled by allowing the rate parameters to evolve along the tree, at the expense of having an increased number of parameters. A model defines transition probabilities from states ''i'' to ''j'' along a branch of length ''t'' (in units of evolutionary time). The likelihood of a phylogeny is computed from a nested sum of transition probabilities that corresponds to the hierarchical structure of the proposed tree.  At each node, the likelihood of its descendants is summed over all possible ancestral character states at that node:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
L_x = \sum_{S_x\in \Omega}  P(S_x) \left(\sum_{S_y\in \Omega} P(S_y | S_x, t_{xy}) L_y \sum_{S_z\in \Omega} P(S_z | S_x, t_{xz}) L_z\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where we are computing the likelihood of the [[Tree (data structure)#Terminology|subtree]] rooted at node ''x'' with direct descendants ''y'' and ''z'', &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the character state of the ''i''-th node, &lt;math&gt;t_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the branch length (evolutionary time) between nodes ''i'' and ''j'', and &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all possible character states (for example, the nucleotides A, C, G, and T).&lt;ref name=Felsenstein1981 /&gt; Thus, the objective of ancestral reconstruction is to find the assignment to &lt;math&gt;S_x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' internal nodes that maximizes the likelihood of the observed data for a given tree.

==== Marginal and joint likelihood ====

Rather than compute the overall likelihood for alternative trees, the problem for ancestral reconstruction is to find the combination of character states at each ancestral node with the highest marginal maximum likelihood.  Generally speaking, there are two approaches to this problem.  First, one can assign the most likely character state to each ancestor independently of the reconstruction of all other ancestral states.  This approach is referred to as ''marginal reconstruction''.  It is akin to summing over all combinations of ancestral states at all of the other nodes of the tree (including the root node), other than those for which data is available. Second, one may instead attempt to find the joint combination of ancestral character states throughout the tree which jointly maximizes the likelihood of the data.  Thus, this approach is referred to as joint reconstruction.&lt;ref name=YangKumarNei1995 /&gt;  Not surprisingly, joint reconstruction is more [[Computational complexity theory|computationally complex]] than marginal reconstruction. Nevertheless, efficient algorithms for joint reconstruction have been developed with a time complexity that is generally linear with the number of observed taxa or sequences.&lt;ref name=PupkoPe2000/&gt;

ML-based methods of ancestral reconstruction tend to provide greater accuracy than MP methods in the presence of variation in rates of evolution among characters (or across sites in a genome).&lt;ref name=EyreWalker1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PupkoPeer2002 /&gt;  However, these methods are not yet able to accommodate variation in rates of evolution over time, otherwise known as [[heterotachy]].  If the rate of evolution for a specific character accelerates on a branch of the phylogeny, then the amount of evolution that has occurred on that branch will be underestimated for a given length of the branch and assuming a constant rate of evolution for that character. In addition to that, it is difficult to distinguish heterotachy from variation among characters in rates of evolution.&lt;ref name=GruenheitLockhart2008 /&gt;

Since ML (unlike maximum parsimony) requires the investigator to specify a model of evolution, its accuracy may be affected by the use of a grossly incorrect model (model misspecification).  Furthermore, ML can only provide a single reconstruction of character states (what is often referred to as a "point estimate") &amp;mdash; when the likelihood surface is highly non-convex, comprising multiple peaks (local optima), then a single point estimate cannot provide an adequate representation, and a Bayesian approach may be more suitable.

===Bayesian inference===

[[Bayesian inference]] uses the likelihood of observed data to update the investigator's belief, or [[Prior probability|prior distribution]], to yield the [[Posterior probability|posterior distribution]]. In the context of ancestral reconstruction, the objective is to infer the posterior probabilities of ancestral character states at each internal node of a given tree. Moreover, one can integrate these probabilities over the posterior distributions over the parameters of the evolutionary model and the space of all possible trees. This can be expressed as an application of [[Bayes' theorem]]:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P(S | D, \theta) &amp;= \frac{ P(D|S,\theta) P(S|\theta) }{ P(D|\theta) }\\
 &amp; \propto P(D|S,\theta) P(S|\theta) P(\theta)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where ''S'' represents the ancestral states, ''D'' corresponds to the observed data, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; represents both the evolutionary model and the phylogenetic tree.  &lt;math&gt;P(D|S,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the likelihood of the observed data which can be computed by [[Felsenstein's tree-pruning algorithm|Felsenstein's pruning algorithm]] as given above.  &lt;math&gt;P(S|\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the prior probability of the ancestral states for a given model and tree. Finally, &lt;math&gt;P(D|\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of the data for a given model and tree, integrated over all possible ancestral states.

Bayesian inference is the method that many have argued is the most accurate.&lt;ref name=PagelMeade2004 /&gt; In general, Bayesian statistical methods allow investigators to combine pre-existing information with new hypothesis. In the case of evolution, it combines the likelihood of the data observed with the likelihood that the events happened in the order they did, while recognizing the potential for error and uncertainty. Overall, it is the most accurate method for reconstructing ancestral genetic sequences, as well as protein stability.&lt;ref name=CunninghamOmland1998 /&gt; Unlike the other two methods, Bayesian inference yields a distribution of possible trees, allowing for more accurate and easily interpretable estimates of the variance of possible outcomes.&lt;ref name=HuelsenbeckRonquist2001 /&gt;

We have given two formulations above to emphasize the two different applications of Bayes' theorem, which we discuss in the following section.

==== Empirical and hierarchical Bayes ====

One of the first implementations of a Bayesian approach to ancestral sequence reconstruction was developed by Yang and colleagues,&lt;ref name=YangKumarNei1995 /&gt; where the maximum likelihood estimates of the evolutionary model and tree, respectively, were used to define the prior distributions. Thus, their approach is an example of an [[empirical Bayes method]] to compute the posterior probabilities of ancestral character states; this method was first implemented in the software package PAML.&lt;ref name=Yang1997 /&gt; In terms of the above Bayesian rule formulation, the empirical Bayes method fixes &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; to the empirical estimates of the model and tree obtained from the data, effectively dropping &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; from the posterior likelihood, and prior terms of the formula.  Moreover, Yang and colleagues&lt;ref name=YangKumarNei1995 /&gt; used the empirical distribution of site patterns (i.e., assignments of nucleotides to tips of the tree) in their alignment of observed nucleotide sequences in the denominator in place of exhaustively computing &lt;math&gt;P(D)&lt;/math&gt; over all possible values of ''S'' given &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  Computationally, the empirical Bayes method is akin to the maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral states except that, rather than searching for the ML assignment of states based on their respective probability distributions at each internal node, the probability distributions themselves are reported directly.

[[Empirical Bayes method]]s for ancestral reconstruction require the investigator to assume that the evolutionary model parameters and tree are known without error.  When the size or complexity of the data makes this an unrealistic assumption, it may be more prudent to adopt the fully hierarchical Bayesian approach and infer the joint posterior distribution over the ancestral character states, model, and tree.&lt;ref name=HuelsenbeckBollback2001 /&gt; Huelsenbeck and Bollback first proposed&lt;ref name=HuelsenbeckBollback2001 /&gt; a hierarchical Bayes method to ancestral reconstruction by using [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) methods to sample ancestral sequences from this joint posterior distribution. A similar approach was also used to reconstruct the evolution of symbiosis with algae in fungal species ([[lichen]]ization).&lt;ref name=LutzoniPagel2001 /&gt; For example, the [[Metropolis hastings|Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]] for MCMC explores the joint posterior distribution by accepting or rejecting parameter assignments on the basis of the ratio of posterior probabilities.

Put simply, the empirical Bayes approach calculates the probabilities of various ancestral states for a specific tree and model of evolution.  By expressing the reconstruction of ancestral states as a set of probabilities, one can directly quantify the uncertainty for assigning any particular state to an ancestor.  On the other hand, the hierarchical Bayes approach averages these probabilities over all possible trees and models of evolution, in proportion to how likely these trees and models are, given the data that has been observed.

Whether the hierarchical Bayes method confers a substantial advantage in practice remains controversial, however.&lt;ref name=HansonSmithKolaczkowski2010 /&gt; Moreover, this fully Bayesian approach is limited to analyzing relatively small numbers of sequences or taxa because the space of [[Phylogenetic tree#Bifurcating tree|all possible trees]] rapidly becomes too vast, making it computationally infeasible for [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|chain samples]] to converge in a reasonable amount of time.

===Calibration===

Ancestral reconstruction can be informed by the observed states in historical samples of known age, such as fossils or archival specimens. Since the accuracy of ancestral reconstruction generally decays with increasing time, the use of such specimens provides data that are closer to the ancestors being reconstructed and will most likely improve the analysis, especially when rates of character change vary through time. This concept has been validated by an experimental evolutionary study in which replicate populations of [[T7 phage|bacteriophage T7]] were propagated to generate an artificial phylogeny.&lt;ref name=HillisBull1992 /&gt; In revisiting these experimental data, Oakley and Cunningham&lt;ref name=OakleyCunningham2000 /&gt; found that maximum parsimony methods were unable to accurately reconstruct the known ancestral state of a continuous character ([[Viral plaque|plaque size]]); these results were verified by computer simulation.  This failure of ancestral reconstruction was attributed to a directional bias in the evolution of plaque size (from large to small plaque diameters) that required the inclusion of "fossilized" samples to address.

Studies of both mammalian carnivores&lt;ref name=FinarelliFlynn2006 /&gt; and fishes&lt;ref name=AlbertJohnson2009 /&gt; have demonstrated that without incorporating fossil data, the reconstructed estimates of ancestral body sizes are unrealistically large.  Moreover, Graham Slater and colleagues showed&lt;ref name=SlaterHarmon2012 /&gt; using [[Caniformia|caniform carnivorans]] that incorporating fossil data into prior distributions improved both the Bayesian inference of ancestral states and evolutionary model selection, relative to analyses using only contemporaneous data.

==Models==

Many models have been developed to estimate ancestral states of discrete and continuous characters from extant descendants.&lt;ref name=WebsterPurvis2002 /&gt; Such models assume that the evolution of a trait through time may be modelled as a stochastic process.  For discrete-valued traits (such as "pollinator type"), this process is typically taken to be a [[Markov chain]]; for continuous-valued traits (such as "[[brain size]]"), the process is frequently taken to be a [[Brownian motion]] or an [[Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process]].  Using this model as the basis for statistical inference, one can now use [[maximum likelihood]] methods or [[Bayesian inference]] to estimate the ancestral states.

===Discrete-state models===

Suppose the trait in question may fall into one of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; states, labelled &lt;math&gt;1,\ldots, k&lt;/math&gt;.  The typical means of modelling evolution of this trait is via a continuous-time Markov chain, which may be briefly described as follows (cf. Figure 2).  Each state has associated to it rates of transition to all of the other states. The trait is modelled as stepping between the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; states; when it reaches a given state, it starts an exponential "clock" for each of the other states that it can step to.  It then "races" the clocks against each other, and it takes a step towards the state whose clock is the first to ring.  In such a model, the parameters are the transition rates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \{q_{ij}: 1\leq i, j\leq k, i\not= j\}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be estimated using, for example, maximum likelihood methods, where one maximizes over the set of all possible configurations of states of the ancestral nodes. [[File:MC2State.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 2.  A general two-state Markov chain representing the rate of jumps from allele a to allele A. The different types of jumps are allowed to have different rates.]]

In order to recover the state of a given ancestral node in the phylogeny (call this node &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) by maximum likelihood, the procedure is: find the maximum likelihood estimate &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt;; then compute the likelihood of each possible state for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; conditioning on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \hat{\mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt;; finally, choose the ancestral state which maximizes this.&lt;ref name=SchluterPrice1997 /&gt;  One may also use this substitution model as the basis for a Bayesian inference procedure, which would consider the posterior belief in the state of an ancestral node given some user-chosen prior.

Because such models may have as many as &lt;math&gt;k(k-1)&lt;/math&gt; parameters, overfitting may be an issue.  Some common choices that reduce the parameter space are:

* ''Markov &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-state 1 parameter model'' (Figure 3): this   model is the reverse-in-time &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-state counterpart of the [[Models of DNA evolution#JC69 model .28Jukes and Cantor.2C 1969.29.5B1.5D|Jukes-Cantor]] model.  In this model, all transitions have the same rate &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, regardless of their start and end states.  Some transitions may be disallowed by declaring that their rates are simply 0; this may be the case, for example, if certain states cannot be reached from other states in a single transition. [[File:kState1Param.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 3.  Example of a four-state 1-parameter Markov chain model. Note that in this diagram, transitions between states A and D have been disallowed; it is conventional to not draw the arrow rather than to draw it with a rate of 0.]]
* ''Asymmetrical Markov &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-state 2 parameter model'' (Figure   4): in this model, the state space is ordered (so that, for example, state 1 is smaller than state 2, which is smaller than state 3), and transitions may only occur between adjacent states.  This model contains two parameters &lt;math&gt;q_\mbox{inc}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_\mbox{dec}&lt;/math&gt;: one for the rate of increase of state (e.g. 0 to 1, 1 to 2, etc.), and one for the rate of decrease in state (e.g. from 2 to 1, 1 to 0, etc.). [[File:Asymmetrical5State.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 4.  Graphical representation of an asymmetrical five-state 2-parameter Markov chain model.]]

==== Example: Binary state speciation and extinction model ====

The binary state speciation and extinction model&lt;ref name=MaddisonMidford2007 /&gt; (BiSSE) is a discrete-space model that does not directly follow the framework of those mentioned above.  It allows estimation of ancestral binary character states jointly with [[diversification rates]] associated with different character states; it may also be straightforwardly extended to a more general multiple-discrete-state model.  In its most basic form, this model involves six parameters: two speciation rates (one each for lineages in states 0 and 1); similarly, two extinction rates; and two rates of character change.  This model allows for hypothesis testing on the rates of speciation/extinction/character change, at the cost of increasing the number of parameters.

===Continuous-state models===

In the case where the trait instead takes non-discrete values, one must instead turn to a model where the trait evolves as some continuous process.  Inference of ancestral states by maximum likelihood (or by Bayesian methods) would proceed as above, but with the likelihoods of transitions in state between adjacent nodes given by some other continuous probability distribution.

* ''Brownian motion'': in this case, if nodes &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and   &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are adjacent in the phylogeny (say &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the ancestor of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) and separated by a branch of length &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the likelihood of a transition from &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; being in state &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; being in state &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is given by a Gaussian density with mean &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 t&lt;/math&gt;In this case, there is only one parameter (&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;), and the model assumes that the trait evolves freely without a bias toward increase or decrease, and that the rate of change is constant throughout the branches of the phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name="Martins1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martins | first1 = Emilia P | year = 1994 | title = 'Estimating the rate of phenotypic evolution from comparative data. | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 144 | issue = | pages = 193–209 | doi=10.1086/285670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.&lt;/ref&gt; This is useful for modelling scenarios where the trait is subject to ''stabilizing'' selection around a certain value (say &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;). Under this model, the above-described transition of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; being in state &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; being in state &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; would have a likelihood defined by the transition density of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with two parameters: &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the variance of the driving Brownian motion, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the strength of its attraction to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  As &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the process is less and less constrained by its attraction to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and the process becomes a Brownian motion.  Because of this, the models may be nested, and log-likelihood ratio tests discerning which of the two models is appropriate may be carried out.&lt;ref name="Martins1994"/&gt;
* ''Stable models of continuous character evolution:''&lt;ref name=ElliotMooers2014 /&gt; though Brownian motion is appealing and tractable as a model of continuous evolution, it does not permit non-neutrality in its basic form, nor does it provide for any variation in the rate of evolution over time.  Instead, one may use a [[stable process]], one whose values at fixed times are distributed as [[stable distribution]]s, to model the evolution of traits.  Stable processes, roughly speaking, behave as Brownian motions that also incorporate discontinuous jumps.  This allows to appropriately model scenarios in which short bursts of fast trait evolution are expected.  In this setting, maximum likelihood methods are poorly suited due to a rugged likelihood surface and because the likelihood may be made arbitrarily large, so Bayesian methods are more appropriate.&lt;ref name=ElliotMooers2014 /&gt;

==Applications==

===Character evolution===

'''Ancestral reconstruction''' is widely used to infer the ecological, phenotypic, or biogeographic traits associated with ancestral nodes in a phylogenetic tree.  It should be noted that all methods of ancestral trait reconstructions have pitfalls, as they use mathematical models to predict how traits have changed with large amounts of missing data. This missing data includes the states of extinct species, the relative rates of evolutionary changes, knowledge of initial character states, and the accuracy of phylogenetic trees. In all cases where ancestral trait reconstruction is used, findings should be justified with an examination of the biological data that supports model based conclusions. Griffith O.W. ''et al.''&lt;ref name=GriffithBlackburn2015 /&gt;

Ancestral reconstruction allows for the study of evolutionary pathways, [[selection (biology)|adaptive selection]], and functional divergence of the evolutionary past. For a review of biological and computational techniques of ancestral reconstruction see Chang ''et al.''.&lt;ref name=ChangUgalde2005 /&gt; For criticism of ancestral reconstruction computation methods see Williams P.D. ''et al.''.&lt;ref name=WilliamsPollock2006 /&gt;

=====Diet reconstruction in Galapagos finches=====

Both phylogenetic and character data are available for the radiation of [[finch]]es inhabiting the [[Galapagos Islands]]. These data allow testing of hypotheses concerning the timing and ordering of character state changes through time via ancestral state reconstruction. During the dry season, the diets of the 13 species of [[Darwin's Finches|Galapagos finches]] may be assorted into three broad diet categories, first those that consume grain-like foods are considered "[[Seed predation|granivores]]", those that ingest arthropods are termed "[[insectivore]]s" and those that consume vegetation are classified as "[[folivore]]s".&lt;ref name=SchluterPrice1997 /&gt; Dietary ancestral state reconstruction using maximum parsimony recover 2 major shifts from an insectivorous state: one to granivory, and one to folivory. Maximum-likelihood ancestral state reconstruction recovers broadly similar results, with one significant difference: the common ancestor of the tree finch (''[[Camarhynchus]]'') and ground finch (''[[Geospiza]]'') clades are most likely granivorous rather than insectivorous (as judged by parsimony). In this case, this difference between ancestral states returned by maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood likely occurs as a result of the fact that ML estimates consider branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name=SchluterPrice1997 /&gt;

====Morphological and physiological character evolution====

[[Phrynosomatidae|Phrynosomatid]] lizards show remarkable morphological diversity, including in the relative muscle [[Skeletal muscle|fiber type]] composition in their hindlimb [[muscles]].  Ancestor reconstruction based on squared-change parsimony (equivalent to maximum likelihood under [[Brownian motion]] character evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maddison | first1 = W. P. | year = 1991 | title = Squared-change parsimony reconstructions of ancestral states for continuous-valued characters on a phylogenetic tree | url = | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 304–314 | doi=10.1093/sysbio/40.3.304}}&lt;/ref&gt;) indicates that [[horned lizard]]s, one of the three main subclades of the lineage, have undergone a major evolutionary increase in the proportion of fast-oxidative glycolytic fibers in their iliofibularis muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonine | first1 = K. E. | year = 2005 | title = Muscle fiber-type variation in lizards (Squamata) and phylogenetic reconstruction of hypothesized ancestral states | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 208 | issue = | pages = 4529–4547 | doi=10.1242/jeb.01903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mammalian body mass=====

In an analysis of the body mass of 1,679 [[Placentalia|placental mammal]] species comparing stable models of continuous character evolution to [[Brownian motion]] models, Elliot and Mooers&lt;ref name=ElliotMooers2014 /&gt; showed that the evolutionary process describing mammalian body mass evolution is best characterized by a [[Stable distribution|stable model]] of continuous character evolution, which accommodates rare changes of large magnitude. Under a stable model, ancestral mammals retained a low body mass through early diversification, with large increases in body mass coincident with the origin of several Orders of large body massed species (e.g. ungulates). By contrast, simulation under a Brownian motion model recovered a less realistic, order of magnitude larger body mass among ancestral mammals, requiring significant reductions in body size prior to the evolution of Orders exhibiting small body size (e.g. [[Rodent]]ia). Thus stable models recover a more realistic picture of mammalian body mass evolution by permitting large transformations to occur on a small subset of branches.&lt;ref name=ElliotMooers2014 /&gt;

=====Correlated character evolution=====

[[Phylogenetic comparative methods]] (inferences drawn through comparison of related taxa) are often used to identify biological characteristics that do not evolve independently, which can reveal an underlying dependence.  For example, the evolution of the shape of a finch's beak may be associated with its foraging behaviour. However, it is not advisable to search for these associations by the direct comparison of measurements or genetic sequences because these observations are not independent because of their descent from common ancestors. For discrete characters, this problem was first addressed in the framework of maximum parsimony by evaluating whether two characters tended to undergo a change on the same branches of the tree.&lt;ref name=Ridley1983 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Maddison1990 /&gt; [[Joseph Felsenstein|Felsenstein]] identified this problem for continuous character evolution and proposed a solution similar to ancestral reconstruction, in which the phylogenetic structure of the data was accommodated statistically by directing the analysis through computation of "independent contrasts" between nodes of the tree related by non-overlapping branches.&lt;ref name=Felsenstein1985 /&gt;

====Molecular evolution====

On a molecular level, [[Amino acid|amino acid residues]] at different locations of a protein may evolve non-independently because they have a direct physicochemical interaction, or indirectly by their interactions with a common substrate or through long-range interactions in the protein structure.  Conversely, the folded structure of a protein could potentially be inferred from the distribution of residue interactions.&lt;ref name=GobelSander1994 /&gt; One of the earliest applications of ancestral reconstruction, to predict the [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure of a protein]] through residue contacts, was published by Shindyalov and colleagues.&lt;ref name=ShindyalovKolchanov1994 /&gt; Phylogenies relating 67 different protein families were generated by a distance-based clustering method ([[UPGMA|unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean]], UPGMA), and ancestral sequences were reconstructed by parsimony. The authors reported a weak but significant tendency for [[Coevolution|co-evolving]] pairs of residues to be co-located in the known three-dimensional structure of the proteins.

The reconstruction of ancient proteins and DNA sequences has only recently become a significant scientific endeavour. The developments of extensive genomic sequence databases in conjunction with advances in biotechnology and phylogenetic inference methods have made ancestral reconstruction cheap, fast, and scientifically practical. This concept has been applied to identify co-evolving residues in protein sequences using more advanced methods for the reconstruction of phylogenies and ancestral sequences. For example, ancestral reconstruction has been used to identify co-evolving residues in proteins encoded by RNA virus genomes, particularly in HIV.&lt;ref name=KorberFarber1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shapiro2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PoonLewis2007 /&gt;

Ancestral [[protein]] and [[DNA]] reconstruction allows for the recreation of protein and DNA evolution in the laboratory so that it can be studied directly.&lt;ref name=ChangUgalde2005 /&gt; With respect to proteins, this allows for the investigation of the evolution of present-day molecular structure and function. Additionally, ancestral protein reconstruction can lead to the discoveries of new biochemical functions that have been lost in modern proteins.&lt;ref name=JermannOpitz1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SadqideAlba2009 /&gt; It also allows insights into the biology and ecology of extinct organisms.&lt;ref name=ChangJonsson2002 /&gt; Although the majority of ancestral reconstructions have dealt with proteins, it has also been used to test evolutionary mechanisms at the level of bacterial genomes&lt;ref name=ZhangZhang2003 /&gt; and primate gene sequences.&lt;ref name=Krishnan2004 /&gt;

=====Vaccine design=====

RNA viruses such as the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) evolve at an extremely rapid rate, orders of magnitude faster than mammals or birds. For these organisms, ancestral reconstruction can be applied on a much shorter time scale; for example, in order to reconstruct the global or regional progenitor of an [[epidemic]] that has spanned decades rather than millions of years.  A team around Brian Gaschen proposed&lt;ref name=Gaschen2002 /&gt; that such reconstructed strains be used as targets for [[vaccine]] design efforts, as opposed to sequences isolated from patients in the present day. Because HIV is extremely diverse, a vaccine designed to work on one patient's viral population might not work for a different patient, because the evolutionary distance between these two viruses may be large. However, their most recent common ancestor is closer to each of the two viruses than they are to each other. Thus, a vaccine designed for a common ancestor could have a better chance of being effective for a larger proportion of circulating strains. Another team took this idea further by developing a center-of-tree reconstruction method to produce a sequence whose total evolutionary distance to contemporary strains is as small as possible.&lt;ref name=RollandJensen2007 /&gt; Strictly speaking, this method was not ''ancestral'' reconstruction, as the center-of-tree (COT) sequence does not necessarily represent a sequence that has ever existed in the evolutionary history of the virus. However, Rolland and colleagues did find that, in the case of HIV, the COT virus was functional when synthesized. Similar experiments with synthetic ancestral sequences obtained by maximum likelihood reconstruction have likewise shown that these ancestors are both functional and immunogenic,&lt;ref name=KotheLi2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DoriaRoseLearn2005 /&gt; lending some credibility to these methods.  Furthermore, ancestral reconstruction can potentially be used to infer the genetic sequence of the transmitted HIV variants that have gone on to establish the next infection, with the objective of identifying distinguishing characteristics of these variants (as a non-random selection of the transmitted population of viruses) that may be targeted for vaccine design.&lt;ref name=McCloskeyLiang2014 /&gt;

=====Genome rearrangements=====

Rather than inferring the ancestral DNA sequence, one may be interested in the larger-scale molecular structure and content of an ancestral genome. This problem is often approached in a combinatorial framework, by modelling genomes as [[permutation]]s of genes or homologous regions. Various operations are allowed on these permutations, such as an [[Chromosomal inversion|inversion]] (a segment of the permutation is reversed in-place), [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]] (a segment is removed), [[Transposable element|transposition]] (a segment is removed from one part of the permutation and spliced in somewhere else), or gain of genetic content through [[Homologous recombination|recombination]], [[Gene duplication|duplication]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]]. The "genome rearrangement problem", first posed by Watterson and colleagues,&lt;ref name= WattersonEwens1982 /&gt; asks: given two genomes (permutations) and a set of allowable operations, what is the shortest sequence of operations that will transform one genome into the other?  A generalization of this problem applicable to ancestral reconstruction is the "multiple genome rearrangement problem":&lt;ref name=BorquePevzner2002 /&gt; given a set of genomes and a set of allowable operations, find (i) a binary tree with the given genomes as its leaves, and (ii) an assignment of genomes to the internal nodes of the tree, such that the total number of operations across the whole tree is minimized.  This approach is similar to parsimony, except that the tree is inferred along with the ancestral sequences.  Unfortunately, even the single genome rearrangement problem is [[NP-hard]],&lt;ref name=EvenGoldreich1981 /&gt; although it has received much attention in mathematics and computer science (for a review, see Fertin and colleagues&lt;ref name=FertinLabarre2009 /&gt;).

The reconstruction of ancestral genomes is also called [[karyotype]] reconstruction. Chromosome painting is currently the main experimental technique.&lt;ref name=Wienberg2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Froenicke2006 /&gt; Recently, researchers have developed computational methods to reconstruct the ancestral karyotype by taking advantage of [[comparative genomics]].&lt;ref name=Murphy2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MaZhang2006 /&gt; Furthermore, comparative genomics and ancestral genome reconstruction has been applied to identify ancient horizontal gene transfer events at the last common ancestor of a lineage (e.g. ''Candidatus'' Accumulibacter phosphatis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oyserman|first=Ben O.|last2=Moya|first2=Francisco|last3=Lawson|first3=Christopher E.|last4=Garcia|first4=Antonio L.|last5=Vogt|first5=Mark|last6=Heffernen|first6=Mitchell|last7=Noguera|first7=Daniel R.|last8=McMahon|first8=Katherine D.|date=2016-04-29|title=Ancestral genome reconstruction identifies the evolutionary basis for trait acquisition in polyphosphate accumulating bacteria|url=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ismej201667a.html|journal=The ISME Journal|language=en|doi=10.1038/ismej.2016.67|issn=1751-7370|volume=10|pages=2931–2945|pmc=5148189}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to identify the evolutionary basis for trait acquisition.

====Spatial applications====

=====Migration=====

Ancestral reconstruction is not limited to biological traits.  Spatial location is also a trait, and ancestral reconstruction methods can infer the locations of ancestors of the individuals under consideration.  Such techniques were used by Lemey and colleagues&lt;ref name= FraserLemey2009 /&gt; to geographically trace the ancestors of 192 [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|Avian influenza A-H5N1]] strains sampled from twenty localities in Europe and Asia, and for 101 [[rabies virus]] sequences sampled across twelve African countries.

Treating locations as discrete states (countries, cities, etc.) allows for the application of the discrete-state models described above. However, unlike in a model where the state space for the trait is small, there may be many locations, and transitions between certain pairs of states may rarely or never occur; for example, migration between distant locales may never happen directly if air travel between the two places does not exist, so such migrations must pass through intermediate locales first.  This means that there could be many parameters in the model which are zero or close to zero.  To this end, Lemey and colleagues used a Bayesian procedure to not only estimate the parameters and ancestral states, but also to select which migration parameters are not zero; their work suggests that this procedure does lead to more efficient use of the data.  They also explore the use of prior distributions that incorporate geographical structure or hypotheses about migration dynamics, finding that those they considered had little effect on the findings.

Using this analysis, the team around Lemey found that the most likely hub of diffusion of A-H5N1 is [[Guangdong]], with [[Hong Kong]] also receiving posterior support.  Further, their results support the hypothesis of long-standing presence of African rabies in [[West Africa]].

=====Species ranges=====

Inferring historical [[Biogeography|biogeographic]] patterns often requires reconstructing ancestral ranges of species on phylogenetic trees.&lt;ref name=ClarkRee2008 /&gt; For instance, a well-resolved phylogeny of plant species in the genus ''[[Cyrtandra (plant)|Cyrtandra]]''&lt;ref name=ClarkRee2008 /&gt; was used together with information of their geographic ranges to compare four methods of ancestral range reconstruction. The team compared Fitch parsimony,&lt;ref name=Fitch1971 /&gt; (FP; parsimony) stochastic mapping&lt;ref name=HuelsenbeckNielsen2003 /&gt; (SM; maximum likelihood), [[Vicariance|dispersal-vicariance]] analysis&lt;ref name=Ronquist1996 /&gt; (DIVA; parsimony), and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis&lt;ref name=ReeSmith2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ReeMoore2005 /&gt; (DEC; maximum-likelihood).  Results indicated that both parsimony methods performed poorly, which was likely due to the fact that parsimony methods do not consider branch lengths. Both maximum-likelihood methods performed better; however, DEC analyses that additionally allow incorporation of geological priors gave more realistic inferences about range evolution in ''Cyrtandra'' relative to other methods.&lt;ref name=ClarkRee2008 /&gt;

Another maximum likelihood method recovers the phylogeographic history of a gene&lt;ref name=LemmonLemmon2008 /&gt; by reconstructing the ancestral locations of the sampled taxa.  This method assumes a spatially explicit random walk model of migration to reconstruct ancestral locations given the geographic coordinates of the individuals represented by the tips of the phylogenetic tree. When applied to a phylogenetic tree of chorus frogs [[Upland chorus frog|''Pseudacris feriarum'']], this method recovered recent northward expansion, higher per-generation dispersal distance in the recently colonized region, a non-central ancestral location, and directional migration.&lt;ref name=LemmonLemmon2008 /&gt;

[[File:flies.png|500px|thumb|right|Figure 6. Phylogeny of 7 regional strains of Drosophila pseudoobscura, as inferred by [[Alfred Sturtevant|Sturtevant]] and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]].&lt;ref name=SturtevantDobzhansky1936 /&gt; Displayed sequences do not correspond to the original paper, but were derived from the notation in the authors' companion paper&lt;ref name=DobzhanskySturtevant1937 /&gt; as follows: A (63A-65B), B (65C-68D), C (69A-70A), D (70B-70D), E (71A-71B), F (71A-73C), G (74A-74C), H (75A-75C), I (76A-76B), J (76C-77B), K (78A-79D), L (80A-81D). Inversions inferred by the authors are highlighted in blue along branches.]]

The first consideration of the multiple genome rearrangement problem, long before its formalization in terms of permutations, was presented by Sturtevant and Dobzhansky in 1936.&lt;ref name=SturtevantDobzhansky1936 /&gt; They examined genomes of several strains of [[Drosophila pseudoobscura|fruit fly]] from different geographic locations, and observed that one configuration, which they called "standard", was the most common throughout all the studied areas. Remarkably, they also noticed that four different strains could be obtained from the standard sequence by a single inversion, and two others could be related by a second inversion. This allowed them to hypothesize a phylogeny for the sequences, and to infer that the standard sequence was probably also the ancestral one.

====Linguistic Evolution====

Reconstructions of the words and phenomes of ancient [[proto-language]]s such as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] have been performed based on the observed analogues in present-day languages. Typically, these analyses are carried out manually using the "comparative method".&lt;ref name=Campbell1998 /&gt; First, words from different languages with a common etymology ([[cognate]]s) are identified in the contemporary languages under study, analogous to the identification of [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthologous]] biological sequences. Second, correspondences between individual sounds in the cognates are identified, a step similar to biological [[sequence alignment]], although performed manually. Finally, likely ancestral sounds are hypothesised by manual inspection and various heuristics (such as the fact that most languages have both [[Nasal vowel|nasal and non-nasal vowels]]).&lt;ref name= Campbell1998 /&gt;

==Software==

There are many software packages available which can perform ancestral state reconstruction.  Generally, these software packages have been developed and maintained through the efforts of scientists in related fields and released under [[free software license]]s.  The following table is not meant to be a comprehensive itemization of all available packages, but provides a representative sample of the extensive variety of packages that implement methods of ancestral reconstruction with different strengths and features.

=== Package descriptions ===

==== Molecular evolution ====

The majority of these software packages are designed for analyzing genetic sequence data.  For example, PAML&lt;ref name=Yang2007 /&gt; is a collection of programs for the phylogenetic analysis of DNA and protein sequence alignments by maximum likelihood. Ancestral reconstruction can be performed using the ''codeml'' program.  In addition, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150307220356/http://markov.uoregon.edu/software/lazarus/ LAZARUS] is a collection of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripts that wrap the ancestral reconstruction functions of PAML for batch processing and greater ease-of-use. [http://hyphy.org/w/index.php/Main_Page HyPhy], [http://mesquiteproject.org/Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/manual.html Mesquite], and [http://www.megasoftware.net/ MEGA] are also software packages for the phylogenetic analysis of sequence data, but are designed to be more modular and customizable.  HyPhy&lt;ref name=PondFrost2004 /&gt; implements a joint maximum likelihood method of ancestral sequence reconstruction&lt;ref name=PupkoPe2000 /&gt; that can be readily adapted to reconstructing a more generalized range of discrete ancestral character states such as geographic locations by specifying a customized model in its batch language.  Mesquite&lt;ref name=Maddison2015 /&gt; provides ancestral state reconstruction methods for both discrete and continuous characters using both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods.  It also provides several visualization tools for interpreting the results of ancestral reconstruction.  MEGA&lt;ref name=TamuraStecher2013 /&gt; is a modular system, too, but places greater emphasis on ease-of-use than customization of analyses.  As of version 5, MEGA allows the user to reconstruct ancestral states using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and empirical Bayes methods.&lt;ref name=TamuraStecher2013 /&gt;

The Bayesian analysis of genetic sequences may confer greater robustness to model misspecification.  MrBayes&lt;ref name=RonquistHuelsenbeck2003 /&gt; allows inference of ancestral states at ancestral nodes using the full hierarchical Bayesian approach.  The PREQUEL program distributed in the PHAST package&lt;ref name=HubiszPollard2010 /&gt; performs comparative evolutionary genomics using ancestral sequence reconstruction. SIMMAP&lt;ref name=Bollback2006 /&gt;  stochastically maps mutations on phylogenies. BayesTraits&lt;ref name=Pagel1999 /&gt; analyses discrete or continuous characters in a Bayesian framework to evaluate models of evolution, reconstruct ancestral states, and detect correlated evolution between pairs of traits.

==== Other character types ====

&lt;!-- References are done up to here, but it keeps crashing when I try to paste stuff in. --&gt;

Other software packages are more oriented towards the analysis of qualitative and quantitative traits ([[phenotype]]s).  For example, the ''ape'' package&lt;ref name=Paradis2012 /&gt; in the statistical computing environment [[R (programming language)|R]] also provides methods for ancestral state reconstruction for both discrete and continuous characters through the [http://www.r-phylo.org/wiki/HowTo/Ancestral_State_Reconstruction ''ace''] function, including maximum likelihood.  (Note that ''ace'' performs reconstruction by computing scaled conditional likelihoods instead of the marginal or joint likelihoods used by other maximum likelihood-based methods for ancestral reconstruction, which may adversely affect the accuracy of reconstruction at nodes other than the root [https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065712/https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-phylo/2013-March/002584.html].) Phyrex implements a maximum parsimony-based algorithm to reconstruct ancestral gene expression profiles, in addition to a maximum likelihood method for reconstructing ancestral genetic sequences (by wrapping around the baseml function in PAML).&lt;ref name=RossnesEidhammer2005 /&gt;

Several software packages also reconstruct [[phylogeography]].  BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees&lt;ref name=DrummondSuchard2012 /&gt;) provides tools for reconstructing ancestral geographic locations from observed sequences annotated with location data using Bayesian [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC]] sampling methods.  Diversitree&lt;ref name=FitzJohn2012 /&gt; is an R package providing methods for ancestral state reconstruction under Mk2 (a [[Continuous-time Markov chain|continuous time Markov model]] of binary character evolution.&lt;ref name=Pagel1994 /&gt;) and BiSSE (Binary State Speciation and Extinction) models.  Lagrange performs analyses on reconstruction of geographic range evolution on phylogenetic trees.&lt;ref name=ReeSmith2008 /&gt;  Phylomapper&lt;ref name=LemmonLemmon2008 /&gt; is a statistical framework for estimating historical patterns of gene flow and ancestral geographic locations.  RASP&lt;ref name=YuHarris2010 /&gt; infers ancestral states using statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis, Lagrange, Bayes-Lagrange, BayArea and BBM methods.  VIP&lt;ref name=AriasSzumik2011 /&gt; infers historical biogeography by examining disjunct geographic distributions.

Genome rearrangements provide valuable information in [[comparative genomics]] between species. ANGES&lt;ref name=JonesRajaraman2012 /&gt; compares extant related genomes through ancestral reconstruction of genetic markers. BADGER&lt;ref name=LargetKadane2005 /&gt; uses a Bayesian approach to examining the history of gene rearrangement.  Count&lt;ref name=Csuos2010 /&gt; reconstructs the evolution of the size of gene families.  EREM&lt;ref name=CarmelWolf2010 /&gt; analyses the gain and loss of genetic features encoded by binary characters.  PARANA&lt;ref name=PatroSefer2012 /&gt; performs parsimony based inference of ancestral biological networks that represent gene loss and duplication.

==== Web applications ====

Finally, there are several web-server based applications that allow investigators to use maximum likelihood methods for ancestral reconstruction of different character types without having to install any software.  For example, Ancestors&lt;ref name=DialloMakarenkov2009 /&gt; is web-server for ancestral genome reconstruction by the identification and arrangement of [[Synteny|syntenic]] regions.  FastML&lt;ref name=AshkenazyPenn2012 /&gt; is a web-server for probabilistic reconstruction of ancestral sequences by maximum likelihood that uses a gap character model for reconstructing [[indel]] variation.  MLGO&lt;ref name=HuLin2014 /&gt; is a web-server for maximum likelihood gene order analysis.

==Future directions==

The development and application of computational algorithms for ancestral reconstruction continues to be an active area of research across disciplines.  For example, the reconstruction of sequence insertions and deletions (indels) has lagged behind the more straightforward application of substitution models.  Bouchard-Côté and Jordan recently described a new model (the Poisson Indel Process&lt;ref name=BouchardCoteJordan2012 /&gt;) which represents an important advance on the archetypal Thorne-Kishino-Felsenstein model of indel evolution.&lt;ref name=ThorneKishino1991 /&gt; In addition, the field is being driven forward by rapid advances in the area of [[DNA sequencing#Next-generation methods|next-generation sequencing]] technology, where sequences are generated from millions of nucleic acid templates by extensive parallelization of sequencing reactions in a custom apparatus. These advances have made it possible to generate a [[Deep sequencing|"deep" snapshot]] of the genetic composition of a rapidly evolving population, such as RNA viruses&lt;ref name=FraserPoon2012 /&gt; or tumour cells,&lt;ref name=BeerenwinkelSchwarz2014 /&gt; in a relatively short amount of time.  At the same time, the massive amount of data and platform-specific sequencing error profiles has created new bioinformatic challenges for processing these data for ancestral sequence reconstruction.

'''"Appeal as from an abuse"''' (French ''appel comme d'abus'') is a legal term applied in the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], meaning originally a legal appeal as recourse to the civil forum (court) against the usurpation by the ecclesiastical forum of the rights of [[law|civil jurisdiction]]. It could mean (''vice versa'') a recourse to the ecclesiastical forum against the usurpation by the civil forum of the rights of [[ecclesiastical jurisdiction]]. 

Thus defined, the "appeal as from an abuse" had as its object was to safeguard equally the rights both of the State and of the Church. An abuse would be an act on either hand, without due authority, beyond the limits of their respective ordinary and natural jurisdictions. In practice the use of such appeals was important, historically, as a way to undermine the power of church courts.

==Canon law==

The canons&lt;ref&gt;can. "Dilecto", in bk. VI of Decretals, "De sent. excom.", in ch. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; did not exclude a recourse to the civil authority when the acts of an ecclesiastical judge invaded the domain of the civil authority, especially as reciprocity gave the ecclesiastical authority the right to repel with the same weapons any usurpation by the lay judge to the damage of the rights of the Church. Thus also a recourse to the supreme civil ruler was not deemed amiss when an ecclesiastical court undertook a cause belonging to the competency of a higher ecclesiastical court, and the ruler was asked&lt;ref&gt;can. "Placuit" in Decree of Gratian, Pt. II, Q. I, ch. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; merely to forward it to the proper tribunal without, however, claiming to delegate to it any jurisdiction. Perhaps the first formal manifestation of this appeal in the legitimate sense occurred in the fourteenth century.

==History==

Ecclesiastical judges acquired a reputation for learning and equity, and by the good will of the State, not merely ecclesiastical, but many civil cases of the laity were adjudicated by them. in 1329 complaint was brought to King [[Philip VI of France|Philip de Valois]] by the advocate general, Peter de Cugnières, that the civil tribunals were fast lapsing into contempt, and were being abandoned. The purport of the complaint was to restrict the competency of the ecclesiastical tribunals to their own legitimate fields. Bickerings between the two forums were henceforth frequent. Even the Catholic states, after the beginning of the sixteenth century, advanced far in the way of frequent ruptures with the Church.

When the Protestant states had acquired control and supervision over the newly reformed bodies even in their spiritual relations, the Catholic states, particularly France, strove to limit the jurisdiction of the Church as far as they could without casting aside the profession of the Catholic Faith. The [[Pragmatic Sanction]] was a serious aggression by France upon the acknowledged rights of the Church and of the Holy See. It is in France that we find the most flagrant series of encroachments upon Church jurisdiction, through pretence of appeals as from an abuse, gradually tending to the elimination of the ecclesiastical forum. 

During the seventeenth century the French clergy presented frequent memorials against the encroachments made by their kings and parliaments through constant recourse to these "appeals as from an abuse", which resulted in submitting to civil tribunals questions of definitions of faith, the proper administration of the sacraments, and the like. This brought confusion into the regulation of spiritual matters by encouraging ecclesiastics to rebel against their lawful ecclesiastical superiors. The lay tribunals undertook to adjudicate whether the ministers of the sacraments had a right to refuse them to those deemed unworthy, or the right to Christian burial of Catholics dying impenitent or under Church censures; whether interdicts or suspensions were valid; whether monastic professions should be annulled; whether the bishop's permission was necessary for preaching; whether a specified marriage was contrary or not to the Gospel; and also to decide the justice of canonical privations of benefices. Many other subjects intimately connected with the teaching of the Church were brought before lay tribunals, and unappealable decisions rendered in open contradiction to the canons, as can easily be surmised both from the absence of theological knowledge, and from the visible animus shown in decisions that undertook to subject the spiritual power of the Church to the dictates of transient politics. 

Interference was mostly owing to courtier-canonists who flattered the secular rulers by dwelling upon the right of protection over the Church conceded in early days to the Christian Roman Emperors. The Church was recognized as autonomous in all things of the divine law and in matters of ecclesiastical discipline. When rulers like [[Charlemagne]] seemed to take upon themselves undue authority, insisting upon certain canons, the bishops claimed their sole right to govern the Church. Even in mixed assemblies of bishops and nobles and princes, the bishops insisted that the civil power should not encroach upon the rights of the Church, e. g. in the [[Concile of Narbonne (788)|Council of Narbonne]] (788). 

Zaccaria&lt;ref&gt;Dissertaz. 28&lt;/ref&gt; recognized, however, that in his day (the eighteenth century), as well as in former ages, the Catholic rulers of Catholic States, in their quality of protectors of the Church, might receive a recourse from ecclesiastics in ecclesiastical matters, in order that justice might be done them by their ordinary ecclesiastical judges, not as deputies of the civil rulers, but as ordinary judges in their own forum. In her [[concordat]]s with Catholic states the Catholic Church granted to several that the civil cases of clerics, and such as concern the property and temporal rights of churches, as well as benefices and other ecclesiastical foundations, may be brought before the civil courts.

==Modern relationship==

All ecclesiastical causes, and those that concern the Faith, sacraments, morals, sacred functions, and rights connected with the sacred ministry, belong to the ecclesiastical forum, both in regard of persons and of matter.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Concordat with Ecuador in 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, as decreed by the [[Council of Baltimore]] (1837), the church law is that if any ecclesiastical person or member of a religious body, male or female, should cite an ecclesiastic or a religious before a civil court on a question of a purely ecclesiastical nature, he should know that he falls under the censures decreed by canon law. 

The [[Congregation of Propaganda]] in its comment explained that, in mixed cases, where the persons may be ecclesiastical, but the things about which there is question may be temporal or of one's household, this rule cannot be enforced, especially in countries in which the civil government is not in the hands of Catholics, and where, unless recourse is had to the civil courts, there is not the means or the power of enforcing an ecclesiastical decision for the protection or recovery of one's own. A special proviso was made by Propaganda for the United States,&lt;ref&gt;17 August 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; that if a priest should bring a cleric before a civil tribunal on an ecclesiastical or other question without permission from the bishop he could be forced to withdraw the case by the infliction of penalties and censures, yet the bishop must not refuse the permission if the parties have ineffectually attempted a settlement before him. If the bishop is to be cited, the permission of the Holy See is required. 

By a special declaration of Propaganda,&lt;ref&gt;6 September 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; a cleric's transfer of a claim to a layman for the purpose of evading the censures is checked by the requirement of the consent of the bishop to such transfer, if made for the purpose of the suit. Justice Redfield&lt;ref&gt;in vol. XV, Am. Law Reg., p. 277, quoted with approval in vol. XCVIII of Penn. Rep., p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; says in reference to the United States generally: "The decision of ecclesiastical courts or officers having, by the rules or laws of the bodies to which they belong, jurisdiction of such questions, or the right to decide them, will be held conclusive in all courts of the civil administration, and no question involved in such decisions will be revised or reviewed in the civil courts, except those pertaining to the jurisdiction of such courts or officers to determine such questions according to the laws or the usage of the bodies they represent." Justice Strong, of the Supreme Court of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;In his lecture on the "Relations of Civil Law to Church Policy" (p. 41).&lt;/ref&gt; speaks of the Church as "an interior organization within a religious society", and adds,&lt;ref&gt;p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it may be safely asserted as a general principle that whenever questions of discipline, of faith, of Church rule, of membership, or of office, have been decided by the Church, in its own modes of decision, civil law tribunals accept these decisions as final and apply them as made."

{{Education in the U.S.}}
'''Art education in the United States''' reflects the social values of [[American culture]]. [[Apprenticeship]] was once the norm and the main sense, however with the democratization of education, particularly as promoted by educational philosopher [[John Dewey]], opportunities have greatly expanded. Elliot Eisner has been an influential advocate for the benefits of art in the schools.

Enrollment in art classes at the high-school elective level peaked in the late 1960s to the early 1970s with that period's emphasis on individuals expressing uniqueness. Currently "art [[magnet schools]]", available in many larger communities, use art(s) as a core or underlying theme to attract those students motivated by personal interest or with the intention of becoming a professional or commercial artist. It is widely reported that the arts are losing instruction time in school based upon budget cuts in combination with increasing test-based assessments of children which the federal government's [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB) act requires. The NCLB retains the arts as part of the "core curriculum" for all schools, it does not require reporting any instruction time or assessment data for arts education content or performance standards, which is reason often cited for the decline or possible decline of arts education in American public schools.

==Picture study movement, before 1930==
Art appreciation in America accelerated with the "picture study movement" in the late 19th century. The movement began to fade at the end of the 1920s.{{sfn|Eisner|2004}} Picture study was an important part of the art education curriculum. Attention to the aesthetics in classrooms led to public interest in beautifying the school, home, and community, which was known as “Art in Daily Living”. The idea was to bring culture to the child to change the parents.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peter (1986,Sept.) The Ecology of Picture Study, ''Art Education''[48-54].&lt;/ref&gt;

Picture study was made possible by the improved technologies of reproduction of images, growing public interest in art, the Progressive Movement in education, and growing numbers of immigrant children who were more visually literate than they were in English. The type of art included in the curriculum was from the Renaissance onward, but nothing considered “modern art” was taught. Often, teachers selected pictures that had a moral message. This is because a major factor in the development in aesthetics as a subject was its relationship to the moral education of the new citizens due to the influx of immigrants during the period. Aesthetics and art masterpieces were part of the popular idea of self culture, and the moralistic response to an artwork was within the capabilities of the teacher, who often did not have the artistic training to discuss the formal qualities of the artwork.

A typical Picture Study lesson was as follows: Teachers purchased materials from the Perry Picture Series, for example. This is similar to the prepackaged [[curriculum]] we have today. These materials included a teacher’s picture that was larger for the class to look at together, and then smaller reproduction approximately 2 ¾” by 2” for each child to look at. These were generally in black and white or sepia tone. Children would often collect these cards and trade them much like modern day baseball cards. The teacher would give the students a certain amount of information about the picture and the artist who created it, such as the picture’s representational content, artist’s vital statistics, and a few biographical details about the artist. These were all included in the materials so an unskilled teacher could still present the information to his or her class. Then the teacher would ask a few discussion questions. Sometimes suggestions for language arts projects or studio activities were included in the materials.

The picture study movement died out at the end of the 1920s as a result of new ideas regarding learning art appreciation through studio work became more popular in the United States.

==Since World War II==
Since [[World War II]], artist training has become the charge of colleges and universities and contemporary art has become an increasingly academic and intellectual field. Prior to World War II an artist did not need a college degree. Since that time the [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] and then the [[Master of Fine Arts]] became recommended degrees to be a professional artist, necessities facilitated by "the passage of the [[G.I. Bill]] in 1944, which sent a wave of World War II veterans off to school, art school included. University art departments quickly expanded. American artists who might once have studied at bohemian, craft-intensive schools like the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Lee Bontecou]], [[Al Held]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Donald Judd]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Cy Twombly]] and hundreds of others did or [[Black Mountain College]] as [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and others did or the [[Hans Hofmann]] School of Art in [[Greenwich Village]] whose students included [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Lee Krasner]] and [[Larry Rivers]] among others; began enrolling at universities instead. By the 60s, The [[School of Visual Arts]], [[Pratt Institute]], and [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and other art schools across the country like the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], and the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], as well as [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale]] had emerged as the leading American art academies; its alums included [[Roxy Paine]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Beverly Pepper]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[R.B. Kitaj]], [[Sylvia Plimack Mangold]], [[Elizabeth Peyton]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Peter Reginato]], [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Karen Finley]], [[Jason Rhoades]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Leon Golub]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Joan Jonas]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Michael Fried]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Jennifer Bartlett]], [[John Currin]], and [[Robert Mangold]], making it seem as if every hip artist in New York was obligated to have a college degree or an Ivy League degree".&lt;ref&gt;"How to Succeed in Art" by Deborah Solomon, New York Times Magazine. June 27, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This trend spread from the United States around the world.

Currently, the PhD in studio art is under debate as the new standard as the terminal degree in the arts. Although in 2008 there are only two United States programs offering a PhD in studio art, "10 universities offer the degree in Australia, and it is ubiquitous in the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and other countries. It is already expected for a teaching job in Malaysia".&lt;ref&gt;"Art Schools: A Group Crit," p. 108. Art In America, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As James Elkins, the chair of the department of art history, theory and criticism at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago as well as the chair of the department of art history at the University of Cork in Ireland wrote in [[Art in America]], "By the 1960s the MFA was ubiquitous. Now the MFA is commonplace and the PhD is coming to take its place as the baseline requirement for teaching jobs".&lt;ref&gt;"Art Schools: A Group Crit," p. 109. Art In America, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in reference to teaching positions for studio art at the college level.  The PhD has been a standard requirement to be a professor of art education for many years.  In his forthcoming book, ''Artists with PhD's'', [[James Elkins (art critic)]] presents the opinion the PhD will  become the new standard, and offers the book as a resource for assessing these programs and for structuring future programs. However, the College Art Association still recognizes the MFA as the terminal degree, stating "At this time, few institutions in the United States offer a PhD degree in studio art, and it does not appear to be a trend that will continue or grow, or that the PhD will replace the MFA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=College Art Association |url=http://www.collegeart.org/guidelines/mfa.html |title=Standards and Guidelines &amp;#124; College Art Association &amp;#124; CAA &amp;#124; Advancing the history, interpretation, and practice of the visual arts for over a century |work=Collegeart.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discipline-based art education in the early 1980s==
Discipline-based art education (DBAE) is an educational program formulated by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] in the early 1980s.  DBAE supports a diminished emphasis on studio instruction, and instead promotes education across four disciplines within the arts: aesthetics, [[art criticism]], art history and art production. It does retain a strong tie to studio instruction with an emphasis on technique.&lt;ref&gt;Neperud, Ronald W.  ''Context, Content and Community in Art Education'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the objectives of DBAE are to make arts education more parallel to other academic disciplines, and to create a standardized framework for evaluation.  It was developed specifically for grades K-12 but has been instituted at other levels of education.  DBAE advocates that art should be taught by certified teachers, and that "art education is for all students, not just those who demonstrate talent in making art".&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs, Stephen Mark.  ''Readings in Discipline Based Art Education'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of DBAE is voiced from postmodern theorists who advocate for a more pluralistic view of the arts, and inclusion of a diverse range of viewpoints that may not be included in a standardized curriculum.

== History of art education provisions ==
In the 1970s, provisions for arts in education were limited, at the discretion of individual states. Local schools, school boards, and districts were the main actors in deciding whether arts education was provided. Where art education was offered, it consisted of exposure-based experiences with cultural organizations outside of the school and was not integrated into classroom curriculum. In the next couple decades, budget cuts as a result of fiscal crises heavily stripped school budgets to the point where positions for art teachers were essentially eliminated in order to retain core subjects. At this time, arts was seen as nonessential to the development of critical thinking and there did not exist a standard curriculum for teaching art in public schools. As such, provisions were scarce if at all present in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.7249/mg702wf.9|title=Revitalizing Arts Education Through Community-Wide Coordination|date=2008|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833043061|editor-last=Bodilly|editor-first=Susan J.|edition=1|pages=9–24|editor-last2=Augustine|editor-first2=Catherine H.|editor-last3=Zakaras|editor-first3=Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the significance of an arts education emerged as data found academic performance improvements and socio-emotional and socio-cultural benefits, among other positive effects, stemming from the stimulative nature of the arts. Key players in advocating for and providing art education included a blend of public entities (school, government agencies, etc.), private organizations, and community centers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This emerging acknowledgement of the importance of art education was matched by a decline in provisions at the beginning of the 19th century. With the implementation of NCLB, public schools prioritized meeting Academic Performance Index (API) growth targets, downgrading the emphasis on non-core subjects. For example, in California public schools, while enrollment increased by 5.8% from 1999 to 2004, music education decreased by 50% in the same 5-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Music for All Foundation, 2004, ''The Sound of Silence – The Unprecedented Decline of Music Education in California Public Schools.'' Retrieved from https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/reports-and-data/legislation-policy/naappd/the-sound-of-silence-the-unprecedented-decline-of-music-education-in-california-public-schools-a&lt;/ref&gt; On a national level, data from the Surveys of Public Participation in the Arts (SPAAs) showed that in 2008, 18-24 year olds were less likely to have had an arts education than in 1982. Low-income and low-performing public schools disproportionately struggled with this decline, and African-American and Latino students are generally less able to access the arts when compared to their White counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Rabkin, N., &amp; Hedberg, E. C. (2011). ''Arts education in America: What the declines mean for arts participation.'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://arts.gov/publications/arts-education-america-what-declines-mean-arts-participation&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings of drastic declines in art education provisions spurred efforts for reinvestment. The NEA declared goals including maximizing investment impact, collaboration with local education across levels of government, and offering guidance and leadership support for art education.&lt;ref&gt;HUDSON, A. (2014). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=99624574&amp;site=eds-live A New Vision for Arts Education]. ''Education Digest'', ''80''(4), 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, funding for education in the United States comes from three levels; local level, state level and federal level. The whole system of education is kept in the hands of public sector for control and to avoid any mishandling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatisusa.info/education-in-usa/|title=Education in the U.S.|date=4 May 2013|accessdate=2012-01-01|publisher=What is USA News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] began awarding Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination grants to support organizations with art expertise in their development of artistic curricula that helps students to better understand and retain academic information. One such model of education was created in 2006 by the Storytellers Inc. and ArtsTech (formerly Pan-Educational Institute). The curricula and method of learning is titled AXIS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalaxis.org/ AXIS - Education Revolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== National organizations ==
The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is one of the many nationally recognized organizations promoting arts education in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/pub/ArtsLearning.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216181026/http://nea.gov/pub/ArtsLearning.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its formation in 1965, the NEA has led efforts in integrating the arts as a part of the core education for all K-12 students. These efforts include collaborating in state, federal, and public-private partnerships to solicit and provide funding and grants for programs in arts education. During the 2008 fiscal year, the NEA awarded over 200 grants totaling $6.7 million to programs that allow students to engage and participate in learning with skilled artists and teachers. The NEA has initiated a number of other arts education partnerships and initiatives, which include:

* The Arts Education Partnership (AEP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aep-arts.org Arts Education Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''AEP convenes forums to discuss topics in arts education, publishes research materials supporting the role of arts education in schools, and is a clearinghouse for arts education resource materials.''
* The Strategic National Arts Alumni Project (SNAAP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snaap.indiana.edu/ |title=SNAAP: Strategic National Arts Alumni Project &amp;#124; Learning about the lives and careers of art graduates in America |work=Snaap.indiana.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is ''an ongoing, online survey system will collect, track, and disseminate data on alumni, and will help institutions to better understand how students use arts training in their careers and other aspects of their lives.''
* The NEA Education Leaders Institute (ELI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|title=Request for Proposals, Education Leaders Institute, National Endowment for the Arts 
|url=http://www.nea.gov/grants/apply/RFP/RFP-ELI-6.pdf |accessdate=March 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225230514/http://www.nea.gov/grants/apply/RFP/RFP-ELI-6.pdf |archivedate=December 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''convenes key decision makers to enhance the quality and quantity of arts education at the state level.  Each institute gathers teams of school leaders, legislators, policymakers, educators, professional artists, consultants, and scholars from up to five states to discuss a shared arts education challenge and engage in strategic planning to advance arts education in their respective states.''

There are a variety of other National organizations promoting arts education in the United States.  These include [[Americans for the Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/artseducation Americans for the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; which features major projects such as The Arts. Ask For More.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsusa.org/Public_awareness ''Art. Ask For More.'']&lt;/ref&gt; national arts education public awareness campaign, Association for the Advancement of Arts Education, [[College Art Association]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org The College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[National Art Education Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naea-reston.org The National Art Education Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts integration==
{{Main|Arts integration}}
Arts integration is another and/or alternative way for the arts to be taught within schools.  Arts integration is the combining of the visual and/or performing arts and incorporating them into the everyday curriculum within classrooms. Learning in a variety of ways allows for students to use their eight multiple intelligences as described by theorist [[Howard Gardner]] in his ''Frames of Mind: Theory of Multiple Intelligences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28500715|title=Frames of mind : the theory of multiple intelligences|last=1943-|first=Gardner, Howard,|date=1993|publisher=Fontana|isbn=9780006862901|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=28500715}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eight [[Theory of multiple intelligences|multiple intelligences]] include bodily-kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, naturalist, and spatial.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, T. (2009) Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom.  Alexandria, Virginia:  ASCD.&lt;/ref&gt; Arts integration is especially important today when some schools no longer have or have small arts education programs due to significant budget cuts, including the federal budget agreement that took $12.5 million from the NEA, the United State's largest public arts funder, in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harsell|first=Dana Michael|date=2013|title=My Taxes Paid for That?! or Why the Past Is Prologue for Public Arts Funding|jstor=43284282|journal=PS: Political Science and Politics|volume=46|issue=1|pages=74–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chalk River Laboratories''' ({{lang-fr|Laboratoires de Chalk River}}; also known as '''CRL''', '''Chalk River Labs''' and formerly '''Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories''') is a Canadian [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] research facility in [[Deep River, Ontario|Deep River]], [[Renfrew County]], [[Ontario]], near [[Chalk River]], about {{cvt|180|km}} north-west of [[Ottawa]].

CRL is a site of major research and development to support and advance nuclear technology, in particular [[CANDU reactor]] technology. CRL has expertise in physics, metallurgy, chemistry, biology, and engineering and unique research facilities.

== History ==
[[File:NRX_Pile_Building_and_ZEEP_Building-_Cooling_Tanks_1945.jpg|thumb|right|NRX and Zeep buildings, Chalk River Laboratories, 1945]] The facility arose out of a 1942 collaboration between British and Canadian nuclear researchers which saw a [[Montreal Laboratory|Montreal research laboratory]] established under the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC).  By 1944 the Chalk River Laboratories were opened and in September, 1945 the facility saw the first nuclear reactor outside of the United States become operational (see [[Lew Kowarski]]).  In 1946, NRC closed the Montreal laboratory and focused its resources on Chalk River.

In 1952, [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) was created by the government to promote peaceful use of nuclear energy.  AECL also took over operation of Chalk River from the NRC.  Throughout the 1950s-2000s various nuclear research reactors have been operated by AECL for production of nuclear material for medical and scientific applications.  The Laboratories produce about one-third of the world's [[Nuclear medicine|medical isotopes]], and about half of the North American supply. Despite the declaration of peaceful use, from 1955 to 1976, Chalk River facilities supplied about 250&amp;nbsp;kg of [[plutonium]], in the form of spent reactor fuel, to the U.S. Department of Energy to be used in the production of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;letter from Dept. of Energy official, March 4, 1996, published at {{cite web |url=http://www.ccnr.org/DOE.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628205542/http://www.ccnr.org/DOE.html |archivedate=2008-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The bomb dropped on [[Nagasaki]], Japan, used about 6.4&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium.)

Canada's first [[nuclear power plant]], a partnership between AECL and [[Ontario Hydro|Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario]], went online in 1962 near the site of Chalk River Laboratories. This reactor, [[Nuclear Power Demonstration]] (NPD), was a demonstration of the [[CANDU reactor]] design, one of the world's safest and most successful nuclear reactors.

The Deep River [[neutron monitor]] operated once in Chalk river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cr0.izmiran.ru/dprv/baseinfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129081714/http://cr0.izmiran.ru/dprv/baseinfo.htm |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1952 NRX incident===
Chalk River was also the site of two nuclear accidents in the 1950s. The first incident occurred in 1952, when there was a [[Criticality accident|power excursion]] and partial loss of coolant in the [[NRX]] reactor, which resulted in significant damage to the core. The control rods could not be lowered into the core because of mechanical problems and human errors. Three rods did not reach their destination and were taken out again by accident. The fuel rods were overheated, resulting in a meltdown. The reactor and the reactor building were seriously damaged by hydrogen explosions. The seal of the reactor vessel was blown up four feet. In the cellar of the building, some 4,500 tons of radioactive water was found. This water was dumped in ditches around 1600 meters from the border of the [[Ottawa River]]. During this accident some 10,000 [[curies]] or 370 TBq of radioactive material was released.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Nuclear Society'' (1989) [http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/nrx.html The NRX Incident by Peter Jedicke]&lt;/ref&gt; Future [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Jimmy Carter]], then a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] officer, was part of the cleanup crew.&lt;ref name="paulson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html|title=Reactor Accidents: The Human Fallout|author=|date=|website=www.ccnr.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923232909/http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html|archivedate=23 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html|title=Jimmy Carter timeline|author=|date=|website=pbs.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329152940/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html|archivedate=29 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the reactor was in use again.&lt;ref name="CNF1952"&gt;{{en icon}} ''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRX reactor in 1952?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958 NRU incident===
The second accident, in 1958, involved a fuel rupture and fire in the [[National Research Universal reactor]] (NRU) reactor building. Some fuel rods were overheated. With a robotic crane, one of the rods with metallic [[uranium]] was pulled out of the reactor vessel. When the arm of the crane moved away from the vessel, the uranium caught fire and the rod broke. The largest part of the rod fell down into the containment vessel, still burning. The whole building was contaminated. The valves of the ventilation system were opened, and a large area outside the building was contaminated. The fire was extinguished by scientists and maintenance men in protective clothing running along the hole in the containment vessel with buckets of wet sand, throwing the sand down at the moment they passed the smoking entrance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both accidents required a major cleanup effort involving many civilian and military personnel.  Follow-up health monitoring of these workers has not revealed any adverse impacts from the two accidents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }} What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x|title=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ - Section D: Safety and Liability|author=|date=|website=www.nuclearfaq.ca|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006022038/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Anti-nuclear movement in Canada#Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility|Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility]], an [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] watchdog group, notes that some cleanup workers who were part of the military contingent assigned to the NRU reactor building unsuccessfully applied for a military disability pension due to health damages.&lt;ref name="paulson"/&gt;

Chalk River Laboratories remain an AECL facility to this day and are used as both a research (in partnership with the NRC) and production facility (on behalf of AECL) in support of other Canadian electrical utilities.

=== 2007 shutdown ===
On November 18, 2007, the NRU, which makes medical radioisotopes, was shut down for routine maintenance. This shutdown was extended when AECL, in consultation with the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC), decided to connect seismically-qualified emergency power supplies (EPS) to two of the reactor's cooling pumps (in addition to the AC and DC backup power systems already in place), which had been required as part of its August 2006 operating licence issued by the CNSC.  This resulted in a worldwide shortage of radioisotopes for medical treatments because Chalk River makes the majority of the world's supply of medical radioisotopes, including two-thirds of the world's [[technetium-99m]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402220916/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 2007, the [[House of Commons of Canada]], acting on independent expert advice, passed emergency legislation authorizing the restarting of the NRU reactor and its operation for 120 days (counter to the decision of the CNSC), which was passed by the Senate and received [[Royal Assent]] on December 12. Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] criticized the CNSC for this shutdown which "jeopardized the health and safety of tens of thousands of Canadians", insisting that there was no risk, contrary to the testimony of then CNSC President &amp; CEO Linda Keen. She would later be fired for ignoring a decision by Parliament to restart the reactor, reflecting its policy that the safety of citizens requiring essential [[nuclear medicine]] should be taken into account in assessing the overall safety concerns of the reactor's operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/ |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403090931/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/ |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last=Ljunggren |first=David |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 |title=Canadian parliament orders isotope reactor restart |journal=Reuters |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603180453/http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 |archivedate=2009-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sunday, May 5, 2013 3:49 PM EDT Facebook Twitter RSS |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 |title=Much more at stake than medical isotopes &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002154837/http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html |title=Chalk River plant to begin making radioisotopes in a week - Canada - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926071822/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Citizen |first=Ottawa |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=c70b1f37-7efe-46c1-a165-8b0efd4dfcaa |title=Harper government fires Linda Keen over isotope crisis |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110071829/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=c70b1f37-7efe-46c1-a165-8b0efd4dfcaa |archivedate=2012-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NRU reactor was restarted on December 16, 2007.

===2008 radioactive leakage===
On December 5, 2008, [[heavy water]] containing tritium leaked from the NRU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/issues/memo_re_december_2008.cfm |title=Current Issues - CNSC Report to Minister of Natural Resources regarding recent events at National Research Universal (NRU) Reactor |publisher=Cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222055045/http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/issues/memo_re_december_2008.cfm |archivedate=2013-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaked water was contained within the facility, and the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC) was notified immediately, as required.

In its formal report to the CNSC, filed on December 9, 2008 (when the volume of leakage was determined to meet the requirement for such a report) [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|AECL]] mentioned that 47 litres of heavy water were released from the reactor, about 10% of which evaporated and the rest contained, but affirmed that the spill was not serious and did not present a threat to public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090127/radioactive_spill_090127/20090127?hub=Canada&amp;s_name= |title=Agency says it was told of nuke leak within hours &amp;#124; CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604012750/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090127/radioactive_spill_090127/20090127?hub=Canada&amp;s_name= |archivedate=2009-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount that evaporated to the atmosphere is considered to be minor, accounting for less than a thousandth of the regulatory limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aecl.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=971 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615020303/http://www.aecl.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=971 |archivedate=2009-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The public was informed of the shutdown at the reactor, but not the details of the leakage since it was not deemed to pose a risk to the public or environment.  The leak stopped before the source could be identified, and the reactor was restarted on December 11, 2008 with the approval of the CNSC, after a strategy for dealing with the leak (should it reappear) was put in place.

In an unrelated incident, the same reactor had been leaking 7,001 litres of light water per day from a crack in a weld of the reactor's reflector system.  This water has been systematically collected, purified in an on-site Waste Treatment Centre, and eventually released to the Ottawa River in accordance with CNSC, Health Canada, and Ministry of the Environment regulations.  Although the leakage is not a concern to the CNSC from a health, safety or environmental perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/releases/news_release.cfm?news_release_id=332 |title=News Releases |publisher=Cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229170842/http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/releases/news_release.cfm?news_release_id=332 |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; AECL has plans for a repair to reduce the current leakage rate for operational reasons.

===2009 NRU reactor shutdown===
{{Main|National Research Universal reactor#2009 Shutdown|l1=National Research Universal reactor&amp;nbsp;— 2009 Shutdown}}
In mid-May 2009 the heavy water leak at the base of the NRU reactor vessel, first detected in 2008 (see above), returned at a greater rate and prompted another temporary shutdown that lasted until August 2010.  The lengthy shutdown was necessary to first completely defuel the entire reactor, then ascertain the full extent of the corrosion to the vessel, and finally to effect the repairs&amp;nbsp;— all with remote and restricted access from a minimum distance of 8 metres due to the residual radioactive fields in the reactor vessel. The 2009 shutdown occurred at a time when only one of the other four worldwide regular medical isotope sourcing reactors was producing, resulting in a worldwide shortage. {{citation-needed|date=December 2016}}

==NRU shutdown in March 2018==
The NRU reactor licence expired in 2016, however the licence was extended to March 31 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-relic-of-canada-s-atom-age-the-nru-reactor-is-shutting-down-for-good-1.4595836|title=Canada's NRU reactor in Chalk River is being turned off for good  - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409162437/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-relic-of-canada-s-atom-age-the-nru-reactor-is-shutting-down-for-good-1.4595836|archivedate=9 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2138">In [[astrophysics]], the '''Darwin–Radau equation''' gives an approximate relation between the [[moment of inertia factor]] of a planetary body and its rotational speed and shape.  The moment of inertia factor is directly related to the largest principal [[moment of inertia]], ''C''.  It is assumed that the rotating body is in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] and is an [[ellipsoid of revolution]].

'''Rev. Fr. Donat Spiteri''' was (born October 13, 1922 in [[Marsa, Malta]] - December 18, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fr DONAT SPITERI|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111220/social/Announcements.399200#.Uo3cYdKsjLQ|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=Times of Malta|date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to Spiridione and Antonia née Cassar 
 
Feeling that he was called to be a friar, he joined the [[Franciscan Order]] and was ordained on March 13, 1948. He furthered his studies at the Gregorian Pontificial University in Rome where he did his Licence in [[Theology]] (Dogmatics). He also studied the Holy Scriptures at Pontificio Istituto Bibblico in Rome where he did his licence in the Holy Scripture. He returned to Malta in 1954 and was given the responsibility of teaching young Capuchin students.
 
Between 1958 and 1967 he was parish priest of the [[Holy Trinity]] Church in Marsa. Throughout those years he was instrumental in the construction of the parochial centre St. Pius X. Between 1983 and 1991, again he was asked to serve as a parish priest of [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060202/http://schoolnet.gov.mt/sangwannparish/history.html Our Lady of Lourdes] in [[San Gwann]].  Throughout the years he served in San Gwann, he again felt the need to gather the lay movements under one roof. Thus, the parochial centre San Guzepp came to be. He found time also to restore the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190609/http://www.vol.net.mt/sangwannpc/margaretinfo.htm Sta. Margherita chapel] - which now houses the Holy Sepulchre for daily adoration. 
 
From 1966 to 1988, he was lecturer and Professor of [[Biblical Studies]] at the Faculty of Theology at the [[University of Malta]] where together with Prof. Karm Sant and others set up the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070329110217/http://www.maltabible.com/ Malta Bible Society], of which he was President. The main achievement of this Society was the publication of the [[Holy Bible]] in [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. The translation commenced in 1966 and continued until it was published in 1984. Since then, the Bible was revised yet again, taking another five years.  Hence, the second edition was published in 1996. As the teaching and interpretation of the Bible were and still are his life's mission, he was instrumental in opening ''Dar il-Bibbja'' in [[Floriana]] as a Bible Centre.
 
Fr. Donat Spiteri is also the [[author]] of a numerous number of [http://www.frdonatspiteri.com/publications.html books] of theological and biblical themes, of which ''il-Ktieb tas-Salmi'' (Book of Psalms), ''Dizzjunarju Bibbliku'' (Bible Dictionary), ''Temi Teologici'' (Theological Themes), ''l-Evangelji ta' San Mattew u San Luqa'' (The Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke),  ''il-Ktieb ta' l-Atti ta' l-Appostli'' (The Book of the Acts of the Apostles) and many others are being published by the Malta Bible Society. He also was a regular contributor in articles to the local press and various religious magazines such as ''Dawl Frangiskan'', besides lecturing and explaining the Holy Bible on the local media. He also toured various parishes in [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]] where he gave Biblical courses.

In 1974 Fr. Donat felt the need to spread further Bible reading into the Maltese households. Thus, he launched the small booklet Kliem il-Hajja (the Word of Life) which has become synonymous with him.  This booklet is issued every quarter and helps and simplifies the daily reading of the Bible.  He was the editor since its origin and today is the Director General.  Today, this booklet finds its way in many homes throughout Malta and Gozo - and also amongst our Maltese emigrants abroad. It is worth mentioning that over 20,000 Kliem il-Hajja booklets are distributed thanks to the many volunteers.  On the 30th Anniversary of this publication,  he inaugurated a Kliem il-Hajja office and library inside the Capuchins Friary at Floriana, Malta where most of this booklet is prepared.  All those interested in Biblical studies have now another place where to study the Bible more in depth, besides going through the many works of Fr. Donat Spiteri.

Fr. Donat Spiteri was honoured with the ''Gieh il-Marsa'' and ''Gieh San Gwann'' by the respective Local Councils as appreciation for his service to their community.

On 13 December, 2009 Fr. Donat Spiteri was awarded the ''[[Midalja għall-Qadi tar-Repubblika]]'' (Medal for Service to the Republic) by the President of Malta Dr George Abela, on behalf of the Government and people of Malta.

Father Donat died at the Christus Sacerdos Home for Elderly Priests at Fleur-de-Lys, on December 19, 2011, aged 89.

[[File:Rat coming out cage.jpg|thumb|300px| A rodent is not stimulated by the environment in a wire cage, and this affects its brain negatively, particularly the complexity of its synaptic connections]]
'''Environmental enrichment''' is the stimulation of the [[brain]] by its physical and social surroundings. Brains in richer, more stimulating environments have higher rates of [[synaptogenesis]] and more complex [[dendrites|dendrite arbors]], leading to increased brain activity. This effect takes place primarily during [[neurodevelopment]], but also during adulthood  to a lesser degree. With extra [[synapses]] there is also increased synapse activity, leading to an increased size and number of [[glia]]l energy-support cells. Environmental enrichment also enhances [[capillary]] vasculation, providing the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The [[neuropil]] (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands, thickening the cortex. Research on rodent brains suggests that environmental enrichment may also lead to an increased rate of [[neurogenesis]].

Research on animals finds that environmental enrichment could aid the treatment and recovery of numerous brain-related dysfunctions, including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and those connected to [[aging]], whereas a lack of stimulation might impair cognitive development. Moreover, this research also suggests that environmental enrichment leads to a greater level of [[cognitive reserve]], the brain's resilience to the effects of conditions such as [[aging]] and [[dementia]].

Research on humans suggests that lack of stimulation delays and impairs cognitive development. Research also finds that attaining and engaging in higher levels of education, environments in which people participate in more challenging cognitively stimulating activities, results in greater cognitive reserve.

== Early research ==
[[Donald O. Hebb]] in 1947 found that rats raised as pets performed better on problem solving tests than rats raised in cages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hebb DO | title = The effects of early experience on problem solving at maturity | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 2 | pages = 306–7 | year = 1947 | doi = 10.1037/h0063667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His research, however, did not investigate the brain nor use standardized impoverished and enriched environments. Research doing this first was started in 1960 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by [[Mark Rosenzweig (psychologist)|Mark Rosenzweig]], who compared single rats in normal cages, and those placed in ones with toys, ladders, tunnels, running wheels in groups. This found that growing up in enriched environments affected enzyme [[cholinesterase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0045402 |vauthors=Krech D, Rosenzweig MR, Bennett EL | title = Effects of environmental complexity and training on brain chemistry | journal = J Comp Physiol Psychol | volume = 53 | pages = 509–19 |date=December 1960 | pmid = 13754181 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work led in 1962 to the discovery that environmental enrichment increased [[cerebral cortex]] volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0041137 |vauthors=Rosenzweig MR, Krech D, Bennett EL, Diamond MC | title = Effects of environmental complexity and training on brain chemistry and anatomy: a replication and extension | journal = J Comp Physiol Psychol | volume = 55 | pages = 429–37 |date=August 1962 | pmid = 14494091 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, it was found that this was due to increased cerebral cortex thickness and greater [[synapse]] and [[glial]] numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/2041161a0 |vauthors=Altman J, Das GD | title = Autoradiographic Examination of the Effects of Enriched Environment on the Rate of Glial Multiplication in the Adult Rat Brain | journal = Nature | volume = 204 | pages = 1161–3 |date=December 1964 | pmid = 14264369 | issue = 4964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiamondKrech"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/cne.901230110 |vauthors=Diamond MC, Krech D, Rosenzweig MR | title = The Effects of an Enriched Environment on the Histology of the Rat Cerebral Cortex | journal = J. Comp. Neurol. | volume = 123 | pages = 111–20 |date=August 1964 | pmid = 14199261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also starting around 1960, [[Harry Harlow]] studied the effects of [[maternal deprivation|maternal and social deprivation]] on [[rhesus monkey]] infants (a form of environmental stimulus deprivation). This established the importance of social stimulation for normal [[cognitive development|cognitive]] and emotional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harlow HF, Rowland GL, Griffin GA | title = The Effect of Total Social Deprivation on the Development of Monkey Behavior | journal = Psychiatr Res Rep Am Psychiatr Assoc | volume = 19 | pages = 116–35 |date=December 1964 | pmid = 14232649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dendrite complexity ===
Environmental enrichment affects the complexity and length of the [[dendrite]] arbors (upon which synapses form). Higher-order dendrite branch complexity is increased in enriched environments,&lt;ref name="Greenough" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.176.4042.1445 |vauthors=Volkmar FR, Greenough WT | title = Rearing complexity affects branching of dendrites in the visual cortex of the rat | journal = Science | volume = 176 | issue = 4042 | pages = 1445–7 |date=June 1972 | pmid = 5033647 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5033647 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as can the length, in young animals, of distal branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0163-1047(92)90937-Y |vauthors=Wallace CS, Kilman VL, Withers GS, Greenough WT | title = Increases in dendritic length in occipital cortex after 4 days of differential housing in weanling rats | journal = Behav.

* Capillaries are wider (4.35 μm compared to 4.15 μm in controls)&lt;ref name="Sirevaag" /&gt;
* Shorter distance exist between any part of the [[neuropil]] and a capillary (27.6 μm compared to 34.6 μm)&lt;ref name="Sirevaag" /&gt;
These energy related changes to the [[neuropil]] are responsible for increasing the volume of the cerebral cortex (the increase in synapse numbers contributes in itself hardly any extra volume).

=== Motor learning stimulation ===
Part of the effect of environmental enrichment is providing opportunities to acquire [[motor skills]]. Research upon “acrobatic” skill learning in the rat shows that it leads to increased synapse numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.14.5568 |vauthors=Black JE, Isaacs KR, Anderson BJ, Alcantara AA, Greenough WT | title = Learning causes synaptogenesis, whereas motor activity causes angiogenesis, in cerebellar cortex of adult rats | journal = Proc.

=== Maternal transmission ===
Environmental enrichment during [[pregnancy]] has effects upon the [[fetus]] such as accelerating its retinal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sale A, Cenni MC, Ciucci F, Putignano E, Chierzi S, Maffei L | title = Maternal Enrichment during Pregnancy Accelerates Retinal Development of the Fetus | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 11 | pages = e1160 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18000533 | pmc = 2063464 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0001160 | url = http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001160 | editor1-last = Reh | editor1-first = Thomas }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rehabilitation and resilience ==

Research in animals suggests that environmental enrichment aids in recovery from an array of neurological disorders and cognitive impairments. There are two mains areas of focus: neurological rehabilitation and [[cognitive reserve]], the brain's resistance to the effects of exposure to physical, natural, and social threats. Although most of these experiments used animal subjects, mainly rodents, researchers have pointed to the affected areas of animal brains to which human brains are most similar and used their findings as evidence to show that humans would have comparable reactions to enriched environments. The tests done on animals are thus meant to represent human simulations for the following list of conditions.

===Neurological rehabilitation===

====Autism====

A study conducted in 2011 led to the conclusion that environmental enrichment vastly improves the cognitive ability of children with [[autism]]. The study found that autistic children who receive olfactory and tactile stimulation along with exercises that stimulated other paried sensory modalities clinically improved by 42 percent while autistic children not receiving this treatment clinically improved by just 7 percent.&lt;ref name = Woo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woo CC, Leon M |title=Environmental Enrichment as an Effective Treatment for Autism: A Randomized Controlled Trial |journal=Behav Neurosci |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=487–97 |date=March 2011 |pmid=23688137 |doi=10.1037/a0033010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also showed that there was significant clinical improvement in autistic children exposed to enriched sensorimotor environments, and a vast majority of parents reported that their child's quality of life was much better with the treatment.&lt;ref name = Woo/&gt;  A second study confirmed its effectiveness.  The second study also found after 6 months of sensory enrichment therapy, 21% of the children who initially had been given an autism classification, using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, improved to the point that, although they remained on the autism spectrum, they no longer met the criteria for classic autism. None of the standard care controls reached an equivalent level of improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Woo, Cynthia C. |author2=Donnelly, Joseph H. |author3=Steinberg-Epstein, Robin |author4=Leon, Michael | title=Environmental enrichment as a therapy for autism: A clinical trial replication and extension |journal=Behavioral Neuroscience |pages= 412–422|date=Aug 2015 |pmid= 26052790|doi=10.1037/bne0000068 |volume=129 |issue=4 |pmc=4682896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy using the methodologies is titled Sensory Enrichment Therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20130605/sensory-focused-autism-therapy-shows-early-promise |title='Sensory-Focused' Autism Therapy Shows Early Promise |author=Mary Brophy Marcus |date=June 5, 2013 |website=webmd.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ksl.com/?sid=31896222&amp;nid=148&amp;title=autism-treatment-gives-utah-family-hope |title=Autism treatment gives Utah family hope |author=Nkoyo Iyamba |date=October 9, 2014 |website=ksl.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alzheimer's disease====

Through environmental enrichment, researchers were able to enhance and partially repair memory deficits in mice between ages of 2 to 7 months with characteristics of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Mice in enriched environments performed significantly better on object recognition tests and the [[Morris water navigation task|Morris Water Maze]] than they had when they were in standard environments. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment enhances visual and learning memory for those with Alzheimer's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Berardi N, Braschi C, Capsoni S, Cattaneo A, Maffei L |title=Environmental enrichment delays the onset of memory deficits and reduces neuropathological hallmarks in a mouse model of Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration |journal=J.

These findings reveal the preventive, and long-lasting effects of early life stimulating experience on Alzheimer-like pathology in mice and likely reflect the capacity of enriched environment to efficiently stimulate the [[cognitive reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verret L, Krezymon A, Halley H, Trouche S, Zerwas M, Lazouret M, Lassalle JM, Rampon C | title = Transient enriched housing before amyloidosis onset sustains cognitive improvement in Tg2576 mice | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 211–25 |date=Jan 2013 | pmid = 22727275 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012003004 | doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Huntington's disease====

Research has indicated that environmental enrichment can help relieve motor and psychiatric deficits caused by [[Huntington's disease]]. It also improves lost protein levels for those with the disease, and prevents striatal and hippocampal deficits in the BDNF, located in the hippocampus.&lt;ref name = Spires&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Spires TL, Grote HE, Varshney NK | title = Environmental enrichment rescues protein deficits in a mouse model of Huntington's disease, indicating a possible disease mechanism | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 24 | issue = 9 | pages = 2270–6 |date=March 2004 | pmid = 14999077 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1658-03.2004 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14999077 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have led researchers to suggest that environmental enrichment has a potential to be a possible form of therapy for those with Huntington's.&lt;ref name = Spires/&gt;

====Parkinson's disease====

Multiple studies have reported that environmental enrichment for adult mice helps relieve neuronal death, which is particularly beneficial to those with [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Faherty CJ, Raviie Shepherd K, Herasimtschuk A, Smeyne RJ | title = Environmental enrichment in adulthood eliminates neuronal death in experimental Parkinsonism | journal = Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. | volume = 134 | issue = 1 | pages = 170–9 |date=March 2005 | pmid = 15790541 | doi = 10.1016/j.molbrainres.2004.08.008 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169-328X(04)00403-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study shows that environmental enrichment particularly affects the [[nigrostriatal pathway]], which is important for managing [[dopamine]] and acetylcholine levels, critical for motor deficits.&lt;ref name = Goldberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=NR|author2=Fields, V |author3=Pflibsen, L |author4=Salvatore, MF |author5= Meshul, CK |title=Social enrichment attenuates nigrostriatal lesioning and reverses motor impairment in a progressive 1-methyl-2-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease.|journal=Neurobiology of Disease|date=March 2012|volume=45|issue=3|pages=1051–67|pmid=22198503|doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2011.12.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, it was found that environmental enrichment has beneficial effects for the social implications of Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name = Goldberg/&gt;

====Stroke====

Research done in animals has shown that subjects recovering in an enriched environment 15 days after having a [[stroke]] had significantly improved neurobehavioral function. In addition these same subjects showed greater capability of learning and larger infarct post-intervention than those who were not in an enriched environment. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment had a considerable beneficial effect on the learning and sensorimotor functions on animals post-stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Janssen H, Bernhardt J, Collier JM, Sena ES, McElduff P, Attia J, Pollack M, Howells DW, Nilsson M, Calford MB, Spratt NJ |title=An Enriched Environment Improves Sensorimotor Function Post-Ischemic Stroke|journal=Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair|date=12 September 2010|volume=24|issue=9|pages=802–813|doi=10.1177/1545968310372092|pmid=20834046}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study also found that environmental enrichment socially benefits patients recovering from stroke. Researchers in that study concluded that stroke patients in enriched environments in assisted-care facilities are much more likely to be engaging with other patients during normal social hours instead of being alone or sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Heidi|author2=Ada, Louise |author3=Bernhardt, Julie |author4=McElduff, Patrick |author5=Pollack, Michael |author6=Nilsson, Michael |author7= Spratt, Neil J. |title=An enriched environment increases activity in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation in a mixed rehabilitation unit: a pilot non-randomized controlled trial|journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|date=29 April 2013|pages=1–8|doi=10.3109/09638288.2013.788218|pmid=23627534 |volume=36 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rett syndrome====

A 2008 study found that environmental enrichment was significant in aiding recovery of motor coordination and some recovery of BDNF levels in female mice with conditions similar to those of [[Rett syndrome]]. Over the course of 30 weeks female mice in enriched environments showed superior ability in motor coordination to those in standard conditions.&lt;ref name = Kondo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kondo M, Gray LJ, Pelka GJ, Christodoulou J, Tam PP, Hannan AJ | title = Environmental enrichment ameliorates a motor coordination deficit in a mouse model of Rett syndrome--Mecp2 gene dosage effects and BDNF expression | journal = Eur. J. Neurosci. | volume = 27 | issue = 12 | pages = 3342–50 |date=June 2008 | pmid = 18557922 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06305.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were unable to have full motor capability, they were able to prevent a more severe motor deficit by living in an enriched environment. These results combined with increased levels of BDNF in the cerebellum led researchers to conclude that an enriched environment that stimulates areas of the motor cortex and areas of the cerebellum having to do with motor learning is beneficial in aiding mice with Rett syndrome.&lt;ref name = Kondo/&gt;

====Amblyopia====

A recent study found that adult rats with [[amblyopia]] improved visual acuity two weeks after being placed into an enriched environment.&lt;ref name = Sale&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sale A, Maya Vetencourt JF, Medini P | title = Environmental enrichment in adulthood promotes amblyopia recovery through a reduction of intracortical inhibition | journal = Nat. Neurosci. | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 679–81 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17468749 | doi = 10.1038/nn1899 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study showed that another two weeks after ending environmental enrichment, the rats retained their visual acuity improvement. Conversely, rats in a standard environment showed no improvement in visual acuity. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment reduces GABA inhibition and increases BDNF expression in the visual cortex. As a result, the growth and development of neurons and synapses in the visual cortex were much improved due to the enriched environment.&lt;ref name = Sale/&gt;

====Sensory deprivation====

Studies have shown that with the help of environmental enrichment the effects of [[sensory deprivation]] can be corrected. For example, a visual impairment known as "dark-rearing" in the visual cortex can be prevented and rehabilitated. In general, an enriched environment will  improve, if not repair, the sensory systems animals possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01103.x |vauthors=Argandoña EG, Bengoetxea H, Lafuente JV | title = Physical exercise is required for environmental enrichment to offset the quantitative effects of dark-rearing on the S-100β astrocytic density in the rat visual cortex | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 215 | issue = 2 | pages = 132–140 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19500177 | pmc = 2740960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lead poisoning====

During development, [[gestation]] is one of the most critical periods for exposure to any lead. Exposure to high levels of lead at this time can lead to inferior spatial learning performance. Studies have shown that environmental enrichment can overturn damage to the hippocampus induced by [[lead poisoning|lead exposure]].&lt;ref name = Cao&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cao|first=Xiujing|author2=Huang, Shenghai |author3=Ruan, Diyun |title=Enriched environment restores impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and water maze performance induced by developmental lead exposure in rats|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|date=April 2008|volume=50|issue=3|pages=307–313|doi=10.1002/dev.20287|pmid=18335502}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Learning and spatial memory that are dependent on the long-term potentiation of the hippocampus are vastly improve as subjects in an enriched environments had lower levels of lead concentration in their hippocampi. The findings also showed that enriched environments result in some natural protection of lead-induced brain deficits.&lt;ref name = Cao/&gt;

====Chronic spinal cord injuries====

Research has indicated that animals suffering from [[spinal cord injuries]] showed significant improvement in motor capabilities even with a long delay in treatment after the injury when exposed to environmental enrichment.&lt;ref name = Fischer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fischer FR, Peduzzi JD | title = Functional Recovery in Rats With Chronic Spinal Cord Injuries After Exposure to an Enriched Environment | journal = J Spinal Cord Med | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–55 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17591227 | pmc = 2031947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social interactions, exercise, and novelty all play major roles in aiding the recovery of an injured subject. This has led to some suggestions that the spinal cord has a continued plasticity and all efforts must be made for enriched environments to stimulate this plasticity in order to aid recovery.&lt;ref name = Fischer/&gt;

====Maternal deprivation stress====

[[Maternal deprivation]] can be caused by the abandonment by a nurturing parent at a young age. In rodents or nonhuman primates, this leads to a higher vulnerability for
stress-related illness.&lt;ref name = Francis&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Francis DD, Diorio J, Plotsky PM, Meaney MJ | title = Environmental enrichment reverses the effects of maternal separation on stress reactivity | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 22 | issue = 18 | pages = 7840–3 |date=September 2002 | pmid = 12223535 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12223535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that environmental enrichment can reverse the effects of maternal separation on stress reactivity, possibly by affecting the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = Francis/&gt;

====Child neglect====

In all children, maternal care is one of the significant influences for hippocampal development, providing the foundation for stable and individualized learning and memory. However, this is not the case for those who have experienced [[child neglect]]. Researchers determined that through environmental enrichment, a neglected child can partially receive the same hippocampal development and stability, albeit not at the same level as that of the presence of a parent or guardian.&lt;ref name = Bredy&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0306-4522(02)00918-1 |vauthors=Bredy TW, Humpartzoomian RA, Cain DP, Meaney MJ | title = Partial reversal of the effect of maternal care on cognitive function through environmental enrichment | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 118 | issue = 2 | pages = 571–6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12699791 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306452202009181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were comparable to those of child intervention programs, rendering environmental enrichment a useful method for dealing with child neglect.&lt;ref name = Bredy/&gt;{{failed verification|I do not have access to full article, but it describes a study with rats, in which the effects of being raised by mothers with low licking/grooming behavior were reversed through environmental enrichment at the behavioral level but not at the physiological level.|date=January 2014}}

=== Cognitive reserve ===

====Aging====

Decreased hippocampal neurogenesis is a characteristic of [[aging]]. Environmental enrichment increases neurogenesis in aged rodents by potentiating neuronal differentiation and new cell survival.&lt;ref name = Kumar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Speisman|first=RB|author2=Kumar, A |author3=Rani, A |author4=Pastoriza, JM |author5=Severance, JE |author6=Foster, TC |author7= Ormerod, BK |title=Environmental enrichment restores neurogenesis and rapid acquisition in aged rats.|journal=Neurobiology of Aging|date=January 2013|volume=34|issue=1|pages=263–74|pmid=22795793|doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.05.023 |pmc=3480541}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, subjects exposed to environmental enrichment aged better due to superior ability in retaining their levels of spatial and learning memory.&lt;ref name = Kumar/&gt;

====Prenatal and perinatal cocaine exposure====

Research has shown that mice exposed to environmental enrichment are less affected by the consequences of [[Cocaine#Effects in pregnancy and nursing|cocaine exposure]] in comparison with those in standard environments. Although the levels of dopamine in the brains of both sets of mice were relatively similar, when both subjects were exposed to the cocaine injection, mice in enriched environment were significantly less responsive than those in standard environments.&lt;ref name = Solinas&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Solinas M, Thiriet N, El Rawas R, Lardeux V, Jaber M | title = Environmental enrichment during early stages of life reduces the behavioral, neurochemical, and molecular effects of cocaine | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 1102–11 |date=April 2009 | pmid = 18463628 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2008.51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thus concluded that both the activating and rewarding effects are suppressed by environmental enrichment and early exposure to environmental enrichment can help prevent [[drug addiction]].&lt;ref name = Solinas/&gt;

== Humans ==

Though environmental enrichment research has been mostly done upon rodents, similar effects occur in primates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kozorovitskiy Y, Gross CG, Kopil C | title = Experience induces structural and biochemical changes in the adult primate brain | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 102 | issue = 48 | pages = 17478–82 |date=November 2005 | pmid = 16299105 | pmc = 1297690 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0508817102 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16299105 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are likely to affect the human brain. However, direct research upon human synapses and their numbers is limited since this requires [[histological]] study of the brain. A link, however, has been found between educational level and greater dendritic branch complexity following autopsy removal of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobs B, Schall M, Scheibel AB | title = A quantitative dendritic analysis of Wernicke's area in humans. II. Gender, hemispheric, and environmental factors | journal = J. Comp. Neurol. | volume = 327 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–111 |date=January 1993 | pmid = 8432910 | doi = 10.1002/cne.903270108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Localized cerebral cortex changes ===
MRI detects localized [[cerebral cortex]] expansion after people learn complex tasks such as mirror reading (in this case in the right [[occipital cortex]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ilg R, Wohlschläger AM, Gaser C | title = Gray matter increase induced by practice correlates with task-specific activation: a combined functional and morphometric magnetic resonance imaging study | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 28 | issue = 16 | pages = 4210–5 |date=April 2008 | pmid = 18417700 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5722-07.2008 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18417700 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; three-ball juggling (bilateral mid-[[Temporal lobe|temporal]] area and left posterior [[intraparietal sulcus]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Draganski B, Gaser C, Busch V, Schuierer G, Bogdahn U, May A | title = Neuroplasticity: changes in grey matter induced by training | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972 | pages = 311–2 |date=January 2004 | pmid = 14737157 | doi = 10.1038/427311a }}&lt;/ref&gt; and when medical students intensively revise for exams (bilaterally in the posterior and lateral [[parietal cortex]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Draganski B, Gaser C, Kempermann G | title = Temporal and spatial dynamics of brain structure changes during extensive learning | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 26 | issue = 23 | pages = 6314–7 |date=June 2006 | pmid = 16763039 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4628-05.2006 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16763039 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such changes in gray matter volume can be expected to link to changes in synapse numbers due to the increased numbers of glial cells and the expanded capillary vascularization needed to support their increased energy consumption.

=== Institutional deprivation ===
Children that receive impoverished stimulation due to being confined to cots without social interaction or reliable caretakers in low quality [[orphanages]] show severe delays in cognitive and social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1994.tb01220.x |vauthors=Kaler SR, Freeman BJ | title = Analysis of environmental deprivation: cognitive and social development in Romanian orphans | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 769–81 |date=May 1994 | pmid = 7518826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 12% of them if adopted after 6 months of age show autistic or mildly autistic traits later at four years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rutter M, Andersen-Wood L, Beckett C | title = Quasi-autistic patterns following severe early global privation. English and Romanian Adoptees (ERA) Study Team | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 537–49 |date=May 1999 | pmid = 10357161 | doi = 10.1017/S0021963099003935 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children in such impoverished orphanages at two and half years of age still fail to produce intelligible words, though a year of foster care enabled such children to catch up in their language in most respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Windsor J, Glaze LE, Koga SF | title = Language acquisition with limited input: Romanian institution and foster care | journal = J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. | volume = 50 | issue = 5 | pages = 1365–81 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17905917 | doi = 10.1044/1092-4388(2007/095) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catch-up in other cognitive functioning also occurs after adoption, though problems continue in many children if this happens after the age of 6 months&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beckett C, Maughan B, Rutter M | title = Do the effects of early severe deprivation on cognition persist into early adolescence? Findings from the English and Romanian adoptees study | journal = Child Dev | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 696–711 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16686796 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00898.x |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such children show marked differences in their brains, consistent with research upon experiment animals, compared to children from normally stimulating environments. They have reduced brain activity in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex|orbital prefrontal cortex]], [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]], [[temporal cortex]], and [[brain stem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chugani HT, Behen ME, Muzik O, Juhász C, Nagy F, Chugani DC | title = Local brain functional activity following early deprivation: a study of postinstitutionalized Romanian orphans | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 1290–301 |date=December 2001 | pmid = 11707085 | doi = 10.1006/nimg.2001.0917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also showed less developed [[white matter]] connections between different areas in their cerebral cortices, particularly the [[uncinate fasciculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eluvathingal TJ, Chugani HT, Behen ME | title = Abnormal brain connectivity in children after early severe socioemotional deprivation: a diffusion tensor imaging study | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 2093–100 |date=June 2006 | pmid = 16740852 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2005-1727 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, enriching the experience of [[Premature birth|preterm infants]] with [[massage]] quickens the maturating of their [[EEG|electroencephalographic]] activity and their [[visual acuity]]. Moreover, as with enrichment in experimental animals, this associates with an increase in [[IGF-1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guzzetta A, Baldini S, Bancale A | title = Massage accelerates brain development and the maturation of visual function | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 6042–51 |date=May 2009 | pmid = 19420271 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5548-08.2009 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19420271 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive reserve and resilience ===
Another source of evidence for the effect of environment stimulation upon the human brain is [[cognitive reserve]] (a measure of the brain’s resilience to cognitive impairment) and the level of a person’s education. Not only is higher education linked to a more cognitively demanding educational experience, but it also correlates with a person’s general engagement in cognitively demanding activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1076/jcen.25.5.634.14572 |vauthors=Wilson R, Barnes L, Bennett D | title = Assessment of lifetime participation in cognitively stimulating activities | journal = J Clin Exp Neuropsychol | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 634–42 |date=August 2003 | pmid = 12815501 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more education a person has received, the less the effects of aging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corral M, Rodríguez M, Amenedo E, Sánchez JL, Díaz F | title = Cognitive reserve, age, and neuropsychological performance in healthy participants | journal = Dev Neuropsychol | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–91 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16671863 | doi = 10.1207/s15326942dn2903_6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fritsch T, McClendon MJ, Smyth KA, Lerner AJ, Friedland RP, Larsen JD | title = Cognitive functioning in healthy aging: the role of reserve and lifestyle factors early in life | journal = Gerontologist | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–22 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17565095 | doi = 10.1093/geront/47.3.307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; dementia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall CB, Derby C, LeValley A, Katz MJ, Verghese J, Lipton RB | title = Education delays accelerated decline on a memory test in persons who develop dementia | journal = Neurology | volume = 69 | issue = 17 | pages = 1657–64 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17954781 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000278163.82636.30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; white matter hyperintensities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nebes RD, Meltzer CC, Whyte EM | title = The relation of white matter hyperintensities to cognitive performance in the normal old: education matters | journal = Neuropsychol Dev Cogn B Aging Neuropsychol Cogn | volume = 13 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 326–40 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16887777 | doi = 10.1080/138255890969294 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; MRI-defined brain infarcts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elkins JS, Longstreth WT, Manolio TA, Newman AB, Bhadelia RA, Johnston SC | title = Education and the cognitive decline associated with MRI-defined brain infarct | journal = Neurology | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 435–40 |date=August 2006 | pmid = 16894104 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000228246.89109.98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alzheimer's disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koepsell TD, Kurland BF, Harel O, Johnson EA, Zhou XH, Kukull WA | title = Education, cognitive function, and severity of neuropathology in Alzheimer disease | journal = Neurology | volume = 70 | issue = 19 Pt 2 | pages = 1732–9 |date=May 2008 | pmid = 18160675 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000284603.85621.aa }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roe CM, Mintun MA, D'Angelo G, Xiong C, Grant EA, Morris JC | title = Alzheimer's and Cognitive Reserve: Education Effect Varies with 11CPIB Uptake | journal = Arch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">A '''floating signifier''' (also known as an '''empty signifier''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Reference Overview: floating signifier|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095824238}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] without a [[referent]] in [[semiotics]] and [[discourse analysis]], such as a word that points to no actual object and has no agreed upon meaning.

==Definition==

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] originated this term,&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, "Introduction à l'oeuvre de Marcel Mauss" in ''Mauss, Sociologie et Anthropologie'', Paris, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; where he identifies terms like ''[[mana]]'' (magical mystical substance of which the magic is formed), or ''oomph'' (American slang term for flavor in the figurative sense)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/oomph | title= ''Oomph'' definition | publisher= Thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "to represent an undetermined quantity of signification, in itself void of meaning and thus apt to receive any meaning".  Daniel Chandler defines the term as "a signifier with a vague, highly variable, unspecifiable or non-existent signified".&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem02a.html | last= Chandler | first= Daniel | title= Semiotics for Beginners | publisher= aber.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such a "floating signifier" may "mean different things to different people: they may stand for many or even any signifieds; they may mean whatever their interpreters want them to mean". Such a floating signifier—which is said to possess "symbolic value zero"—necessarily results to "allow symbolic thought to operate despite the contradiction inherent in it".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Mehlman, ''The "Floating Signifier": From Lévi-Strauss to Lacan'', Yale French Studies, No. 48, '''French Freud: Structural Studies in Psychoanalysis'''. (1972), pp. 10–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In Emancipation(s), Ernesto Laclau frames empty signifier a context of social interactions. For Laclau, empty signifier is the hegemonic representative of a collection of various demands, constituting a chain of equivalence whose members are distinguished through a differential logic (as in elements exist only in their differences to one another) but combine through an equivalential one. This chain of unsatisfied demands create an unfulfilled totality, inside of which one signifier subordinates the rest and assumes representation of the rest via a hegemonic process.

==Uses and examples==

The notion of floating signifiers can be applied to concepts such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://caffeinesparks.blogspot.com/2007/08/race-floating-signifier.html | title= Race: a Floating Signifier? Stuart Hall speech | publisher= caffeine_sparks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gender]], as a way of asserting that the word is more concrete than the concept it describes, where the concept may not be stable, but the word is. It is often applied to [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|non-linguistic signs]], such as the example of the [[Rorschach inkblot test]]. [[Roland Barthes]], while not using the term "floating signifier" explicitly, referred specifically to non-linguistic signs as being so open to interpretation that they constituted a "floating chain of signifieds."&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt; For example, the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] is at once a signifier of the geographical nation it represents, of patriotism to that nation, of the nation's set of governmental policies, and/or of the ideologies associated with it, such as [[liberty]]. Depending on the context, the flag can carry either positive ''or'' negative significance.

The concept is used in some more textual forms of [[postmodernism]], which rejects the strict anchoring of particular signifiers to particular signifieds and argues against the concept that there are any ultimate determinable meanings to words or signs. For example, [[Jacques Derrida]] speaks of the "freeplay" of signifiers: arguing that they are not fixed to their signifieds but point beyond themselves to other signifiers in an "indefinite referral of signifier to signified."&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;

'''Front-End Engineering (FEE)''', or '''Front-End Engineering Design (FEED)''', is an engineering design approach used to control project expenses and thoroughly plan a project before a fix bid quote is submitted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epcengineer.com/definition/556/feed-front-end-engineering-design&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be referred to as Pre-project planning (PPP), [[Front-end loading|front-end loading (FEL)]], feasibility analysis, or early project planning.

==Overview==
The FEE is basic engineering which comes after the [[Engineering design process|Conceptual design]] or [[Engineering design process|Feasibility study]]. The FEE design focuses the technical requirements as well as rough investment cost for the project. The FEE can be divided into separate packages covering different portions of the project. The FEE package is used as the basis for bidding the Execution Phase Contracts (EPC, EPCI, etc) and is used as the design basis.

A good FEE will reflect all of the client's project-specific requirements and avoid significant changes during the execution phase. FEE contracts usually take around 1 year to complete for larger-sized projects. During the FEE phase there is close communication between Project Owners and Operators and the Engineering Contractor to work up the project-specific requirements.

Front-End Engineering focuses on technical requirements and identifying main costs for a proposed project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epicpackaginglines.com/lineevaluation/line-evaluation/&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to establish a price for the execution phase of the project and evaluate potential risks. It is typically followed by [[Engineering design process|Detailed Design]] (or Detailed Engineering).  The amount of time invested in Front-End Engineering is higher than a traditional quote, because project specifications are thoroughly extracted and the following typically developed in detail:

* Project Organization Chart
* Project Scope
:* Defined [[Civil engineering|civil]], [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[Chemical engineering|chemical]] engineering
:* [[Hazard and operability study|HAZOP]], safety and ergonomic studies
:* 2D &amp; 3D preliminary models
:* Equipment layout and installation plan
:* Engineering design package development
:* Major equipment list
:* [[Automation]] strategy
* Process Flow Diagrams 
* Project timeline
* Fixed-bid quote

Traditionally, all of these documents would be developed in detail during a design review after a quote has been agreed to. A company using FEE will develop these materials before submitting a quote.

Front-end engineering is typically used by design/build engineering firms. These firms may operate in various industries including:
* [[Automation]]
* Chemical processing
* Construction
* EPC
* Equipment design
* [[Manufacturing]]
* [[Pharmaceuticals]]
* [[Petrochemicals]]
* Process system design
* Production line design
* [[Refining]]
* [[Machine Vision]]

==FEE Methodology==
FEE Methodology:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asee.org/documents/sections/middle-atlantic/fall-2010/01-Teaching-Front-End-Engineering-Design-FEED.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
FEE is a way of looking at a project before completing detailed design. There is no set way to conduct a Front-End Engineering study. Generally, FEE requires an engineer or a group of engineers to thoroughly and logically consider a proposed project. Example considerations may include:
* '''Degree of automation''' – depending on the application being considered, automation may or may not be appropriate. Determining the amount of automation in the project will help determine equipment, labor costs, layout, and design. 
* '''Rates and levels''' – to hit a certain rate or level of, for example, production, a certain amount of equipment, materials, and automation may be required. Determining key rates and parameters will have great effect on overall project costs and timeline
* '''Material specifications''' – Not all materials work well together, or can withstand the physical application. A basic engineering discipline is determining materials of construction, material compatibility etc. 
* '''Standards and guidelines''' – every industry has standards and guidelines, and many industries are regulated. Any equipment, production facilities, manufacturing lines etc. developed for these industries must meet these standards and regulations and can have major impact on costs/time to project completion
* '''Assumptions, Exclusions, and potential problems:''' FEE seeks to identify potential problems, assumptions or exclusions that could affect the project during execution. Identifying these during the front-end planning stage so they can be accounted for is the goal of FEE.
Feed also includes the outline and stages of Expansions to happen in future, although the timeline is not specifically stated for such expansions. In such cases, the plot area allocated for expansion at certain stage is usually not transgressed.

'''FutureGen''' is a project (now suspended) to demonstrate [[carbon capture and storage|capture and sequestration]] of waste carbon dioxide from a coal-fired electrical generating station. The project (renamed FutureGen 2.0) was retrofitting a shuttered coal-fired power plant in [[Meredosia, Illinois]], with [[Oxy-fuel combustion process|oxy-combustion]] generators.  The waste CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would be piped approximately {{convert|30|mi}} to be sequestered in underground saline formations. FutureGen was a partnership between the [[United States government]] and an alliance of primarily coal-related corporations. Costs were estimated at US$1.65&amp;nbsp;billion, with $1.0&amp;nbsp;billion provided by the Federal Government.&lt;ref name="TechRev15Sept2014"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/530661/construction-begins-at-a-carbon-capture-plant-but-will-it-ever-be-completed/ | title=Construction Begins at a Carbon-Capture Plant, but Will It Ever Be Completed? | journal=MIT Technology Review |date=15 September 2014 |last=Talbot | first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MITCCST"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/futuregen.html | title=FutureGen Fact Sheet: Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Project | publisher=MIT Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program | accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FGAFAQ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://futuregenalliance.org/faqs/ | title=FAQs | publisher=FutureGen Alliance | accessdate=25 October 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102052620/http://futuregenalliance.org/faqs/ | archivedate=2 November 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First announced by President [[George W. Bush]] in 2003, construction started in 2014 after restructuring, canceling, relocating, and restarting.&lt;ref name="TechRev15Sept2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRSHistory"/&gt; Citing an inability to commit and spend the funds by deadlines in 2015, the Department of Energy withdrew funds and suspended FutureGen 2.0 in February, 2015. The government also cited the Alliance's inability to raise the requisite amount of private funding.&lt;ref name="bloombergsuspend"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bna.com/doe-suspends-billion-n17179922773/ | title=DOE Suspends $1 Billion in FutureGen Funds, Killing Carbon Capture Demonstration Project | work=Energy and Climate Report | date=4 February 2015 | agency=Bloomberg BNA | accessdate=10 February 2015 | last=Natter | first=Ari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FutureGen 2.0 would have been the most comprehensive Department of Energy Carbon Capture and Storage demonstration project, involving all phases from combustion to sequestration.&lt;ref name="CRSHistory"/&gt; FutureGen's initial plan involved [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] technology to produce both electricity and hydrogen. Early in the project it was to be sited in Mattoon, IL.&lt;ref name="CRSHistory"&gt;{{cite report|last1=Folger|first1=Peter|title=The FutureGen Carbon Capture and Sequestration Project: A Brief History and Issues for Congress|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43028.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=10 Feb 2014|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original project==
The original incarnation of FutureGen was as a public-private partnership to build the world's first near zero-emissions coal-fueled power plant. The 275-[[megawatt]] plant would be intended to prove the feasibility of producing electricity and hydrogen from coal while capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide underground. The Alliance intended to build the plant in [[Mattoon Township, Coles County, Illinois]] northwest of Mattoon, Illinois, subject to necessary approvals (issuing a “Record of Decision”) by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) as part of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuregenalliance.org/about.stm FutureGen - About FutureGen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202233448/http://www.futuregenalliance.org/about.stm |date=2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FutureGen was to be designed, developed and operated by the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a non-profit consortium of coal mining and electric utility companies formed to partner with the DOE on the FutureGen project. The project was still in the development stage when its funding was cancelled in January 2008. The Alliance decision of the location of the host site, subject to DOE's completing NEPA environmental reviews, was announced in December 2007 after a two-year bidding and review process. Construction was scheduled to begin in 2009, with full-scale plant operations to begin in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.futuregenalliance.org/publications/fg_factsheet_7_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216073139/http://www.futuregenalliance.org/publications/fg_factsheet_7_final.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimated gross project cost, including construction and operations, and excluding offsetting revenue, was $1.65 billion.&lt;ref name="sequestration.mit.edu"&gt;http://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/futuregen.html&lt;/ref&gt; The project was governed by a legally binding cooperative agreement between DOE and the Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;DOE Cooperative Agreement # DE-FC26-06NT42073:  FutureGen - A Sequestration and Hydrogen Research Initiative&lt;/ref&gt; Under the agreement, DOE was to provide 74% of the project’s cost, with private industry contributing the other 26%. The DOE also planned to solicit the financial support and participation of international governments in the FutureGen project, since by 2020 more than 60% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions are expected to come from developing countries. Foreign financial support was to offset a portion of DOE’s cost-share. As of January 2008, the foreign governments of [[China]], India, Australia, South Korea, and Japan had expressed interest in participating and sharing the cost of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuregenalliance.org/costs.stm FutureGen - FutureGen Project Costs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513164454/http://www.futuregenalliance.org/costs.stm |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FutureGen was to sequester carbon dioxide emissions at a rate of one million [[metric ton]]s per year for four years, which is the scale a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) report cites as appropriate for proving sequestration. The MIT report also states that “the priority objective with respect to coal should be the successful large-scale demonstration of the technical, economic, and environmental performance of the technologies that make up all of the major components of a large-scale integrated [[Carbon capture and storage|CCS]] system — capture, transportation and storage.”&lt;ref&gt;The Future of Coal, http://web.mit.edu/coal/The_Future_of_Coal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An injection field test similar to this was done in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seed.slb.com/en/scictr/watch/climate_change/sleipner.htm Sleipner—A Carbon Dioxide Capture-and-Storage Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101151123/http://www.seed.slb.com/en/scictr/watch/climate_change/sleipner.htm |date=2006-11-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V2S-4CC7RP3-V&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2004&amp;_alid=509250811&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_qd=1&amp;_cdi=5710&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=eae16bc99d60c2aff71a07a8f5a8b9f1 Monitoring of CO2 injected at Sleipner using time-lapse seismic data].&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009 [[Washington Post]] reported that U.S. Secretary of Energy [[Steven Chu]] expressed support for continuing the project using stimulus funds (after some changes that have not yet been specified) and making it a part of a larger portfolio of research plants developed in collaboration with other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Following the successful completion of the first phase, in February 2013, the Energy Department announced the beginning of Phase II of the project development with a new cooperative agreement between the FutureGen Industrial Alliance and the Department of Energy. This means that the FutureGen project has government support as it moves into its third phase, deployment of the project.&lt;ref name="sequestration.mit.edu"/&gt;

===Site selection===
[[Site selection]] for the FutureGen facility was based on a competitive process which began in May 2006. Seven states responded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Keith |last=Benman |title=FutureGen not in near future for Indiana |url=http://www.thetimesonline.com/articles/2004/03/10/business/business/f5e87b5fd54a377186256e52007c6430.txt |work=The Times |location=Munster, IN |date=2004-03-10 |accessdate=2007-12-18 }} (Bids by states to host FutureGen)&lt;/ref&gt; to the Site Request for Proposals with a total of 12 proposals. Proposals were reviewed against a set of environmental, technical, regulatory, and financial criteria with input from external technical advisors on power plant design and [[carbon sequestration]]. In July 2006, four candidate sites were selected for further review, including an environmental impact analysis as required by NEPA.

DOE issued its Final [[Environmental impact statement]] (EIS) on November 8, 2007, which concluded that all four sites were acceptable from an environmental impact standpoint and all would move forward in the site evaluation process.  EPA published a Notice of Availability (NOA) for the EIS in the Federal Register on November 16, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eh.doe.gov/nepa/na/64618.pdf Federal Register, Vol. 72, No. 221] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216073055/http://www.eh.doe.gov/nepa/na/64618.pdf |date=2008-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOE is required by federal law to wait at least 30 days after the NOA release before issuing its final Record of Decision (ROD).  The waiting period legally closed on December 17, 2007.  DOE chose not to issue the ROD and advised the FutureGen Alliance to delay the final site selection announcement, which was scheduled to occur at the end of the 30-day waiting period. The Alliance chose to move ahead with the announcement, citing time, money, and a commitment to proposers to select the final site by year-end. "Every month of delay can add $10 million to the project's cost, solely due to inflation," said Michael Mudd, the Alliance's chief executive. &lt;center&gt;

(PDF) 12.1 MB.

===Technology===
Original FutureGen project was intended to combine and test several new technologies in a single location, including [[Coal#Gasification|coal gasification]], emissions controls, [[hydrogen production]], electricity generation, and [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon dioxide capture and storage]] (CCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.futuregenalliance.org/technology.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101033603/http://www.futuregenalliance.org/technology.stm |archivedate=2008-01-01 |df= }} FutureGen Technology Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle]] (IGCC) was the core technology behind FutureGen. IGCC power plants use two turbines – a gas and a steam turbine – to produce electric power more efficiently than pulverized coal plants. IGCC plants also make it easier to capture carbon dioxide for carbon sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.futuregenalliance.org/technology/coal.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113072754/http://www.futuregenalliance.org/technology/coal.stm |archivedate=2008-01-13 |df= }} Coal Gassification&lt;/ref&gt;

FutureGen was to capture carbon dioxide produced during the gasification process and pump it into deep rock formations thousands of feet under ground. FutureGen specifically targeted rock formations containing saline water, as these are one of the most abundant types of geologic formations that can be used to store carbon dioxide worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.futuregenalliance.org/technology/carbon.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112193255/http://www.futuregenalliance.org/technology/carbon.stm |archivedate=2008-01-12 |df= }} Carbon Sequestration&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Global Energy Technology Strategy Program estimates the storage capacity of these saline rock formations in the U.S. to be 2,970 gigatons of carbon dioxide, compared to a capacity of 77 gigatons of carbon dioxide for all other types of reservoirs, such as depleted gas fields.&lt;ref&gt;“Carbon Dioxide Capture and Geologic Storage: A Core Element of A Global Energy Technology Strategy To Address Climate Change, p. 26. {{cite web |url=http://www.pnl.gov/gtsp/docs/gtsp_reportfinal_2006.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216073055/http://www.pnl.gov/gtsp/docs/gtsp_reportfinal_2006.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on rock formations with saline water was intended to help ensure that the lessons learned from the project are broadly transferable throughout the U.S. and around the world.

===Challenges===
Maintaining the project schedule and keeping costs down were two major challenges with which the DOE and the FutureGen Alliance grappled. The project had remained on schedule with the announcement of the host site before the end of 2007; however, a desire by DOE to restructure the project’s financial arrangement has brought the project to a halt.

In December 2007, the DOE Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy James Slutz stated that projected cost overruns for the project "require a reassessment of FutureGen's design."  And that "This will require restructuring FutureGen to maximize the role of private-sector innovation, facilitate the most productive public-private partnership, and prevent further cost escalation."&lt;ref name="Illinois wins, official warned"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fowler | first = Tom | title = Illinois wins coal project, and along with it a tussle / Official warned against announcing winning town in $1.8 billion project | work = Houston Chronicle | date = 2007-12-18 | url = http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2007_4480471 | accessdate = 2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FutureGen Alliance wrote a letter to the Department of Energy’s Under Secretary C.H. “Bud” Albright Jr. stating that overall inflation and the rising cost of raw materials and engineering services are driving costs up on energy projects around the world. According to [[James L. Connaughton]], chairman of the White House [[Council on Environmental Quality]], the market for steel, concrete and power plant components has “just gone through the roof globally”, and much of the reason is the construction of hundreds of new conventional coal plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

On January 11, 2008, the FutureGen Alliance sent a letter to the DOE offering to lower the government's portion of the project's costs.  The initial plans had called for DOE to pay based on a percentage of the total cost, and their portion had risen from about $620 million to about $1.33 billion.

[[Risk management]] was a significant portion of the cost of the first FutureGen experimental implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/futuregen/EIS/FG%20Risk%20Assessment%20110807.pdf Final Risk Assessment Report for the FutureGen Project Environmental Impact Statement], U.S. Department of Energy, October 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; FutureGen involved many complex never-before-solved technology problems. The risks also included significant health risks, if the untested-technology systems failed to work correctly.

===Funding cancellation===
On January 29, 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that it would pull its funding for the project, mostly due to higher than expected costs. The move is likely to delay the project as other members seek the additional funds that the DOE was to provide. The sudden concern over cost after an Illinois site was chosen over those in Texas raised questions about the motives for the cancellation. Local and state officials in Illinois, including then Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]], expressed frustration at the move, especially in light of the money and resources that the state had spent to attract the project. Democratic Senator [[Dick Durbin]] of Illinois accused Energy Secretary [[Samuel Bodman]] of "cruel deception" of Illinoisans by "creating false hope in a FutureGen project which he has no intention of funding or supporting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In March 2009, Congressional auditors determined that the DOE had miscalculated the government portion of the project's cost, overstating the amount by a half billion dollars.  As a result, the Bush administration cited the project as having nearly doubled in cost when, in reality, it had increased by 39%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Secretary Bodman stated that with restructuring the FutureGen project, DOE plans "to equip multiple new clean-coal power plants with advanced CCS technology, instead of one demonstration plant.

In November 2008, Fred Palmer, senior vice president at [[Peabody Energy]] shared his outlook on FutureGen with the [[American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity]] (ACCCE), saying that the FutureGen Alliance would "Make a concerted effort in the Obama administration to reinstate the project and get this built as originally planned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2008/11/no-matter-what-youve-heard-futuregen-is-alive.html | title=No matter what you’ve heard, FutureGen is alive | publisher=AmericasPower.org | work=Behind the Plug (blog) | date=2008-11-21 | accessdate=23 October 2014 | author=Lucas, Joe | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916125401/http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2008/11/no-matter-what-youve-heard-futuregen-is-alive.html | archivedate=16 September 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2009, the DOE announced a restart of design work for the FutureGen project.&lt;ref name="doe12june2009"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Secretary Chu Announces Agreement on FutureGen Project in Mattoon, IL |date=June 12, 2009 |url=http://energy.gov/articles/secretary-chu-announces-agreement-futuregen-project-mattoon-il |publisher=US Dept. of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Following the completion of the detailed cost estimate and fundraising activities," the press release states, "the Department of Energy and the FutureGen Alliance will make a decision either to move forward or to discontinue the project early in 2010."

===Revised project: FutureGen 2.0===
On August 5, 2010, the DOE announced a retooling of the FutureGen project, dubbed FutureGen 2.0.&lt;ref name="doe05aug2010"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Secretary Chu Announces FutureGen 2.0 |date=August 5, 2010 |url=http://energy.gov/articles/secretary-chu-announces-futuregen-20 |publisher=US Dept. of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The revised plan includes retrofitting a shuttered coal-fired power plant in [[Meredosia, Illinois]] to demonstrate advanced oxy-combustion technology, and piping the carbon dioxide 175 miles to Mattoon for underground storage.  Due to these changes, leaders in Mattoon decided to drop out of the FutureGen project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kacich | first = Tom | title = Coles County says 'no' to FutureGen | work = Champaign News-Gazette | date = 2010-08-11 | url = http://www.news-gazette.com/news/environment/2010-08-11/coles-county-says-no-futuregen.html | accessdate = 2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Illinois sites vying for the underground storage portion of the project were in Christian, Douglas, Fayette, and Morgan counties, after sites in Adams and Pike counties were cut in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = FutureGen narrows potential carbon sites to 4 | work = Associated Press | date = 2010-12-20 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-20/futuregen-narrows-potential-carbon-sites-to-4.html | accessdate = 2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2011, [[Morgan County, Illinois|Morgan County]] was chosen for the sequestration site.

In Sept, 2014 FutureGen received the first-ever EPA permits for four class VI carbon dioxide sequestration wells in Morgan County, with plans to store 1.1 million metric tons per year for 20 years.&lt;ref name="stl02sept2014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/epa-approves-futuregen-plan-for-carbon-dioxide-storage/article_3a5a3b42-0de6-5621-8e60-dd446b50244b.html | title=EPA approves FutureGen plan for carbon dioxide storage | work=St. Louis Post Dispatch | date=2014-09-02 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="epafuturegen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/r5water/uic/futuregen/ | title=FutureGen Alliance 2.0 Permit Application | publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2014 FutureGen survived a lawsuit from Illinois Electric utility ComEd, which challenged the state's ability to impose a surcharge on all customers to pay for FutureGen electricity.&lt;ref name="ccb22july14"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140722/NEWS11/140729953/court-victory-gives-futuregen-a-green-light-comed-challenge-rejected | title=Court victory gives FutureGen a green light; ComEd challenge rejected | work=Crain's Chicago Business | date=2014-07-22 | accessdate=23 October 2014 | last=Daniels | first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics, including the Illinois Policy Institute, the plan presents major environmental and fiscal pitfalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illinoispolicy.org/blog/blog.asp?ArticleSource%3D4580 |accessdate=December 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426062333/http://illinoispolicy.org/blog/blog.asp?ArticleSource=4580 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sjr20dec2011"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sj-r.com/top-stories/x1658263682/Group-calls-for-pulling-the-plug-on-FutureGen | title=Group calls for pulling the plug on FutureGen | work=State Journal-Register | date=2011-12-20 | accessdate=23 October 2014 | location=Springfield, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FutureGen 2.0 funding cancellation===
The Department of Energy ordered suspension of FutureGen 2.0 in February, 2015. The funds, appropriated by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], needed to be committed by July 1 and spent by Sept 30, 2015. The government also cited the Alliance's inability to raise the requisite amount of private funding. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz explained at a press conference “If you look between now and July 1, without them having closed their financing, and try as we might, we just don’t see how it gets over the finish line.” At the time of suspension the power plant part of the project had spent $116.5 million and the sequestration part had spent $86 million.&lt;ref name="bloombergsuspend"/&gt;

[[File:MOAB grid fins.jpg|thumb|Closeup of [[GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb|MOAB]] grid fins]]
'''Grid fins''' (or '''lattice fins''') are a type of [[flight control surfaces|flight control surface]] used on [[rocket|rockets]] and [[bomb]]s, sometimes in place of more conventional control surfaces, such as planar [[fin]]s. They have been used since the 1970s in various [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[ballistic missile]] designs such as the [[SS-12 Scaleboard|SS-12 ''Scaleboard'']], [[SS-20|SS-20 ''Saber'']], [[OTR-21 Tochka|SS-21 ''Scarab'']], [[SS-23|SS-23 ''Spider'']], and [[SS-25|SS-25 ''Sickle'']], as well as the [[N1 rocket|N-1]] (the intended rocket for the [[Soviet Moonshot|Soviet moon program]]).

In Russia, they are often referred to as ''{{lang|ru-Latn|Belotserkovskiy}}'' grid fins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaloga |first=Steve |authorlink= |title=The Scud and Other Russian Ballistic Missile Vehicles |year=2000 |publisher=Concord Publications Co |location=New Territories, Hong Kong |isbn=962-361-675-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after Russian computational [[mechanician]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Sergey Belotserkovskiy|ru|3=Белоцерковский, Сергей Михайлович}} (also known as an advisor of [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s aerospace engineering thesis, where grid fins were examined too&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/10523 {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who developed them in the 1950s.

Grid fins have been used on conventional missiles and bombs such as the [[Vympel R-77]] air-to-air missile; the [[3M-54 Klub]] (SS-N-27 Sizzler) family of [[cruise missile]]s; and the American [[GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb|Massive Ordnance Air Blast]] (MOAB) large-yield conventional bomb. They have also been used on specialized devices such as the [[RQ-7 Shadow#Quick-MEDS|Quick-MEDS]] delivery system and as part of the [[launch escape system]] for the [[Soyuz spacecraft]].

In 2014, [[SpaceX]] tested grid fins on a first-stage [[F9R Dev1|demonstration test vehicle]] of its reusable [[Falcon 9 v1.1|Falcon 9]] rocket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= [[SpaceX]] |title= F9R 1000m Fin Flight &amp;#124; Onboard Cam and Wide Shot|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgLBIdVg3EM |via=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=21 June 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on December 21, 2015 they were used during the high-velocity atmospheric portion of the [[atmospheric entry|reentry]]&lt;!-- SpaceX uses multiple systems, of which the grid fins are only one; the grid fins do not work outside the atmosphere, and they are also unneeded during the reentry burn of the first stage engines when the rocket angle of entry is easily controlled by the thrust vector --&gt; to help guide a commercial Falcon 9 first stage back to land for the first successful orbital booster landing in spaceflight history.

==Design characteristics==
Conventional planar control fins are shaped like miniature [[wing]]s. By contrast, grid fins are a lattice of smaller aerodynamic surfaces arranged within a box. Their appearance has sometimes led them to be compared to [[potato masher]]s or [[waffle iron]]s.

Grid fins can be folded, pitched forward (or backwards), against the cylindrical body of a missile more directly and compactly than planar fins, allowing for more compact storage of the weapon; this is of importance where weapons are launched from a tube or for craft which store weapons in internal bays, such as [[stealth aircraft]].  Generally, the grid fins pitch forward/backward away from the body shortly after the missile has cleared the firing craft.

Grid fins have a much shorter [[chord (aircraft)|chord]] (the distance between leading and trailing edge of the surface) than planar fins, as they are effectively a group of short fins mounted parallel to one another.  Their reduced chord reduces the amount of [[torque]] exerted on the steering mechanism by high-speed airflow, allowing for the use of smaller fin [[actuators]], and a smaller tail assembly overall.

Grid fins perform very well at subsonic and supersonic speeds, but poorly at [[transonic]] speeds; the flow causes a [[normal shock]]wave to form within the lattice, causing much of the airflow to pass completely around the fin instead of through it and generating significant [[wave drag]]. At high [[Mach number]]s, grid fins flow fully supersonic and can provide lower [[drag (physics)|drag]] and greater maneuverability than planar fins.

== Application in reusable launch vehicles ==
[[File:Falcon 9 preparing to launch DSCOVR (16822013226).jpg|thumb|upright|Initial design aluminum grid fins on the [[Falcon 9]] [[launch vehicle]], undeployed. February 2015.]]
[[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9#Falcon 9-R|Falcon 9-R]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaceflight101.net/spacex---f9r-development-updates.html&lt;/ref&gt; — Grid fins are being used for increased precision in control of the landing location for [[reusable launch vehicle]]s.  The grid fin [[new product development|development effort]] is a part of the [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program]] that has been underway since 2012. The first [[hypersonic velocity|hypersonic]]&lt;!-- low-altitude subsonic vehicle with grid fins had been tested in 2014. --&gt; [[flight test]] with grid fins was in February 2015, and grid fins were subsequently used on all reusable Falcon 9 experimental test landings and, eventually, after December 2015, an increasing number of successful first stage landings and recoveries.

Iteration on the design of the Falcon 9 grid fins continued into 2017. SpaceX CEO [[Elon Musk]] announced in early 2017 that a new version of the Falcon 9 grid fins would improve reusability for the company's vehicles. Falcon 9 Block 5/Version 2.5 will introduce new cast and cut &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/878821062326198272&lt;/ref&gt; [[titanium]] grid fins. Musk had noted the original Falcon 9 grid fins were made from [[aluminum]].  The fins experience temperatures near their maximum survivability limits during [[atmospheric entry|reentry]] and landing, and so the aluminum fins were coated with an ablative thermal protection system. In fact, some aluminum grid fins have actually caught fire during the entry and landing sequence. The new titanium grid fins should introduce greater controllability to the rocket and increase the payload to orbit capability by allowing Falcon 9 to fly at a higher [[angle of attack]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/03/spacex-new-spaceflight-successful-core-reuse/&lt;/ref&gt;
The larger and more robust titanium grid fins are left unpainted and were first tested in June 2017.  They are used on all reusable Block 5 Falcon 9 first stages since late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/06/spacex-falcon-9-iridium-next-2-launch/ https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/06/spacex-falcon-9-iridium-next-2-launch/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guild of Romanists''' or '''Confrérie van romanisten''' was a society which was active in [[Antwerp]] from the late 16th to the late 18th century. It was made up of notables and [[artist]]s of Antwerp who had visited [[Rome]] and offered artists access to the networks of Antwerp's urban elites.&lt;ref name=lux&gt;Rengenier C. Rittersma, ''Luxury in the Low Countries: Miscellaneous Reflections on Netherlandish Material Culture, 1500 to the Present'', Asp / Vubpress / Upa, 2010, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Confrérie was established in 1572 in Antwerp's [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] under the patronage of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] and was therefore also known as the 'Broederschap van de HH. Petrus en Paulus' (Confrérie of St. Peter and Paul).  It was a condition of membership to have visited [[Rome]].  The condition of having visited Rome to enjoy membership appears to have been strictly enforced and art historians accept membership of the Confrérie as evidence of visits to Rome that are (in the case of Fyt etc.) otherwise undocumented.

The membership included [[Canon (priest)|canons]], prosperous merchants, members of the local nobility, aldermen and leading artists.  Total membership was capped at 25 members, which accentuated the exclusive character of the society.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  Deans of the Confrérie were appointed annually. 
[[File:Rubens apostel paulus grt.jpg|thumb|Saint Paul by Rubens]]

After 1680 the Confrérie went into decline.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  The Confrérie moved in 1681 for financial reasons to Antwerp's St George's Church and remained dormant for a few decades.  It was revived in 1716 when the 'true and approved' relics of St. Peter and Paul were delivered to St George's Church by a Roman cardinal.  The Confrérie was finally abolished in 1785 under the rule of the Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]].

A Magistrate Book (1576), the "LIBER CONFRATERNITATIS SANCTORUM PETRI ET PAULI EN ROMA' is kept in the State Archives.&lt;ref&gt;Antwerpen, Sint-Joriskerk – De broederschappen actief in de kerk
Centrum - Mechels Plein, 2000 Antwerpen, at the site of topa.be {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The diversity of the membership offered artists a good opportunity to meet with potential patrons.&lt;ref name=Tim&gt;Bert Timmermans. ''Patronen van patronage in het zeventiende-eeuwse Antwerpen: een elite als actor binnen een kunstwereld'', Amsterdam University Press, Antwerp, 2008, pp. 243-245&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar social mediation role was played by the [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] and in particular the [[Violieren]], which was the chamber of rhetoric of the Antwerp [[Guild of Saint Luke]].   Membership assisted artists further in raising their profile and prestige in society at large as well as among their fellow artists since only renowned artists were invited to join.

The non-artist members relied on membership of the Confrérie to consolidate their social standing since many of the artist members enjoyed an international reputation.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The social role of the Confrérie was facilitated through the institution of an annual gastronomic dinner (the '(h)eerlyck maeltyt'), with excellent wines and copious servings of food.  The dinner was hosted at different locations.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The Confrérie further allowed "'art-pilgrims' to keep themselves up to date on news from Rome, whether it be on new painters or paintings, or newly discovered antiquities".&lt;ref&gt;David Jaffé (ed), ''Rubens, A Master in the Making'', The National Gallery Company/Yale, p. 11 London 2005, {{ISBN|1-85709-326-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11755">In the field of [[pedagogy]], '''learning by teaching''' (German: ''Lernen durch Lehren'', short '''LdL''') is a method of teaching in which students are made to learn material and prepare [[lesson]]s to teach it to the other students. There is a strong emphasis on acquisition of [[life skills]] along with the subject matter. This method was originally defined by [[Jean-Pol Martin]] in the 1980s.

== Background ==
[[Image:Ldl-wortschatz.jpg|thumb|250px|Student teaching vocabulary]]
The method of having students teach other students has been present since antiquity.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heinrich |first1=Christian |title=Learning by Teaching: The Goal is Independence |url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/prj/sog/mud/en3913352.htm |work=Goethe-Institut |date=November 2007 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often this was due to lack of resources.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;  For example, the [[Monitorial System]] was an education method that became popular on a global scale during the early 19th century. It was developed in parallel by  Scotsman [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] who had worked in [[Madras]] and [[Joseph Lancaster]] who worked in London; each attempted to educate masses of poor children with scant resources by having older children teach younger children what they had already learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graves |first1=Frank Pierrepont |title=A Student's History of Education |date=1915 |publisher=Macmillan Company |pages=239ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPQTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA239 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic research into intentionally improving education, by having students learn by teaching began in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gartner |first1=Alan |last2=Kohler |first2=Mary Conway |last3=Riessman |first3=Frank |title=Children teach children; learning by teaching |date=1971 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=0-06-013553-0 |edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, [[Jean-Pol Martin]] systematically developed the concept of having students teach other in the context of learning [[French language|French]] as a [[foreign language]], and he gave it a theoretical background in numerous publications.&lt;ref name=Safiye/&gt;  The method was originally resisted, as the German educational system generally emphasized discipline and rote learning.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;  However the method became widely used in Germany in secondary education, and in the 1990s it was further formalized and began to be used in universities as well.&lt;ref name=Safiye&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Safiye |first1=Aslan, |title=Is Learning by Teaching Effective in Gaining 21st Century Skills? The Views of Pre-Service Science Teachers. |journal=Educational Sciences: Theory and Practice |date=October 5, 2015 |volume=15 |issue=6 |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?q=EJ1101263 |language=en |issn=1303-0485}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2008 Martin had retired, and although he remained active [[Joachim Grzega]] took the lead in developing and promulgating LdL.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPMabout&gt;{{cite web |title=About me |url=https://jeanpol.wordpress.com/about-me/ |publisher=Jean-Pol Martins Weblog |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=de-DE |date=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
[[File:Learning by teaching phases.png|thumb|left|LDL, modeled on the structure of the brain by Martin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kahl |first1=von Reinhard |title=Treibhäuser der Zukunft wie in Deutschland Schulen gelingen ; eine Dokumentation |date=2005 |publisher=Archiv der Zukunft [u.a.] |location=Berlin |isbn=3-407-85830-2 |edition= 2nd, überarb. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After preparation by the teacher, students become responsible for their own learning and teaching. The new material is divided into small units and student groups of not more than three people are formed.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;

Students are then encouraged to experiment to find ways to teach the material to the others. Along with ensuring that students learn the material, another goal of the method, is to teach students [[life skills]] like respect for other people, planning, problem solving, taking chances in public, and communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thimm |first1=Katja |title="Guten Morgen, liebe Zahlen" |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-23011324.html |work=Der Spiegel |date=1 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kahl |first1=Reinhard |title=Unterricht: Schüler als Lehrer |url=https://www.zeit.de/online/2008/43/schueler-lehrer |work=Zeit |date=October 22, 2008 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stollhans |first1=S. |editor1-last=Corradini |editor1-first=E. |editor2-last=Borthwick |editor2-first=K. |editor3-last=Gallagher-Brett |editor3-first=A. |title=Employability for languages: a handbook |date=2016 |publisher=Researchpublishing.net |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-908416-39-1 |pages=161–164 |chapter-url=https://dx.doi.org/10.14705/rpnet.2016.cbg2016.478 |chapter=Learning by teaching: developing transferable skills.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grzega |first1=Joachim |last2=Schöner |first2=Marion |title=The didactic model LdL (Lernen durch Lehren) as a way of preparing students for communication in a knowledge society |journal=Journal of Education for Teaching |date=4 July 2008 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=167–175 |doi=10.1080/02607470802212157}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The teacher remains actively involved, stepping in to further explain or provide support if the teaching-students falter or the learning-students do not seem to understand the material.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;

The method is distinct from [[tutoring]] in that LdL is done in class, supported by the teacher, and distinct from [[student teaching]], which is a part of [[teacher education]].&lt;ref name=Safiye/&gt;

== Plastic Platypus Learning ==
One way of learning by teaching, is the '''plastic platypus learning''' or '''platypus learning''' technique. This technique is based on evidence that show that teaching an inanimate object improves understanding and knowledge retention of a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/ | title=Learning by teaching others is extremely effective – a new study tested a key reason why| date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aslan |first1=Safiye |title=Is Learning by Teaching Effective in Gaining 21st Century Skills? The Views of Pre-Service Science Teachers |journal=Educational Sciences: Theory &amp; Practice |date=2015 |volume=15 |issue=6 |doi=10.12738/estp.2016.1.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bargh |first1=John A. |last2=Schul |first2=Yaacov |title=On the cognitive benefits of teaching. |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |date=1980 |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=593–604 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.72.5.593}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The advantage of this technique is that that the learner does not need the presence of another person in order to teach the subject.

The name 'plastic platypus learning' is a paraphrase on the known [[software engineering]] technique [[rubber duck debugging]], in which a programmer can find bugs in their code without the help of others, simply by explaining what the code does, line by line, to an inanimate object - namely, a rubber duck.

[[File:Plastic platypus learning cropped.jpg|thumb|Plastic platypus learning in action]]
To increase the effectiveness of plastic platypus learning, learners are advised to do the following:

1. Prepare notes while learning the subject.

2. Prepare the lesson on the subject (as opposed to just teaching it unprepared; this section demands the most time and energy, and may be omitted in some situations).

3. Teach the subject without using the notes at all (the student knows this beforehand).
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/acp.3410|title = The learning benefits of teaching: A retrieval practice hypothesis| journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology| volume=32| issue=3| pages=401–410|year = 2018|last1 = Koh|first1 = Aloysius Wei Lun| last2=Lee| first2=Sze Chi| last3=Lim| first3=Stephen Wee Hun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obviously, this technique may work with any inanimate object, and not just plastic platypuses.

[[File:Ligatures.jpg|thumb|Box and oblique '''ligatures''' (13th to 16th century); see [[#Usage|usage]], below]]
In [[music notation]], a '''ligature''' is a graphic symbol that tells a musician to perform two or more notes in a single gesture, and on a single syllable. It was primarily used from around 800 to 1650 AD. Ligatures are characteristic of [[neumatic]] (chant) and [[mensural notation|mensural]] notation. The notation and meaning of ligatures has changed significantly throughout Western music history, and their precise interpretation is a continuing subject of debate among [[List of musicologists|musicologists]].

==History==
===Plainchant===
{{main|Plainsong}}
{{main|Gregorian chant}}
The early notation of [[plainsong|plainchant]], particularly [[Gregorian chant]], used a series of shapes called [[neumes]], which served as reminders of music that was taught [[rote learning|by rote]] rather than as an exact record of which notes to sing.  Neumes were in use from the 9th through the 11th centuries AD for most plainsong, and differed by region.&lt;ref name="Apel"&gt;{{Citation|last = Apel | first = Willi | author-link = Willi Apel | publication-date = 1953 | title = The Notation of Polyphonic Music, 900–1600 | publication-place = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Medieval Academy of America | pages = 87–94 | isbn = 978-0-8400-0526-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2015}}&lt;!--In the passage in question, Apel is primarily discussing ligatures, which he says "developed from certain neumes ... such as were in use during the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries", but also says, "When (around 1150 [i.e., the middle of the twelfth century] ther neumes changed to the more definite forms of the so-called Roman chorale notation, these four signs took on the following shapes: [illustration]. These forms are still used today...". He says nothing about different regional styles, and the discussion of neumes is confined to p. 88.--&gt;  Due to their malleable nature, there were no hard and fast rules for the lengths each note was supposed to last, or even how high or low the intervals between notes were to be.

===''De mensurabili musica''===
{{main|Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)}}
A treatise on notation named ''De mensurabili musica'' was copied around 1260.  In this treatise, the anonymous author proposed that, much in the same way that poetry of the time was based on a series of [[Rhythmic_mode|modal rhythms]], music should also be set up in this way.  The notation of these [[rhythmic mode|modes]] was accomplished primarily through using ligatures in varying lengths and with varying degrees of complexity, where the rhythms would be derived from context.  For most of their notated history, this was the purpose of ligatures: to indicate the rhythmic mode.&lt;ref name="Apel"/&gt;

===Franco of Cologne===
{{main|Franco of Cologne}}
Around 1250, a music theorist named [[Franco of Cologne]] published a treatise on music entitled ''Ars cantus mensurabilis''.  In this treatise, Franco proposed that note values should be set up objectively, so that when looking at the notated music, a musician would be able to tell what notes were being sung or played, and the duration of those notes, with some degree of certainty.  Ligatures were used for this as well, as they had become more or less standardized through the practice of the rhythmic modes.

===Polyphonic music from c1300-c1600===
See [[mensural notation#Ligatures|mensural notation]] (ligatures).

==Usage==
[[image:Ligatures.jpg|thumb|right|Ligature values vary based on the shape of the ligature and whether it has a tail.]]
Ligatures have two basic shapes: ''box'' (rectangular) and ''oblique'' (angled).  Additionally, some ligatures have tails that either point up or down; the direction of the ligature's tail affects its meaning, unlike the direction of a tail on a modern note head.  While primarily contextual, the system of ligatures in use from the 13th to the 16th century is fairly standardized.  All ligatures of this period have the following principles in common:
*All ligature notes are either the length of a ''[[longa (music)|longa]]'' ("''L''"), a ''[[double whole note|breve]]'' ("''B''"), or a ''[[whole note|semibreve]]'' ("''S''").
*All ligatures have at least two notes.
*For ease of discussion, ligatures of different lengths have different names.  A ligature with two notes is called a ''binaria''; one with three notes, a ''ternaria''; one with four notes, a ''quaternaria''; and one with five notes, a ''quinaria''.  Larger ones are possible, but rare.
*If a ligature has three or more notes, all notes in the middle (the ''mediae'') are ''B''.
*A downward tail changes the value of the note where the tail occurs, either from ''L'' to ''B'' or, less commonly, from ''B'' to ''L''.
*An upward tail indicates that the next ''two'' notes are a series of ''S''.
*A tail at the end of a ligature indicates an additional note be sung or played, called a ''plica'', that is not part of the ligature.  Plicas were especially common with the rhythmic modes, to accommodate in practice what could not be accomplished within the very strict theoretical basis for modal music.&lt;ref name="Apel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godt"&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1093/earlyj/4.1.44 | last = Godt | first = Irving | publication-date = January 1976 | title = Reading Ligatures from Their Ground State | periodical = Early Music | publisher = Oxford University Press | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–45 | year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternate interpretations===

Most scholarship on ligatures is focused on period from the 13th to the 16th centuries.  Prior to this period, ligatures were far less standardized; a ''quaternaria'' ligature that, under the above rules, would mean a series like ''SSLB'' would simply mean ''BBBB''.&lt;ref name="Parrish"&gt;{{Citation | last = Parrish | first = Carl | publication-date = 1978 | title = The Notation of Medieval Music | publication-place = Hillsdale, NY | publisher = Pendragon Press | page = 70 | isbn = 978-0-918728-08-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcription==

In transcribing old works to modern notation, where no compound graphs as ligatures exist, editors usually indicate by a hook, a bracket (brace), or (less often in polyphonic music) a [[slur (music)|slur]]/[[phrase mark]] those notes that the original combined into a ligature.  To avoid confusion, many scores transcribed purely for performance do not include additional notation to indicate that a particular note originally belonged to a ligature, as most methods to show this have separate meanings in a performance capacity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8929">A '''lighting control system''' is an intelligent network based lighting control solution that incorporates communication between various system inputs and outputs related to lighting control with the use of one or more central computing devices.  Lighting control systems are widely used on  both indoor and outdoor lighting of commercial, industrial, and residential spaces. Lighting control systems serve to provide the right amount of light where and when it is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DiLouie|first=Craig|title=Lighting controls handbook|year=2008|publisher=Fairmont Press [u.a.]|location=Lilburn, Ga. [u.a.]|isbn=1-4200-6921-7|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lighting control systems are employed to maximize the [[energy conservation|energy savings]] from the lighting system, satisfy [[building codes]], or comply with [[green building]] and [[energy conservation]] programs.  Lighting control systems are often referred to under the term [[Smart Lighting]].

== Lighting controls==
The term ''lighting controls'' is typically used to indicate stand-alone control of the lighting within a space. This may include [[occupancy sensor]]s, timeclocks, and [[photocells]] that are hard-wired to control fixed groups of lights independently. Adjustment occurs manually at each devices location. The efficiency of and market for residential lighting controls has been characterized by the [[Consortium for Energy Efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEE Residential Lighting Controls Market Characterization|url=http://library.cee1.org/content/cee-residential-lighting-controls-market-characterization|publisher=[[Consortium for Energy Efficiency]]|accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''lighting control system'' refers to an intelligent networked system of devices related to lighting control. These devices may include [[relay]]s, [[occupancy sensor]]s, [[photocells]], light control switches or [[touchscreens]], and signals from other building systems (such as [[fire alarm]] or [[HVAC]]). Adjustment of the system occurs both at device locations and at central computer locations via software programs or other interface devices.

===Advantages===
The major advantage of a lighting control system over stand-alone lighting controls or conventional manual [[light switch|switch]]ing is the ability to control individual lights or groups of lights from a single [[user interface]] device.  This ability to control multiple light sources from a user device allows complex lighting scenes to be created. A room may have multiple scenes pre-set, each one created for different activities in the room.  A major benefit of lighting control systems is reduced energy consumption. Longer lamp life is also gained when dimming and switching off lights when not in use. Wireless lighting control systems provide additional benefits including reduced installation costs and increased flexibility over where switches and sensors may be placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lighting control saves money and makes sense|url=http://www.daintree.net/downloads/whitepapers/smart-lighting.pdf|publisher=[[Daintree Networks]]|accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automated control==
Lighting control systems typically provide the ability to automatically adjust a lighting device's output based on:
*Chronological time (time of day)
*Solar time ([[sunrise]]/[[sunset]])
*[[Occupancy]] using [[occupancy sensor]]s
*[[Daylight]] availability using [[photocell]]s
*[[Alarm]] conditions
*Program logic (combination of events)

===Chronological time===
Chronological time schedules incorporate specific times of the day, week, month or year.

===Solar time===
Solar time schedules incorporate [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]] times, often used to switch outdoor lighting. Solar time scheduling requires that the location of the building be set. This is accomplished using the building's geographic location via either latitude and longitude or by picking the nearest city in a given database giving the approximate location and corresponding solar times.

===Occupancy===
Space occupancy is primarily determined with [[occupancy sensor]]s.

===Daylight availability===
Electric lighting energy use can be adjusted by automatically dimming and/or switching electric lights in response to the level of available [[daylighting|daylight]].  Reducing the amount of electric lighting used when daylight is available is known as [[daylight harvesting]].

===Alarm conditions===
Alarm conditions typically include inputs from other building systems  such as the [[fire alarm]] or [[HVAC]] system, which may trigger an emergency 'all lights on' or ' all lights flashing' command for example.

===Program logic===
Program logic can tie all of the above elements together using constructs such as [[if-then-else]] statements and [[logical operator]]s.

==Types==
In the 1980s there was a strong requirement to make commercial lighting more controllable so that it could become more energy efficient. Initially this was done with analog control, allowing [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] [[Electrical ballast|ballasts]] and [[dimmer]]s to be controlled from a central source. This was a step in the right direction, but cabling was complicated and therefore not cost effective.  

Tridonic was an early company to go digital with their broadcast [[communications protocol|protocol]]s, [[Digital Serial Interface|DSI]], in 1991. [[Digital Serial Interface|DSI]] was a basic protocol as it transmitted one control value to change the brightness of all the fixtures attached to the line. What made this protocol more attractive, and able to compete with the established analog option, was the simple wiring.

There are two types of lighting control systems which are:
* [[Analog electronics|Analog]] lighting control
* [[Digital electronics|Digital]] lighting control

Examples for analog lighting control systems are:
* [[0-10 V lighting control|0-10V]] based system.
* [[AMX192]] based systems (often referred to as AMX) ([[United States|USA]] standard).
* [[D54 (protocol)|D54]] based systems (European standard).

In production lighting 0-10V system was replaced by analog multiplexed systems such as D54 and AMX192, which themselves have been almost completely replaced by DMX512. For dimmable fluorescent lamps (where it operates instead at 1-10 V, where 1 V is minimum and 0 V is off) the system is being replaced by DSI, which itself is in the process of being replaced by DALI.

Examples for digital lighting control systems are:
* [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface|DALI]] based systems 
* [[Digital Serial Interface|DSI]] based system 
* [[DMX512]] based systems (often referred to as simply DMX).
* [[KNX (standard)|KNX]] based systems

Those are all wired lighting control system. There is also a [[wireless]] lighting control system that is based on some standard protocols like [[MIDI]], [[ZigBee]], [[Bluetooth Mesh]], and others.

==Theatrical lighting control==
{{Main|Stage lighting}}
Architectural lighting control systems can integrate with a  [[Theater (structure)|theater]]'s on-off and [[dimmer]] controls, and are often used for [[house lights]] and [[stage lighting]], and can include [[worklight]]s, [[rehearsal]] lighting, and [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] lighting.  Control stations can be placed in several locations in the building and range in complexity from single buttons that bring up preset options-looks, to in-wall or desktop [[LCD]] [[touchscreen]] consoles. Much of the [[technology]] is related to residential and commercial lighting control systems.

The benefit of architectural lighting control systems in the theater is the ability for theater staff to turn worklights and house lights on and off without having to use a [[lighting control console]].  Alternately, the light designer can control these same lights with light [[cue (theatrical)|cues]] from the lighting control console so that, for instance, the transition from houselights being up before a show starts and the first light cue of the show is controlled by one system.

[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|Legal systems of the world]]
The contemporary '''legal systems of the world''' are generally based on one of four basic [[systems]]: [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[common law]], [[statutory law]], [[religious law]] or combinations of these. However, the legal system of each country is shaped by its unique history and so incorporates individual variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://saint-claire.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Legal-Systems-of-the-World.pdf|title=Legal Systems of the World|last=|first=|date= |website= |access-date=|publisher = Saint: Security Sector Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The science that studies Law at the level of legal systems is called [[Comparative Law]].

Both ''civil'' (also known as ''Roman'') and ''common'' law systems can be considered the most widespread in the world: civil law because it is the most widespread by landmass, and common law because it is employed by the greatest number of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Principles of International Insolvency''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;lpg=PT454&amp;ots=D-khdgPbR4&amp;dq=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;pg=PT454#v=onepage&amp;q=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;f=false|date=2007|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Maps of World Financial Law:Law and practice of international finance series''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Maps_of_World_Financial_Law.html?id=Z5vKGAAACAAJ|date=2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''English Common Law is the most widespread legal system in the world''|url=https://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/061108.pdf|date=November 2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}
[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Shamash]] (the [[Babylonia]]n sun god) hands King [[Hammurabi]] a [[Code of Hammurabi|code of law]]]]

The central source of law that is recognized as authoritative is [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in a constitution or [[statute]] passed by [[legislature]], to amend a code.
While the concept of codification dates back to the [[Code of Hammurabi]] in [[Babylon]] ca. 1790 BC, civil law systems derive from the [[Roman Empire]] and, more particularly, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' issued by the Emperor [[Justinian]] ca. AD 529. This was an extensive reform of the law in the [[Byzantine Empire]], bringing it together into codified documents. Civil law was also partly influenced by [[religious law]]s such as [[Canon law]] and [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Badr&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 [Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977]|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi /&gt; Civil law today, in theory, is interpreted rather than developed or made by judges. Only [[legislature|legislative]] enactments (rather than legal [[precedent]]s, as in common law) are considered legally binding.

Scholars of [[comparative law]] and economists promoting the [[legal origins theory]] usually subdivide civil law into four distinct groups:
* '''French civil law''': in France, the [[Benelux]] countries, Italy, Romania, Spain and former colonies of those countries;
* '''[[Law of Germany#Civil law|German civil law]]''': in Germany, Austria, Russia, Switzerland, Estonia, Latvia,  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo*, Macedonia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, [[Portugal]] and [[Portuguese Empire|its former colonies]], Turkey, and East Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (Republic of China);
* '''[[Scandinavian law|Scandinavian civil law]]''': in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. As historically integrated in the Scandinavian cultural sphere, Finland and Iceland also inherited the system.
* '''[[Chinese law]]''': a mixture of civil law and [[socialist law]] in use in the People's Republic of China.

However, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:
*'''Napoleonic to Germanistic influence ([[Italian law|Italian civil law]]) '''
The [[Italy|Italian]] civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing germanistic elements due to the geopolitical alliances of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.teoriaestoriadeldirittoprivato.com/index.php?com=statics&amp;option=index&amp;cID=132 |title = Towards a Civil Code: The Italian Experience|last = Triggiano|first = Annalisa|website = Teoria e Storia del Diritto Privato}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian approach has been imitated by other countries including the [[Netherlands]] (1992), [[Argentina]] (2014), [[Brazil]] (2002) and [[Portugal]] (1966). Most of them have innovations introduced  by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the [[civil code|civil]] and [[Commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol16/iss2/8/ |title = On the Legal Method of the Uniform Commercial Code|journal = Law and Contemporary Problems|volume = 16|number = 2|first= Mitchell|last= Franklin|date = Spring 1951|pages = 330-343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Germanistic to Napoleonic influence ([[Swiss law|Swiss civil law]])'''
The [[Swiss civil code]] is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code.  The civil code of the [[Republic of Turkey]] is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s presidency as part of the government's progressive reforms and secularization.

A comprehensive list of countries that base their legal system on a [[Codification (law)|codified]] civil law follows:

|The Spanish legal tradition had a great influence on the [[Civil Code of Argentina]], basically a work of the Argentine [[jurist]] [[Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield]], who dedicated five years of his life on this task. The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1871. Beyond the influence of the Spanish legal tradition, the Argentinian Civil Code was also inspired by the Draft of the Brazilian Civil Code, the [[wikt:Draft|Draft]] of the Spanish Civil Code of 1851, the [[Napoleonic code]] and the [[Civil Code (Chile)|Chilean Civil Code]]. The sources of this Civil Code also include various theoretical legal works, mainly of the great French jurists of the 19th century. It was the first Civil Law that consciously adopted as its cornerstone the distinction between i. rights from obligations and ii. real property rights, thus distancing itself from the French model.

The Argentinian Civil Code was also in effect in Paraguay, as per a [[Paraguayan]] law of 1880, until the new Civil Code went in force in 1987.

In Argentina, this 1871 Civil Code remained in force until August 2015, when it was replaced by the new ''Código Civil y Comercial de la Nación''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm |title=Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas Públicas - Argentina |publisher=InfoLEG |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial |title=Comienza a regir el nuevo Código Civil y Comercial |publisher=Jornadaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{flagicon|Chile}} [[Law of Chile|Chile]]
|Based on the Chilean Civil Law inspired by the Napoleonic Civil Law. The Spanish legal tradition exercised an especially great influence on the civil code of Chile. On its turn, the Chilean civil code influenced to a large degree the drafting of the civil codes of other [[Latin-American]] states. For instance, the codes of Ecuador (1861) and Colombia (1873) constituted faithful reproductions of the Chilean code, but for very few exceptions. The compiler of the [[Civil Code of Chile]], Venezuelan [[Andrés Bello]], worked for its completion for almost 30 years, using elements, of the Spanish law on the one hand, and of other [[Western law]]s, especially of the French one, on the other. Indeed, it is noted that he consulted and used all of the codes that had been issued till then, starting from the era of [[Justinian]].

The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1857. The influence of the [[Napoleonic code]] and the Law of Castile of the Spanish colonial period (especially the ''[[Siete Partidas]]''), is great; it is observed however that ''e.g.'' in many provisions of [[property law|property]] or [[contract law]], the solutions of the French ''code civil'' were put aside in favor of pure [[Roman law]] or Castilian law.

|Based on the Napoleonic Civil Law. First Civil Code (a part of the General Code or [[Braulio Carrillo Colina|Carrillo]] Code) came into effect in 1841; its text was inspired by the South Peruvian Civil Code of Marshal [[Andres de Santa Cruz]]. The present Civil Code went into effect 1 January 1888, and was influenced by the [[Napoleonic Code]] and the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 (from its 1851 draft version).
|-
|{{flagicon|Croatia}} [[Law of Croatia|Croatia]]
|Based on the Germanic Civil Law. Croatian Law system is largely influenced by German and  Austrian law systems. It is significantly influenced by the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Civil Code of the Austrian Empire]] from 1811, known in Croatia as ''"General Civil Law"'' ''("Opći građanski zakon")''. OGZ was in force from 1853&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=45220 |title=Opći građanski zakonik &amp;#124; Hrvatska enciklopedija |publisher=Enciklopedija.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1946. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-controlled [[puppet state]] that was established in 1941 during [[World War II]], used the OGZ as a basis for the 1943 ''"Base of the Civil Code for the Independent State of Croatia"'' ''("Osnova građanskoga zakona za Nezavisnu Državu Hrvatsku")''. After the War, Croatia become a member of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Federation]] which enacted in 1946 the ''"Law on immediate voiding of regulations passed before April 6, 1941 and during the enemy occupation"'' ''("Zakon o nevaženju pravnih propisa donesenih prije 6. travnja 1941. i za vrijeme neprijateljske okupacije")''. By this law OGZ was declared invalid as a whole, but implementation of some of its legal rules was approved. During the post-War era, the Croatian legal system become influenced by elements of the [[socialist law]]. Croatian civil law was pushed aside, and it took norms of public law and legal regulation of the [[Socialization (economics)|social ownership]]. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on June 25, 1991, the previous legal system was used as a base for writing new laws.  ''"The Law on Obligations"'' ''("Zakon o obveznim odnosima")'' was enacted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Croatian legal history in the European context, Dalibor Čepulo, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Croatia as a [[European union]] member state implements elements of the [[Acquis communautaire|EU acquis]] into its legal system.

|{{flagicon|Guatemala}} [[Law of Guatemala|Guatemala]]
|Based on Napoleonic civil law. Guatemala has had three Civil Codes: the first one from 1877, a new one introduced in 1933, and the one currently in force, which was passed in 1963. This Civil Code has suffered some reforms throughout the years, as well as a few derogations relating to areas which have subsequently been regulated by newer laws, such as the Code of Commerce and the Law of the National Registry of Persons. In general, it follows the tradition of the Roman-French system of civil codification.

Regarding the theory of 'sources of law' in the Guatemalan legal system, the 'Ley del Organismo Judicial' recognizes 'the law' as the main legal source (in the sense of legislative texts), although it also establishes 'jurisprudence' as a complementary source. Although jurisprudence technically refers to judicial decisions in general, in practice it tends to be confused and identified with the concept of 'legal doctrine', which is a qualified series of identical resolutions in similar cases pronounced by higher courts (the Constitutional Court acting as a 'Tribunal de [[Amparo (law)|Amparo]]', and the Supreme Court acting as a 'Tribunal de Casación') whose theses become binding for lower courts.

==Common law==
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King John of England signs [[Magna Carta]]]]
Common law and [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]] (legal concept) are systems of law whose sources are the decisions in cases by judges. In addition, every system will have a legislature that passes new laws and statutes. The relationships between statutes and judicial decisions can be complex. In some jurisdictions, such statutes may overrule judicial decisions or codify the topic covered by several contradictory or ambiguous decisions. In some jurisdictions, judicial decisions may decide whether the jurisdiction's constitution allowed a particular statute or statutory provision to be made or what meaning is contained within the statutory provisions. Statutes were allowed to be made by the government. Common law developed in England, influenced by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] law and to a much lesser extent by the [[Norman conquest of England]], which introduced legal concepts from [[Norman law]], which, in turn, had its origins in [[Salic law]]. Common law was later inherited by the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and almost every former colony of the [[British Empire]] has adopted it ([[Malta]] being an exception). The doctrine of ''stare decisis'', also known as ''case law'' or ''[[precedent]] by courts'', is the major difference to codified civil law systems.

Common law is currently in practice in [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], most of the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] ([[English law|England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]]), [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Law of India|India]] (excluding [[Goa civil code|Goa]]),{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed because the Supreme Court of India's decisions override many lower courts|date=June 2014}} [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Law of Canada|Canada]] (excluding [[Quebec law|Quebec]]), [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], the [[Law of the United States|United States]] (on a state level excluding [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]]), and many other places. In addition to these countries, several others have adapted the common law system into a mixed system. For example, Nigeria operates largely on a common law system, but incorporates religious law.

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] takes an approach mixing civil law (based on the treaties) with an attachment to the importance of case law. One of the most fundamental documents to shape common law is the English [[Magna Carta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html|accessdate=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which placed limits on the power of the English Kings. It served as a kind of medieval bill of rights for the aristocracy and the judiciary who developed the law.

==Religious law==
{{main|Religious law}}

Religious law refers to the notion of a religious system or document being used as a legal source, though the methodology used varies. For example, the use of Jewish and [[Halakha]] for public law has a static and unalterable quality, precluding amendment through legislative acts of government or development through judicial precedent; Christian [[Canon law]] is more similar to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in its use of [[code (law)|codes]]; and Islamic [[Sharia]] law (and [[Fiqh]] jurisprudence) is based on legal [[precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]''), and is thus considered similar to [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice|first=Mahmoud A.|last=El-Gamal|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-86414-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main kinds of religious law are [[Sharia]] in Islam, [[Halakha]] in Judaism, and [[canon law]] in some Christian groups. In some cases these are intended purely as individual moral guidance, whereas in other cases they are intended and may be used as the basis for a country's legal system. The latter was particularly common during the [[Middle Ages]].

[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Aleppo Codex: 10th century Hebrew Bible with Masoretic pointing]]
The Halakha is followed by [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|conservative]] Jews in both ecclesiastical and civil relations. No country is fully governed by Halakha, but two Jewish people may decide, because of personal belief, to have a dispute heard by a Jewish court, and be bound by its rulings.

The Islamic legal system of [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) and [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) is the most widely used [[religious law]], and one of the three most common legal systems in the world alongside common law and civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on both [[divine law]], derived from the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]], and the rulings of [[Ulema]] (jurists), who used the methods of ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus), ''[[Qiyas]]'' (analogical deduction), ''[[Ijtihad]]'' (research) and ''[[Urf]]'' (common practice) to derive ''[[Fatwā]]'' (legal opinions). An Ulema was required to qualify for an ''[[Ijazah]]'' ([[Law degree|legal]] [[doctorate]]) at a ''[[Madrasa]]'' ([[law school]]/[[college]]) before they could issue ''Fatwā''.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]|doi=10.2307/604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], classical Islamic law may have had an [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|influence]] on the development of common law&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several civil law institutions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharia law governs a number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, though most countries use Sharia law only as a supplement to national law. It can relate to all aspects of civil law, including property rights, contracts or public law.

===Civil law and canon law===
{{main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
[[Canon law]] is not divine law, properly speaking, because it is not found in revelation. Instead, it is seen as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. [[Canon law]] regulates the internal ordering of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]]. Canon law is amended and adapted by the legislative authority of the church, such as [[episcopal conference|councils of bishops]], individual bishops for their respective sees, the [[Pope]] for the entire Catholic Church, and the British Parliament for the [[Church of England]].

[[Image:VFPt Earths Magnetic Field Confusion.svg|300px|thumbnail|right|'''A sketch of Earth's magnetic field''' representing the source of Earth's magnetic field as a magnet The [[north pole]] of Earth is near the top of the diagram, the south pole near the bottom. Notice that the south pole of that magnet is deep in Earth's interior below Earth's [[North Magnetic Pole]].  Earth's magnetic field is produced in the outer liquid part of its core due to a [[dynamo]] that produce electrical currents there.]]

The [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] interacting with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] generally follow its [[magnetic field lines]].  These represent the force that a north magnetic pole would experience at any given point.  (Denser lines indicate a stronger force.)  Plasmas exhibit more complex second-order behaviors, studied as part of [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

[[Image:Structure of the magnetosphere-en.svg|300px|thumb|right|A simulation of a charged particle being deflected from the Earth by the magnetosphere.]]

Thus in the "closed" model of the magnetosphere, the [[magnetopause]] boundary between the magnetosphere and the [[solar wind]] is outlined by field lines. Not much plasma can cross such a stiff boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piddington|first=J. H.|year=1979|title=The Closed Model of the Earth's Magnetosphere|url=|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=84|pages=8|via=|doi=10.1029/ja084ia01p00093|bibcode=1979JGR....84...93P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its only "weak points" are the two polar cusps, the points where field lines closing at noon (-z axis GSM) get separated from those closing at midnight (+z axis GSM); at such points the field intensity on the boundary is zero, posing no barrier to the entry of plasma. (This simple definition assumes a noon-midnight plane of symmetry, but closed fields lacking such symmetry also must have cusps, by the [[fixed point theorem]].)

The amount of solar wind energy and plasma entering the actual magnetosphere depends on how far it departs from such a "closed" configuration, i.e. the extent to which [[Interplanetary Magnetic Field]] field lines manage to cross the boundary. As discussed further below, that extent depends very much on the direction of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field, in particular on its southward or northward slant.

[[Image:Currents.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Schematic view of the different current systems which shape the Earth's magnetosphere]]
Trapping of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], e.g. of the [[ring current]], also follows the structure of field lines. A particle interacting with this B field experiences a [[Lorentz Force]] which is responsible for many of the particle motion in the magnetosphere.  Furthermore, [[Birkeland currents]] and heat flow are also channeled by such lines — easy along them, blocked in perpendicular directions.  Indeed, field lines in the magnetosphere have been likened to the grain in a log of wood{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}, which defines an "easy" direction along which it easily gives way.

==  Motion of charged particles ==

[[Image:Earth ElectronParticle thru magnetosphere small.JPG|thumb|right|A simulated charged particle, its trajectory determined primarily by the Earth's magnetosphere.]]

The simplest magnetic field '''B''' is a constant one– straight parallel field lines and constant field intensity. In such a field, if an ion or electron enters perpendicular to the field lines, it can be shown to move in a circle (the field only needs to be constant in the region covering the circle). If q is the charge of the particle, m its mass, v its velocity and R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;  the radius of the circle ([[gyroradius|"gyration radius"]]), all one needs do is notice that the centripetal force mv&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;   must equal the magnetic force qvB. One gets
&lt;CENTER&gt;
R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;  = mv/(qB)
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
If the initial velocity of the particle has a different direction, one only needs resolve it into a component '''v'''&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;perpendicular to B and a component '''v'''&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;//&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/span&gt; parallel to B, and replace v in the above formula with v&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;.

If W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;=m v&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/2 is the energy associated with the perpendicular motion in electron-volts (all calculations here are non-relativistic), in a field of B nT (nanotesla), then R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; in kilometers is

&lt;CENTER&gt;
For protons &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; =  (144/B) {{radic|W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;}}

For electrons &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; =  (3.37/B) {{radic|W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;}}
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
			
The velocity parallel to the field '''v'''&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;//&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is not affected by the field, because no magnetic force exists in that direction. That velocity just stays constant (as long as the field does), and adding the two motions together gives a spiral around a central guiding field line. If the field curves or changes, the motion is modified, but the general character of spiraling around a central field line persists: hence the name "[[guiding center|guiding center motion]]."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Because the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity, it performs no work and requires no energy—nor does it provide any. Thus magnetic fields (like the Earth's) can profoundly affect particle motion in them, but need no energy input to maintain their effect.  Particles may also get steered around, but their total energy remains the same.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==  Magnetic Mirroring and Magnetic Drift ==

The spacing between field lines is an indicator of the relative strength of the magnetic field. Where magnetic field lines converge the field grows stronger, and where they diverge, weaker.

Now, it can be shown that in the motion of gyrating particles, the "magnetic moment" μ = W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;/B (or relativistically, p&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/2mγB) stays very nearly constant. The "very nearly" qualifier sets it apart from true constants of motion, such as energy, reducing it to merely an "adiabatic invariant." For most plasmas in the magnetosphere, the deviation from constancy is negligible.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The conservation of μ is tremendously important (in laboratory plasmas as well as in space). Suppose the field line guiding a particle, the axis of its spiral path, belongs to a converging bundle of lines, so that the particle is led into an increasingly larger B. To keep μ constant, W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt; must also grow.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

However, as noted before, the total energy of a particle in a "purely magnetic" field remains constant. What therefore happens is that energy is converted, from the part associated with the parallel motion '''v'''&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;//&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the perpendicular part.  As v&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;//&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/span&gt; decreases, the angle between v and B then increases, until it reaches 90°. At that point W&lt;SUB&gt;⊥&lt;/SUB&gt; contains all the available energy, it can grow no more and no further advance into the stronger field can occur.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The result is known as [[magnetic mirror]]ing. The particle briefly gyrates perpendicular to its guiding field line, and then retreats back to the weaker field, the spiral unwinding again in the process.  It may be noted that such motion was first derived by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1895, for a charged particle in the field of a magnetic monopole, whose field lines are all straight and converge to a point. The conservation of μ was only pointed by [[Hannes Alfvén|Alfvén]] about 50 years later, and the connection to adiabatic invariant was only made afterwards.

Magnetic mirroring makes possible the "trapping" in the dipole-like field lines near Earth of particles in the radiation belt and in the ring current. On all such lines the field is much stronger at their ends near Earth, compared to its strength when it crosses the equatorial plane. Assuming such particles are somehow placed in the equatorial region of that field, most of them stay trapped, because every time their motion along the field line brings them into the strong field region, they "get mirrored" and bounce back and forth between hemispheres. Only particles whose motion is very close to parallel to the field line, with near-zero μ, avoid mirroring—and these are quickly absorbed by the atmosphere and lost. Their loss leaves a bundle of directions around the field line which is empty of particles—the "loss cone".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In addition to gyrating around their guiding field lines and bouncing back and forth between mirror points, trapped particles also drift slowly around Earth, switching guiding field lines but staying at approximately the same distance (another adiabatic invariant is involved, "the second invariant"). [[Guiding center|This motion]] was mentioned earlier in connection with the ring current.

One reason for the drift is that the intensity of '''B''' increases as Earth is approached. The gyration around the guiding field line is therefore not a perfect circle, but curves a little more tightly on the side closer to the Earth, where the larger B gives a smaller R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. This change in curvature makes ions advance sideways, while electrons, which gyrate in the opposite sense, advance sideways in the opposite direction.  The net result, as already noted, produces the ring current, though additional effects (like non-uniform distribution of plasma density) also affect the result.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Plasma fountain==
[[Image:plasma fountain.gif|thumb|200px|right|The Earth's "[[plasma fountain]]", showing oxygen, helium, and hydrogen ions which gush into space from regions near the Earth's poles. The faint yellow area shown above the north pole represents gas lost from Earth into space; the green area is the [[aurora borealis]]-or plasma energy pouring back into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Plasma fountain  [http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/news/9812/solar1.html Source], press release: [http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/news/9812/solarwind.html Solar Wind Squeezes Some of Earth's Atmosphere into Space]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

In the 1980s, a "plasma fountain" of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions was discovered flowing from the Earth's north pole.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

'''Memory management''' is a form of [[Resource management (computing)|resource management]] applied to [[computer memory]].  The essential requirement of memory management is to provide ways to dynamically allocate portions of memory to programs at their request, and free it for reuse when no longer needed. This is critical to any advanced computer system where more than a single [[Process (computing)|process]] might be underway at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Steve|author1-link=Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|title=Tech Talk: Placing the IBM/Microsoft XMS Spec Into Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|magazine=[[InfoWorld]]|date=August 15, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods have been devised that increase the effectiveness of memory management. [[Virtual memory]] systems separate the memory addresses used by a process from actual physical addresses, allowing separation of processes and increasing the size of the [[virtual address space]] beyond the available amount of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] using [[paging]] or swapping to [[secondary storage]]. The quality of the virtual memory manager can have an extensive effect on overall system performance.

Application-level memory management is generally categorized as either automatic memory management, usually involving [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], or [[manual memory management]].

=== {{Anchor|DYNAMIC|HEAP|ALLOCATION}}Dynamic memory allocation ===
[[File:External Fragmentation.svg|thumb|450px|An example of external fragmentation]]
{{See also|C dynamic memory allocation}}

The task of fulfilling an allocation request consists of locating a block of unused memory of sufficient size. Memory requests are satisfied by allocating portions from a large pool of memory called the ''heap'' or ''free store''.{{efn|Not to be confused with the unrelated [[heap (data structure)|heap]] data structure.}} At any given time, some parts of the heap are in use, while some are "free" (unused) and thus available for future allocations.

Several issues complicate the implementation, such as [[fragmentation (computer)#External fragmentation|external fragmentation]], which arises when there are many small gaps between allocated memory blocks, which invalidates their use for an allocation request. The allocator's [[metadata (computing)|metadata]] can also inflate the size of (individually) small allocations. This is often managed by [[chunking (computing)|chunking]]. The memory management system must track outstanding allocations to ensure that they do not overlap and that no memory is ever "lost" (i.e. that there be no "[[memory leak]]").

==== Efficiency ====
The specific dynamic memory allocation algorithm implemented can impact performance significantly. A study conducted in 1994 by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] illustrates the [[computational overhead|overheads]] involved for a variety of allocators. The lowest average [[instruction path length]] required to allocate a single memory slot was 52 (as measured with an instruction level [[Profiling (computer programming)|profiler]] on a variety of software).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/spe.4380240602| title = Memory allocation costs in large C and C++ programs| journal = Software: Practice and Experience| volume = 24| issue = 6| pages = 527–542| date=June 1994 | last1 = Detlefs | first1 = D. | last2 = Dosser | first2 = A. | last3 = Zorn | first3 = B. | url = http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/uc-courses/15400-2008-spring/spe895.pdf| citeseerx = 10.1.1.30.3073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Implementations ====
Since the precise location of the allocation is not known in advance, the memory is accessed indirectly, usually through a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] [[reference (computer science)|reference]]. The specific algorithm used to organize the memory area and allocate and deallocate chunks is interlinked with the [[kernel (computing)|kernel]], and may use any of the following methods:

===== {{Anchor|FIXED-SIZE}}Fixed-size blocks allocation =====
{{main|Memory pool}}

Fixed-size blocks allocation, also called memory pool allocation, uses a [[free list]] of fixed-size blocks of memory (often all of the same size). This works well for simple [[embedded system]]s where no large objects need to be allocated, but suffers from [[Fragmentation (computing)|fragmentation]], especially with long memory addresses. However, due to the significantly reduced overhead this method can substantially improve performance for objects that need frequent allocation / de-allocation and is often used in [[video games]].

===== Buddy blocks =====
{{details|Buddy memory allocation}}

In this system, memory is allocated into several pools of memory instead of just one, where each pool represents blocks of memory of a certain [[power of two]] in size, or blocks of some other convenient size progression. All blocks of a particular size are kept in a sorted [[linked list]] or [[Tree data structure|tree]] and all new blocks that are formed during allocation are added to their respective memory pools for later use. If a smaller size is requested than is available, the smallest available size is selected and split. One of the resulting parts is selected, and the process repeats until the request is complete. When a block is allocated, the allocator will start with the smallest sufficiently large block to avoid needlessly breaking blocks. When a block is freed, it is compared to its buddy. If they are both free, they are combined and placed in the correspondingly larger-sized buddy-block list.

===== Slab allocation =====
{{main|Slab allocation}}

This memory allocation mechanism preallocates memory chunks suitable to fit objects of a certain type or size.&lt;ref name=silberschatz&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abraham Silberschatz|authorlink1=Abraham Silberschatz|author2=Peter B. Galvin|title=Operating system concepts|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=0-471-69466-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chunks are called caches and the allocator only has to keep track of a list of free cache slots. Constructing an object will use the any one of the free cache slots and destructing an object will add a slot back to the free cache slot list. This technique alleviates memory fragmentation and is efficient as there is no need to search for a suitable portion of memory, as any open slot will suffice.

===== Stack allocation =====
{{main|Stack-based memory allocation}}

{{expand section|date=November 2016}}

=== Automatic variables  ===
{{main|Automatic variable}}
In many programming language implementations, all variables declared within a procedure (subroutine, or function) are local to that function; the runtime environment for the program automatically allocates memory for these variables on program execution entry to the procedure, and automatically releases that memory when the procedure is exited. Special declarations may allow local variables to retain values between invocations of the procedure, or may allow local variables to be accessed by other procedures. The automatic allocation of local variables makes [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] possible, to a depth limited by available memory.  

==== Garbage collection ====
{{main|Garbage collection (computer science)}}
Garbage collection is a strategy for automatically detecting memory allocated to objects that are no longer usable in a program, and returning that allocated memory to a pool of free memory locations. This method is in contrast to "manual" memory management where a programmer explicitly  codes memory requests and memory releases in the program. While automatic garbage has the advantages of reducing programmer workload and preventing certain kinds of memory allocation bugs, garbage collection does require memory resources of its own, and can compete with the application program for processor time.

== Systems with virtual memory ==
{{Main|Memory protection|Shared memory (interprocess communication)}}

[[Virtual memory]] is a method of decoupling the memory organization from the physical hardware. The applications operate on memory via ''virtual addresses''. Each attempt by the application to access a particular virtual memory address results in the virtual memory address being translated to an actual ''physical address''.  In this way the addition of virtual memory enables granular control over memory systems and methods of access.

In virtual memory systems the operating system limits how a [[Process (computing)|process]] can access the memory. This feature, called [[memory protection]], can be used to disallow a process to read or write to memory that is not allocated to it, preventing malicious or malfunctioning code in one program from interfering with the operation of another.

Even though the memory allocated for specific processes is normally isolated, processes sometimes need to be able to share information. [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|Shared memory]] is one of the fastest techniques for [[inter-process communication]].

Memory is usually classified by access rate into [[primary storage]] and [[secondary storage]]. Memory management systems, among other operations, also handle the moving of information between these two levels of memory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14627">The genre of '''Menippean satire''' is a form of [[satire]], usually in [[prose]], which has a length and structure similar to a [[novel]] and is characterized by attacking mental attitudes rather than specific individuals or entities.&lt;ref name="FryeProseFiction"/&gt; Other features found in Menippean satire are different forms of [[parody]] and mythological [[burlesque]],&lt;ref name="Branham97p18"/&gt; a critique of the myths inherited from traditional culture,&lt;ref name="Branham97p18"/&gt; a [[Epic poetry|rhapsodic]] nature, a fragmented narrative, the combination of many different targets, and the rapid moving between styles and points of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakhtin|first1=Mikhail|title=Problems in Dostoevsky's Poetics|date=1984|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|pages=108, 114–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used by classical grammarians and by philologists mostly to refer to satires in prose (cf. the verse [[Satires of Juvenal]] and his imitators). Typical mental attitudes attacked and [[ridicule]]d by Menippean satires are "pedants, bigots, cranks, parvenus, virtuosi, enthusiasts, rapacious and incompetent professional men of all kinds," which are treated as diseases of the intellect.&lt;ref name="FryeProseFiction"&gt;Frye, Fourth essay, section ''[http://northropfrye-theanatomyofcriticism.blogspot.com/2009/02/fourth-essay-rhetorical-criticism.html Specific Continuous Forms (Prose Fiction)]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"&gt;Theodore D. Kharpertian, ''Thomas Pynchon and Postmodern American Satire'' pp. 29–30, in Kharpertian [https://books.google.com/books?id=um0h0arlUdoC ''A hand to turn the time: the Menippean satires of Thomas Pynchon'']&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Menippean satire'' distinguishes it from the earlier satire pioneered by [[Aristophanes]], which was based on personal attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Mastromarco, Giuseppe (1994) ''Introduzione a Aristofane'' (Sesta edizione: Roma-Bari 2004). {{ISBN|88-420-4448-2}} pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The form is named after the Greek [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] [[parody|parodist]] and polemicist [[Menippus]] (third century BC).&lt;ref name="Branham97p17"&gt;Branham (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XrNEns3_yd0C&amp;pg=PR17 p.17]&lt;/ref&gt; His works, now lost, influenced the works of [[Lucian]] and [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]; such satires are sometimes also termed '''Varronian satire'''. [[M. H. Abrams]] classifies Menippean satire as one form of indirect satire, the category opposed to the formal satire of direct criticism in the [[first-person narrative|first person]].&lt;ref name = Abrams&gt;[[M. H. Abrams]], ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' (1985 edition), article on satire, pp. 166–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Salzman, taking Menippean satire as a genre as "rather ill-defined", describes it as a mixture of [[allegory]], [[picaresque]] narrative and satirical commentary.&lt;ref name = Salzman&gt;Paul Salzman, ''Narrative Contexts for Bacon's New Atlantis'', p. 39, in Bronwen Price (editor), ''Francis Bacon's New Atlantis'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northrop Frye]] found the term "cumbersome and in modern terms rather misleading", and proposed as replacement the term 'anatomy' (taken from Burton's ''[[Anatomy of Melancholy]]''). In his theory of prose fiction it occupies the fourth place with the [[novel]], [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] and confession.&lt;ref name = Frye&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'' (1974 edition) pp. 309–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical tradition==

Varro's own 150 books of Menippean satires survive only through quotations. The genre continued with [[Seneca the Younger]], whose ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'', or "Pumpkinification", is the only near-complete classical Menippean satire to survive. It consisted in an irreverent [[parody]] of the deification of Emperor Claudius.&lt;ref name="Branham97p17"/&gt; The Menippean tradition is also evident in [[Petronius]]' ''[[Satyricon]]'', especially in the banquet scene "Cena Trimalchionis", which combines epic form, tragedy, and philosophy with verse and prose; and in [[Apuleius]]' ''Golden Ass'', the form is combined with the [[comic novel]].&lt;ref&gt;"[[Bakhtin]], ''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'', pg. 113–20. Translated by C. Emerson. Minnesota UP 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of the Menippean satire have also been pointed out in the Gospels.&lt;ref&gt;George W. Young, ''[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=t54DzhncNE4C&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Subversive Symmetry: Exploring the Fantastic in Mark 6:45-56]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later examples include ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]'' of [[Boethius]]&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Sullivan ed., ''Petronius, The Satyricon'' (Penguin 1986) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Caesars'' of [[Julian the apostate]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Nettleship ed., ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (London 1894) p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later examples==
The form was revived during the Renaissance by [[Erasmus]], [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Burton]], and [[Laurence Sterne]],&lt;ref name="N. Frye, 1971 p. 310-12"&gt;N. Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 310-12&lt;/ref&gt; while 19th-century examples include the ''John Buncle'' of [[Thomas Amory (author)|Thomas Amory]] and ''The Doctor'' of [[Robert Southey]].&lt;ref name="N. Frye, 1971 p. 310-12"/&gt; The 20th century saw renewed critical interest in the form, with Menippean satire significantly influencing [[postmodern literature]].&lt;ref name="Branham97p18"&gt;Branham (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XrNEns3_yd0C&amp;pg=PR18 pp. 18–9]&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary scholars including Frye classify the following works as Menippean satires:{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

According to P. Adams Sitney in "Visionary Film," Mennipea became the dominant new genre in avant-garde cinema at the turn of the century. Filmmakers he cited include [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Sidney Peterson]], [[Michael Snow]], and [[Hollis Frampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sitney|first1=P.

[[Marshall McLuhan]] also made extensive use of Menippean satire, as he himself suggested: “Most of my writing is Menippean satire, presenting the actual surface of the world we live in as a ludicrous image.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan, Marshall]]. Letters of Marshall McLuhan. Molinaro, C. McLuhan, and W. Toye (Eds.), Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1987. p. 517&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bakhtin's theory==
Menippean satire plays a special role in [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theory of the novel. In ''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'', Bakhtin treats Menippean satire as one of the classical "serio-comic" genres, alongside [[Socratic dialogue]] and other forms that Bakhtin claims are united by a "carnival sense of the world", wherein "carnival is the past millennia's way of sensing the world as one great communal performance" and is "permeated with the pathos of change and the joyful relativity of all things". The folk-carnival sense of the world, in which forms like the Socratic dialogue and Menippean satire are based, "did not permit thought to stop and congeal in one-sided seriousness or in a stupid fetish for definition or singleness of meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakhtin|first1=Mikhail|title=Problems in Dostoevsky's Poetics|date=1984|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-1227-7|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern authors of "Menippea" in Bakhtin's sense include [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]], and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref name = Bakhtin&gt;[[Mikhail Bakhtin]], ''[[Rabelais and His World]]''  Tr. Helene Iswolsky.  The M. I. T. Press (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; For Bakhtin, the novels of Dostoevsky represent the highest point in the development of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin (1984). p121&lt;/ref&gt;
In a series of articles, Edward Milowicki and Robert Rawdon Wilson, building upon Bakhtin’s theory, have argued that Menippean is not a period-specific term, as many Classicists have claimed, but a term for discursive analysis that instructively applies to many kinds of writing from many historical periods including the modern.  As a type of discourse, “Menippean” signifies a mixed, often discontinuous way of writing that draws upon distinct, multiple traditions. It is normally highly intellectual and typically embodies an idea, an ideology or a mind-set in the figure of a grotesque, even disgusting, comic character.  &lt;blockquote&gt;The power of very physical images to satirize, or otherwise comment upon, ideas lies at the heart of Menippean satire.&lt;ref name="Wilson2002"&gt;Wilson(2002) p.308 n.25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Frye's definition ==
Critic [[Northrop Frye]] said that Menippean satire moves rapidly between styles and points of view.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Such satires deal less with human characters than with the single-minded mental attitudes, or "[[humour]]s", that they represent: the pedant, the braggart, the bigot, the miser, the quack, the seducer, etc. Frye observed,

{{cquote|The novelist sees evil and folly as social diseases, but the Menippean satirist sees them as diseases of the intellect […]&lt;ref name = Frye/&gt;}}

He illustrated this distinction by positing Squire Western (from ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'') as a character rooted in novelistic realism, but the tutors Thwackum and Square as figures of Menippean satire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15613">Mechanistic models for niche apportionment are biological models used to explain [[relative species abundance]] distributions.  These '''niche apportionment models''' describe how species break up [[resource]] pool in multi-dimensional space, determining the distribution of abundances of individuals among species.  The relative abundances of species are usually expressed as a Whittaker plot, or rank abundance plot, where species are ranked by number of individuals on the x-axis, plotted against the log relative abundance of each species on the y-axis.  The relative abundance can be measured as the relative number of individuals within species or the relative biomass of individuals within species.

==History==
Niche apportionment models were developed because ecologists sought biological explanations for [[relative species abundance]] distributions. [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] (1957, 1961),&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur, R. H.]] (1957). On the relative abundance of bird species. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 43, 293-295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur, R. H. MacArthur, J. W. (1961). On bird species diversity. Ecology. 42, 594-598.&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the earliest to express dissatisfaction with purely [[statistical models]], presenting instead 3 mechanistic niche apportionment models. MacArthur believed that [[ecological niches]] within a resource pool could be broken up like a stick, with each piece of the stick representing niches occupied in the community.  With contributions from Sugihara (1980),&lt;ref name="Sugihara, G. 1980"&gt;Sugihara, G. (1980). Minimal community structure: an explanation of species abundance patterns. Am. Nat. 116. 770-787.&lt;/ref&gt; Tokeshi (1990, 1993, 1996)&lt;ref name="Tokeshi, M. 1990"&gt;Tokeshi, M. (1990). Niche apportionment or random assortment: species abundance patterns revisited. Journal of Animal Ecology. 59, 1129-1146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tokeshi, M. 1993"&gt;Tokeshi, M. (1993). Species abundance patterns and community structure. Adv. Ecol. Res. 24, 112-186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tokeshi, M. 1996"&gt;Tokeshi, M. (1996). Power Fraction: a new explanation for species abundance patterns in species-rich assemblages. Oikos. 75, 543-550.&lt;/ref&gt; expanded upon the broken stick model, when he generated roughly 7 mechanistic niche apportionment models.  These mechanistic models provide a useful starting point for describing the species composition of communities.

==Description==

A niche apportionment model can be used in situations where one resource pool is either sequentially or simultaneously broken up into smaller niches by colonizing species or by speciation (clarification on resource use: species within a guild use same resources, while species within a community may not).

These models describe how species that draw from the same resource pool (e.g. a [[guild (ecology)]]) partition their niche. The resource pool is broken either sequentially or simultaneously, and the two components of the process of fragmentation of the niche include which fragment is chosen and the size of the resulting fragment (Figure 2).

Niche apportionment models have been used in the primary literature to explain, and describe changes in the relative abundance distributions of a diverse array of taxa including, freshwater insects, fish, bryophytes beetles, hymenopteran parasites, plankton assemblages and salt marsh grass.

==Assumptions==
[[File:MechanismNA.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2. The mechanisms with which a niche is broken. A resource pool is partitioned into niches of different sizes, which can be translated into the relative abundances of species in the total resource pool.]]

The mechanistic models that describe these plots work under the assumption that rank abundance plots are based on a rigorous estimate of the abundances of individuals within species and that these measures represent the actual species abundance distribution.  Furthermore, whether using the number of individuals as the abundance measure or the biomass of individuals, these models assume that this quantity is directly proportional to the size of the niche occupied by an organism (add a direct sentence explaining size structure and biomass and thus energy use by each individual). One suggestion is that abundance measured as the numbers of individuals, may exhibit lower variances than those using [[biomass]].  Thus, some studies using abundance as a proxy for niche allocation may overestimate the [[Species evenness|evenness]] of a [[community (ecology)|community]].  This happens because there is not a clear distinction of the relationship between body size, [[abundance (ecology)]], and [[resource]] use. Often studies fail to incorporate size structure or biomass estimates into measures of actual abundance, and these measure can create a higher variance around the niche apportionment models than abundance measured strictly as the number of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston, K. W. Blackburn, T. M. (2000). Macroecology, Oxford, UK: Blackwell Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taper, M. L. Marquet, P. A. (1996). How do species really divide resources? American Naturalist. 147, 1072-1086.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tokeshi's mechanistic models of niche apportionment==
Seven mechanistic models that describe niche apportionment are described below.  The models are presented in the order of increasing evenness, from least even, the Dominance Pre-emption model to the most even the Dominance Decay and MacArthur Fraction models. 

===Dominance preemption===
This model describes a situation where after initial colonization (or speciation) each new species pre-empts more than 50% the smallest remaining niche.  In a Dominance preemption model of niche apportionment the species colonize random portion between 50 and 100% of the smallest remaining niche, making this model stochastic in nature.  A closely related model, the Geometric Series,&lt;ref&gt;May, R. M. (1975). Patterns of species abundance and diversity. In Ecology and Evolution of Communities.  81-120, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is a deterministic version of the Dominance pre-emption model, wherein the percentage of remaining niche space that the new species occupies (k) is always the same.  In fact, the dominance pre-emption and geometric series models are conceptually similar and will produce the same relative abundance distribution when the proportion of the smaller niche filled is always 0.75.  The dominance pre-emption model is the best fit to the relative abundance distributions of some stream fish communities in [[Texas]], including some taxonomic groupings, and specific functional groupings.&lt;ref name="Higgins, C. L 2008"&gt;Higgins, C. L. Strauss, R. E. (2008). Modeling stream fish assemblages with niche apportionment models: patterns. processes, and scale dependence. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society. 137, 696-706.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geometric (k=0.75)
&lt;math&gt;Pi = k(1 -k)^i-1&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Dominance-preemption.svg|400px]]

===Random assortment===
In the random assortment model the resource pool is divided at random among simultaneously or sequentially colonizing species.  This pattern could arise because the abundance measure does not scale with the amount of niche occupied by a species or because temporal-variation in species abundance or niche breadth causes discontinuity in niche apportionment over time and thus species appear to have no relationship between extent of occupancy and their niche.  Tokeshi (1993)&lt;ref name="Tokeshi, M. 1993"/&gt; explained that this model, in many ways, is similar to Caswell's neutral theory of biodiversity, mainly because species appear to act independently of each other.

===Random fraction===
The random fraction model describes a process where niche size is chosen at random by sequentially colonizing species.  The initial species chooses a random portion of the total niche and subsequent colonizing species also choose a random portion of the total niche and divide it randomly until all species have colonized.  Tokeshi (1990)&lt;ref name="Tokeshi, M. 1990"/&gt; found this model to be compatible with some epiphytic Chiromonid shrimp communities, and more recently it has been used to explain the relative abundance distributions of phytoplankton communities, salt meadow vegetation, some communities of insects in the order Diptera, some ground beetle communities, functional and taxonomic groupings of stream fish in Texas bio-regions, and ichneumonid parasitoids.  A similar model was developed by Sugihara in an attempt to provide a biological explanation for the log normal distribution of Preston (1948).&lt;ref&gt;Prestion, F. W. (1948). The commonness and rarity of species. Ecology. 29, 254-253.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sugihara's (1980)&lt;ref name="Sugihara, G. 1980"/&gt; Fixed Division Model was similar to the random fraction model, but the randomness of the model is drawn from a [[triangular distribution]] with a mean of 0.75 rather that a normal distribution with a mean of 0.5 used in the random fraction.  Sugihara used a triangular distribution to draw the random variables because the randomness of some natural populations matches a triangular distribution with a mean of 0.75.   

[[Image:Random-fraction.svg|600px]]

===Power fraction===
This model can explain a relative abundance distribution when the probability of colonization an existing niche in a resource pool is positively related to the size of that niche (measured as abundance, biomass etc.).  The probability with which a portion of the niche colonized is dependent on the relative sizes of the established niches, and is scaled by an exponent k. k can take a value between 0 and 1 and if k&gt;0 there is always a slightly higher probability that the larger niche will be colonized.  This model is toted as being more biologically realistic because one can imagine many cases where the niche with the larger proportion of resources is more likely to be invaded because that niche has more resource space, and thus more opportunity for acquisition.  The random fraction model of niche apportionment is an extreme of the power fraction model where k=0, and the other extreme of the power fraction, when k=1 resembles the MacArthur Fraction model where the probability of colonization is directly proportion to niche size.&lt;ref name="Tokeshi, M. 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Magurrran, A. E. 2004"&gt;Magurrran, A. E. (2004). Measuring Biological Diversity. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Science&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Power-fraction.svg|600px]]

===MacArthur fraction===
This model requires that the initial niche is broken at random and the successive niches are chosen with a probability proportional to their size.  In this model the largest niche always has a greater probability of being broken relative to the smaller niches in the resource pool.  This model can lead to a more even distribution where larger niches are more likely to be broken facilitating co-existence between species in equivalent sized niches.  The basis for the MacArthur Fraction model is the Broken Stick, developed by MacArthur (1957).  These models produce similar results, but one of the main conceptual differences is that niches are filled simultaneously in Broken Stick model rather than sequentially as in the MacArthur Fraction.  Tokeshi (1993)&lt;ref name="Tokeshi, M. 1993"/&gt; argues that sequentially invading a resource pool is more biologically realistic than simultaneously breaking the niche space.  When the abundance of fish from all bio-regions  in Texas were combined the distribution resembled the broken stick model of niche apportionment, suggesting a relatively even distribution of freshwater fish species in Texas.&lt;ref name="Higgins, C. L 2008"/&gt;

[[Image:Macarthur-fraction.svg|600px]]

===Dominance decay===
This model can be thought of as the inverse to the Dominance pre-emption model.  First, the initial resource pool is colonized randomly and the remaining, subsequent colonizers always colonize the largest niche, whether or not it is already colonized.  This model generates the most even community relative to the niche apportionment models described above because the largest niche is always broken into two smaller fragments that are more likely to be equivalent to the size of the smaller niche that was not broken.  Communities of this “level” of evenness seem to be rare in natural systems.  However, one such community includes the relative abundance distribution of filter feeders in one site within the River Danube in Austria.&lt;ref name="Fesl, C. 2002"&gt;Fesl, C. (2002). Niche oriented species abundance models: different approaches and their application to larval chironomid (Diptera) assemblages in a large river. J. Anim. Ecol. 71, 1085-1094.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dominance-decay.svg|600px]]

===Composite===
A composite model exists when a combination of niche apportionment models are acting in different portions of the resource pool.  Fesl (2002).&lt;ref name="Fesl, C. 2002"/&gt; shows how a composite model might appear in a study of freshwater [[Diptera]], in that different niche apportionment models fit different functional groups of the data.  Another example by Higgins and Strauss (2008), modeling fish assemblages, found that fish communities from different habitats and with different species compositions conform to different niche apportionment models, thus the entire species assemblage was a combination of models in different regions of the species range.

==Fitting mechanistic models of niche apportionment to empirical data==
Mechanistic models of niche apportionment are intended to describe communities.  Researchers have used these models in many ways to investigate the temporal and geographic trends in species abundance.  

For many years the fit of niche apportionment models was conducted by eye and graphs of the models were compared with empirical data.&lt;ref name="Tokeshi, M. 1993"/&gt;  More recently statistical tests of the fit of niche apportionment models to empirical data have been developed.&lt;ref name="entu.cas"&gt;Drozd, P. Novotny, V.  (2000). Power Niche: Niche Division models for community analysis. Version 1. Manual and program published at www.entu.cas/png/PowerNiche&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Etienne, R. S 2005"&gt;Etienne, R. S. Ollf, H. (2005). Confronting different models of community structure to species-abundance data: a Bayesian model comparison. Ecology Letters. 8, 493-504.&lt;/ref&gt;  The later method (Etienne and Ollf 2005)&lt;ref name="Etienne, R. S 2005"/&gt; uses a Bayesian simulation of the models to test their fit to empirical data.  The former method, which is still commonly used, simulates the expected relative abundances, from a normal distribution, of each model given the same number of species as the empirical data.  Each model is simulated multiple times, and mean and standard deviation can be calculated to assign confidence intervals around each relative abundance distribution.  The confidence around each rank can be tested against empirical data for each model to determine model fit.  The confidence intervals are calculated as follows.&lt;ref name="Tokeshi, M. 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Magurrran, A. E. 2004"/&gt; For more information on the simulation of niche apportionment models the website [http://www.entu.cas/png/PowerNiche], which explains the program Power Niche.&lt;ref name="entu.cas"/&gt;

In [[positional astronomy]], two [[astronomical object]]s are said to be in '''opposition''' when they are on [[antipodal point|opposite sides]] of the [[celestial sphere]], as observed from a given body (usually [[Earth]]).

A planet (or [[asteroid]] or [[comet]]) is said to be "in opposition" when it is in opposition to the [[Sun]]. Because most [[orbit]]s in the [[Solar System]] are nearly [[coplanar]] to the [[ecliptic]], this occurs when the [[Sun]], [[Earth]], and the body are configured in an approximately straight line, or [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]; that is, Earth and the body are in the same direction as seen from the Sun. Opposition occurs only for [[superior planets]] (see the diagram).

The instant of opposition is defined as that when the apparent geocentric [[ecliptic coordinate system|celestial longitude]] of the body differs by 180° from the apparent geocentric longitude of the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;

A '''protected area mosaic''', or '''conservation mosaic''' is a collection of environmentally protected areas that are treated as a whole, either formally or informally.
The protected areas may be of different types, including strictly protected areas and sustainable use areas, which may be administered at different public levels or privately.
They may include areas assigned to indigenous people.
A mosaic may be more flexible and effective than an attempt to combine all the areas into a single conservation unit under one agency.
In practice, results with mosaics in different countries have been mixed.

==Definition==

A conservation mosaic may be defined as "a network of protected areas and complementary landscapes that include combinations of national parks (i.e. the core conservation areas), production landscapes and collectively-owned ethnic territories (i.e. the surrounding areas)".{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=x}}
Conservation mosaics are similar to the [[biosphere]]s promoted by [[UNESCO]] under the [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]].{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=4}}
The cooperative approach between different agencies and types of protected area avoids the conflicts and disagreements over land use and conservation that often result with a single agency and single type of conservation unit.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=247}}
The value of creating protected area mosaics has been the subject of intense debate among conservationists.{{sfn|Conservation International|2009|p=21}}
Protected areas are of great importance in protecting biodiversity, but conservation efforts must take into account the social and economic needs of the surrounding communities and the resulting pressure on land usage.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|pp=x–xi}}

==National examples==

===Brazil===
[[File:Amazonas BR-319.jpg|thumb|[[BR-319]]. A protected area mosaic has been defined in an effort to reduce deforestation when the road is paved.]]
{{main article|Protected area mosaic (Brazil)}}
A ''[[Protected area mosaic (Brazil)|mosaico de unidades de conservação]]'' is a legally recognized entity in Brazil, a collection of protected areas of the same or different categories that are near to each other, adjoin each other or overlap, and that should be managed as a whole. It may include conservation units, private lands and indigenous territories.{{sfn|Mosaicos de áreas protegidas – ISA}}
Brazil has created a mosaic of federal and state conservation units along the [[BR-319]] highway through the Amazon rainforest in an effort to better prevent deforestation when the highway is paved through more efficient management of a larger area. 
However, WWF-Brazil has pointed out that it is not enough to simply create the protected areas on paper. 
They must be staffed, delimited, legal owners compensated and so on.{{sfn|Six new protected areas created in Brazilian Amazonian state}}

The [[Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park]] in the state of [[Goiás]], Brazil, was expanded by Federal Decree in September 2001 and inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in December 2001.
In 2003 the expansion was successfully challenged and 72% of the national park lost its protection status.
The park is part of the [[Cerrado Biosphere Reserve]].
Brazil has outlined plans for a mosaic of new conservation units with different management categories covering an equivalent area to the expanded National Park, but [[UNESCO]] has questioned whether the mosaic will be sufficient to ensure the statutory protection required for the World Heritage properties.{{sfn|Cerrado Protected Areas ... UNESCO}}

===Colombia===

A 2015 World Bank report on national protected areas in Colombia covering at least {{convert|2000000|ha}} found that with the mosaic approach ecological connectivity had improved in eight of the mosaics, exceeding the target.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=2}}
The local farmers and fishing communities in seven of the conservation mosaics, which included protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones, benefited from sustainable provision and use of
environmental goods and services.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=3}}

===Kenya===

In northern Kenya the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) organisation covers 19 community conservancies with more than {{convert|3000000|acre}} of wildlife habitat.  
The NRT Council of Elders agreed in May 2010 to found the  Nakuprat – Gotu Community Conservancy beside the [[Shaba National Reserve]] and the [[Ewaso Ng'iro]] river to promote conflict resolution and conserve nature.
The conservancy is part of a protected area mosaic that is a vital habitat for species that include the [[African elephant]] and the endangered [[Grévy's zebra]].{{sfn|Nakuprat Conservancy – Tusk}}

===United Kingdom===

A mosaic of protected areas has evolved in the United Kingdom, with a growing number of types of protected area, some as a result of European Union directives.
The objectives of nature conservation and landscape protection are treated as distinct.
The mosaic has evolved in a manner that results in duplication of effort and funding.
It could benefit from rationalisation and more flexible administration.{{sfn|Bishop|Phillips|Warren}}

===United States===

The protected area mosaics of the [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]], [[El Malpais National Monument|El Malpais]], [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro]] and [[Las Cienegas National Conservation Area|Las Cienegas]] areas in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona have been assembled by a variety of government and non-government organisations to protect the environment while respecting land use demands of the southwest of the United States.
This broad approach to ecosystem planning and management seems more fair and effective than former single-agency approaches.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=245}}
The Great Sand Dunes Monument Area combined various type of protected area to satisfy the objectives of the [[National Park Service]], [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other organizations, and to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem.
The result was similar to the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the [[Yukon]] in Canada.
Implementation was staged, with many interactions and adaptations over time.{{sfn|Day|Nelson|Sportza|2003|p=142}}

'''Qualified teacher status''' ('''QTS or QTLS''') is required in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to work as a [[teacher]] of children in [[public education|state schools]] under [[local authority]] control, and in [[special education]] schools. A similar status exists under a different name in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

==Gaining QTS==
An [[undergraduate degree]] and successful completion of a teacher training programme is compulsory for QTS recommendation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} One of the main routes to achieving QTS, for those already in possession of a degree, involves undertaking a postgraduate teacher training course, such as the [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE), or a School Direct programme. There are also some undergraduate degree qualifications leading to QTS, such as the [[Bachelor of Education]]. In [[England]] only, candidates must also pass [[QTS Skills Tests|professional skills tests]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qtsskillstests.com/about/|title=About {{!}} QTS Skills Tests|work=QTS Skills Tests|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; All candidates must have [[GCSE]]s at grade C or above in English and mathematics, and prospective primary teachers must also be in possession of (usually) a grade C in a science subject before embarking on teacher training.

All training which leads to qualified teacher status requires trainees to train across at least two key consecutive pupil age ranges, as defined in the Secretary of State's Requirements for Initial Teacher Training.&lt;ref name="tda"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/ittstandards/guidance_08/itt/R2_7.aspx|title=ITT requirements guidance|accessdate=2008-05-07|publisher=Training &amp; Development Agency for Schools|work=TDA website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age ranges are:

*Ages 3–5    (Early years foundation stage)
*Ages 5–7    (School years 1 and 2)	
*Ages 7–9    (School years 3 and 4)
*Ages 9–11   (School years 5 and 6)
*Ages 11–14  (School years 7 to 9)	
*Ages 14–16  (School years 10 and 11)
*Ages 16–19  (School years 12 and 13)
 
The [[Teaching Regulation Agency]] in England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/teaching-regulation-agency/about|website=Teaching Regulation Agency|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[General Teaching Council for Wales]] maintain all registrations, as well as issuing QTS certificates.

QTS is technically recognised only in the country it was awarded (England or Wales), but teachers can normally apply for QTS in other Home Countries relatively easily. QTS is also recognised by many other countries once the relevant paperwork has been completed, though many countries place a lot of importance on the route to QTS (such as requiring a PGCE, whilst not accepting the GTP). Teachers trained outside England and Wales must also apply to be awarded QTS if they wish to teach in these countries.

After having been awarded QTS teachers must normally still pass an [[Induction (teachers)|induction period]] (previously called 'probation') &amp;ndash; normally their first year of teaching. Teachers who have gained QTS but have not yet completed the Induction period are known as [[Newly Qualified Teacher|NQT]]s. NQTs who fail the induction still retain their QTS, but cannot teach in state-run schools. The induction period normally lasts a year (three school terms).

Not all [[European Union]] qualifications have been officially recognized yet, so one should confirm with one's education establishment as to whether one's qualifications are acceptable, or whether one needs to go through the recognition process.

===Routes to QTS===
Many different qualifications and courses lead to QTS:

====Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE)====
{{main|Postgraduate Certificate in Education}}
The PGCE is a one-year course for existing degree holders, and the most common postgraduate route into teaching. It is based at and coordinated by a [[university]] or other [[higher education]] institution, though students spend a large proportion of the course working in placement schools. The PGCE carries credits towards a [[master's degree]].

====School-Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT)====
{{main|School-Centred Initial Teacher Training}}
A SCITT programme enables graduates to undertake their training within a school environment, leading to QTS. Some SCITT programmes also award a PGCE qualification. It is available in England only.

====Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) ====
{{main|Graduate Teacher Programme}}
The GTP enables candidates to gain QTS while they are employed as an unqualified teacher in a school.

Both the graduate and registered teacher programmes (GTP and RTP) have been closed in England. The graduate teacher programme (GTP) has been replaced by the School Direct Training Programme (salaried).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://targetcourses.co.uk/study-areas/teaching/teacher-training-options}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Undergraduate QTS routes====
Students can take a three or four-year [[undergraduate degree]] course that includes QTS. This enables a candidate to gain their QTS while they study for their degree, with teaching practice being undertaken over the course of the whole programme. These are usually [[Bachelor of Education]] (BEd) degrees, though some are [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) and [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) degrees.

==Scotland and Northern Ireland==
QTS as such does not exist in Scotland or Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=J Hobson|first1=Andrew|last2=Tracey|first2=Louise|last3=Malderez|first3=Angi|title=Navigating Initial Teacher Training: Becoming a Teacher|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317723929|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as is the case in England and Wales, all teachers in Scotland and Northern Ireland are required to register with either the [[General Teaching Council for Scotland]] or the [[General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland]]; the General Teaching Councils will consider only [[graduation|graduate]]s with [[teaching qualification]]s (such as a [[Bachelor of Education|BEd]], [[Professional Graduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] or [[Professional Graduate Diploma in Education|PGDE]]) for registration.

In Northern Ireland, a one-year Induction programme (equivalent to the NQT programme in England and Wales) must be completed.

In Scotland, a one-year probation period (equivalent to induction in England and Wales) must be completed.

Those holding English or Welsh QTS (or an equivalent from another country) must apply for registration with the relevant General Teaching Council. Each case is considered individually;  even those with English or Welsh QTS are not guaranteed to be allowed to teach in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

== Schools not requiring QTS for teachers ==

There is no formal requirement for teachers at [[independent schools]] to have QTS.

As of 27 July 2012, there is no longer any requirement for teaching staff in [[Academy (English school)|academies]] to have QTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

'''Ramón Massó Tarruella''' (1928 - 2017) was a Spanish [[Communication|media and communications]] expert and a former [[Carlist]] politician.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Antiga Fabrica Borras i Masso.jpg|thumbnail|190px|left|Borràs &amp; Massó manufacture, [[Mataró]]]]
Ramón Massó Tarruella was born to an established, much branched and well-to-do [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[bourgeoisie]] family. His grandfather, [[Ramón Massó Marcer]], originated from the small seaside town of [[Sant Pere de Ribes]]. In 1885, during rapid expansion of the Catalan [[clothing]] manufacturing, he moved to Barcelona to set up his own business; he started a company specializing in [[dye]]s for the [[textile industry]] (his cousin, [[Ramón Oliveras Massó]], became an academic and taught [[chemistry]] in the Barcelona-based [[Escuela de Ingenieros Industriales]] until 1936). His son, [[Juan Massó Soler]], entered the family business in 1912 and developed it into a successful chemical company. Member of many Catalan commercial and trade institutions, he married Nuria Tarruella Riu.

The couple had 8 children, 3 sons (José Luis, Ramón, Juan Antonio) and 5 daughters (Montserrat, Isabel, Maria Amelia, Pilar and Nuria), all raised in a profoundly [[Catholic]] and traditional ambience. In the 1950s José Luis and Juan Antonio got engaged in the family company and later turned it into [[Comercial Química Massó Sociedad Anónima]], which expanded into new market sectors and remains active until today. In the early 1960s [[John Masso|Juan Antonio]] left the family enterprise and commenced studying [[canon law]], ordained as a [[priest]] in 1965; following his transfer to Australia he later became head ([[Vicar|Regional Vicar]]) of [[Opus Dei]] there, the position retained until his death.

As a child Ramón together with his family fled Barcelona, the city which fell under the [[CNT-FAI|anarchist]] control during the first months of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. The family settled in [[San Sebastián]] in the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|nationalist zone]]. The Massó boys joined [[Pelayos (Carlist Youth Organisation)|Pelayos]], the Carlist organization for older children animated mostly by the Catalan emigrees, but terminated their engagement following [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|amalgamation]] of the Carlist and [[Falangist]] juvenile organizations; as a kid Massó took part in the 1937 anti-unification demonstrations, allegedly shouting "death to Franco" and "death to Falange". Following the end of hostilities the family returned to Barcelona, where Ramón together with his brothers became a teenage member of the Catalan Opus Dei.

In late 1940s Massó moved to [[Madrid]] studying Filosofia y Letras to graduate in Philosophy (later he became also Técnico en Publicidad). During his university years he joined [[Agrupación de Estudiantes Tradicionalistas]], a technically illegal though tolerated Carlist student organization. Enraged by increasing marginalization of Carlism within the political realm of the [[Francoist Spain|regime]] he developed his childish anti-Falangist sentiments into a firm anti-Francoist outlook. Engaged in leafleting campaigns and skirmishes against the official [[:es:Sindicato Español Universitario|SEU]] organization, in 1954 Massó (recommended by the Carlist political leader [[Manuel Fal Conde]]) grew to the position of Delegado Nacional of AET.

==Aspiring Carlist==
[[File:Don Javier 1960.jpg|thumbnail|left|170px|Don Javier, 1960]]
Massó was increasingly disappointed by the perceived somnolent atmosphere of the movement's circulos, with the older generation trapped in recollections of the long gone days of glory. Highly emotional semi-clandestine 1956 attempts to dissuade the Carlist [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|claimant]] from a would-be dynastical union with the ''[[Alfonsism|Alfonsinos]]'' and to inspire him towards a decisive policy proved unsuccessful. The Massó-led ''aetistas'', upset with the diffident Don Javier, decided to focus on his eldest son [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Carlos Hugo]], with whom the group found common ground during his brief stay in Madrid en route to Portugal in 1955.
 
Carlos Hugo, at that time a [[French citizen]] completing PhD in economics in [[Oxford]], threw himself into the Spanish politics in liaison with Massó and his team. Following half a year spent quietly in [[Bilbao]] on improving his [[Castellano language|castellano]] and learning Spanish politics (his key tutor Massó just commenced teaching at the local [[Colegio Gaztelueta]]), the prince made a public debut during the annual Carlist amassment at [[Montejurra]] in May 1957. The entry, repeatedly rehearsed, meticulously planned and pre-agreed with the Carlist leadership, turned out to be a masterpiece of public appearance. The unexpected prince's presentation generated exploding enthusiasm of the crowd, excited by youth, optimism and royal firmness of the speaker (though the lecture contained only one reference to God and included phrases sounding like an offer to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]). Massó and his team ensured that ''La Proclama de Montejurra'' gets propagated in the Carlist circulos across Spain. In 1958 Carlos Hugo's speech – again carefully crafted by the prince, Massó and the team – called for profound change, put social issues on the forefront and contained a positive reference to Franco. During the following years the snowballing attendance at Montejurra transformed it from a Carlist-flavored local ''[[Via Crucis]]'' to the largest (save official, religious and football gatherings) public amassment in Francoist Spain. 
[[File:Charles-Hugues de Bourbon-Parme.jpg|thumbnail|180px|Carlos Hugo, 1964]]
The emergence of Carlos Hugo and the ''hugocarlistas'' coincided with the overall change in the Carlist strategy towards Francoism; in 1955 the intransigent Fal Conde was replaced as the movement's leader by a collective governing body, which initiated a new collaborative policy. Tactically Massó also opted for limited collaboration with Francoism (which cost him AET leadership in 1957), judging that gaining room for action is vital for his further aims.  However, while the new Carlist leader [[José María Valiente Soriano|José María Valiente]] sincerely hoped for some sort of prudent partnership between Francoism and Carlism, Massó aimed at dismantling the regime from within. Moreover, while Valiente oriented himself towards the army and bureaucracy, the hugocarlistas approached the hardcore [[syndicalist]] Falange sector, likewise promoting new social order and disdainful towards greedy capitalism.

The collaborative approach appeared to work: in the early 1960s the Carlists were granted a few media and organizational concessions. The ''hugocarlistas'' benefited the most, opening a number of new periodicals turned into their ideological tribunes (mostly ''Azada y asta'' and ''Montejurra''), galvanizing the chain of [[Círculos Culturales Vázquez de Mella]] and launching their own workers' organization, [[Movimiento Obrero Tradicionalista|MOT]], all of them becoming later dissemination channels of their political vision.

==Protagonist Carlist==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|210px|left|the Carlist standard]]
As Carlos Hugo moved to Madrid he organized the young collaborators, dubbed ''camarilla'' and headed by Massó, into his [[Secretaría Politica (of Carlos Hugo)|Secretaría Política]]. The partnership of the old and the young leaders seemed smooth, though some of the former started suspecting the latter of dangerously Leftist ideas. Backed by the aging claimant the ''hugocarlistas'' assumed more powers as the newly established [[Junta de Gobierno (Carlist body)|Junta de Gobierno]] diluted the authority of Valiente. Massó outplayed the chief opponent, [[José Luis Zamanillo González-Camino|José Luis Zamanillo]], marginalized him in 1962–1963 and finally got him expelled early 1964. From this moment on the ''hugocarlistas'' spelled out their vision of Carlism more openly; the same year they published ''Esquema doctrinal'', a lecture which avoided open challenge to Francoism and presented a monarchist [[Corporativism|corporative]] political organization combined with [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] principles. During the 1965 Montejurra the ''hugocarlistas'' voiced their praise of [[socialism]] and even [[Marxism]] at unprecedented levels.

It is not clear whether Massó intended to instaurate the Carlist dynasty by means of new social mobilization or he tried to promote profound transformation using Carlos Hugo as an agent of change; anyway, the two threads became intertwined. The immediate political objective of Massó was to prevent the Alfonsist restoration. The young Carlists dogged the ''juanista niño'', boycotting or jeering [[Juan Carlos]]; they publicly humiliated the royal prince and [[Sofia de Grecia|his wife]] a few times. At the same time, Massó engineered a campaign to promote Carlos Hugo across the country. The operation revealed much understanding of the media role in the [[consumer society]], as it exploited common [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] threads and kept feeding the press with new [[Scoop (term)|scoops]] (the prince as a miner in [[Asturias]], at a [[parachute]] course, at [[Sanfermines]]) and taking advantage of charm and youth of the prince's three sisters. The efforts proved fairly successful, as in the tightly [[Censorship|censured]] media the Borbon-Parmas gained sort of nationwide positive recognition.

The greatest scoop came in 1964, when Carlos Hugo married [[princess Irene of the Netherlands]]. At this point, however, the regime propaganda machine was firmly ordered to backtrack. Franco, though personally delighted that the [[House of Orange-Nassau|Dutch royal family]] (one of the harshest critics of his regime) was publicly humiliated by a Spanish royal hopeful, grew increasingly anxious that the popularity of Carlos Hugo might get him cornered when it comes to an inescapable dynastical decision. Despite wide TV coverage across Western Europe the Spanish media played down the event, which marked hard limits of Massó's strategy and got him bitterly disappointed.

In mid-1960s Massó realized that his strategy had failed; moreover, he realized that Leftist phraseology (with ''socialismo'' and ''autogestión'' most prominent catchwords) had divided and debilitated Carlism. In 1965 he loosened his ties with Carlos Hugo by moving from Madrid to [[Pamplona]], where he commenced teaching at the Opus Dei university. As opposition against his influence mounted from the orthodox [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] camp of Valiente and from the militantly Leftist group of [[José María de Zavala y Castella|José de Zavala]], in 1966 Massó ceased as head of Secretaría Política; in 1967 he and some of his collaborators handed their resignations and withdrew from politics. He remained loosely related to Carlism, e.g. shortly before death taking part in historical conference,

==Media pundit and academic==
[[File:IESE Campus.jpg|thumbnail|left|IESE (contemporary view)]]
In late 1960s Massó settled in Pamplona, working as an academic teacher at [[IESE Business School|Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa]] (IESE), a prestigious business school founded by Opus Dei back in 1958. It was there that he completed the Alta Dirección curriculum himself, a holistic leadership program offered to top corporate managers. Finally disillusioned with Opus Dei and with its role during the process of installing Juan Carlos as the future king of Spain, Massó broke with the organization and moved to Barcelona. In his native city he joined [[Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona]] (UAB), where he became ''catedratico'' in Departamento de publicidad at the Facultad de Ciencias de la Información.

Massó's small booklet ''Estrategia para unas extrañas elecciones'' (1977) earned him local media recognition  and triggered co-operation with ''[[La Vanguardia]]''; he became its key politics and public affairs commentator (until 1984). Massó experienced most of the Spanish [[Transition to democracy (Spain)|transition to democracy]] not as a protagonist but as a witness, periodically having a regular column in the Sunday issue. As a press pundit he was careful to remain within the limits of political science and styled himself as an unbiased scholarly observer, though his hostility to Francoism and support for reforms remained evident. In general opposed to [[sectarian]] politics, he occasionally kept referring to [[Lenin]] as a political authority. His commentary suggested also that Massó sort of put up with the royal function of Juan Carlos and with his role in the Spanish transition. In late 1970s together with his former Carlist collaborator [[José Antonio Parilla]] he engaged in the Nono Art publishing house and co-ordinated work on a popular series ''Breu História de Catalunya'' (1979–81).

In mid-1970s Massó co-founded Alas, one of the first media agencies in Spain and became head of its Barcelona branch. About the same time he launched the term "politing", intended as a merger of "politics" and "marketing" and meant as a specialized knowledge (if not a science itself) on the crossroads of [[social sciences]], [[public relations]] and [[politics]]. His work ''Introducción al “politing”. Lanzamiento de un aspirante'' (1976), apart from gaining official prizes (Premio Markedit, Premio Instituto Nacional de Publicidad), generated also significant interest among the academics, politicians and commentators.  The book was formatted as a systematic theoretical lecture on the basics of [[political marketing]], though it contained many explicit and implicit references to the 1957–1967 political experiences of the author. Relative success of launching Carlos Hugo became one of Masso's key credentials as a scholar in public relations and as a businessman running commercial (he claims authorship of [[La Caixa]] brand) and social (e.g. cancer awareness) media campaigns. He followed with another book, ''De la magia a la artesanía: el politing del cambio español''  (1980), becoming a nationwide recognised scholar and giving courses organised by [[Sociedad Española de Anunciantes]], I[[nstituto Nacional de Publicidad]] or [[Escuela Oficial de Radio y Television]].
[[File:Alblog5.png|thumbnail|communication model (sample)]]
In the 1990s Massó switched his focus to media with ''El exito de la cultura light: Anuncios y noticias'' (1993) and ''Noticias frente a hechos: Entender la realidad despues de leer los periodicos'' (1997). Later on he broadened his interest into the wider realm of public communication, focusing on combined multidimensional holistic forms and channels of information exchange named "integral communication". He co-founded the Barcelona-based [[Institut de Comunicació Integral]], an independent college specializing in [[marketing]], [[Brand|brand communications]] and [[public relations]], and became its president. ICOMI turned out to be a commercial (though not necessarily scientific) success and became a fashionable educational institute (incorporated into [[Abat Oliba CEU University|Universidad Abad Oliva CEU]] in 2003). During the last decade Massó published successive books on culture, communications and politics: ''Otro rey para España: crónica del lanzamiento y fracaso de Carlos Hugo'' (2004), ''Los últimos días de la Telecracia'' (with Enrique Nebot, 2009), ''Nacimiento y muerte de las marcas'' (with Joaquín García-Lavernia Gil, 2010), ''Navegando por el cachondeo de la historia'' (2012) and even a children's book, ''La segunda vida de Don Jos Kintana'' (1999). He maintaied [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] accounts, scarcely active during last years of his life.

==Reception==
[[File:Formal dinner in honour of King Juan Carlos 2 (crop).jpg|thumbnail|180px|left|Juan Carlos de Borbón]]
In the 1990s, looking back on his political past, Massó admitted defeat at the hands of a competitive group of [[Machiavellian]] players coming from the same Opus Dei hotbed (especially [[Laureano López Rodó|López Rodó]]), who outplayed him by dismantling Francoism with technocratic strategy and with Juan Carlos as a better marketed and better designed version of Carlos Hugo. He denied charges that he had implanted Marxism within the Carlist realm; he rather pointed to the Juan Vázquez de Mella heritage, based on ''sociedalismo'' and the concept of [[:es:Democracia orgánica|organic society]].
 
In historiography Massó remains a rather divisive and ambiguous figure, with little agreement as to his role and intentions. Some historians (Payne, Bartyzel) maintain that he unleashed forces which either destroyed Carlism or turned it into its own [[antinomy]]. Some historians (Clemente, Martorell Pérez) claim that he helped to safeguard Carlist identity or at least contributed to emphasizing genuine Carlism and sidetracking its accidental threads.  Some historians (MacClancy, Caspistegui Gorasurreta) suggest that he commenced the process of redirecting Carlism from traditional and orthodox path to a new formula. Some historians (Perez-Nievas) do not consider Massó worth mentioning and present de Zavala as the leader of the group.

According to one group of studies (Martorell Pérez, MacClancy) Massó was primarily motivated by dynastical objectives, according to another (Clemente) he was not a monarchist at all. There are scholars (Bartyzel) who consider him a radical Leftist approximate to Marxism, there are others (Clemente) who consider him a "neocapitalist technocrat". Certain works (Martorell Pérez, in line with Masso's own later narration) present Carlos Hugo as a politician invented and created by Massó, certain works (Clemente) present Massó as Carlos Hugo's sidekick, useful at one political phase and to be replaced at the following one. Massó's departure from politics is explained by failure of his policy (Martorell Pérez), by Carlos Hugo's decision to replace him (Clemente), by his alleged falling in love with one of Carlos Hugo's sisters (Fraga), by pressure from Opus Dei (Lavardín), by combined efforts of enemies from the Right like Valiente and from the Left like de Zavala (Pérez Madrigal) or by pure greed (Zabala).
[[File:Carlism, Concepts, Context and Time.jpg|thumbnail|Carlist concepts over time]]
One thing most historians agree on is that Massó proved instrumental in dismantling Traditionalist Carlism (though they do not agree whether a non-Traditionalist Carlism can actually exist). None of the currently operating Carlist grouplets admits deference to Massó. Traditionalists ([[Carloctavismo|carloctavistas]], [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma|sixtinos]], [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista|CTC]]) tend to view him as a turncoat, the progressives ([[Carlist Party (1970)|Partido Carlista]], [[Carlos, Duke of Parma|javierocarlistas]]) tend to view him as merely a former [[:ru:Попутчик (жаргон)|fellow-traveller]].

Before death he dedicated his future corpse to scientific research, and hence there was no funeral arranged and there is no grave. His death was acknowledged on few websites related to Partido Carlista, though not by major Spanish media.

'''Red tide''' is a common name for a worldwide phenomenon known as an [[algae bloom]] (large concentrations of aquatic microorganisms—protozoans or unicellular algae) when it is caused by species of [[dinoflagellate]]s and other algae. The upwelling of nutrients from the sea floor from massive storms is most likely the cause of these events.

== Overview ==
Certain species of phytoplankton and dinoflagellates found in red tides contain photosynthetic pigments that vary in color from brown to red. When the algae are present in high concentrations, the water appears to be discolored or murky, varying in color from a rust color to pink to blood red. Specifically, red tide species can be found in oceans, bays, and places where fresh water meets salt water, but they can not thrive in freshwater environments due to the lack of salinity. The growth of the algal bloom depends on wind, temperature, nutrients, and salinity.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, Frank. "An Assessment of Florida red tide: Causes, Consequences and Management Strategies." 2007. 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some red tide algal blooms are associated with fish kills. The production of natural toxins such as [[brevetoxin]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/health/brevetoxin.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723194047/http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/health/brevetoxin.pdf# |archive-date=2017-07-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ichthyotoxins are harmful to marine life. Generally, red tides are described as [[harmful algal bloom]]s. The most conspicuous effects of these kinds of red tides are the associated wildlife mortalities, as well as harmful human exposure.

== Harmful toxins produced by the red tide ==

=== Marine life exposure ===
Red tides occur naturally off coasts all over the world. Not all red tides have toxins or are harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/fileserver.do?id=47320&amp;pt=10&amp;p=18553|title=Red Tides: Questions and Answers|last=Gregg W. Langlois|first=Pamela D. Tom|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where red tides occur, dead fish wash up on shore for up to two weeks after a red tide has been through the area. In addition to killing fish, the toxic algae contaminate shellfish. Some mollusks are not susceptible to the toxin, and store it in their fatty tissues. Shellfish consume the organisms responsible for red tide and concentrate [[saxitoxin]] (produced from these organisms) in their tissues. Saxitoxin blocks [[sodium channel]]s and ingestion can cause [[paralysis]] within 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/faq.phtml#q9|title=Red Tide FAQ – Is it safe to eat oysters during a red tide?|publisher=www.tpwd.state.tx.us|accessdate=2009-08-23}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals that eat the shellfish are susceptible to the neurotoxin, leading to neurotoxic shellfish poisoning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Sharon M. |last1=Watkins |first2=Andrew |last2=Reich |first3=Lora E. |last3=Fleming |first4=Roberta |last4=Hammond |title=Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning |journal=Marine Drugs |year=2008 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=431–455 |doi=10.3390/md20080021 |pmid=19005578 |pmc=2579735}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes even death. Most mollusks and clams filter feed, which results in higher concentrations of the toxin than just drinking the water.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Brand et al., Larry E., Lisa Campbell, Eileen Bresnan. "Karenia: The biology and ecology of a toxic genus." Harmful Algae 14 (2012): 156–178. 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scaup]], for example, are [[diving ducks]] whose diet mainly consists of mollusks. When scaup eat the filter-feeding shellfish that are concentrated with high levels of the red tide toxin, their population along with other types of diving ducks become a prime target for poisoning. However, even birds that do not eat mollusks can be affected by simply eating dead fish on the beach or drinking the water, as in the Peking duck experiment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Forrester et al., Donald J., Jack M. Gaskin, Franklin H. White. "AN EPIZOOTIC OF WATERFOWL IN FLORIDA." Journal of Wildlife Diseases 13 (1997): 160–167.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2018}} The toxins released by the blooms can kill marine animals including [[dolphin]]s, sea turtles, birds, and [[Manatee|manatees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://start1.org/red-tide/effects/ | title=Red Tide &amp; Red Algae Effects | date=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/aquatic-toxins/_documents/red-tide-rack-card-2014-two-up-897kb.pdf | title=Top 10 Red Tide Facts |publisher=Florida Department of Health | date=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine dinoflagellates produce ichthyotoxins. Fish such as Atlantic herring, American pollock, winter flounder, Atlantic salmon, and cod were dosed orally with these toxins in an experiment. Within minutes of receiving doses of the toxin, fish started to exhibit a loss of equilibrium and began to swim in an irregular, jerking pattern followed by paralysis and shallow, arrhythmic breathing and eventually death after about an hour.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;White, A. W. "Sensitivity of Marine Fishes to Toxins from the Red-Tide Dinoflagellate Gonyaulax excavata and Implications for Fish Kills." Marine Biology 65 (1981): 255–260. 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists concluded that the toxic red tide had negative effects on fish that were exposed to it.

=== Human exposure ===
Humans are affected by the red tide species by ingesting improperly harvested shellfish, breathing in aerosolized brevetoxins (i.e. PbTx or ''Ptychodiscus'' toxins) and in some cases skin contact. The brevetoxins bind to [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s, important structures of cell membranes. Binding results in persistent activation of nerve cells, which interferes with neural transmission leading to health problems. These toxins are created within the unicellular organism, or as a metabolic product.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10646-008-0241-x|pmid=18758951|pmc=2683401|title=Harmful algal toxins of the Florida red tide (Karenia brevis): Natural chemical stressors in South Florida coastal ecosystems|journal=Ecotoxicology|volume=17|issue=7|pages=623–631|year=2008|last1=Pierce|first1=R. H.|last2=Henry|first2=M. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major types of brevetoxin compounds have similar but distinct backbone structures. PbTx-2 is the primary intracellular brevetoxin produced by ''K. brevis'' blooms. However, over time, the PbTx-2 brevetoxin can be converted to PbTx-3 through metabolic changes.&lt;ref name="doi.org" /&gt; Researchers found that PbTx-2 has been the primary intracellular brevetoxin that converts overtime into PbTx-3.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, R.H., M. S. Henry. "Harmful algal toxins of the Florida red tide (Karenia brevis): natural chemical stressors in South Florida coastal ecosystems." Ecotoxicology (2008): 623–631. 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; When the cells rupture, they release extracellular brevetoxins into the environment. Some of those stay in the ocean, while other particles get aerosolized. During onshore winds, brevetoxins can become aerosolized by bubble-mediated transport, causing respiratory irritation, bronchoconstriction, coughing, and wheezing, among other symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Backer et al., Lorraine C., Laura E. Flemming, Alan Rowan. "Recreational exposure to aerosolized brevetoxins during Florida red tide events." Harmful Algae 2 (2003): 19–28. 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; On a windy day,  avoiding contact with the aerosolized toxin is recommended. These individuals report a decrease in respiratory function after only 1 hour of exposure to a ''K. brevis'' red-tide beach and these symptoms may last for days.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming LE, Kirkpatrick B, Backer LC, et al. Initial evaluation of the effects of aerosolized Florida red tide toxins (brevetoxins) in persons with asthma. Environ Health Perspect. 2005;113:650–657.&lt;/ref&gt; People with severe or persistent respiratory conditions (such as chronic lung disease or asthma) may experience stronger adverse reactions.  The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[National Ocean Service]] provides a public conditions report identifying possible respiratory irritation impacts in areas affected by red tides.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/hab/|title=Harmful Algal Bloom Operational Forecast System|publisher=www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/hab/|accessdate=2012-02-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases like in the U.S., the seafood consumed by humans is tested regularly for toxins by the USDA to ensure safe consumption. However, improper harvesting of shellfish can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and neurotoxic shellfish poisoning in humans. Some symptoms include drowsiness, diarrhea, nausea, loss of motor control, tingling, numbing or aching of extremities, incoherence, and respiratory paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc=1637787|year=2000|last1=Van Dolah|first1=F. M.|title=Marine algal toxins: Origins, health effects, and their increased occurrence|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=108|issue=Suppl 1|pages=133–141|pmid=10698729|doi=10.1289/ehp.00108s1133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, reports of skin irritation after swimming in the ocean during a red tide are common, so people should try to avoid the red tide when it is in the area.

[[File:Karenia brevis Anatomy (1).png|thumb|The dinoflagellate labeled above is the microscopic alga'' [[Karenia brevis]]''. It is the cause of red tide in the Gulf of Mexico. The algae propel themselves using a longitudinal flagellum (A) and a transverse flagellum (B). The longitudinal flagellum lies in a groove-like structure called the cingulum (F). The [[dinoflagellate]] is separated into an upper portion called the epitheca (C) where the apical horn resides (E) and a lower portion called the hypotheca (D).]]

Red tide is a colloquial term used to refer to one of a variety of natural phenomena known as [[harmful algal bloom]]s. The term specifically refers to blooms of a species of [[dinoflagellate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hab/redtide/default.htm|title=Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs): Red Tide|publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being phased out among researchers because:

# Red tides are not necessarily red and many have no discoloration at all.
# They are unrelated to movements of the tides.
# The term is imprecisely used to refer to a wide variety of algal species that are known as bloom-formers.

As a technical term, it is being replaced in favor of more precise terminology, including the generic term "harmful algal bloom" for harmful species, and "algal bloom" for benign species.

=== On the U.S. coasts ===
The term red tide is most often used in the US to refer to ''Karenia brevis'' blooms in the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]], also called the Florida red tide. ''K. brevis'' is one of many different species of the genus ''Karenia'' found in the world's oceans.
&lt;ref name="Fleming, L. E. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleming |first1=L.E. |last2=Kirkpatrick |first2=B. |last3=Backer |first3=L.C. |last4=Walsh |first4=C.J. |last5=Nierenberg |first5=K. |last6=Clark |first6=J. |last7=et al |date=2011 |title=Review of Florida red tide and human health effects |url= |journal=Harmful Algae |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=224–233 |doi=10.1016/j.hal.2010.08.006|pmid=21218152 |pmc=3014608 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major advances have occurred  in the study of dinoflagellates and their genomics. Some include identification of the toxin-producing genes ([[Polyketide synthase|''PKS'']] genes), exploration of environmental changes (temperature, light/dark, etc.) have on gene expression, as well as an appreciation of the complexity of the ''Karenia'' genome.&lt;ref name="Fleming, L. E. 2011" /&gt; These blooms have been documented since the 1800s, and occur almost annually along Florida's coasts.&lt;ref name="Fleming, L. E. 2011" /&gt; There was increased research activity of HABs in the 1980s and 1990s. This was primarily driven by media attention from the discovery of new HAB organisms and the potential adverse health effects of their exposure to animals and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham and Baden, 2006; Backer et al., 2003a, 2005a; Backer and Fleming, 2008; Fleming et al., 2001; Fleming et al., 2004; Okamoto and Fleming, 2005; Twiner et al., 2008; Zaias et al., 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} The Florida red tides have been observed to have spread as far as the eastern coast of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Fleming, L. E. 2011" /&gt; The density of these organisms during a bloom can exceed tens of millions of cells per litre of seawater, and often discolor the water a deep reddish-brown hue.

Red tide is also sometimes used to describe harmful algal blooms on the northeast coast of the United States, particularly in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. This type of bloom is caused by another species of dinoflagellate known as ''[[Alexandrium fundyense]]''. These blooms of organisms cause severe disruptions in [[fishery|fisheries]] of these waters, as the toxins in these organism cause filter-feeding shellfish in affected waters to become poisonous for human consumption due to saxitoxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/10/13/red-tide-fact-sheet-english.pdf |title=Red Tide (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015 |publisher=Massachusetts Department of Public Health |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related  ''[[Alexandrium monilatum]]'' is found in subtropical or tropical shallow seas and [[Estuary|estuaries]] in the western [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Caribbean Sea]], the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]].

=== Factors that may contribute to a bloom ===
[[File:Red tide.jpg|thumb|right|Red tide (NOAA)]]Red tides contain dense concentrations of organisms and appear as discolored water, often reddish-brown in color. It is a natural phenomenon, but the exact cause or combination of factors that result in a red tide outbreak are not necessarily known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/faq.phtml |title=Red Tide FAQ |publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department |location=Austin, TX |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, three key factors are thought to play an important role in a bloom - salinity, temperature, and wind. Red tides cause economic harm, so outbreaks are carefully monitored. For example, the [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission]]  provides an up-to-date status report on  red tides in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.myfwc.com/features/view_article.asp?id=9670 |title=Red Tide Current Status Statewide Information |publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822163316/http://research.myfwc.com/features/view_article.asp?id=9670 |archivedate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] also provides a status report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/ |title=Red Tide Index |publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no  particular cause of red tides has been found,  many different factors can contribute to their presence. These factors can include [[water pollution]], which originates from sources such as human [[sewage]] and [[Agricultural pollution|agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name="West, L. 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environment.about.com/od/redtidesfaq/f/red_tide_causes.htm |title=Red Tide: Causes and Effects |author=West, L. |date=2016 |publisher=''About News''}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The occurrence of red tides in some locations appears to be entirely natural (algal blooms are a seasonal occurrence resulting from coastal upwelling, a natural result of the movement of certain ocean currents)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trainer |first1=VL |last2=Adams |first2=NG |last3=Bill |first3=BD |last4=Stehr |first4=CM |last5=Wekell |first5=JC |last6=Moeller |first6=P |last7=Busman |first7=M |last8=Woodruff |first8=D |year=2000 |title=Domoic acid production near California coastal upwelling zones, June (1998) |url = |journal=Limnol Oceanogr |volume=45 |issue= 8|pages=1818–1833 |doi=10.4319/lo.2000.45.8.1818|bibcode= 2000LimOc..45.1818T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=NG |last2=Lesoing |first2=M |last3=Trainer |first3=VL |year= 2000 |title=Environmental conditions associated with domoic acid in razor clams on the Washington coast |url= |journal=J Shellfish Res |volume=19 |issue= |pages=1007–1015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in others they appear to be a result of increased [[nutrient pollution]] from human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Lam CWY, Ho KC (1989) Red tides in Tolo Harbor, Hong Kong. In: Okaichi T, Anderson DM, Nemoto T (eds) Red tides. Biology, environmental science and toxicology. Elsevier, New York, pp 49–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of marine phytoplankton is generally limited by the availability of [[nitrates]] and [[phosphates]], which can be abundant in agricultural run-off as well as coastal upwelling zones. Coastal water pollution produced by humans and systematic increase in [[global warming|seawater temperature]] have also been implicated as contributing factors in red tides.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Other factors such as iron-rich dust influx from large desert areas such as the Sahara Desert are thought to play a major role in causing red tides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |display-authors=et al |year=2006 |title=Red tides in the Gulf of Mexico: Where, when, and why? |url=http://works.bepress.com/kendall_carder/7 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=111 |issue= C11003|pages=1–46 |doi=10.1029/2004JC002813 |pmid=20411040 |bibcode=2006JGRC..11111003W |pmc=2856968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some algal blooms on the Pacific Coast have also been linked to occurrences of large-scale climatic oscillations such as [[El Niño]] events. While red tides in the Gulf of Mexico have been occurring since the time of early explorers such as [[Cabeza de Vaca]],&lt;ref&gt;Cabeza de Vaca, Álvar Núnez. La Relación (1542). Translated by Martin A. dunsworth and José B. Fernández. Arte Público Press, Houston, Texas (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  what initiates these blooms and how large a role [[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] and natural factors play in their development is unclear. Whether the apparent increase in frequency and severity of algal blooms in various parts of the world is in fact a real increase or is due to increased observation effort and advances in species identification methods is also debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sellner |first=K.G. |author2=Doucette G.J. |author3=Kirkpatrick G.J. |year=2003 |title=Harmful Algal blooms: causes, impacts and detection |journal=Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology |pmid=12898390 |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=383–406 |doi=10.1007/s10295-003-0074-9 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptybc0qg8y4klr5c/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Dolah |first=F.M. |year=2000 |title=Marine Algal Toxins: Origins, Health Effects, and Their Increased Occurrence |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=108 |pmid=10698729 |issue=suppl.1 |pages=133–141 |pmc=1637787 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2000/suppl-1/133-141vandolah/abstract.html |doi=10.2307/3454638 |jstor=3454638 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120150050/http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2000/suppl-1/133-141vandolah/abstract.html |archivedate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing temperature, enhanced surface stratification, alteration of ocean currents, intensification or weakening of local nutrient [[upwelling]], stimulation of [[photosynthesis]] by elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, reduced calcification through [[ocean acidification]], and heavy precipitation and storm events causing changes in land runoff and micronutrient availability may all produce contradictory species- or even strain-specific responses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hallegraeff |first=Gustaaf M. |date=2010-04-01 |title=Ocean Climate Change, Phytoplankton Community Responses, and Harmful Algal Blooms: A Formidable Predictive Challenge1 |journal=Journal of Phycology |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=220–235 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2010.00815.x |issn=1529-8817}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of harmful algal blooms (HABs), we can expect: (i) range expansion of warm-water species at the expense of cold-water species, which are driven poleward; (ii) species-specific changes in the abundance and seasonal window of growth of HAB taxa; (iii) earlier timing of peak production of some [[phytoplankton]]; and (iv) secondary effects for marine food webs, notably when individual zooplankton and fish grazers are differentially impacted by climate change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the potential consequences of these changes for HABs have received relatively little attention and are not well understood.

[[Image:Soybean-root-nodules.jpg|thumb|right|Root nodules, each containing billions of ''[[Rhizobiaceae]]'' bacteria]]
'''Rhizobia''' are [[bacteria]] that [[Nitrogen fixation|fix]] [[nitrogen]] ([[diazotrophs]]) after becoming established inside [[root nodule]]s of [[legume]]s ([[Fabaceae]]). To express genes for [[nitrogen fixation]], rhizobia require a [[plant]] [[Host (biology)|host]]; they cannot independently fix nitrogen.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zahran|first=H. H.|date=1999-12-01|title=Rhizobium-legume symbiosis and nitrogen fixation under severe conditions and in an arid climate|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews: MMBR|volume=63|issue=4|pages=968–989, table of contents|issn=1092-2172|pmc=98982|pmid=10585971}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, they are [[Gram staining|Gram-negative]], [[Motility|motile]], non-[[sporogenesis|sporulating]] rods.

== History ==
The first known [[species]] of rhizobia, ''Rhizobium leguminosarum'', was identified in 1889, and all further species were initially placed in the ''[[Rhizobium]]'' [[genus]]. Most research has been done on [[crop]] and [[forage]] legumes such as [[clover]], [[alfalfa]], [[bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and [[soy]]; more research is being done on North American legumes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Taxonomy ==
Rhizobia are a [[paraphyletic]] group that fall into two [[Class (biology)|classes]] of the [[proteobacteria]]&amp;mdash;the alpha- and beta-proteobacteria. As shown below, most belong to the order [[Rhizobiales]], but several rhizobia occur in distinct bacterial orders of the proteobacteria.&lt;ref name="The current taxonomy of rhizobia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhizobia.co.nz/taxonomy/rhizobia.html|accessdate=2013-12-02|title=Current taxonomy of rhizobia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="notrhizobia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhizobia.co.nz/taxonomy/not-rhizobia|accessdate=2013-12-02|title=Bacteria confused with rhizobia, including ''Agrobacterium'' taxonomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edzna.ccg.unam.mx/rhizobial-taxonomy/node/4|accessdate=2013-12-02|title=Taxonomy of legume nodule bacteria (rhizobia) and agrobacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}&lt;!-- I listed Sinorhizobium species as such rather than Ensifer because despite the ruling by the Judicial Commission of the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes, Sinorhizobium continues to be preferentially used in the scientific literature. The ability of Burkholderia cepacia and/or Burkholderia dolosa to nodulate has been called into question, so I've removed both. I excluded Bradyrhizobium betae (shown on the ICSP list) because it is tumorigenic, but doesn't form symbiotic nodules. I excluded Mesorhizobium thiogangeticum (shown on the ICSP list) because while it was isolated from a legume rhizosphere, its ability to nodulate has never been demonstrated.I excluded Rhizobium aggregatum because its nodulation status is unknown. I excluded Rhizobium endophyticum because it is an endophyte and incapable of nodulation (unless transformed). I followed Dr. Weir's lead in including Phyllobacterium ifriqiyense and Phyllobacterium leguminum since both are valid and were isolated from functional root nodules. I included Rhizobium lupini from the ICSP list and Rhizobium miluonense, Sinorhizobium abri, and Sinorhizobium indiaense from Dr. Weir's list, all of which are valid and form symbiotic nodules. I excluded Sinorhizobium morelense and Sinorhizobium xinjiangense because their status as unique species has been challenged. I excluded Herbaspirillum lusitanum because it is not known to nodulate.--&gt;

These groups include a variety of non-[[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria. For instance, the plant [[pathogen]] ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' is a closer relative of ''Rhizobium'' than the ''Bradyrhizobium'' that nodulate soybean (and might not really be a separate genus). The [[gene]]s responsible for the [[symbiosis]] with plants,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=John, T.|title=Evolution of rhizobia by acquisition of a 500-kb symbiosis island that integrates into a phe-tRNA gene|journal=PNAS|date=11 December 1997|volume=95|issue=9|pages=5145–5149|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.9.5145|pmid=9560243|pmc=20228|bibcode=1998PNAS...95.5145S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance in agriculture ==
[[Image:Rhizobia nodules on Vigna unguiculata.jpg|thumb|right|Rhizobia nodules on ''[[Vigna unguiculata]]'']]
Although much of the nitrogen is removed when [[protein]]-rich [[Cereal|grain]] or [[hay]] is [[harvest]]ed, significant amounts can remain in the soil for future crops. This is especially important when nitrogen [[fertilizer]] is not used, as in [[organic farming|organic]] [[Crop rotation|rotation schemes]] or some less-[[Industrialisation|industrialized]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bionewsonline.com/y/what_is_rhizobia.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120720012116/http://www.bionewsonline.com/y/what_is_rhizobia.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-20 | title = What is Rhizobia | accessdate = 2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nitrogen]] is the most commonly deficient nutrient in many soils around the world and it is the most commonly supplied plant nutrient. Supply of nitrogen through [[fertilizers]] has severe [[Fertilizer#Risks of fertilizer use|environmental concerns]].

Rhizobia is "the group of soil bacteria that infect the roots of legumes to form [[root nodules]]".&lt;ref name="Herridge2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herridge|first1=David|title=Rhizobial Inoculants|journal=GRDC|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhizobia are found in the soil and after infection, produce nodules in the [[legume]] where they fix nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the atmosphere turning it into a more readily useful form of nitrogen. From here, the nitrogen is exported from the nodules and used for growth in the legume. Once the legume dies, the nodule breaks down and releases the rhizobia back into the soil where they can live individually or reinfect a new legume host.&lt;ref name="Herridge2013" /&gt;

Specific strains of rhizobia are required to make functional nodules on the roots able to fix the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rachaputi|first1=Rao|last2=Halpin|first2=Neil|last3=Seymour|first3=Nikki|last4=Bell|first4=Mike|title=rhizobium inoculation|url=https://www.daff.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/58946/Rhizobium-brochure.pdf|publisher=GRDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having this specific rhizobia present is beneficial to the legume, as the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation can increase crop yield.&lt;ref name="Catroux2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Catroux|first1=Gerard|last2=Hartmann|first2=Alain|last3=Revillin|first3=Cecile|title=Trends in rhizobium inoculant production and use|date=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|pages=21–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inoculation with rhizobia tends to increase yield.&lt;ref name=Chapter5&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Larry C.|last2=Salmeron|first2=Montserrat|last3=Ashlock|first3=Lanny|title=Arkansas Soybean Production Handbook - MP197|date=2013|chapter=Chapter 5|chapter-url=http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/mp197/chapter5.pdf|chapter-format=PDF|publisher=University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service|location=Little Rock, AR|page=5|url=http://www.uaex.edu/publications/mp-197.aspx|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legume inoculation has been an agriculture practice for many years and has continuously improved over time.&lt;ref name="Catroux2001" /&gt; 12–20 million hectares of soybeans are inoculated annually. The technology to produce these inoculants are microbial fermenters. An ideal inoculant includes some of the following aspects; maximum efficacy, ease of use, compatibility, high rhizobial concentration, long shelf-life, usefulness under varying field conditions, and survivability.&lt;ref name="Catroux2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shrestha2011"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shrestha|first1=R|last2=Neupane|first2=RK|last3=Adhikari|first3=NP|title=Status and Future Prospects of Pulses in Nepal|url=http://www.doanepal.gov.np/downloadfile/Current%20Status%20SAARC_paper-Nepal_1320838291.pdf|publisher=Government of Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=J.

Many poor countries have trouble with the introduction of new crops and reaching attainable yield. As they introduce new crops into their soils, these inoculants may foster legume growth and success in the area, therefore giving farmers more options for planting.  Using these inoculants provide many other benefits as well such as not having to use nitrogen fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephens|first1=J.H.G|last2=Rask|first2=H.M|title=Inoculant production and formulation|date=2000|publisher=MicroBio RhizoGen Corporation|location=Saskatoon|pages=249–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the nodulation process, after the harvest of the crop there are higher levels of soil nitrate, which can then be used by the next crop, and little to no nitrogen fertilizer is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Adam|title=Opening New Markets and Increasing Canadian Exports Generates Jobs—Creating Benefits for Middle-Class Families: Report|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2012/09/11a.aspx?lang=eng|publisher=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many poor farmers do not have access to fertilizers, so the sustainability of rhizobial inoculum is an important aspect in saving money for the essentials.

It has also been stated that "cereals were healthier and higher yielding when grown after a legume".&lt;ref name="Herridge2013" /&gt; Cereals are another major crop, so if integrated in a crop rotation with legumes, then rhizobium inoculation can be very beneficial to crops other than legumes.&lt;ref name="Shrestha2011" /&gt; Increasing the possible amount of yield for multiple crops would help farmers very much in growing their current food production as well to help close the gap between current yield and potential yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shercan|first1=D.P|last2=Karki|first2=K.B|title=Plant nutrient management for improving crop productivity in Nepal|date=n.d.|publisher=Nepal Agriculture Research Council|location=Nepal|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbiotic relationship ==
Rhizobia are unique in that they are the only nitrogen-fixing bacteria living in a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with [[legumes]]. Common crop and forage legumes are peas, beans, clover, and soy.

===Infection and signal exchange===
The formation of the symbiotic relationship involves a signal exchange between both partners that leads to mutual recognition and development of symbiotic structures. The most well understood mechanism for the establishment of this symbiosis is through intracellular infection. Rhizobia are free living in the soil until they are able to sense [[flavonoid]]s, derivatives of 2-phenyl-1.4-benzopyrone, which are secreted by the roots of their host plant triggering the accumulation of a large population of cells and eventuallly attachment to [[root hair]]s.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/857863493|title=Brock biology of microorganisms|last=M.,|first=Martinko, John|last2=1977-|first2=Bender, Kelly S.,|last3=Hezekiah),|first3=Buckley, Daniel H.

This is followed by continuous cell proliferation resulting in the formation of the [[root nodule]].&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; A second mechanism, used especially by rhizobia which infect aquatic hosts, is called crack entry. In this case, no root hair deformation is observed. Instead the bacteria penetrate between cells, through cracks produced by lateral root emergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgante|first=Carolina|last2=Angelini|first2=Jorge|last3=Castro|first3=Stella|last4=Fabra|first4=Adriana|date=2005-08-01|title=Role of rhizobial exopolysaccharides in crack entry/intercellular infection of peanut|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071705000234|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=37|issue=8|pages=1436–1444|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2004.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the nodule, the bacteria differentiate morphologically into '''bacteroids''' and fix atmospheric nitrogen into [[ammonium]], using the enzyme [[nitrogenase]]. [[Ammonium]] is then converted into amino acids like [[glutamine]] and [[asparagine]] before it is exported to the plant.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In return, the plant supplies the bacteria with [[carbohydrate]]s in the form of organic acids.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; The plant also provides the bacteroid oxygen for [[cellular respiration]], tightly bound by [[Leghemoglobin|leghaemoglobins]], plant proteins similar to human [[hemoglobin]]s. This process keeps the nodule oxygen poor in order to prevent the inhibition of [[nitrogenase]] activity.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Recently, a ''[[Bradyrhizobium]]'' strain was discovered to form nodules in ''[[Aeschynomene]]'' without producing nod factors, suggesting the existence of alternative communication signals other than nod factors, possibly involving the secretion of the plant hormone cytokinin.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okazaki|first=Shin|last2=Tittabutr|first2=Panlada|last3=Teulet|first3=Albin|last4=Thouin|first4=Julien|last5=Fardoux|first5=Joël|last6=Chaintreuil|first6=Clémence|last7=Gully|first7=Djamel|last8=Arrighi|first8=Jean-François|last9=Furuta|first9=Noriyuki|date=2016-01-01|title=Rhizobium–legume symbiosis in the absence of Nod factors: two possible scenarios with or without the T3SS|url=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v10/n1/full/ismej2015103a.html|journal=The ISME Journal|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=64–74|doi=10.1038/ismej.2015.103|issn=1751-7362|pmc=4681849|pmid=26161635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that root nodules can be formed spontaneously in ''[[Medicago]]'' without the presence of rhizobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968919649|title=Advances in Molecular Genetics of Plant-microbe Interactions Vol. 3 Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Molecular Plant-microbe Interactions, Edinburgh, U.k., June 1994|last=J.|first=Daniels, Michael|last2=Allan|first2=Downie, J.|last3=E.|first3=Osbourn, Anne|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=9789401040792|oclc=968919649}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the development of the nodule is controlled entirely by the plant and simply triggered by the secretion of [[nod factor]]s.

===Nature of the mutualism===
The legume–rhizobium [[symbiosis]] is a classic example of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]&amp;mdash;rhizobia supply ammonia or [[amino acids]] to the plant and in return receive organic acids (principally as the [[dicarboxylic acid]]s [[Malic acid|malate]] and [[Succinic acid|succinate]]) as a carbon and energy source. However, because several unrelated strains infect each individual plant, a classic [[tragedy of the commons]] scenario presents itself. Cheater strains may hoard plant resources such as [[polyhydroxybutyrate]] for the benefit of their own [[reproduction]] without fixing an appreciable amount of [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ratcliff|first1=W.C.|last2=Kadam|first2=S.V.|last3=Denison|first3=R.F.|title=Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) supports survival and reproduction in starving rhizobia|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|date=2008|volume=65|issue=3|pages=391–399|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00544.x|pmid=18631180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the costs involved in nodulation and the opportunity for rhizobia to cheat, it may be surprising that this symbiosis should exist at all.

===The sanctions hypothesis===
There are two main hypotheses for the mechanism that maintains legume-rhizobium symbiosis (though both may occur in nature). The '''sanctions hypothesis''' theorizes that legumes cannot recognize the more parasitic or less nitrogen fixing rhizobia, and must counter the parasitism by post-infection legume sanctions. In response to underperforming rhizobia, legume hosts can respond by imposing sanctions of varying severity to their nodules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiers|first1=E. Toby|title=Measured sanctions: legume hosts detect quantitative variation in rhizobium cooperation and punish accordingly|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|date=2006|volume=8|pages=1077–1086|url=http://www.tobykiers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/14.-Kiers_EER_2006.pdf|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These sanctions include, but are not limited to reduction of nodule growth, early nodule death, decreased carbon supply to nodules, or [[Reduced fare program|reduced]] [[oxygen]] supply to nodules that fix less nitrogen. Within a nodule, some of the bacteria differentiate into nitrogen fixing bacteroids, which have been found to be unable to reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Denison | first1 = R. F. | year = 2000 | title = Legume sanctions and the evolution of symbiotic cooperation by rhizobia | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 156 | issue = 6| pages = 567–576 | doi=10.1086/316994| pmid = 29592542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, with the development of a symbiotic relationship, if the host sanctions hypothesis is correct, the host sanctions must act toward whole nodules rather than individual bacteria because individual targeting sanctions would prevent any reproducing rhizobia from proliferating over time. This ability to reinforce a mutual relationship with host sanctions pushes the relationship toward a mutualism rather than a parasitism and is likely a contributing factor to why the symbiosis exists.

However, other studies have found no evidence of plant sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marco | first1 = D. E. | last2 = Perez-Arnedo | first2 = R. | last3 = Hidalgo-Perea | first3 = A. | last4 = Olivares | first4 = J. | last5 = Ruiz-Sainz | first5 = J.

===The partner choice hypothesis===
The '''partner choice hypothesis''' proposes that the plant uses prenodulation signals from the rhizobia to decide whether to allow nodulation, and chooses only noncheating rhizobia. There is evidence for sanctions in soybean plants, which reduce rhizobium reproduction (perhaps by limiting oxygen supply) in nodules that fix less nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Kiers ET, Rousseau RA, West SA, Denison RF 2003. Host sanctions and the legume–rhizobium mutualism. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 425 : 79-81&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, wild lupine plants allocate fewer resources to nodules containing less-beneficial rhizobia, limiting rhizobial reproduction inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simms | display-authors = etal   | year = 2006 | title = An empirical test of partner choice mechanisms in a wild legume-rhizobium interaction | url = | journal = Proc. R. Soc. B | volume = 273 | issue = 1582| pages = 77–81 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3292| pmid = 16519238   | pmc = 1560009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the definition of sanctions, although called "partner choice" by the authors.  Some studies support the partner choice hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heath | first1 = K. D. | last2 = Tiffin | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Stabilizing mechanisms in legume-rhizobium mutualism | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 652–662 | pmid = 19087187 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00582.x | title-link = Mutualism (biology) }}&lt;/ref&gt; While both mechanisms no doubt contribute significantly to maintaining rhizobial cooperation, they do not in themselves fully explain the persistence of the [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]. The partner choice hypothesis is not exclusive from the host sanctions hypothesis, as it is apparent that both of them are prevalent in the symbiotic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heath|first1=Katy D.|title=Stabilizing Mechanisms in a Legume-Rhizobium Mutualism|journal=Evolution|date=12 December 2008|volume=63|issue=3|pages=652–662|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00582.x|pmid=19087187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary history===
The symbiosis between nitrogen fixing rhizobia and the legume family has emerged and evolved over the past 66 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herendeen|first1=Patrick|title=A Preliminary Conspectus of the Allon Flora from the Late Cretaceous (Late Santonian) of Central Georgia, U.S.A|journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden|date=1999|volume=86|issue=2|pages=407–471|doi=10.2307/2666182|jstor=2666182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Renne |first=Paul R. |last2=Deino |first2=Alan L. |last3=Hilgen |first3=Frederik J. |last4=Kuiper |first4=Klaudia F. |last5=Mark |first5=Darren F. |last6=Mitchell |first6=William S. |last7=Morgan |first7=Leah E. |last8=Mundil |first8=Roland |last9=Smit |first9=Jan |title=Time Scales of Critical Events Around the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary |journal=Science |date=7 February 2013 |volume=339 |issue=6120 |pages=684–687 |doi=10.1126/science.1230492 |pmid=23393261 |url=http://www.cugb.edu.cn/uploadCms/file/20600/20131028144132060.pdf |bibcode=2013Sci...339..684R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although evolution tends to swing toward one species taking advantage of another in the form of noncooperation in the selfish-gene model, management of such symbiosis allows for the continuation of cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sachs|first1=Joel L.|title=The Evolution of Cooperation|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=June 2004|volume=79|issue=2|jstor=383541|doi=10.1086/383541|pages=135–160|pmid=15232949}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the relative fitness of both species is increased, natural selection will favor the symbiosis.

To understand the evolutionary history of this symbiosis, it is helpful to compare the rhizobia-legume symbiosis to a more ancient symbiotic relationship, such as that between [[endomycorrhizae|endomycorrhizae fungi]] and land plants, which dates back to almost 460 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=[[Martin Parniske|Parniske]]|title=Arbuscular mycorrhiza: the mother of plant root endosymbioses|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=2008|volume=6|issue=10|pages=763–775|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1987|pmid=18794914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endomycorrhizal symbiosis can provide many insights into rhizobia symbiosis because recent genetic studies have suggested that rhizobia co-opted the signaling pathways from the more ancient endomycorrhizal symbiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geurts|first1=René|title=Mycorrhizal Symbiosis: Ancient Signalling Mechanisms Co-opted|journal=Current Biology|date=2012|volume=22|issue=23|pages=R997–9|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2012.10.021|pmid=23218015|bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria secrete Nod factors and endomycorrhizae secrete Myc-LCOs. Upon recognition of the Nod factor/Myc-LCO, the plant proceeds to induce a variety of intracellular responses to prepare for the symbiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=[[Martin Parniske|Parniske]]|first1=Martin|title=Intracellular accommodation of microbes by plants: a common developmental program for symbiosis and disease?|journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol|date=2000|issue=4|pages=320–328|pmid=10873847|volume=3|doi=10.1016/s1369-5266(00)00088-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that rhizobia co-opted the features already in place for endomycorrhizal symbiosis, because there are many shared or similar genes involved in the two processes. For example, the plant recognition gene, SYMRK (symbiosis receptor-like kinase) is involved in the perception of both the rhizobial Nod factors as well as the endomycorrhizal Myc-LCOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldroyd|first1=Giles|title=Coordinating nodule morphogenesis with rhizobial infection in legumes|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|date=2008|volume=59|pages=519–546|doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092839|pmid=18444906}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shared similar processes would have greatly facilitated the evolution of rhizobial symbiosis, because not all the symbiotic mechanisms would have needed to develop. Instead the rhizobia simply needed to evolve mechanisms to take advantage of the symbiotic signaling processes already in place from endomycorrhizal symbiosis.

== Other diazotrophs ==
Many other species of bacteria are able to fix nitrogen ([[diazotroph]]s), but few are able to associate intimately with plants and colonize specific structures like legume nodules. Bacteria that do associate with plants include the [[actinobacteria]] ''[[Frankia]]'', which form symbiotic root nodules in [[actinorhizal plant]]s, although these bacteria have a much broader host range implying the association is less specific than in legumes.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Additionally, several [[cyanobacteria]] like ''[[Nostoc]]'' are associated with [[Azolla|aquatic ferns]], ''[[Cycas]]'' and ''[[Gunnera]]s,'' although they do not form nodules.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Douglas Houghton|date=1908-01-01|title=Symbiosis in Fern Prothallia|jstor=2455676|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=42|issue=495|pages=154–165|doi=10.1086/278916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vagnoli|first=L.|last2=Margheri|first2=M.

Additionally, loosely associated plant bacteria, termed [[endophyte]]s, have been reported to fix nitrogen ''in planta''.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/187303797|title=Associative and endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria and cyanobacterial associations|last=(Claudine)|first=Elmerich, C.|last2=1938-|first2=Newton, William E. (William Edward),|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402035418|oclc=187303797}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bacteria colonize the intercellular spaces of leaves, stems and roots in plants &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/938989968|title=Bacteria in Agrobiology: Plant Growth Responses|last=K.|first=Maheshwari, Dinesh|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642203312|oclc=938989968}}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not form specialized structures unlike rhizobia and ''[[Frankia]].''

'''Unlocked Central posts for doctors with disability'''

The disabled fighter fought for not only his but other disabled doctor’s rights. He also brought into open the discrimination by UPSC which disallowed doctors with disability to apply for various Central Health Services (CHS) posts. He himself was rejected in 2014 but fought and was later allowed to appear for the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M.S.J.E. doesn’t consider disabled doctors fit for teaching jobs|url=http://www.dnis.org/news.php?issue_id=5&amp;volume_id=8&amp;news_id=1142&amp;i=6|newspaper=D.N.I.S|date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPSC discriminating against me, alleges differently-abled doctor|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/upsc-discriminating-against-me-alleges-differentlyabled-doctor/article5334572.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, his application was again rejected when he highlighted that the same discrimination was also present for the other posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rejected by UPSC twice, physically challenged doctor battles for justice|url=http://www.indiamedicaltimes.com/2013/11/08/rejected-by-upsc-twice-physically-challenged-doctor-battles-for-justice/|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was allowed to apply in a quick intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Success for Dr Singh, but other physically challenged doctors still in lurch|url=http://www.indiamedicaltimes.com/2013/11/14/success-for-dr-singh-but-other-physically-challenged-doctors-still-in-lurch/|newspaper=India Medical Times|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His RTI revealed that doctors with disabilities are not considered eligible for specialist CHS posts in teaching, non-teaching as well as public health specialist cadres. Undeterred, he complained again and requested the health ministry to allow all eligible doctors with disability to apply for these posts. His single handed relentless fight for justice over four years ultimately forced Health Ministry to unlock 1,674 specialist central posts for disabled doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One man’s crusade opens up CHS jobs for disabled doctors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/One-mans-crusade-opens-up-CHS-jobs-for-disabled-doctors/articleshow/47661044.cms|publisher=The Times of India|date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Withdrawal of [[Union Public Service Commission]] and'''  '''[[Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination|Indian]] Institutes of Technology Joint Entrance Examinations ‘discriminatory proforma’'''

Dr Singh challenged [[Union Public Service Commission]]’s format whereby disabled applicants were asked to paste photographs showing their disability as a proof. The Court of [[Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities]] directed the UPSC to refrain from asking disabled candidates to submit photographs showing their disabilities and to consider the ‘permanent disability certificate’ issued from a government hospital as a valid proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPSC asked to withdraw proforma which demands photographs showing disability from applicants |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/upsc-asked-to-withdraw-proforma-which-demands-photographs-showing-disability-from-applicants/506055-3.html|newspaper=IBN Live.|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His advocacy led to the withdrawal of similar prOforma by IITJEE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/iits-asked-to-stop-using-disability-photos-in-applications/story-ooKM1jGog3BJ8ZFNPvJ9oK.html|title = IITs asked to stop using disability photos in applications|last = |first = |date = 3 November 2015|work = |access-date = 17 February 2016|via = Hindustan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Policy change in duty concession for drivers with disability'''
Central Government provides excise duty concession to disabled customers however [[Maruti Suzuki]] denied him the concession on the pretext of right leg disability which was not only discriminatory but illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Only left is right: Why disabled drivers miss discount trip|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Only-left-is-right-Why-disabled-drivers-miss-discount-trip/articleshow/51675645.cms|publisher=Times of India|date=4 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His relentless fight led the [[Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises]] to amend the rules and quashing manufacturer's certificate and allowing RTO's certificate only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Centre amends duty concession for disabled|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Centre-amends-duty-concession-for-disabled/articleshow/52440917.cms|date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sex swing''' (also known as a '''sling''') is a type of [[:wikt:harness|harness]] designed to allow [[sexual intercourse]] between one partner suspended by the swing and another who moves freely. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.kinkly.com/definition/208/sex-sling | title=What does Sex Sling mean | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;Though there is considerable variety in the design, the most common sex swings have a support for the back, another for the [[buttocks]], and [[stirrup]]s for each leg, which can be adjusted whilst the user is suspended. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thenation.com/article/what-the-pathetic-case-against-rentboy-com-says-about-sex-work/ | title=What the Pathetic Case Against Rentboy.com Says About Sex Work | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following types of sex swing exist: traditional swing, door swing, body swing, and fantasy swing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The body swing is suspended from one partner's body.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The door swing is mounted on a door.&lt;ref name="PassionShop How To"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passionshop.com/blog/sex-toys/how-to-use-a-sex-swing |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514085912/http://www.passionshop.com/blog/sex-toys/how-to-use-a-sex-swing/ |archivedate=May 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fantasy swing is suspended from an [[eye bolt]] in the ceiling.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} In popular culture, sex swing is mostly associated with [[BDSM]] practices. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/20/dungeons-and-genital-clamps-inside-a-legendary-bdsm-chateau.html | title=Dungeons and Genital Clamps: Inside a Legendary BDSM Chateau | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

[[File:Sling.jpg|thumb|[[Hammock]]-style sling for sexual activity]]
A sex swing or sling is designed to assist in [[Human sexuality|sexual]] activity.&lt;ref name="PassionShop How To"/&gt; Materials for constructing these devices include [[nylon]] [[webbing]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} heavy [[canvas]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[leather]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[neoprene]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} heavy [[natural rubber|rubber]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[wood]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}and [[steel]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The designs provide access to the passive (receptive) partner's [[Sex organ|genitalia]], [[perineum]], buttocks, and [[Anus|anal]] areas while supporting the individual in a comfortable position, with the hips flexed, to allowing the passive partner to fully relax.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The most common sex swing is similar to a [[hammock]] and holds the receptive partner in a [[supine position]] (back down).{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} A variant of the hammock style is a hanging platform of wood or metal, padded for comfort, on which the receptive partner reclines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The hanging platform differs from the hammock style in that, being rigid, the receptive partner's back is straight rather than bowed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Both the hammock and hanging platform designs are often equipped with loops or stirrups to support the ankles or calves up without the requiring exertion by the receptive partner.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} This allows the receptive partner's hips to be flexed without exertion, improving access to the areas of interest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Hammock-style swings vary in the number of suspension points from three (two at the hips and one at the head), to four (two at the hips and two at the shoulders), to five (two each at hips and shoulders, plus one at the head).{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The functional difference between these variants lies in the stability of the sling when in use: the more suspension points, the less movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} However, many users prefer to have a greater range of movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Another variation is the sit swing, which holds the receptive partner upright in sitting position, rather than supine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Sit swings take most of the body's weight with large padded loops around the thighs, or some similar arrangement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Sit swings are commonly suspended from a single point attached to the ceiling, to a free-standing sex swing stand, or a door.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Door swings offer quicker installation and lower cost, but sacrifice some flexibility.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Purpose ==

The main purpose of sex swings is to make sexual intercourse more exciting and effortless. A sex swing may enable greater freedom of movement during intercourse or assist with challenging [[sex position]]s.&lt;ref name="PassionShop How To"/&gt; Swings may be used for [[Vaginal sex|vaginal]] and [[Anal sex|anal]] sex, [[fellatio]], and [[cunnilingus]].

Sex swings can enable individuals with a physical impairment or [[disability]] to enjoy a wide range of sexual activities. Individuals with muscular weakness or [[arthritis]] may use a sex swing to reduce the strain on affected muscles or joints.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Individuals who use a [[wheelchair]] can engage in sexual activity using a sex swing suspended from a [[hoist (device)|hoist]].&lt;ref name="Wheelchair Sex Swing"&gt;{{cite web

== Safety ==

It is important to follow the provided instructions when using a sex swing. Secure mounting is vital to avoid injury to the suspended partner from falling. The use of [[toggle bolt]]s, such as would be used to hang a dreamcatcher, is not appropriate. Installing springs, if supplied, is important to reduce physical [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]] to the suspended partner caused by rapid [[deceleration]] when bouncing in a sex swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Sexually active life expectancy''' is the average number of years remaining for a person to be [[Human sexual activity|sexually active]]. This population-based indicator extends the concept of health expectancy to the measure of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] (via sexual activity). Calculation of sexually active life expectancy uses the age-specific prevalence data on sexual activity in conjunction with [[life table]] data on survival probabilities to partition the number of [[person-year]]s into years with and without sexual activity, which is based on the Sullivan method.&lt;ref name=sullivan1971&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sullivan, D.F.|year=1971|title=A single index of mortality and morbidity|journal=HSMHA Health Reports|volume=86|issue=4|pages=347–354|pmc=1937122|doi=10.2307/4594169|pmid=5554262|jstor=4594169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sullivan method's objective is to understand the change of health in a given population over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan, D.F.|first=|date=|title=A single index of mortality and Morbidity|url=|journal=HSMHA Health Reports|volume=86|pages=4|doi=10.2307/4594169|pmc=1937122|pmid=5554262|via=347-354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure of sexually active life expectancy was introduced by Lindau and Gavrilova.&lt;ref name=gavrilova2007&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gavrilova, N.|author2=Lindau, S.T.|year=2007|url=http://www.ined.fr/fichier/t_telechargement/11987/telechargement_fichier_fr_697_gavrilova_sexuality_an.overlooked.pdf|title=An overlooked aspect of women's health|journal=Proceedings of the 19th REVES meeting|location=St.Petersburg, Florida}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lindau2008&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lindau, S.T.|author2=Gavrilova, N.|year=2008|title=Population gender differences in the effects of obesity on later life sexuality and sexually active life expectancy|journal=Gerontologist|volume=48|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lindau2010&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lindau, S.T.|author2=Gavrilova, N.|year=2010|title=Sex, health, and years of sexually active life gained due to good health: evidence from two US population based cross sectional surveys of ageing|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=340|page=c810|pmid=20215365|doi=10.1136/bmj.c850|pmc=2835854}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through their study of two cohorts, researchers Lindau and Gavrilova found that sexual activity, a good quality sex life, and interest in sex were associated with self rated health in a positive way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindau|first=Stacy Tessler|last2=Gavrilova|first2=Natalia|date=2010|title=Sex, health, and years of sexually active life gained due to good health: evidence from two US population based cross sectional surveys of ageing|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=340|issue=7746|pages=580 Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research focused on midlife and later life health. This included ages 27 to 74 years and 57 to 85 years. In their findings they concluded that a gender difference was present with increasing age. Evidence proved that men were more likely than women to be engaging in sexual activity. Men were also more likely to report that they were even interested in having sex and that they were having good quality sex . In addition, the research demonstrated that only 51.8% of women in a later stage of life reported being satisfied by their sexual life compared to 71.1% of men.&lt;ref&gt;[Lindau, S. T., &amp; Gavrilova, N. (2010). Sex, health, and years of sexually active life gained due to good health: evidence from two US population based cross sectional surveys of ageing. BMJ, 340, c810.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their research showed that men in good or excellent health could gain an extra five to seven years for participating in regular sexual activity. Where as women would only gain three to six years given they had substantial health. Even though the gender gap is evident, the research provides a clear association between health and sexual activity.

A study of two large population-based U.S. surveys found that, on average, women expect fewer years of sexual activity, mainly due to prevalent [[widowhood]] among older women. This [[gender disparity]] is attenuated for people with a [[Marriage|spouse]] or other intimate partner. The study also found that men tend to lose more years of sexually active life due to poor health.&lt;ref name=lindau2010 /&gt;

Sexually active life expectancy is associated with self-reports of good health in both men and women. Sexuality has been identified as an important attribute to overall health and a marker of [[quality of life]]. Sexual desire has also been attributed to good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a skillful partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kontula|first=Osmo|last2=Haavio-Mannila|first2=Elina|date=2009|title=The Impact of Aging on Human Sexual Activity and Sexual Desire|url=|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=46|issue=1|pages=46–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Physician]]s may find that sexually active [[life expectancy]] can be used as an incentive for patients to become (and stay) healthy.&lt;ref name=lindau2010 /&gt; Institutional settings such as residential care facilities should focus on offering an accepting environment for sexually active older people.

== Barriers Preventing Sex ==
Although people generalize that older adults do not participate in sex often, research shows that older people enjoy participating in a variety of sexual activities. Barriers, both physically and mentally, is an important factor that influences older adults' sexual activities. These barriers can be seen at the individual, societal, and structural level. Some barriers include: lack of privacy, availability of sexual partner, mental health, and the impact of prescriptions on sexual desires.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bouman|first=Walter Pierre|last2=Kleinplatz|first2=Peggy J|date=2015|title=Moving towards understanding greater diversity and fluidity of sexual expression of older people|url=|journal=Sexual &amp; Relationship Therapy|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1–3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age-related Barriers ===
Age-related factors can be identified through the decline of health. This can include declining fitness and mobility levels. Biological changes, such as menopause for women, can cause an unpleasant experience during sex. This can include painful intercourse and a lack of sex drive, however, many women have reported that not having to worry about becoming pregnant made them enjoy sexual activity more. The presence of diseases such as arthritis, can also greatly affect a person's sexual activities, however, this is evident for any age range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hillman|first=Jennifer|title=Sexual issues and aging within the context of work with older adult patients.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0735-7028.39.3.290|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=290–297|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.39.3.290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as a decrease in self esteem, confidence, and cognitive function can prohibit an older person from participating in sex or romantic partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Michael|last2=Haesler|first2=Emily|last3=Fetherstonhaugh|first3=Deirdre|date=September 3, 2015|title=Let’s talk about sex: older people’s views on the recognition of sexuality and sexual health in the health-care setting|url=|journal=Health Expectations: An International Journal Of Public Participation In Health Care And Health Policy|volume=19|pages=1237–1250|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having to live in an assisted living home has also created a physical behavior. People are less likely to have the privacy that they want when they are surrounded by other elderly people and nurses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Importance of Intimate Relationships within Institutional Settings (Residential Care) ==
Due to the increasing ageist attitudes towards older people being sexually active, there is not many programs advocating for older people's sexuality. Employers of residential facilities see many problems with allowing older people to participate in sexual activities. Within institutional settings, segregation was found to be the main boundary between older people, assuming they were heterosexual, achieving sexual activities. Many buildings were designed to ensure that males and females were separated, usually by floors or specific wings of the building. Unless they could afford to, married couples were not able to stay with each other in residential care facilities. Creating a "home" environment is a key factor in an older person's well being, especially since this facility may be the last place an older person resides in. Therefore, being open minded about residents' sexual life would be very beneficial to older people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=J|date=2003|title=Care home design and human rights|url=|journal=Elder LJ|volume=1|issue=4|pages=395–402|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal and Ethical Issues ===
One of the main reasons residential homes do not care to facilitate intimate relationships is because employees may have a hard time distinguishing a desired sexual partnership from an undesired one. The residential care faces possible issues if a resident is being taken advantage of especially if they are incapable physically or mentally to protect them self. Facilities usually have a safeguarding and protection policy which monitors any relationship to prevent abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=J|date=2015|title=Intimate Relationships between older people in institutional settings: Ageism, protection or fear?|url=|journal=Ethics, Medicine and Public Health|volume=1|pages=194–202|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15008">The '''side effects of penicillin ''' are bodily responses to [[penicillin]] and closely related [[antibiotic]]s that do not relate directly to its effect on bacteria. A side effect is an effect that is not intended with normal dosaging.&lt;ref name = WHO2017&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/safety_efficacy/trainingcourses/definitions.pdf |title = Definitions | publisher= The World health organization | accessdate = May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these reactions are visible and some occur in the body's organs or blood. [[Penicillin]]s are a widely used group of medications that are effective for the treatment of a wide variety of [[bacterial infection]]s in human adults and children as well as other species. Some [[side effects]] are predictable, of which some are common but not serious, some are uncommon and serious and others are rare.{{sfn|Valerand|pages=3-4}} The route of administration of penicillin can have an effect on the development of side effects. An example of this is irritation and inflammation that develops at a peripheral infusion site when penicillin is administered intravenously. In addition, penicillin is available in different forms. There are different penicillin medications ([[penicillin G benzathine]], [[penicillin G potassium]], [[Penicillin G sodium]], [[penicillin G procaine]], and [[penicillin V]]){{sfn|Karch|page=115}} as well as a number of [[β-lactam antibiotic]]s derived from penicillin (e.g. [[amoxicillin]]) generally also referred to as "penicillin".

Side effects may only last for a short time and then go away. Side effects can be relieved in some cases with non pharmacological treatment.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt; Some side effects require treatment to correct potentially serious and sometimes fatal reactions to penicillin. Penicillin has not been found to cause birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imt.ie/clinical/infections-immunology/penicillin-use-during-pregnancy-not-linked-to-birth-defects-16-12-2009/|title=Penicillin use during pregnancy not linked to birth defects|date=16 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allergies and cross sensitivities==
Many people have indicated that they have a side effect related to an allergic reaction to penicillin. It has been proposed that as many as 90% of those claiming to have an allergy to penicillin are able to take it. Identifying an allergy to penicillin requires a hypersensitivity skin test which diagnoses IgE-mediated immune responses caused by penicillin. This test is typically performed by an allergist who uses a  skin-prick and intradermal injection of penicilloyl-polylysine, a negative control (normal saline), and a positive control (histamine).&lt;ref name="Gonz2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez-Estrada|first1=A.|last2=Radojicic|first2=C.|title=Penicillin allergy: A practical guide for clinicians|journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine|volume=82|issue=5|year=2015|pages=295–300|issn=0891-1150|doi=10.3949/ccjm.82a.14111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common side effect that can develop when other medications are used. This is  the development of cross sensitivities to other antibiotics. If someone has developed side effects when taking penicillin, these side effects may develop with a new medication even though the person has not taken the new medication before. Those medications that may cause a cross sensitivity reaction are: [[carbapenems]], [[ampicillin]], [[cefazolin]], [[cephalosporins]] and [[cloxacillin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher =Vancouver Acute Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vancouver Hospital &amp; Health Sciences Centre | date = 2016 |access-date = May 19, 2017 | url = http://www.vhpharmsci.com/vhformulary/Tools/ANTIBIOTIC%20CROSS-SENSITIVITY%20CHART.pdf|title=Pharmaceutical Sciences CSU Parenteral Antibiotic Allergy cross-sensitivity chart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonz2015"/&gt;{{sfn|Vallerand|pages = 989-994}}

==Side effects in adults==
Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥ 1% of people) associated with use of the penicillins include [[diarrhoea]], [[hypersensitivity]], [[nausea]], rash, [[neurotoxicity]], [[urticaria]], and [[superinfection]] (including [[candidiasis]]). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of people) include fever, vomiting, [[erythema]], [[dermatitis]], [[angioedema]], [[seizures]] (especially in people with [[epilepsy]]), and [[pseudomembranous colitis]].&lt;ref name=AMH2006&gt;{{cite book | editor=Rossi S | title=[[Australian Medicines Handbook]] | year=2006 | location=Adelaide | publisher=Australian Medicines Handbook | isbn=0-9757919-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[outdated?]&lt;/sup&gt;

==High doses==
When penicillin is used at high doses [[hypokalemia]], [[metabolic acidosis]], and [[hyperkalemia]] can occur.{{sfn|Potter|page=897}} Developing hypernatremia after administering high doses of penicillin can be a serious side effect.{{sfn|Vallerand|pages = 989-994}}

==Side effects from other medications==
The side effects of penicillin can be altered by taking other medications at the same time. Taking oral contraceptives along with penicillin may lower the effects of the contraceptive. When [[probenecid]] is used concurrently with penicillin, kidney excretion of probenecid is decreased resulting in higher blood levels of penicillin in the circulation. In some instances, this would be an intended therapeutic effect. In other instances, this is an unintended side effect. Neomycin can lower the absorption of penicillin from the gastrointestinal tract resulting in lower than expected levels of penicillin in the circulation. This side effect may result in an ineffective therapeutic effect of penicillin. When methotrexate is administered with penicillin, toxicity may occur related to methotrexate.{{sfn|Vallerand|pages =989-994 }}

==In animals==
Animals are often treated with antibiotics for infections they have developed. There are side effects of penicillin when it is used in animals. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] may develop in pets as a consequence of treatment.&lt;ref name="HarrisonWeinert2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=E.

==Other side effects ==
Penicillin is known to become less effective as strains of bacteria become resistant.&lt;ref name="LiHuang2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Shunming|last2=Huang|first2=Jingya|last3=Chen|first3=Zhiyao|last4=Guo|first4=Dan|last5=Yao|first5=Zhenjiang|last6=Ye|first6=Xiaohua|title=Antibiotic Prevention for Maternal Group B Streptococcal Colonization on Neonatal GBS-Related Adverse Outcomes: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=8|year=2017|issn=1664-302X|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2017.00374}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--==Children==
Digoxin may be prescribed for a child to _____. Children may demonstrate side effects if they are breastfed. Dogoxin is also absorbed by the infant in utero.
==Geriatric considerations==
Kidney function gradually decreases as someone ages. The elderly are also likely to be underweight. In addition, these older people tend to be dehydrated and be taking other medications. These factors increase the likelihood of developing side effects. Often lowering the dose is considered by the prescriber.
==Side effects due to other drug interactions==
Side effects can become more pronounced due to the drug interactions between _____ and the following:

==Side effects due to dietary supplements==
Side effects can become pronounced due to the interactions of _____ and these substances: licorice, aloe, and St. John' wort.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14937">The '''status of women's [[testimony]] in [[Islam]]''' is disputed.

In Islamic law, testimony (''shahada'') is defined as attestation with regard to a right of a second party against a third. It exists alongside other forms of evidence (''bayyina''), such as the oath (''yamin''), acknowledgement (''iqrar''), and circumstantial evidence (''qara'in al-ahwal''). A testimony must involve certain knowledge of an affirmed event, and cannot be based on conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wael B. Hallaq|authorlink = Wael Hallaq|title=Sharī'a: Theory, Practice, Transformations|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muzammil H. Siddiqi]], a notable scholar from North America, has said the Quran makes very little reference to genders, in regard to testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/shariah-based-systems/judiciary-and-police-systems/176429.html?Police_Systems=|title=Save BIG with $9.99 .COMs from GoDaddy!|website=Go Daddy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishments==
In cases of ''[[hudud]]'', punishments for serious crimes, 12th-century [[Maliki]] jurist [[Averroes]] wrote that jurists disagree about the status of women's testimony.&lt;ref name="aver"&gt;[[Ibn Rushd]]. ''Bidayatu’l-Mujtahid'', 1st ed., vol. 4, (Beirut: Daru’l-Ma‘rifah, 1997), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Averroes, most scholars say that in this case women's testimony is unacceptable regardless of whether they testify alongside male witnesses.&lt;ref name="aver"/&gt; However, he writes that the school of thought known as the [[Zahiri]]s believe that if two or more women testify alongside a male witness, then (as in cases regarding financial transactions, discussed below), their testimony is acceptable.&lt;ref name="aver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|1|6|301}}: "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|48|826}}: "Isn't the witness of a women equal to half that of a man?" The women said "yes". He said "This is because of the deficiency of the women's mind."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|1|142}}: "O womenfolk, you should ask for forgiveness for I saw you in bulk amongst the dwellers of Hell. A wise lady said: Why is it, Allah’s Apostle, that women comprise the bulk of the inhabitants of Hell? The Prophet observed: ‘You curse too much and are ungrateful to your spouses. You lack common sense, fail in religion and rob the wisdom of the wise.’ Upon this the woman remarked: What is wrong with our common sense? The Prophet replied, ‘Your lack of common sense can be determined from the fact that the evidence of two women is equal to one man. That is a proof."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial documents==
In case of witnesses for financial documents, the Qur'an asks for two men or one man and two women.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{Cite quran|2|282}}: "... and call in to witness from among your men two witnesses; but if there are not two men, then one man and two women from among those whom you choose to be witnesses, so that if one of the two errs, the second of the two may remind the other...".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Averroes, a 12th-century [[Maliki]], "There is a general consensus among the jurists that in financial transactions a case stands proven by the testimony of a just man and two women on the basis of [this] verse." ([[Ibn Rushd]]. ''Bidayatu’l-Mujtahid'', 1st ed., vol. 4, (Beirut: Daru’l-Ma‘rifah, 1997), p. 311).&lt;/ref&gt; It is disputed whether this means that a woman's testimony worth half that of a man either in disputes about financial transactions or as a general matter.

On the other hand, [[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]] writes that Islam asks for two female witnesses against one male, in the case of financial transactions, because this responsibility is not very suited to their temperament, sphere of interest, and usual environment. He argues that Islam makes no claim that a woman's testimony is half in any case.&lt;ref name="ev"&gt;[[Ghamidi]]. ''Burhan:''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl12y2.html The Law of Evidence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211020525/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl12y2.html |date=2007-02-11 }}. [[Al-Mawrid]]&lt;/ref&gt; He interprets the Qur'an verse as only a recommendation and argues that it will be for the court judge to decide what kind and whose evidence will be enough to prove a case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Javed Ahmed Ghamidi|title=Kia Aurat ki Gawahi Adhi hai - Javed Ahmed Ghamidi|date=2012-03-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnmY4GDhktU|accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the  Prophetic [[Hadith|narration]], that is used to prove half-testimony status of women, Javed Ahmed Ghamidi and members of his foundation [[Al-Mawrid]] argue against its reliability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.javedahmadghamidi.com/books/view/the-woman-and-the-islamic-law-part-1-2|title=The Woman and the Islamic Law (Part 1/2) - Javed Ahmad Ghamidi|website=www.javedahmadghamidi.com|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its translation from Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/questions/view/testimony-of-a-woman|title=Questions {{!}} Al-Mawrid|website=www.al-mawrid.org|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghamdi also contends that the narration cannot be used in all general cases because it is related to the Qur'an verse whose subject is related only to financial matters.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Another Pakistani religious scholar Ishaq argues that acquiring conclusive evidence is important, regardless of whether it can be obtained from just one man or just one woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MaulanaIshaqURDU|title=Islam Main Kya Aurat Ki Gawahi Aadhi Hai - maulana ishaq urdu|date=2011-10-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuzIkJ3L7JU|accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Qayyim]] also argued that the verse referred to, relates to the heavy responsibility of testifying by which an owner of wealth protects his rights, not with the decision of a court; the two are completely different from each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn al-Qayyim]], I‘lam al-Muwwaqi‘in, 1st ed., vol. 1 (Beirut: Dar al-Jayl, 1973), 91.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that this command shows that the Qur'an does not want to make difficulties for women.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Julrefl12y4.html Half of a Man!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210116/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Julrefl12y4.html |date=2007-09-27 }}'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance - Monthly Islamic Journal]], 14(7), July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Taymiyyah|Ibn Taymiyya]] also reasoned the deficiency of using Qur'an 2:282 to prove [[evidentiary]] discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fadel|first=Mohammad|date=1997-01-01|title=Two Women, One Man: Knowledge, Power, and Gender in Medieval Sunni Legal Thought|url=https://www.law.utoronto.ca/documents/lectures/religion_fadel_0710.pdf|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both Ibn al-Qayyim and Ibn Taymiyya ''did'' believe in the difference of [[Probative value|probative]] value of men's and women's testimony. It is argued that even though Ibn al-Qayyim believed that women were more prone to making errors, instead of concluding a general discrimination from this, women's testimony was to be treated on an individual basis. This is because Ibn al-Qayyim contended that in cases where a woman and man share all the Islamic good qualities of a witness, a woman's testimony corroborated by another woman may ''actually'' be considered stronger than the uncorroborated testimony of a man. Additionally, Ibn al-Qayyim also regarded the testimony of some exceptional women like those who transmitted ''[[Hadith]]'' as doubtlessly greater than a single man of lesser esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fadel|first=Mohammad|date=1997-01-01|title=Two Women, One Man: Knowledge, Power, and Gender in Medieval Sunni Legal Thought|url=https://www.law.utoronto.ca/documents/lectures/religion_fadel_0710.pdf|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholar opinions==
In matters other than financial transactions, scholars differ on whether the Qur'anic verses relating to financial transactions apply.&lt;ref&gt;Ordinary Muslims also challenge the extent of the application of the verse; see, e.g., http://www.submission.org/women/faq8.html.{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true in the case of bodily affairs like divorce, marriage, [[emancipation|slave-emancipation]] and ''raju‘'' (restitution of conjugal rights). According to Averroes, [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man|Imam Abu Hanifa]] believed that their testimony is acceptable in such cases.  [[Imam Malik]], on the contrary, believes that their testimony remains unacceptable. For bodily affairs about which men can have no information in ordinary circumstances, such as the physical handicaps of women and the crying of a baby at birth, the majority of scholars hold that the testimony of women alone is acceptable. But the number of women witnesses needed is debated in different Islamic schools of law. Hanafi's and Hanbali's see even one woman enough. According to Maliki's two women are required. As for Shafii's, they see that 4 women are needed. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In certain situations, the scripture accepts the testimony of a woman as equal to that of a man's and that her testimony can even invalidate his, such as when a man accuses his wife of unchastity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twf.org/Library/WomenICJ.html#witness|title=Women In Islam Versus Women In The Judaeo-Christian Tradition|website=www.twf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical commentators==
Classical commentators commonly explained the unequal treatment of testimony by asserting that women's nature made them more prone to error than men.  Muslim modernists have followed the Egyptian reformer [[Muhammad Abduh]] in viewing the relevant scriptural passages as conditioned on the different gender roles and life experiences that prevailed at the time rather than women's innately inferior mental capacities, making the rule not generally applicable in all times and places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Two Women, One Man: Knowledge, Power, and Gender in Medieval Sunni Legal Thought|author=Mohammad Fadel|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=29|number=2|year=1997|page=187|jstor=164016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A function f is said to be strict if, when applied to a non-terminating expression, it also fails to terminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/functions.html|title=A Gentle Introduction to Haskell: Functions|website=www.haskell.org|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''strict function''' in the [[denotational semantics]] of [[programming language]]s is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' where &lt;math&gt;f\left(\perp\right) = \perp&lt;/math&gt;.  The entity &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;, called ''[[Bottom type|bottom]]'', denotes an expression which does not return a normal value, either because it loops endlessly or because it aborts due to an error such as division by zero.  A function which is not strict is called '''non-strict'''. A [[strict programming language]] is one in which user-defined functions are always strict.

Intuitively, non-strict functions correspond to [[control structure]]s. Operationally, a strict function is one which always [[evaluate]]s its [[parameter|argument]]; a non-strict function is one which may not evaluate some of its arguments. Functions having more than one parameter may be strict or non-strict in each parameter independently, as well as ''jointly strict'' in several parameters simultaneously.

As an example, the &lt;tt&gt;if-then-else&lt;/tt&gt; expression of many programming languages may be thought of as a function of three parameters. This function is strict in its first parameter, since the function must know whether its first argument evaluates to true or to false before it can return; but it is non-strict in its second parameter, because (for example) &lt;tt&gt;if(false,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;,1) = 1&lt;/tt&gt;, as well as non-strict in its third parameter, because (for example) &lt;tt&gt;if(true,2,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;) = 2&lt;/tt&gt;. However, it is jointly strict in its second and third parameters, since &lt;tt&gt;if(true,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;if(false,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

In a [[non-strict programming language|non-strict]] [[functional programming]] language, [[strictness analysis]] refers to any algorithm used to prove the strictness of a function with respect to one or more of its arguments. Such functions can be [[compilation (programming)|compiled]] to a more efficient [[calling convention]], such as [[call by value]], without changing the meaning of the enclosing program.

'''Technological determinism''' is a [[reductionism|reductionist]] [[theory]] that assumes that a society's [[technology]] [[determinism|determines]] the development of its social structure and cultural values. Technological determinism tries to understand how technology has had an impact on human action and thought. Changes in technology are the primary source for changes in society. The term is believed to have originated from [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857–1929), an American sociologist and economist. The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely [[Clarence Ayres]] who was a follower of [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[John Dewey]]. [[William Ogburn]] was also known for his radical technological determinism.

The first major elaboration of a technological determinist view of socioeconomic development came from the German philosopher and economist [[Karl Marx]], whose theoretical framework was grounded in the perspective that changes in technology, and specifically [[Productive forces|productive technology]], are the primary influence on human social relations and organizational structure, and that social relations and cultural practices ultimately revolve around the technological and economic base of a given society. Marx's position has become embedded in contemporary society, where the idea that fast-changing technologies alter human lives is all-pervasive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith &amp; Marx|first= Merrit Roe &amp; Leo |title= Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism|publisher= The MIT Press|date=June 1994|isbn= 978-0262691673}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although many authors attribute a technologically determined view of human history to Marx's insights, not all Marxists are technological determinists, and some authors question the extent to which Marx himself was a determinist. Furthermore, there are multiple forms of technological determinism.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx and the Three Faces of Technological Determinism, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bimber|first=Bruce|title=Karl Marx and the Three Faces of Technological Determinism|journal=Social Studies of Science|date=May 1990|volume=20|issue=2|pages=333–351|doi=10.1177/030631290020002006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
The term is believed to have been coined by Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), an American social scientist. Veblen's contemporary, popular historian Charles A. Beard, provided this apt determinist image, "Technology marches in seven-league boots from one ruthless, revolutionary conquest to another, tearing down old factories and industries, flinging up new processes with terrifying rapidity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beard|first=Charles A.|title=Time, Technology, and the Creative Spirit in Political Science|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=February 1927|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/1945535|jstor=1945535}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to the meaning, it is described as the ascription to machines of "powers" that they do not have.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Technology Drive History?: The Dilemma of Technological Determinism|last=Smith|first=Merritt|last2=Marx|first2=Leo|publisher=MIT Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0262193474|location=Cambridge|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veblen, for instance, asserted that "the machine throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times And Ideas Of The Great Economic Thinkers|last=Heilbroner|first=Robert|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1999|isbn=978-0684862149|location=New York|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of Karl Marx who expected that the construction of the railway in India would dissolve the caste system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general idea, according to [[Robert Heilbroner]], is that technology, by way of its machines, can cause historical change by changing the material conditions of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowing Machines: Essays on Technical Change|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald|publisher=MIT Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0262631884|location=Cambridge|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most radical technological determinists was a man named [[Clarence Edwin Ayres|Clarence Ayres]], who was a follower of Veblen's theory in the 20th century. Ayers is best known for developing economic philosophies, but he also worked closely with Veblen who coined the technological determinism theory.  He often times talked about the struggle between technology and ceremonial structure. One of his most notable theories involved the concept of "technological drag" where he explains technology as a self-generating process and institutions as ceremonial and this notion creates a technological over-determinism in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Limits to Economic Theory|last=Mulberg|first=Jonathan|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=978-0415123860|location=London|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Explanation ==
Technological determinism seeks to show technical developments, media, or technology as a whole, as the key mover in history and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunz|first=William M.|title=Culture Conglomerates: Consolidation in the Motion Picture and Television Industries|year=2006|publisher=Publisher: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-0742540668|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theory subscribed by "hyperglobalist" who claims that as a consequence of the wide availability of technology, accelerated globalization is inevitable. Therefore, technological development and innovation become the principal motor of social, economic or political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global politics|last=Macmillan.|first=Palgrave|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict adherents to technological determinism do not believe the influence of technology differs based on how much a technology is or can be used.  Instead of considering technology as part of a larger spectrum of human activity, technological determinism sees technology as the basis for all human activity.

Technological determinism has been summarized as 'The belief in technology as a key governing force in society ...' ([[Merritt Roe Smith]]). 'The idea that technological development determines social change ...' (Bruce Bimber). It changes the way people think and how they interact with others and can be described as '...a three-word logical proposition: "Technology determines history"' ([[Rosalind Williams]]) &lt;!--[thanks to Brian Martin: http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/96BRmetascience.html"].--&gt;. It is, '... the belief that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an "inevitable" course.' ([[Michael L. Smith]]). This 'idea of progress' or 'doctrine of progress' is centralised around the idea that social problems can be solved by technological advancement, and this is the way that society moves forward. Technological determinists believe that "'You can't stop progress', implying that we are unable to control technology" ([[Lelia Green]]). This suggests that we are somewhat powerless and society allows technology to drive social changes because, "societies fail to be aware of the alternatives to the values embedded in it [technology]" ([[Merritt Roe Smith]]).

Technological determinism has been defined as an approach that identifies technology, or technological advances, as the central causal element in processes of social change (Croteau and Hoynes). As a technology is stabilized, its design tends to dictate users' behaviors, consequently diminishing human agency. This stance however ignores the social and cultural circumstances in which the technology was developed. Sociologist Claude Fischer (1992) characterized the most prominent forms of technological determinism as "billiard ball" approaches, in which technology is seen as an external force introduced into a social situation, producing a series of ricochet effects.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau and Hoynes, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than acknowledging that a society or culture interacts with and even shapes the technologies that are used, a technological determinist view holds that "the uses made of technology are largely determined by the structure of the technology itself, that is, that its functions follow from its form" ([[Neil Postman]]). However, this is not to be confused with [[Daniel Chandler]]'s "inevitability thesis", which states that once a technology is introduced into a culture that what follows is the inevitable development of that technology.

For example, we could examine why Romance Novels have become so dominant in our society compared to other forms of novels like the Detective or Western novel. We might say that it was because of the invention of the perfect binding system developed by publishers. This was where glue was used instead of the time-consuming and very costly process of binding books by sewing in separate signatures. This meant that these books could be mass-produced for the wider public. We would not be able to have mass literacy without mass production.{{clarify|Society could mass produce books on any theme. This does not explain how Romance became more dominant than Detective or Western novels. Its relevance to the idea of Technological Determinism is dubious, as well.|date=May 2014}} This example is closely related to [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s belief that print helped produce the [[nation state]]. This moved society on from an oral culture to a literate culture but also introduced a capitalist society where there was clear class distinction and individualism. As Postman maintains  &lt;!-- This is a poor example of technological determinism --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Hard and soft determinism ==

In examining [[determinism]], '''hard determinism''' can be contrasted with '''soft determinism'''. A [[compatibilist]] says that it is possible for [[free will]] and determinism to exist in the world together, while an [[incompatibilist]] would say that they can not and there must be one or the other.  Those who support [[determinism]] can be further divided.

'''''Hard determinists''''' would view technology as developing independent from social concerns. They would say that technology creates a set of powerful forces acting to regulate our social activity and its meaning.  According to this view of determinism we organize ourselves to meet the needs of technology and the outcome of this organization is beyond our control or we do not have the freedom to make a choice regarding the outcome (autonomous technology). The 20th century French philosopher and social theorist [[Jacques Ellul]] could be said to be a hard determinist and proponent of autonomous technique (technology).  In his 1954 work ''[[:fr:La Technique ou l'Enjeu du siècle|The Technological Society]]'', Ellul essentially posits that technology, by virtue of its power through efficiency, determines which social aspects are best suited for its own development through a process of natural selection.  A social system's values, morals, philosophy etc. that are most conducive to the advancement of technology allow that social system to enhance its power and spread at the expense of those social systems whose values, morals, philosophy etc. are less promoting of technology.  [[Theodore J. Kaczynski]] (the Unabomber) can be essentially thought of as a hard determinist.  According to Kaczynski, "objective" material factors in the human environment are the principal determining factors in the evolution of social systems. While geography, climate, and other "natural" factors largely determined the parameters of social conditions for most of human history, technology has recently become the dominant objective factor (largely due to forces unleashed by the industrial revolution) and it has been the principal objective and determining factor.

'''''Soft determinism''''', as the name suggests, is a more passive view of the way technology interacts with socio-political situations.  Soft determinists still subscribe to the fact that technology is the guiding force in our evolution, but would maintain that we have a ''chance'' to make decisions regarding the outcomes of a situation.  This is not to say that free will exists, but that the possibility for us to ''roll the dice'' and see what the outcome is exists. A slightly different variant of soft determinism is the 1922 technology-driven theory of social change proposed by [[William Fielding Ogburn]], in which society must adjust to the consequences of major inventions, but often does so only after a period of [[cultural lag]].&lt;!-- This section needs a reference --&gt;

== Technology as neutral ==
Individuals who consider technology as neutral see technology as neither good nor bad and what matters are the ways in which we use technology.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], "The Myth of Value-Neutrality", pp. 235-241, New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a neutral viewpoint is, "guns are neutral and its up to how we use them whether it would be 'good or bad'" (Green, 2001). Mackenzie and Wajcman&lt;ref&gt;(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; believe that technology is neutral only if it's never been used before, or if no one knows what it is going to be used for (Green, 2001). In effect, guns would be classified as neutral if and only if society were none the wiser of their existence and functionality (Green, 2001). Obviously, such a society is non-existent and once becoming knowledgeable about technology, the society is drawn into a social progression where nothing is 'neutral about society' (Green). According to [[Lelia Green]], if one believes technology is neutral, one would disregard the cultural and social conditions that technology has produced (Green, 2001). This view is also referred to as technological instrumentalism.

In what is often considered a definitive reflection on the topic, the historian [[Melvin Kranzberg]] famously wrote in the first of his [[Kranzberg's laws of technology|six laws of technology]]: "Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral."

== Criticism ==
Scepticism about technological determinism emerged alongside increased pessimism about techno-science in the mid-20th century, in particular around the use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] in the production of [[nuclear weapons]], [[Nazi human experimentation]] during [[World War II]], and the problems of economic development in the [[Third World]]. As a direct consequence, desire for greater control of the course of development of technology gave rise to disenchantment with the model of technological determinism in academia.

Modern theorists of technology and society no longer consider technological determinism to be a very accurate view of the way in which we interact with technology, even though determinist assumptions and language fairly saturate the writings of many boosters of technology, the business pages of many popular magazines, and much reporting on technology {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.  Instead, research in [[science and technology studies]], [[social construction of technology]] and related fields have emphasised more nuanced views that resist easy causal formulations. They emphasise that "The relationship between technology and society cannot be reduced to a simplistic cause-and-effect formula. It is, rather, an 'intertwining'", whereby technology does not determine but "operates, and are operated upon in a complex social field" (Murphie and Potts).

In his article "Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with Technology," [[Andrew Feenberg]] argues that technological determinism is not a very well founded concept by illustrating that two of the founding theses of determinism are easily questionable and in doing so calls for what he calls [[democratic rationalization]] ([[Feenberg]] 210–212).

Prominent opposition to technologically determinist thinking has emerged within work on the [[social construction of technology]] (SCOT). SCOT research, such as that of Mackenzie and Wajcman (1997) argues that the path of innovation and its social consequences are strongly, if not entirely shaped by society itself through the influence of culture, politics, economic arrangements, regulatory mechanisms and the like. In its strongest form, verging on [[social determinism]], "What matters is not the technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded" ([[Langdon Winner]]).

In his influential but contested (see Woolgar and Cooper, 1999) article "Do Artifacts Have Politics?", [[Langdon Winner]] illustrates not a form of determinism but the various sources of the politics of technologies. Those politics can stem from the intentions of the designer and the culture of the society in which a technology emerges or can stem from the technology itself, a "practical necessity" for it to function. For instance, New York City urban planner [[Robert Moses]] is purported to have built Long Island's parkway tunnels too low for buses to pass in order to keep minorities away from the island's beaches, an example of externally inscribed politics. On the other hand, an authoritarian command-and-control structure is a practical necessity of a nuclear power plant if radioactive waste is not to fall into the wrong hands. As such, Winner neither succumbs to technological determinism nor social determinism. The source of a technology's politics is determined only by carefully examining its features and history.

Although "The deterministic model of technology is widely propagated in society" ([[Sarah Miller]]), it has also been widely questioned by scholars. [[Lelia Green]] explains that, "When technology was perceived as being outside society, it made sense to talk about technology as neutral". Yet, this idea fails to take into account that culture is not fixed and society is dynamic. When "Technology is implicated in social processes, there is nothing neutral about society" ([[Lelia Green]]). This confirms one of the major problems with "technological determinism and the resulting denial of human responsibility for change. There is a loss of human involvement that shape technology and society" ([[Sarah Miller]]).

Another conflicting idea is that of [[technological somnambulism]], a term coined by Winner in his essay "Technology as Forms of Life".  Winner wonders whether or not we are simply ''sleepwalking'' through our existence with little concern or knowledge as to how we truly interact with technology. In this view, it is still possible for us to wake up and once again take control of the direction in which we are traveling (Winner 104). However, it requires society to adopt [[Ralph Schroeder]]'s claim that, "users don't just passively consume technology, but actively transform it".

In opposition to technological determinism are those who subscribe to the belief of [[social determinism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Social determinists believe that social circumstances alone select which technologies are adopted, with the result that no technology can be considered "inevitable" solely on its own merits. Technology and culture are not neutral and when knowledge comes into the equation, technology becomes implicated in social processes. The knowledge of how to create and enhance technology, and of how to use technology is socially bound knowledge. Postmodernists take another view, suggesting that what is right or wrong is dependent on circumstance. They believe technological change can have implications on the past, present and future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Leila|year=2001|title=Technoculture: From Alphabet to Cybersex|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest|page=15|isbn=9781865080482}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they believe technological change is influenced by changes in government policy, society and culture, they consider the notion of change to be a paradox, since change is constant.

Media and cultural studies theorist [[Brian Winston]], in response to technological determinism, developed a model for the emergence of new technologies which is centered on the [[Law of the suppression of radical potential]]. In two of his books – ''Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television'' (1997) and ''Media Technology and Society'' (1998) – Winston applied this model to show how technologies evolve over time, and how their 'invention' is mediated and controlled by society and societal factors which suppress the radical potential of a given technology.

==The stirrup==
{{main|Great Stirrup Controversy}}

One continued argument for technological determinism is centered on the stirrup and its impact on the creation of [[feudalism]] in Europe in the late 8th century/early 9th century. [[Lynn White]] is credited with first drawing this parallel between feudalism and the stirrup in his book ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'', stating that as "it made possible mounted [[shock combat]]", the new form of war made the soldier that much more efficient in supporting feudal townships (White, 2). According to White, the superiority of the stirrup in combat was found in the mechanics of the lance charge: "The stirrup made possible- though it did not demand- a vastly more effective mode of attack: now the rider could law his lance at rest, held between the upper arm and the body, and make at his foe, delivering the blow not with his muscles but with the combined weight of himself and his charging stallion (White, 2)." White draws from a large research base, particularly [[Heinrich Brunner]]'s "Der Reiterdienst und die Anfänge des Lehnwesens" in substantiating his claim of the emergence of feudalism. In focusing on the evolution of warfare, particularly that of cavalry in connection with [[Charles Martel]]'s "diversion of a considerable part of the Church's vast military riches...from infantry to cavalry", White draws from Brunner's research and identifies the stirrup as the underlying cause for such a shift in military division and the subsequent emergence of feudalism (White, 4). Under the new brand of warfare garnered from the stirrup, White implicitly argues in favor of technological determinism as the vehicle by which feudalism was created.

Though an accomplished work, White's ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' has since come under heavy scrutiny and condemnation. The most volatile critics of White's argument at the time of its publication, P.H. Sawyer and R.H. Hilton, call the work as a whole "a misleading adventurist cast to old-fashioned platitudes with a chain of obscure and dubious deductions from scanty evidence about the progress of technology (Sawyer and Hilton, 90)." They further condemn his methods and, by association, the validity of technological determinism: "Had Mr. White been prepared to accept the view that the English and Norman methods of fighting were not so very different in the eleventh century, he would have made the weakness of his argument less obvious, but the fundamental failure would remain: the stirrup cannot alone explain the changes it made possible (Sawyer and Hilton, 91)." For Sawyer and Hilton, though the stirrup may be useful in the implementation of feudalism, it cannot be credited for the creation of feudalism alone.

Despite the scathing review of White's claims, the technological determinist aspect of the stirrup is still in debate. [[Alex Roland]], author of "Once More into the Stirrups; Lynne White Jr, Medieval Technology and Social Change", provides an intermediary stance: not necessarily lauding White's claims, but providing a little defense against Sawyer and Hilton's allegations of gross intellectual negligence. Roland views White's focus on technology to be the most relevant and important aspect of ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' rather than the particulars of its execution: "But can these many virtues, can this utility for historians of technology, outweigh the most fundamental standards of the profession? Can historians of technology continue to read and assign a book that is, in the words of a recent critic, "shot through with over-simplification, with a progression of false connexions between cause and effect, and with evidence presented selectively to fit with [White's] own pre-conceived ideas"? The answer, I think, is yes, at least a qualified yes (Roland, 574-575)." Objectively, Roland claims ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' a variable success, at least as "Most of White's argument stands... the rest has sparked useful lines of research (Roland, 584)." This acceptance of technological determinism is ambiguous at best, neither fully supporting the theory at large nor denouncing it, rather placing the construct firmly in the realm of the theoretical. Roland neither views technological determinism as completely dominant over history nor completely absent as well; in accordance with the above criterion of technological determinist structure, would Roland be classified as a "soft determinist".

==Notable technological determinists ==

[[Thomas L. Friedman]], American journalist, columnist and author, admits to being a technological determinist in his book ''The World is Flat''.

Futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil]]'s theories about a [[technological singularity]] follow a technologically deterministic view of history.

Some interpret Karl Marx as advocating technological determinism, with such statements as "The Handmill gives you society with the feudal lord: the [[steam-mill]], society with the industrial capitalist" (''The Poverty of Philosophy,'' 1847), but others argue that Marx was not a determinist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tdet02.html Technological or Media Determinism], Daniel Chandler&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological determinist Walter Ong reviews the societal transition from an oral culture to a written culture in his work "Orality and Literacy." He asserts that this particular development is attributable to the use of new technologies of literacy (particularly print and writing,) to communicate thoughts which could previously only be verbalized. He furthers this  argument by claiming that writing is purely context dependent as it is a "secondary modelling system" (8). Reliant upon the earlier primary system of spoken language, writing manipulates the potential of language as it depends purely upon the visual sense to communicate the intended information. Furthermore, the rather stagnant technology of literacy distinctly limits the usage and influence of knowledge, it unquestionably effects the evolution of society. In fact, Ong asserts that "more than any other single invention, writing has transformed human consciousness" (Ong 1982: 78).

== Media determinism as a form of technological determinism ==

Media determinism is a form of technological determinism, a philosophical and sociological position which posits the power of the media to impact society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/define.html ''Media Determinism in Cyberspace''], Regent University&lt;/ref&gt; Two foundational media determinists are the Canadian scholars [[Harold Innis]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. One of the best examples of technological determinism in media theory is Marshall McLuhan's theory "[[the medium is the message]]" and the ideas of his mentor Harold Adams Innis. Both these Canadian theorists saw media as the essence of civilization. The association of different media with particular mental consequences by McLuhan and others can be seen as related to technological determinism. It is this variety of determinism that is referred to as media determinism. According to McLuhan, there is an association between communications media/technology and language; similarly, [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] argues that language shapes our perception of thinking ([[linguistic determinism]]). For McLuhan, media is a more powerful and explicit determinant than is the more general concept of language. McLuhan was not necessarily a hard determinist. As a more moderate version of media determinism, he proposed that our use of particular media may have subtle influences on us, but more importantly, it is the social context of use that is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://beforebefore.net/80f/s11/media/mcluhan.pdf |last=McLuhan|first=Marshall | title=Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man |format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324065603/http://beforebefore.net/80f/s11/media/mcluhan.pdf|archivedate= March 24, 2012|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Media ecology]].
Media determinism is a form of the popular dominant theory of the relationship between [[technology and society]]. In a determinist view, technology takes on an active life of its own and is seen be as a driver of social phenomena. Innis believed that the social, cultural, political, and economic developments of each historical period can be related directly to the technology of the means of mass communication of that period. In this sense, like Dr. Frankenstein's monster, technology itself appears to be alive, or at least capable of shaping human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1789051 |last=Hist|first=Martin |title= One tweet does not a revolution make: Technological determinism, media and social change|publisher= Deakin University}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been increasingly subject to critical review by scholars. For example, scholar [[Raymond Williams]], criticizes media determinism and rather believes social movements define technological and media processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams|first=Raymond |title=Television: Technology and Cultural Form|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PXSLD8j0kb8C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Determination+is+a+real+social+process,+but+never#v=onepage&amp;q=Determination%20is%20a%20real%20social%20process%2C%20but%20never&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 May 2013 |year=1974 |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |isbn=978-0-415-31456-5 |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to communications media, audience determinism is a viewpoint opposed to media determinism. This is described as instead of media being presented as doing things to people; the stress is on the way people do things with media. Individuals need to be aware that the term "deterministic" is a negative one for many social scientists and modern sociologists; in particular they often use the word as a term of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tecdet.html |last=Chandler| first= Daniel | title=Technological or Media Determinism |date=18 September 1995|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421235047/http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tecdet.html|archivedate=April 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">Temporary adjustments are set of operations which are performed on a [[theodolite]] to make it ready for taking observations. These include its initial setting up on a tripod or other stand, centering, levelling up and focusing of eyepiece.

==Initial setting==
[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The measurement axes and scales of a theodolite]]
&lt;div&gt;The initial setting operation includes fixing the theodolite on a [[tripod]], along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. For setting up the instrument, the tripod is placed over the station with its legs widely spread so that the centre of the tripod head lies above the station point and its head approximately level (by eye estimation). The instrument is then fixed with the tripod by screwing through the trivet.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The height of the instrument should be such that observer can see through [[telescope]] conveniently. After this, a [[plumb bob]] is suspended from the bottom of the instrument and it should approximately align with the station mark.&lt;/div&gt;

==Centering==
[[image:Tribrach for surveying instruments.JPG|right|thumb|A tribrach with an optical plummet (the black cylinder pointing to the left lower corner of the image).]]
&lt;div&gt;Centering means bringing the [[vertical axis]] of the theodolite exactly over the station mark.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher, page no. 341. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; Exact centering is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the sliding head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the plumb bob is exactly over the station mark. After the exact centering, the screw clamping ring is tightened. This can be done by means of a forced centering plate or [[tribrach (instrument)|tribrach]]. An optical or laser plummet is normally used for the most accurate setting. The centering and levelling of the instrument is interactive and iterative; a re-levelling may change the centering, so error each is eliminated in successively until negligible.

==Levelling==
[[File:Green bull's eye level (level).jpg|thumb|Bull's eye level with alignment rings]]
[[File:Theodolite in use.JPG|thumb|Theodolite in use with cones to protect tripod positioning]]
Leveling of an instrument is done to make it vertical axis with respect to the apparent force of gravity at the station.

For two spirit vials at right angles;

# Bring one of the level tubes parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward. The bubble moves in the same direction as the left thumb.
# The bubble of the other level tube is then brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating the third foot screw either inward or outward. [In step 1 itself, the other plate level will be parallel to the line joining the third foot screw and the centre of the line joining the previous two foot screws.]
# Repeat Step 2 and step 3 in the same quadrant till both the bubble remain central.
# By rotating the upper part of the instrument through 180°, the level tube is brought parallel to first two-foot screws in reverse order. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment.
Otherwise, repeat the whole process starting from step 1 to step 5.

The same principle applies for a bulls-eye level:

# Bring the level parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward.
# Rotate the upper part of the instrument through 180°, so the level is over the remaining foot screw. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment. If not adjust this screw to halve the error. Then rotate back through 180 degrees and check the error. Adjust those screws to halve the residual error.  Continue until the bubble is always central on the ring.

==Focusing==
To obtain an accurate clear sighting, the cross hairs should be in focus; adjust the eyepiece to do this.

* '''Focusing of eyepiece lens'''.
For focusing of the eye piece, point the telescope to the [[sky]] or hold a piece of white paper in front of telescope. Move the eye-piece in and out until a distinct sharp black image of the cross-hairs is seen. This confirms proper focusing.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher on Page no. 342. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
To Clearly view the object being sighted Focus the objective lens.

* '''Focusing of objective lens'''.
It is done for each independent observation to bring the image of the object in the plane of cross hairs. It includes following steps of operation: First, direct the [[telescope]] towards the object for observation. Next, turn the focusing screw until the image of the object appears clear and sharp as the observer looks through properly focused eye-piece. If focusing has been done properly, there will be no parallax i.e., there will be no apparent movement of the image relative to the cross hairs if the observer moves his eye from one side to the other or from top to bottom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6434">'''The Word and the World Project''' of the [[Stanford University]]'s [[Stanford Learning Lab|Learning Lab]] developed a large lecture, Introduction to Humanities (IHUM) course adopting pedagogical strategies and technologies designed to enhance learning. The course was given in 1997 and 1998.  The goal of the curriculum innovations was to transform a large lecture course into a learning community.  Professors: [[Larry Friedlander]] (English), [[Haun Saussy]] (East Asian Studies), and [[Tim Lenior]] (History); teaching fellows: [[Carlos Seligo]] and [[Margo Denman]] and lab staff: [[Charles Kerns]] and [[George Toye]] worked together to develop a holistic curriculum mediated through a website center for the course.

==Problems in Large Lecture Courses==
This course was developed in response to the shortcomings of earlier large lecture courses. This type of course typically rated poorly in student evaluations and often led students to behaviors that inhibited learning: students skipped lectures and did not read assignments or prepare for meetings; students crammed for exams and waited until the last minute to write papers with a focus on grades and not learning. They were passive participants in a system that did not foster active engagement. Often there was a lack of continuity between lecture and section. Students had widely varying levels of knowledge about the texts. Faculty had very little information about the students’ knowledge as the course proceeded and the students had little feedback on their performance.

==Course Design==
The curriculum was based on the reading of five texts, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Blade Runner]], [[Hamlet]], [[Descartes]]' [[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]], from the viewpoint of the scholar of history, literature, or philosophy. The course emphasized methods of reading and critical and interpretive approaches, rather than content.
 
This first year course met weekly in two one-hour lectures for all 100 students and two one-hour discussion section meetings of 15 students each. Students and instructors engaged in web activities including structured reading assignments and asynchronous discussion forums. The web site provided rich resources to supplement the texts. Students worked cross-section group projects and on panel discussions.  There was no final exam for the course; a fair was held in which students exhibited their project web sites.

==Technology==
[[File:WWAnnouncements.png|thumb|Course Web Site Home Page with Announcements]]
*Central Course Web Site
A site that had a calendar, announcements, faculty bios, the asynchronous discussion forums, assignments, and student projects

[[File:WWGenesis maps.png|thumb|Web Site Genesis Material]]
*Rich Web Resources
The course web site linked rich resources supporting each text to engage students from novices to those well-informed on the texts. It included explanatory information, annotations, cultural information, critical analyses, visual interpretations of the texts including paintings, video recordings of multiple performances, and different cuts of the films.

[[File:WWHamletAssignment answers.png|thumb|Web Reading Assignment]]
*Structured Readings
The web site also had a series of on-line assignments that structured the learners’ reading activities. These on-line activities drew upon the students’ previous knowledge and guided them as they approached each text. In the first year of the project in 1997 students responses were recorded in a personal on-line, shareable portfolio, but after noting little use of the portfolio, the design was changed in the second iteration of the course in 1998 so that assignments were displayed directly in the discussion Forum.

* The Forum 
The Forum had special features to support large lecture courses such as photographs of the posting student next to his/her message, organization into sections, and notification systems to alert faculty and groups to special postings. The forum was used to discuss lectures; it was where assignments were posted (they were not sent to an instructor); and was used for communication in forming project groups.The Forum was enhanced in the second year to allow direct linkage to assignments, faculty-controlled subject organization, and threaded discussion.

* Student Project Web Sites 
The students in the course completed projects in the second half of the course that demonstrated their understanding of the texts. Projects were constructed in many media the first year but were limited to posters and web sites in the second. Faculty met often with students helping them to plan their projects. All projects from the previous year were available as models when the course was repeated.

* Evaluation
The project employed several modes of project and technology evaluation: questionnaires, interviews, video interaction analysis, peer review, and ethnographic studies. Findings:

-The Forum provided a venue for discussion by quiet students and accommodated different learning styles.
-The Forum and assignments helped students prepare for face-to-face meetings by discussing basic issues before class. 
-It added to workload of teaching staff.
-There was a positive correlation between scores on papers and number of Forum postings.

In [[medicine]], "'''topographical codes'''" (or "topography codes") are codes that indicate a specific location in the body.

==Examples==
Only the first of these is a system dedicated only to topography. The others are more generalized systems that contain topographic axes.

'''Transnational feminism''' refers to both a contemporary [[feminist]] [[paradigm]]&lt;ref name="scattered"/&gt; and the corresponding activist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawkesworth|first1=Mary|last2=Disch|first2=Lisa|title=Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=978-0199328581|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the theories and activist practices are concerned with how [[globalization]] and [[capitalism]] affect people across [[nations]], [[race (human categorization)|races]], [[genders]], [[Social class|classes]], and [[sexualities]].&lt;ref name="scattered"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=edited by M. Jacqui|last2=Mohanty|first2=Chandra Talpade|title=Feminist genealogies, colonial legacies, democratic futures|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-91212-9|page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement asks to critique the ideologies of traditional white, classist, western models of feminist practices from an intersectional approach and how these connect with labor, theoretical applications, and analytical practice on a geopolitical scale.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.nau.edu/doi/10.1177/1464700117700536#articleCitationDownloadContainer|title=Troubling transnational feminism(s): Theorising activist praxis|last=Conway|first=Janet|date=10 October 2018|website=https://doi-org.libproxy.nau.edu/10.1177%2F1464700117700536|archive-url=|archive-date=March 31, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "transnational" is reaction and the rejection of terms like "international" and "global" feminism.&lt;ref name="scattered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SwarrNagar2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohanty2003" /&gt; Transnational feminists believe that the term "international" puts more emphasis on nation-states as distinct entities, and that "global" speaks to liberal feminist theories on "global sisterhood" that ignore Third World women and women of color's perspectives on gender inequality and other problems globalization inherently brings.

The transnational feminist academic paradigm draws from [[postcolonial feminist]] theories, which emphasize how colonialist legacies have shaped and continue to shape the social, economic, and [[political repression|political oppression]] of people across the globe.&lt;ref name="scattered"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grewal|first1=Inderpal|last2=editors|first2=Caren Kaplan,|title=Scattered hegemonies : postmodernity and transnational feminist practices|date=1994|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0816621385|edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rejects the idea that people from different regions have the same [[subjectivities]] and experiences with [[gender inequality]], it further recognizes that global [[capitalism]] has created similar relations of exploitation and inequality, this core concept creates dialogue which feminists around the world can find solidarity and seek collaboration. Transnational feminism further complicates global capitalism and neoliberalism.

Transnational feminist practice is involved in activist movements across the globe that work together to understand the role of [[gender]], the state, [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[Class (social)|class]], and [[sexuality]] in critiquing and resisting structures of [[patriarchal]], [[capitalist]] power. It is attentive to feminism as both a liberatory formation and a practice that has been oppressed by and sometimes been complicit with [[colonialism]], [[racism]], and [[imperialism]]. As such, it resists [[utopian]] ideas about "global sisterhood" while simultaneously working to lay the groundwork for more productive and equitable social relations among women across borders and cultural contexts.

==Usage==

Transnational feminist theorists and practitioners vary in how they phrase "transnational feminism". Variations include "transnational feminisms", or "transnational feminist praxis"&lt;ref name="SwarrNagar2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swarr|first1=edited by Amanda Lock|last2=Nagar|first2=Richa|title=Critical Transnational Feminist Praxis|date=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=978-1438429380}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "transnational practices"&lt;ref name="KaplanGrewal2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=[ed. by] Inderpal Grewal; Caren|title=An introduction to women's studies : gender in a transnational world|date=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=9780072887181|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amanda Swarr and Richa Nagar, in their book ''Critical Transnational Feminist Praxis'', give a list of the now outdated terms that describe transnational feminist practices. They emphasize that, like these "rejects", the term "transnational" feminisms is merely a product of its time in the U.S. and Canadian academic institutions. Before, the terms were " "women of color" feminisms (Combahee River Collective 1982), "third world" feminisms (Mohanty et al. 1991), "Multicultural feminisms (e.g. Shohat 1998)", "international (Enloe 1990)" and "global" feminisms (e.g., Morgan 1984)." Currently, "transnational feminism" is the term that feminists like Chandra Mohanty and Jacqui Alexander, Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan claim has political power and can discard [[essentialist]] binaries like First World/Third World, or [[heteronormative]] gender constructs. These feminist theorists believed that "international" put more emphasis on nation-states as distinct entities, and that "global" speaks to [[liberal feminist]] theories, like Robin Morgan's concept of "global sisterhood",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|date=1996|publisher=The Feminist Press at CUNY|location=CUNY}}&lt;/ref&gt; without taking into consideration race, class, culture, or colonialist and imperialist histories.

In ''Women's studies on its own: a next wave reader in institutional change,'' Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan claim they do not think the term "transnational" is better than other "international" or "global", but that it is useful inasmuch as it is free from the implications that other terms may have:
{{Quote|text=Transnational as a term is useful only when it signals attention to uneven and dissimilar circuits of culture and capital. Through such critical recognition, the links among patriarchies, colonialisms, racisms, and feminisms become more apparent and available for critique or appropriation. The history of the term "international", by contrast, is quite different. |author=Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan |source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiegman|first1=edited by Robyn|title=Women's studies on its own : a next wave reader in institutional change|date=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, N.C. ;London|isbn=978-0822329862}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 }}

Criticisms against the term "transnational" claim that because it de-emphasizes the borders between nations and emphasizes the similar concept of global capital flows, it deceptively smooths over large inequalities between nations.&lt;ref name="Oxford2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Disch|first1=Lisa|last2=Hawkesworth|first2=Mary|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transnational Feminism in practice can be noted as a means of studying the “other”, a western concept of people not strictly related to the global north. This is the attempt to understand what factors make up their identities and struggles and a way of acknowledging  these experiences have their own complex natures, unique geographically and how this is interpolated by those examining and theorizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780190221911/obo-9780190221911-0006.xml#obo-9780190221911-0006-div2-0017|title=Transnational Feminism - Literary and Critical Theory - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Globalization===

[[Globalization]] is a process marked by greater political, economic, and social interdependence between all the nations of the world. It arose in the 1970s with greater market expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lourdes|last2=May|first2=AnnMari|last3=Strassmann|first3=Diana|title=Feminist Economics Volumes I–III, pp. xi–xxi. International Library of Critical Writings in Economics series|date=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing Inc.|location=Northampton|page=xi-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[neoliberal]] ideologies and policies spread in the 1980s and 1990s, more governments started deregulating their markets. In the Third World, governments implemented [[Structural Adjustment Programs]], which espoused the neoliberal ideologies of free trade, increased government deregulation, and reduced welfare and social protection. These practices feminized the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Standing|first1=Guy|title=Global feminization through flexible Labor|journal=World Development|date=1989|volume=17|issue=7|pages=1077–1095|doi=10.1016/0305-750x(89)90170-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because women in Third world countries are now more involved in the professional workforce, many outsource care work to women in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Martha|last2=Vanek|first2=Joann|last3=Lund|first3=Francie|last4=Heintz|first4=James|last5=Jhabvala|first5=Renana|last6=Bonner|first6=Christine|title=Progress of the World's Women|date=2005|publisher=United Nations Development Fund for Women|location=New York|pages=22–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides more job opportunities for the Third World women but also detracts from the migrants' ability to care for their own children and increases the gap in human capital between the two spheres. Because of this global demand for outsourced labor, women in countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia who would otherwise not have a job now do, and studies have shown that this improves their sense of empowerment and reduces likelihood of domestic abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kabeer|first1=Naila|title=Globalization, labor standards, and women's rights: dilemmas of collective (in)action in an interdependent world|journal=Feminist Economics|date=March 2004|volume=10|issue=1|pages=3–35|doi=10.1080/1354570042000198227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization also allows resistances against the spread of neoliberal ideologies. Transnational feminist networks, in which women from all over the world can organize together against gender inequity, would not be possible without the information and travel networks created by globalization.

===Feminism===

In the ''Oxford Handbook of Transnational Feminist Movements'', Valentine Moghadam says that "women have worked together across borders since at least the mid-1800s. (55)" What is now called [[first wave feminism]] started in the early twentieth century in the West with a focus on women's suffrage. 
During [[World War II]], the United States government gave women jobs because the war had caused a national shortage of labor. After the war ended, Irene Tinker says (oxford transnational), these jobs were taken away but women were no longer satisfied going back to their previous gender roles. Starting in the 1960s in the United States, [[second wave feminism]] emerged, defined by women's organization around "equal right to education, employment, and equal pay for equal work, and on sexual and reproductive rights." The UN Decade for Women of 1976-1985, and the following four UN conferences on women between 1975 and 1995 were essential in creating transnational feminist networks and putting feminism on a global agenda. 
However starting in the 1980s there was a separation between Western feminists and [[Third World]] feminists. This occurred largely because Western feminists largely subscribed to [[liberal feminist]] perspectives, which focused on the common patriarchal oppressor of women, defined by its confining women to the household and traditional work. Liberal feminists propose that women break this oppression by leaving their traditional roles in the household, becoming educated, and entering the labor force. Women in the global South often felt that Western feminism did not represent them and align with their struggles. They felt that Western feminism was ethnocentric and assumed all women had similar situations. Scholars like Chandra Talpade Mohanty plays an integral role in articulating concerns about Western feminism's failure to account for non-Western subjects. She critiques feminism during this time period to be more inclusive of intersectional struggles, identifying that feminism and inequalities are not linear, and the idea of female being a basis of shared oppression invisibilized the individual within their specific context and time.&lt;ref name="Mohanty 2000"/&gt; Upon realizing that the common phenomena of capitalist globalization was causing women all over the world to be disproportionately affected (CITE), transnational feminist movements allied together and helped to consolidate the field of transnational feminism.

===Transnational feminism===

The theory termed "transnational feminism" was first used&lt;ref name="Oxford2016" /&gt; by Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan in 1994 in their seminal text ''Scattered Hegemonies: Postmodernity and Transnational Feminist Practices, which situated transnational feminism among other theories of feminism, modernity, and postmodernity.''
Soon after, M. Alexander and Chandra Mohanty published ''Feminist Genealogies, Colonial Legacies, Democratic Futures'' in 1997, a book important in formulating transnational feminist canon. This text, building on Grewal and Kaplan's, focused more on the ways in which a new theory of transnational feminism could help foreground feminist activist practices in global contexts. They talk about  "feminist democracies" as ways for activists to imagine nonhegemonic futures.

The practice of transnational feminism networks, in which feminists started exchanging ideas and collaborating across nation-state borders, originated from the United Nations conferences in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Oxford2016" /&gt; In 1975 the United Nations Decade of Women began with the United Nations declaration of an International Women's Year. This ushered in a decade of conferences that would continue to the present. Important events during this period included conferences in Mexico City (1975), Copenhagen (1980), Nairobi (1985), and Beijing in 1995.&lt;ref name="SwarrNagar2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford2016" /&gt;

These conferences and others facilitated the contact of feminists from all over the globe, allowing for discussions to occur that transcended borders. While so called "western feminists", a term for feminists that were "US-based white, class-privileged women"&lt;ref name="SwarrNagar2010" /&gt; had dominated the women's rights movement, when women from other parts of the globe were brought in, they began criticizing this type of women's rights for assuming all women had the same experiences, and not considering the impact of factors such as race, state, economic status had on their lives.

The theories of WID and GAD also helped to highlight gender related issues that pertained to women worldwide.&lt;ref name="Sarah E 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dempsey|first1=Sarah E.|last2=Parker|first2=Patricia S.|last3=Krone|first3=Kathleen J.|title=Navigating Socio-Spatial Difference, Constructing Counter-Space: Insights from Transnational Feminist Praxis|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|date=August 2011|volume=4|issue=3|pages=201–220|doi=10.1080/17513057.2011.569973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/17513057.2011.569973 | volume=4 | issue=3 | title=Navigating Socio-Spatial Difference, Constructing Counter-Space: Insights from Transnational Feminist Praxis | journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication | pages=201–220| year=2011 | last1=Dempsey | first1=Sarah E | last2=Parker | first2=Patricia S | last3=Krone | first3=Kathleen J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of transnational feminist networks did many things, one such thing was creating numerous NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quataert|first1=J.H.|last2=Roth|first2=B|title=editorial note: Human rights, global conferences, and the making of postwar transnational feminism|journal=Journal of Women's History|date=2012|volume=24|issue=4|pages=11–23|doi=10.1353/jowh.2012.0038}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United Nations conferences were not the only factors leading to the transnationalization of feminism as mentioned, WID and GAD played important roles and so did other global events. As more women globally were gaining greater access to education, obtaining jobs, and becoming more mobile, it allowed for women to more easily meet and communicate. The spread of neoliberalism, poor working conditions, and declining welfare conditions in many countries led many women to find common ground and to subsequently form transnational feminist groups and organizations.&lt;ref name="Sarah E 2011"/&gt;

Although the term "transnational" was chosen for its supposed political power and ability to "resist or question modernity", Laura Briggs, in the ''Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory'', claims that "transnational feminism" could only be legitimized as a separate field of feminist study when the term "transnational" started being used by business schools, education systems, and global corporations in the 1990s. Since then, however, academic institutions have been incorporating transnational feminist studies as categories of study. In 2000, a group of feminists started publishing the journal ''[[Meridians: feminism, race, transnationalism]]'', in which feminist theorists like Amrita Basu started using the term "transnational feminism" to describe a separate and emerging field of feminist studies.

== Theory ==

Transnational feminist theories seek to destabilize liberal feminist assumptions that Third World women face the same type of oppression as First World women. 
In their seminal text'' Scattered Hegemonies: Postmodernity and Transnational Feminist Practices'', the authors Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan posit transnational feminist theory as one that critiques [[modernity]] through the lens of feminist theory. This articulation of feminist theory is a revision to the field of [[postmodernism]], which the authors argue is powerful in its critique of modern global capitalism, but inadequate because it does not explore gender or reflect on the consequences of theorizing with a Western background. Without paying attention to how colonial histories and global capital flows allow for different cultures to influence and change each other, postmodernist theorists portray non-Western cultures as essentially different from and marginal to Western cultures. Postmodern does not exemplify the realities of transnational feminism and its relation to the global south, Mohanty states "postmodernist critique that is skeptical of a systematic analysis of institutionalized power and of decolonizing methodologies that center marginalized experience (women of color epistemology) in struggles for justice is seriously off the mark".&lt;ref name="Mohanty2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Mohanty | first= C.T. | year = 2013 | title= Transnational Feminist Crossings: On Neoliberalism and Radical Critique  |url = | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 967–991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In order for activists around the world to collaborate, they need a theory that both creates solidarity among women all over the globe and recognizes difference. This involves challenging how people from different cultures understand what being a "woman" is and can be. Grewal and Kaplan express this sentiment when they say:

{{Quote|text=In working to construct such a terrain for coalition and cooperation, however, we have to rearticulate the histories of how people in different locations and circumstances are linked by the spread of and resistance to modern capitalist social formations even as their experiences of these phenomena are not at all the same or equal. }}

These modern capitalist social formations can include "humanitarian" wars waged on behalf of the supposed oppressed women.&lt;ref name="Mullally2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mullaly | first1 = S | year = 2009 | title = Gender, culture and human rights: Reclaiming universalism | url = | journal = International Journal of Law | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 87–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Laura Bush]], along with various western feminist groups such as National Organization for Women and the Feminist Majority Foundation, justified the war in Afghanistan because of "the human rights abuses committed against Afghani women and girls by the Taliban".&lt;ref name="Mullally2009"/&gt;   Transnational feminists often oppose such wars, and tend to insist that Western states try to work with local women's rights groups, such as the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA).&lt;ref name="Mullally2009" /&gt; to ensure the effectiveness of solving the cultural and systematic problem that is affecting those marginalized subjects. Another example of liberal feminist theories going wrong is the ban against wearing Muslim [[burqas]] in public. Westerners objected to burqas because they saw them as "a symbol of subservience". Transnational feminists argue that banning burqas forces women to conform to "Euro-patriarchal notions of femininity and dress",&lt;ref name="Mullally2009"/&gt; stripping them of their agency to make their own choices.

== Concerns ==
There are a number of concerns that many transnational feminists focus on. Issues of gender, imperialism, colonialism, economics, human rights, race, and nationalism encompass many areas of concern.

=== Gender ===

Transnational feminisms examine how powers of colonialism, modernity, postmodernity, and globalization construct gender norms, or normative conceptions of masculinity and femininity among the subaltern, Third World, and colonized.

Second-wave feminism in the 1980s started to explore gender instead of sex as a category of distinction between people. With a recognition that biology can identify differences between people, feminists focused on the system of gender norms as an ongoing, changeable process that shaped people's lives and behaviors. This production of critique was largely used in the Global North and is a liberal feminist ideology. Though it did not broaden the discussion of workplace discrimination and reproductive rights for heterosexual female identified people of the first world, this wave was exclusionary of Third world feminist and the global south. Second wave feminism rejected critic of inequalities due to class, race, sex, socioeconomic status, legal status, age, ability and religion.&lt;ref name="Code2006"&gt;{{cite book |last= Code |first= L. |year=2006 |chapter= Introduction |title= Encyclopedia of feminist theories |pages= xv–xxiii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With global capitalism causing more people to migrate away from their homes in search of jobs, migration has affected genders unequally, and is thus a key concern in transnational feminisms and feminist economics. Women currently account for roughly half of long-distance migration, and overwhelmingly marginalized women of color bear the burden of global capitalism.

=== Human rights ===

Because the original design of human rights, particularly as constituted in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], was designed to fit into specific legal categories, it reflected the "needs and values of affluent white Western men" who were the subjects of the legal system.&lt;ref name="CollinsFalconLodhiaTalcott2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Dana|last2=Falcon|first2=Sylvanna |last3=Lodhia |first3=Sharmila|last4=Talcott|first4=Molly|title=New Directions in Feminism and Human Rights|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|date=December 2010|volume=12|issue=3|pages=298–318|doi=10.1080/14616742.2010.513096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transnational feminists argue that human rights sometimes do not take into account other conceptions of rights, and do not recognize the experiences of women, in particular those who are "indigenous, Third World, women of color, poor, rural, disabled and queer".&lt;ref name="CollinsFalconLodhiaTalcott2010"/&gt; For example, human rights are geared towards public life and often don't account for the violations of women within their private lives. The private sector is often one of the major focuses of women's rights, including "domestic violence, the 'double day' of work and family, discrimination against homosexuals, or the denial of reproductive rights",&lt;ref name="Friedman2003"&gt;Friedman, E. J. (2003). Gendering the agenda: The impact of the transnational women's rights movement at the UN conferences of the 1990s. Women's Studies International Forum, 26(4), 313-331.&lt;/ref&gt; and even rights tied to keeping these private for women. However, human rights discourse doesn't largely concern itself with these areas.&lt;ref name="Mullally2009"/&gt; Feminists also critique that these definitions of human rights are often tied too much to the nation-state itself, and that this model discludes "the majority of women and communities throughout the world".&lt;ref name="CollinsFalconLodhiaTalcott2010"/&gt;

Feminists argue that human rights tend also to reinforce power imbalances, giving marginalized people the false assumption that they have rights. In reality these kinds of rights often work more greatly in favor of those already with power,&lt;ref name="Mullally2009"/&gt; and furthermore that nation-states that already do not care to follow human rights declarations have no incentive to protect women's rights.&lt;ref name="CollinsFalconLodhiaTalcott2010"/&gt;

=== Race ===
[[Race (human classification)|Race]] is a very relevant area of study for transnational feminism as it is concerned with cross-cultural interactions, histories, and [[Human migration|migration]]s.&lt;ref name="Park2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = H | year = 2011 | title = Migrants, minorities and economics: Transnational feminism and the Asian/Canadian woman subject | url = | journal = Asian Journal of Women Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 7–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Race plays an important role in shaping not only historical interactions between groups, but also present day migrations. Race also plays an important role in many transnational interactions shaping conceptions of [[cultures]] and groups of people.&lt;ref name="Khan2013"&gt;Khan, S. (2013). Zina, transnational feminism, and the moral regulation of Pakistani women. Vancouver: UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Race is a key component in transnational feminism, race and ethnicity contribute to the complexities of why globalization and neoliberal agendas are imposed on certain groups (colonized; read: marginalized groups) over others (colonizer; read: imperial elitist).

=== Economics ===

Some transnational feminist groups focus on [[economic]] issues. Many of the most important issues to transnational feminists revolve around economics. For many transnational feminists like [[Chandra Talpade Mohanty|Mohanty]], [[global capitalism]] is a serious problem and one that hurts [[women]], particularly [[Third World]] women.&lt;ref name= "Mohanty2003"&gt;Mohanty, C. T. (2003). Feminism without borders. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Mohanty argues strongly against global capitalism. She considers herself an [[anti-capitalist]] and is opposed to [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="Mohanty2003"/&gt; Mohanty advocates transnational feminists take similar stances.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2003"/&gt; The expansion of [[neoliberalism]] and [[neoliberal]] policies are also of concern given their often negative impacts on women.&lt;ref name="Signs2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Signs | first1 = C | year = 2011 | title = We want empowerment for our women: Transnational Feminism, Neoliberal Citizenship, and the Gendering of Women's Political Subjectivity in Postconflict South Sudan | url = | journal = Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 627–652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Audre Lorde, empowering people who are doing work, like educating others, does not mean using privilege to overstep and overpower groups like educators. Instead, these people must use their privilege to hold the door open for more allies to step in and support groups like educators or less-industrialized groups of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dangerous Liaisons: Gender, Nation, and Postcolonial Perspectives|last=Lorde|first=Audre|first2=|publisher=University of Minneapolis Press|year=1997|isbn=9780816626496|editor-last=McClintock|editor-first=Anne|location=Minneapolis|pages=374–380|chapter=Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonialism ===
Colonialism is one of the most important areas of concern for transnational feminism. Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan talk about how colonialism has created situations of gender inequality that continue to disadvantage the lives of women today. Sometimes this inequality takes the form of neocolonialism, which manifests in the way that First World or Western feminists talk about women from the Third World, creating a binary of Us vs. Them rather than developing a cultural understanding of the differences each respective group has. These ways of talking do not consider colonialist histories and tend to portray Third World women as isolated from flows of global capital and information, and therefore passive, helpless, and uninformed. Such Western depictions of non-Western women, Grewal and Kaplan argue, only perpetuate hierarchies that place Western theorists at the superior center and non-Western theorists and people at the inferior margins.

=== Imperialism ===
[[Imperialism]] has had numerous effects on people. Imperialism has often been the impetus for colonialism. Transnational feminism examines not only colonial history, but how imperialism may have contributed to that history. Imperialism is not an issue of only the past, but one of modern-day concern. For example, the United States occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan can be seen as imperialistic in nature. The United States has also had a substantial military presence in [[Pakistan]]. Some transnational feminists argue this kind of imperialistic nature has led to the increased [[fundamentalism]] and [[extremism]] in Pakistan, which can be seen in the [[Zina]] laws.&lt;ref name="Khan2013"/&gt; The Zina Laws are strict religious laws that regulate extramarital and premarital sex. These laws have very negative effects on women's livelihoods. Transnational feminism looks at the reasons behind the oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Khan2013"/&gt; Some feminists might simply look at the oppressive nature of such policies, while many transnational feminists look to how these oppressive policies came to be.&lt;ref name="Khan2013"/&gt; By not only examining the issue at hand but depthinging the systematic ideologies such as neocolonialism and imperialism and how those contribute to the initial involvement into that country.

=== Nationalism ===
In her essay "Postcolonial Legacies", Geraldine Heng shows how feminism in almost all Third World countries arose as part of nationalistic agendas that were reacting against colonialism and imperialism.&lt;ref name="scattered" /&gt; Kwame Anthony Appiah talks about how footbinding in China ended when it was seen to represent the weakness of the nation: here, Chinese nationalism enacts its hopes for an anti-imperialist future on the bodies of its women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appiah|first1=Kwame Anthony|title=The Honor Code: How Moral Revolutions Happen|date=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton and Co.|location=New York|page=x–xix and 137–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some transnational feminist are antagonistic to nationalism because of its history of being a tool of control "the retrospective activity of nation-building in modernity is always predicated upon women as trope".&lt;ref name="Herr2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Herr | first= R.S.| year = 2014 | title= Reclaiming Third World Feminism: or Why Transnational Feminism Needs Third World Feminism  |url = | journal = Meridians: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The nation-state ===

Because global capitalism is one of the driving forces for much of the inequalities that transnational feminists are addressing with, and nation-states produce and reproduce structures of global capitalism, nation-states are important to look at in transnational feminist practices.

Today, there is also a wave of transnational feminism with "important currents of feminism are challenging the state-territorial framing of political claims-making" and that rejects "the state-territorial frame" itself.&lt;ref name="Fraser2005"&gt;Fraser, N. (2005). Mapping the feminist imagination: From redistribution to recognition to representation. Constellations,12(3), 295-307.&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that the actions of one state can and tend to affect the lives of women in surrounding territories, and even throughout the world with more powerful actors. Furthermore, the actions of non-state actors, especially those of international organizations, of the governmental and non-governmental varieties, have huge impacts on the lives of women without consideration of state borders. Likewise, communication at the scale it exists today can alter the lives of women, especially with "global mass media and cyber technology".&lt;ref name="Fraser2005"/&gt; Many of the issues that women around the world face as well are not simply from within state borders, such as sickness and climate change, so the traditional model of the state does not do enough for helping to solve these issues.

Some further claim that this framework of the state further contributes to oppression, as it "partitions political space in ways that block many women from challenging the forces that oppress them", especially with the protection international corporations and the current global governance of the economy.&lt;ref name="Fraser2005"/&gt; Many of the poor and marginalized in the world, especially of the women, are restricted in seeking justice for problems against such large, international corporations. It also takes many groups out of the global decision making, as, with a few exceptions, women are underrepresented at the national level in many states and in many global governance groups.&lt;ref name="Fraser2005"/&gt; These feminists argue that because women are among the most impoverished and underrepresented of the world, in the current framework of the global nation-state, it is even more difficult for women to attempt to create change, when in order to do so, they must often go against their domestic state or an international corporation, both of which have more resources and influence than a singular or even a small community of women, so this power division and systematic structure seeks to further oppress women.

== Networks and organizations ==

In the Introduction for the Oxford Handbook of Transnational Feminist Movements, Rawwida Baksh and Wendy Harcourt define transnational feminist movements as "the fluid coalescence of organizations, networks, coalitions, campaigns, analysis, advocacy and actions that politicize women's rights and gender equality issues beyond the nation-state, particularly from the 1990s, when deepening globalization and new communications and information technologies (ICTs) enabled feminists to connect readily with a nt interrogate their localities and cross-border relations (4)." The formation of Transnational Feminist Network organizations requires methods for approaching the conflicts that arise based out of cultural and personal differences of women across the globe. Approaches include dialogue based conversations, flexibility and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=Anna|title=Transnational Dialogue: Building the Social Infrastructure for Transnational Feminist Networks|journal=International Journal of Peace Studies|date=2005|volume=10|issue=2|pages=69–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AF3IRM is also anti-imperialist, acknowledging and addressing the role United States imperialism and global capitalism plays in the subjugation of women worldwide. It is

== Movements/activism ==

Gender plays a large role in the allotment of work, quality of work, type of work etc. Women often find themselves in poor working conditions, earning minimal pay, and having little to no channels to protest or negotiate the conditions. Rural [[agricultural]] work in [[Brazil]] often exemplifies some of these conditions. Transnational feminists take interests in projects to improve gender relations in family agriculture.&lt;ref name="Thayer2010"&gt;Thayer, M. (2010). Making transnational feminism: Rural women, ngo activists, and northern donors in Brazil. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists wanted to understand the [[Hierarchy|subordination]] of women agricultural workers and also give the women the tools to increase political discourse.&lt;ref name="Thayer2010"/&gt; By creating [[political discourse]] they could hopefully increase their [[bargaining power]] in [[labour economics|labor]] situations.&lt;ref name="Thayer2010"/&gt; Labor rights are an issue for women not only in Brazil, but all over the world. Transnational feminists in [[South Africa]] study and acknowledge the many factors affecting women.&lt;ref name="Turshen2010"&gt;Turshen, M. (Ed.). (2010). African women: A political economy. New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in South Africa face racial oppression, gender oppression, and subsequently oppression as workers.&lt;ref name="Turshen2010"/&gt;

== Critiques ==

Transnational feminism has been criticized for working within the imperialistic framework it has derived from.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Networking Arguments : Rhetoric, Transnational Feminism, and Public Policy Writing|last=Dingo|first=Rebecca|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=2012|isbn=9780822961888|location=|pages=7, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major criticism of transnational feminism lie in the duality of approach to research. While the United States has been seen as a great source for imperialist privilege, Sylvanna Falcón asserts that it is not the US alone that "practices imperial privilege".

:''"Privileges garnered as a result of geopolitical power are not always experienced''
:''the same way, even by groups of people who benefit from the same structural privileges."'' &lt;ref&gt;Falcón, Sylvanna M. (2016).

Frontiers, 37(1). {{DOI|10.5250/fronjwomestud.37.1.0vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This speaks to the level in which "Western" feminism is still homogenized as a single experience, even from transnational feminist scholars. Falcón reminds scholars to be mindful of the social location of identities that lie within the area of Western feminism while utilizing a transnational feminist lens. Furthermore, Falcón's assessment of the transnational feminist approach to ontology challenges the "tendency to secularize US feminist research."&lt;ref&gt;Falcón, Sylvanna M. (2016).

== Methodology ==

One key critique to transnational feminist research and literature is the obtainment of resources to accurately represent the masses and marginalised people. Falcon suggests "building of ethics involves relationships and solidarity models, prioritizing collective justice, adopting alternative research models that acknowledge the dimensions of spirituality in relation to ethics".&lt;ref name="Falcón2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Falcón| first= S.M.| year = 2016 | title= Transnational Feminism as a Paradigm for Decolonizing the Practice of Research: Identifying Feminist Principles and Methodology Criteria for US-Based Scholars  |url = | journal = Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 174–194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to collect other sources besides elite academic search components to ensure the accessibility of this knowledge. This also challenges academia's tendency to be exclusionary and selective to what is considered valid and noteworthy content. "Imperialist privilege is one of those contradictory factors in the research process".&lt;ref name="Falcón2016"/&gt; To bridge this gap the call for building a research community through seeking out community members, collecting testimonies to people affected by neocolonialism in marginalized communities and involving family members is crucial to creating an organic collective of non-academic, valid knowledge for transnational feminism rhetoric. 
The challenge Transnational Feminist researchers are faced with is the ability to incorporate ontologies that are relational Falcon, further explains

"Knowledge production is collective, and we must strive to retain that collective spirit in the organization of our research. As a result, scholars may have to be more creative about their research practices or acknowledge that we do not have the existing methodological tools or ability to research certain dimensions of relational ontologies."&lt;ref name="Falcón2016"/&gt;

This is not to discourage Transnational feminist but to further critique the modes in which research and academic literature obtains its knowledge. Acknowledging the central nature of feminist research as being imperialist is crucial to understanding how to further improve feminist scholarship.

The '''vaginal flora in pregnancy''', or '''vaginal microbiota in pregnancy''', is different from the [[vaginal flora]] (the population of microorganisms that resides in the vagina) before [[sexual maturity]], during reproductive years, and after [[menopause]]. A description of the vaginal flora of pregnant women who are [[immunocompromised]] is not covered in this article. The composition of the vaginal flora significantly differs in [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="AfricaNel2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Africa|first1=Charlene|last2=Nel|first2=Janske|last3=Stemmet|first3=Megan|title=Anaerobes and Bacterial Vaginosis in Pregnancy: Virulence Factors Contributing to Vaginal Colonisation|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=11|issue=7|year=2014|pages=6979–7000|issn=1660-4601|doi=10.3390/ijerph110706979|pmid=25014248|pmc=4113856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria or viruses that are infectious most often have no symptoms.

==Normal microbiota==

{{Further information|Vaginal flora}}

==Microbiota in pregnancy==
In normal pregnancy, the resident vaginal flora is thought to provide protection against infection. The microbiota during pregnancy is predominantly Lactobacillus spp.  Microbiota composition can change during the course of the pregnancy.  If the microbiota populations become more diverse, indicating that the normal Lactobacillus-dominated population has changed to a bacterial vaginosis population, risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes increase.&lt;ref name="LamontSobel2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamont|first1=RF|last2=Sobel|first2=JD|last3=Akins|first3=RA|last4=Hassan|first4=SS|last5=Chaiworapongsa|first5=T|last6=Kusanovic|first6=JP|last7=Romero|first7=R|title=The vaginal microbiome: new information about genital tract flora using molecular based techniques|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology|volume=118|issue=5|year=2011|pages=533–549|issn=1470-0328|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2010.02840.x|pmc=3055920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal discharge is common during pregnancy but is not an indicator of bacterial vaginosis or abnormal Lactobacillus-dominated microbiota.&lt;ref name="PetrovaLievens2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrova|first1=Mariya I.|last2=Lievens|first2=Elke|last3=Malik|first3=Shweta|last4=Imholz|first4=Nicole|last5=Lebeer|first5=Sarah|title=Lactobacillus species as biomarkers and agents that can promote various aspects of vaginal health|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|volume=6|year=2015|issn=1664-042X|doi=10.3389/fphys.2015.00081}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment of abnormal vaginal microbiota populations with lactobacilli and estriol during pregnancy was found to restore the microbiota to a normal state.&lt;ref name="UnluDonders2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Unlu|first1=Cihat|last2=Donders|first2=Gilbert|title=Use of lactobacilli and estriol combination in the treatment of disturbed vaginal ecosystem: a review|journal=Journal of the Turkish German Gynecological Association|volume=12|issue=4|year=2011|pages=239–246|issn=1309-0399|doi=10.5152/jtgga.2011.57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bacterial vaginosis and pregnancy==
{{further information|List of bacterial vaginosis microbiota}}
[[Bacterial vaginosis]] in pregnancy is an alteration of the normal vaginal microbiota of pregnancy. Intrauterine infections in pregnancy are caused by bacteria that cause inflammation.  The women may experience few or no symptoms. This sometimes leads to [[chorioamnionitis]] and other negative pregnancy outcomes. When there are high bacterial counts in of the vagina during pregnancy is typically due to the presence of the following organisms:

*''[[G. vaginalis]]''
*''[[F. nucleatum]]''
*''[[Staphylococci]]  spp''
*''[[Streptococci]]''
*''[[Atopobium vaginae]]''
*''[[Mobiluncus]] spp''
*''[[Mycoplasma]]'' spp
*[[Bacteroides ureolyticus]]
*''[[Fusobacterium]]''&lt;ref name="PetrovaLievens2015"/&gt;

==History==
Investigations into reproductive-associated microbiomes began around 1885 by [[Theodor Escherich]]. He wrote that [[meconium]] from the newborn was free of bacteria. This was interpreted as the uterine environment was sterile. Other investigations used sterile diapers for meconium collection. No bacteria were able to be cultured from the samples. Bacteria were detected and were directly proportional to the time between birth and the passage of meconium.&lt;ref name="Per2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perez-Muñoz|first1=Maria Elisa|last2=Arrieta|first2=Marie-Claire|last3=Ramer-Tait|first3=Amanda E.|last4=Walter|first4=Jens|title=A critical assessment of the "sterile womb" and "in utero colonization" hypotheses: implications for research on the pioneer infant microbiome|journal=Microbiome|volume=5|issue=1|year=2017|issn=2049-2618|doi=10.1186/s40168-017-0268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water quality modeling''' involves the prediction of [[water pollution]] using [[mathematical model|mathematical simulation]] techniques. A typical [[water quality]] model consists of a collection of formulations representing physical mechanisms that determine position and momentum of [[pollutants]] in a water body.  Models are available for individual components of the hydrological system such as [[surface runoff]]; there also exist basinwide models addressing [[hydrologic transport model|hydrologic transport]] and for ocean and estuarine applications.  Often [[finite difference]] methods are used to analyse these phenomena, and, almost always, large complex [[computer model]]s are required.

==Formulations and  associated Constants==
Water quality is modeled by one or more of the following formulations:
* [[Advective Transport formulation]]
* [[Dispersive Transport formulation]]
* [[Surface Heat Budget formulation]]
* [[Dissolved Oxygen Saturation formulation]]
* [[Reaeration formulation]]
* [[Carbonaceous Deoxygenation formulation]]
* [[Nitrogenous Biochemical Oxygen Demand formulation]]
* [[Sediment oxygen demand formulation]] (SOD)
* [[Photosynthesis and Respiration formulation]]
* [[pH and Alkalinity formulation]]
* [[Nutrients formulation]] (fertilizers)
* [[Algae formulation]]
* [[Zooplankton formulation]]
* [[Coliform bacteria formulation]] (e.g. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'')

'''West Bengal Judicial Academy''' is a training institution for the Judges of the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and officers of the [[West Bengal Judicial Service]]. The institution organises Induction Level Training for newly appointed Judicial Officers as well as entry level District Judges of West Bengal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbja.nic.in/|title=West Bengal Judicial Academy|last=|first=|date=|website=wbja.nic.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The [[Law Commission of India]] recommended to establish Judicial academies in various state of [[India]] for training of all Judges of the subordinate Judiciary. Subsequently the [[Supreme Court of India]] accepted those recommendations and on 28 February [[Calcutta High Court]] issued a notification to set up a state Judicial Academy under the name of West Bengal Judicial Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbja.nic.in/wbja_adm/files/Establishment.pdf|title=The Kolkata Gazette|last=|first=|date=June 14, 2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 2005, the [[Chief Justice of India]] Mr. Justice [[Y.K.
