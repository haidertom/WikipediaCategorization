      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2787">The '''Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science''' is a cross-disciplinary organization founded in 2009 within [[Stony Brook University]]'s School of Journalism, in [[Stony Brook, New York]].

Its current director is Laura Lindenfield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/?cat=6 Staff and Leadership Archive], Center for Communicating Science&lt;/ref&gt;  Its goal is to help scientists learn to communicate more effectively with the public, including policymakers, students, funders and the media. It was inspired by [[Alan Alda]], the actor, writer and science advocate, in whose honor it was renamed in 2013, and is supported by [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=sbpress&gt;{{cite web|title=It was a SM*A*S*H of Science|url=http://sbpress.com/2010/10/it-was-a-s-mash-of-science/|work=October 1, 2010|publisher=[[Stony Brook Press]]|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center offers courses in communication that have been taken by more than 200 graduate students in the sciences and health professions at Stony Brook. It also conducts workshops at universities, laboratories and science meetings around the country. Many of its workshops use improvisational theater exercises to help scientists connect more directly with listeners and respond more spontaneously to their needs.&lt;ref name="Actor Is Honored for Using Improv to Help Scientists Communicate"&gt;{{cite news |last=Basken |first=Paul |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Alan-Alda-the-Actor-Is/138673/ |title=Actor Is Honored for Using Improv to Help Scientists Communicate |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2015-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Alda and the Center issued the "Flame Challenge",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flamechallenge.org/|title=Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science™|work=flamechallenge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; asking scientists to come up with the best explanation for a [[flame]] for an intended audience of 11-year-olds.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Alda seeking curious 11-year-old scientists|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46609095/ns/technology_and_science-science|work=Mar 2, 2012|publisher=MSNBC.com|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='npr-totn'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/2012/03/23/149231680/alan-alda-asks-scientists-what-is-a-flame | title = Alan Alda Asks Scientists "What Is A Flame?" | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | date = 2012-03-23 | work = [[Science Friday]] | publisher = [[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''Algorithms of Oppression'' is a text based on over six years of academic research on Google search algorithms. Noble argues that though algorithms themselves may not be racist, they can [[Algorithmic bias|reflect the biases]] and values of the people who create them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/06/scholar-sets-twitter-furor-critiquing-book-he-hasnt-read|title=Scholar sets off Twitter furor by critiquing a book he hasn't read|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/algorithms-of-oppression-racist/|title=Can an algorithm be racist? Spotting systemic oppression in the age of Google|date=2018-03-03|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These algorithms can then have negative biases against [[women of color]] and other marginalized populations, while also affecting Internet users in general by leading to "racial and gender profiling, misrepresentation, and even economic redlining".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/safiya-umoja-noble/algorithms-of-oppression/|title=ALGORITHMS OF OPPRESSION by Safiya Umoja Noble {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Critical reception for ''Algorithms of Oppression'' has been largely positive. In the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', Emily Drabinski writes, "What emerges from these pages is the sense that Google’s algorithms of oppression comprise just one of the hidden infrastructures that govern our daily lives, and that the others are likely just as hard-coded with white supremacy and misogyny as the one that Noble explores."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/ideologies-of-boring-things-the-internet-and-infrastructures-of-race/#!|title=Ideologies of Boring Things: The Internet and Infrastructures of Race - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[PopMatters]],'' Hans Rollman describes writes that ''Algorithms of Oppression'' "demonstrate[s] that search engines, and in particular [[Google]], are not simply imperfect machines, but systems designed by humans in ways that replicate the power structures of the western countries where they are built, complete with all the sexism and racism that are built into those structures."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ''[[Booklist]],'' reviewer Lesley Williams states, "Noble’s study should prompt some soul-searching about our reliance on commercial search engines and about digital social equity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Algorithms-of-Oppression-How-Search-Engines-Reinforce-Racism-Safiya-Umoja-Noble/pid=9240185|title=Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism, by Safiya Umoja  Noble {{!}} Booklist Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February 2018, ''Algorithms of Oppression'' received press attention when the official [[Twitter]] account for the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] expressed criticism of the book, citing that the thesis of the text, based on the text of the book's official blurb on commercial sites, could not be reproduced. IEEE's outreach historian, Alexander Magoun, later revealed that he had not read the book, and issued an apology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''The Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology''' (ASHA) was founded as the Australian Society for Historical Archaeology in 1970 by [[Judy Birmingham]], then a lecturer at the [[University of Sydney]]. Its aims were, and still are, to promote the study of [[historical archaeology in Australia]].

==Origins==

The Australian Society for Historical Archaeology, came out of the developing interest in archaeology in Australia in the 1970s, and in particular the increasing interest generated by uncovering of Colonial period archaeology in [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]], [[Sydney Cove]], [[The Rocks, Sydney|The Rocks]] and other parts of [[New South Wales]], as well as the first historical archaeology course at the University of Sydney, in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, Ian 2006  “Historical Archaeology, Heritage and the [[University of Sydney]]”, ''Australasian Historical Archaeology'' 24:19-24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the society was extended to include [[New Zealand]] and the Asia-Pacific region generally, and its name was changed to the Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology. In the mid-1990s the Society's committee moved from being Sydney based to being a more Australasian wide committee (Neville Ritchie, the then president lived in New Zealand) reflecting the growth of historical archaeology in the region.

The society's activities include public lectures and an annual conference with papers presented by national and international speakers. It promotes the exchange of information and reference material relating to historical archaeology in Australia and overseas.

ASHA publishes the ''ASHA Newsletter'' and the journal ''Australasian Historical Archaeology'', (distributed free to members of the Society), as well as the ''Occasional Papers'' series and monographs. Initially ASHA published only a ''Newsletter'' which was important in conveying relevant news and information (often research findings). In 1983 the society began publishing the ''Australian Journal of Historical Archaeology'' under the editorship of [[Graham Connah]]. This provided the only venue for publishing the results of historical archaeological research in Australia. In 1981 the journal was renamed to reflect the contribution of New Zealand Historical Archaeology and became the ''Australasian Historical Archaeology'', and has remained the main journal in Australia for publication of research and excavation results from Historical Archaeological Projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informit.com.au/products/productdetails.aspx?id=1322-9214&amp;container=IELHSS RMIT, INFORMIT, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Collection Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume included 'A first bibliography of historical archaeology in Australia', which was subsequently updated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asha.org.au/australasian-historical-archaeology/ ''Australian Historical Archaeology''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830134127/http://www.asha.org.au/australasian-historical-archaeology/ |date=August 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been important in developing theory and practice in Historical Archaeology, with early analytical articles such as Graham Connah's  'Stamp-collecting or increasing understanding',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashadocs.org/aha/01/01_04_Connah.pdf Graham Connah, 'Stamp-collecting or increasing understanding: the dilema of Historical Archaeology', ''Australian Historical Archaeology'', 1, 1983, pp.15-21]&lt;/ref&gt; which he followed up with the answer in 1998 in 'Pattern and purpose in Historical Archaeology'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashadocs.org/aha/16/16_04_Connah.pdf Graham Connah, 'Pattern and purpose in Historical Archaeology' ''Australian Historical Archaeology'', No 6. 1998, pp.3-7]&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by Mackay and Karskers review of Connah's approasial, focusing on the ''...contribution of other forms of public archaeology in Australia in the
late twentieth century.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashadocs.org/aha/17/17_04_Mackay.pdf RICHARD MACKAY and GRACE KARSKENS, 'Historical Archaeology in Australia: Historical or Hysterical? Crisis or Creative Awakening?', ''Australasian Historical Archaeology'', 17, 1999, pp. 110-115]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BBC Research &amp; Development''' is the national technical research department of the [[BBC]].

==Function==
It has responsibility for researching and developing advanced and emerging media technologies for the benefit of the corporation, and wider UK and European media industries, and is also the technical design authority for a number of major technical infrastructure transformation projects for the UK broadcasting industry.

==Structure==
BBC R&amp;D is part of the wider [[BBC Design &amp; Engineering]], and is led by Andy Conroy, Controller Research &amp; Development.&lt;ref name="andyconroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2015/09/introduction-to-the-controller|title=Introduction to the Controller|work=BBC R&amp;D Blog|date=9 September 2015|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the North Lab moved into [[MediaCityUK]] in [[City of Salford|Salford]]  along with several other departments of the BBC, whilst the South Lab remained in [[BBC White City|White City]] in London.

==History==
[[Image:Rainbow over Kingswood Warren - geograph.org.uk - 137535.jpg|thumb|Former site at [[Kingswood Warren]]]]
The department as it stands today was formed in 1993 from the merger of the BBC Designs Department and the BBC Research Department. From 2006 to 2008 it was known as '''Research and Innovation'''  but has since reverted to its original name. '''BBC Research &amp; Development''' has made major contributions to broadcast technology, carrying out original research in many areas, and developing items like the [[peak programme meter]] (PPM) which became the basis for many world standards.

===Innovations===
It has also been involved in many well known consumer technologies such as [[teletext]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], [[NICAM]] and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. It was at the forefront of development of [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]], stereo FM, and [[Radio Data System|RDS]]. These innovations have led to [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Awards for Innovation]] in 1969, 1974, 1983, 1987, 1992, 1998, 2001 and 2011.

In the 1970s, its engineers designed the famous [[LS3/5A]] studio monitor for use in [[outside broadcasting]] units.&lt;ref name=hfa1979bbchomeservice&gt;Prakel, David (August 1979).

Whatton, C.Eng., M.I.E.E. and R.W. Mills.

[http://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/stirling-broadcast-ls35a-v2-loudspeaker/ "Stirling Broadcast LS3/5a V2 Loudspeaker"]. ''The Absolute Sound''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure of Kingswood Warren and move to London and Salford===
In early 2010 the department had approximately 135 staff based at three locations:  White City in London, Kingswood Warren in [[Kingswood, Surrey]], and the R&amp;D (North Lab) at the BBC's Manchester offices at New Broadcasting House, Oxford Road, [[Manchester]]. In early 2010 the Kingswood Warren site was vacated and the bulk of the department relocated to Centre House, in [[White City, London]] co-locating with the main campus of the BBC in London, whilst a significant number have moved to the new North Lab in [[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].

==Future projects==
BBC R&amp;D engineers and researchers are currently active on approximately 50 projects, including 7 active national and international collaborative research efforts.

These include R&amp;D projects built around [[BBC Redux]]&lt;ref name="notube"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labs.notu.be/1/bbc/about.html|title=NoTube Archive Browser Experiment 1|work=NoTube Archive Browser|date=19 December 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306190402/http://labs.notu.be/1/bbc/about.html|archive-date=6 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="james-archak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://custard-cat.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/archak-bbc-research-and-development.html|title=ArcHak|work=CustardCat|first=Bruce|last=James|date=5 November 2009|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="browser-extensions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2010/08/-prototyping-weeknotes-29-2708.shtml|title=Prototyping Weeknotes #29|date=27 August 2010|accessdate=13 May 2012|work=BBC Research &amp; Development Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dtg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=4296|title=BBC R&amp;D develops 'mood based navigation'|work=News|publisher=[[Digital TV Group]]|author=DTG staff|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2012/01/an-interface-for-mood-based-navigation.shtml|title=An Affective Interface for Mood-Based Navigation|first=Rosie|last=Campbell|date=16 January 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012|work=BBC Research &amp; Development Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redux-mood-testing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/2009/10/mulitmedia_classification.shtml|work=Projects|title=Multimedia Classification|author=BBC Research and Development|accessdate=13 May 2012|quote=User Evaluation on BBC Redux (by BBC staff) …}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="annual-2009-2010"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/bbc_rd_annual_review_2009-2010.pdf|title=Highlights of the Year|work=BBC R&amp;D Annual Review 2009–2010|date=10 March 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Highlights of the Year|work=BBC R&amp;D Annual Report 2010–2011|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/bbc_rd_annual_review_2010-2011.pdf|page=5|date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the [[proof of concept]] for the cross-platform, [[Flash video]]-based streaming version of the [[BBC iPlayer]].&lt;ref name="bird"&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.uknof.org.uk/uknof13/Bird-Redux.pdf|first=Tom|last=Bird|date=28 May 2009|title=BBC Redux|publisher=[[UKNOF]] 13|location=Sheffield|pages=2–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2319">In [[astrophysics]], the '''Biermann battery''' is a process by which a weak seed [[magnetic field]] can be generated from zero initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2008ApJ...688L..57X|title=The Biermann Battery in Cosmological MHD Simulations of Population III Star Formation|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=688|issue=2|pages=L57|author1=Xu|first1=Hao|last2=O'Shea|first2=Brian W.|last3=Collins|first3=David C.|last4=Norman|first4=Michael L.|last5=Li|first5=Hui|last6=Li|first6=Shengtai|year=2008|doi=10.1086/595617|arxiv = 0807.2647 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative motion between [[electron]]s and [[ion]]s is driven by rotation. The process was discovered by [[Ludwig Biermann]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Uber den Ursprung der Magnetfelder auf Sternen und im interstellaren Raum (mit einem Anhang von A. Schluter)|journal=Zeitschrift für Naturforschung|volume=5|pages=65|author1=Biermann|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1998MNRAS.295L...6K|title=Generation of magnetic fields by a gravitomagnetic plasma battery|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=295|pages=L6|author1=Khanna|first1=Ramon|year=1998|doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.29511447.x|arxiv = astro-ph/9803240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple derivation of the effect starts with the momentum equation for the free electron fluid, keeping only the [[electric field]] and pressure force:

&lt;math&gt;m_e{d\vec v_e \over dt}=-e\vec E-{\nabla p_e \over n_e}&lt;/math&gt;.

For phenomena on sufficiently slow time scales, the left-hand side of the above equation can be neglected. That leads to the [[Ohm's law]] for the electric field:

&lt;math&gt;\vec E=-{\nabla p_e \over en_e}&lt;/math&gt;.

The other terms in the general Ohm's law are neglected here since they typically vanish for zero magnetic field and do not spontaneously generate field. Inserting the above electric field into [[Faraday's law of induction]] gives an equation for the magnetic field:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \vec B \over \partial t}={1\over en_e}\nabla T_e \times\nabla n_e&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that magnetic fields develop "spontaneously", that is, from initially being zero, when there are non-parallel gradients in electron temperature and density.

A '''biochore''' is a subdivision of the [[biosphere]] consisting of [[biotope]]s that resemble one another&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ecology/Biosphere_Organization&lt;/ref&gt; and thus are colonized by similar [[vegetation]].

A '''biomarker, '''or '''biological marker,''' is defined as a "cellular, biochemical or molecular alteration in cells, tissues or fluids that can be measured and evaluated to indicate normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayeux|first=Richard|date=April 2004|title=Biomarkers: Potential Uses and Limitations|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC534923/|journal=NeuroRx|volume=1|pages=182-188|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Biomarkers characterize disease progression starting from the earliest [[Natural history of disease|natural history of the disease]].  Biomarkers assess disease susceptibility and severity, which allows one to predict outcomes, determine interventions and evaluate therapeutic responses. From a forensics and epidemiologic perspective, biomarkers offer unique insight about the relationships between environmental risk factors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayeux|first1=Richard|title=Biomarkers: Potential Uses and Limitations|pmc=534923|publisher=NeuroRX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classes of Biomarkers==
Three broad classes of biomarkers are '''prognostic biomarkers''', '''predictive biomarkers''' and '''pharmacodynamic biomarkers'''.

===Prognostic Biomarkers===
[[Prognosis|Prognostic]] biomarkers give intervention-independent information on disease status through screening, diagnosis and disease monitoring.  Prognostic biomarkers can signify individuals in the [[Incubation period|latent period]] of a disease's natural history, allowing optimal therapy and prevention until the disease's termination. Prognostic biomarkers give information on disease status by measuring the internal precursors that increase or decrease the likelihood of attaining a disease.  For example, [[blood pressure]] and [[cholesterol]] are biomarkers for [[Cardiovascular disease|CVD]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prognostic biomarkers can be direct or indirect to the causal pathway of a disease.  If a prognostic biomarker is a direct step in the causal pathway, it is one of the factors or products of the disease.  A prognostic biomarker could be indirectly associated with a disease if it is related to a change caused by the exposure, or related to an unknown factor connected with the exposure or disease.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gainor|first1=Justin|last2=Longo|first2=Dan|last3=Chabner|first3=Bruce|title=Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers: Falling Short of the Mark?|url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/20/10/2587.full|publisher=AACR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictive Biomarkers===
Predictive biomarkers measure the effect of a drug and tell if the drug is having its expected activity, but do not offer any direct information on the disease.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Predictive biomarkers are highly sensitive and specific; therefore they increase [[Diagnostic test|diagnostic]] validity of a drug or toxin's site-specific effect by eliminating recall bias and subjectivity from those exposed. For example, when an individual is exposed to a drug or toxin, the concentration of that drug or toxin within the body, or the '''[[Effective dose (pharmacology)|biological effective dose]]''', provides a more accurate prediction for the effect of the drug or toxin compared to an estimation or measurement of the toxin from the origin or external environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers===
[[Pharmacodynamics|Pharmacodynamic]] (PD) biomarkers can measure the direct interaction between a drug and its receptor.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers reveal drug mechanisms, if the drug has its intended effect on the biology of the disease, ideal biological dosing concentrations, and physiologic response/resistance mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers are particularly relevant in drug mechanisms of tumor cells, where pharmacodynamic endpoints for drug interventions can be assessed directly on tumor tissues.  For example, protein phosphorylation biomarkers indicate alterations in target [[protein kinases]] and activation of downstream signaling molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pharmacodynamic biomarkers for molecular cancer therapeutics|journal = Advances in Cancer Research|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 0065-230X|pmid = 17161682|pages = 213–268|volume = 96|doi = 10.1016/S0065-230X(06)96008-4|first = Debashis|last = Sarker|first2 = Paul|last2 = Workman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical Applications for Biomarkers==
Biomarkers can be classified on their clinical applications as '''molecular biomarkers,''' '''cellular biomarkers''' or '''imaging biomarkers'''.

===Molecular Biomarkers===
Four of the main types of molecular biomarkers are '''genomic biomarkers''', '''transcriptomic biomarkers''', '''proteomic biomarkers''' and '''metabolic biomarkers'''.

====Genomic Biomarkers====
Genomic biomarkers analyze DNA by identifying irregular sequences in the [[genome]], typically a [[single nucleotide polymorphism]].  Genetic biomarkers are particularly significant in cancer because most cancer cell lines carry somatic mutations.  Somatic mutations are distinguishable from hereditary mutations because the mutation is not in every cell; just the tumor cells, making them easy targets.

====Transcriptomic Biomarkers====


Transcriptomic biomarkers analyze all [[RNA]] molecules, not solely the [[exome]].  Transcriptomic biomarkers reveal the molecular identity and concentration of RNA in a specific cell or population. Pattern-based RNA expression analysis provides increased diagnostic and prognostic capability in predicting therapeutic responses for individuals. For example, distinct RNA subtypes in breast cancer patients have different survival rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blenkiron|first1=Cherie|last2=Goldstein|first2=Leonard|last3=Thorne|first3=Natalie|title=MicroRNA expression profiling of human breast cancer identifies new markers of tumor subtype|journal=Genome Biology|date=2007|doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-10-r214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proteomic Biomarkers====
[[Proteomics]] permits the quantitative analysis and detection of changes to proteins or protein biomarkers.  Protein biomarkers detect a variety of biological changes, such as protein-protein interactions, [[post-translational modifications]] and immunological responses. 

=== Cellular Biomarkers ===
Cellular biomarkers allow cells to be isolated, sorted, quantified and characterized by their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]]. Cellular biomarkers are used in both clinical and laboratory settings, and can discriminate between a large sample of cells based on their [[antigen]]s. An example of a cellular biomarker sorting technique is [[Fluorescent-activated cell sorting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cellular biomarkers analysis - ImmuneHealth|url = http://www.immunehealth.eu/immunomonitoring-laboratory/cellular-platform/|website = ImmuneHealth|accessdate = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imaging Biomarkers===
Imaging biomarkers allow earlier detection of disease compared to molecular biomarkers, and streamline translational research in the drug discovery marketplace. For example, one could determine the percent of receptors a drug targets, shortening the time and money of research during the new drug development stage.  Imaging biomarkers also are non-invasive, which is a clinical advantage over molecular biomarkers. Some of the image-based biomarkers are [[X-ray crystallography|X-Ray]], [[Computed Tomography]] (CT), [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET), Single Photo Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Promise of Imaging Biomarkers|url=http://www.bio-itworld.com/uploadedFiles/Bio-IT_World/Whitepaper_SmartForms/Forms/PDF/Imaging_Biomarkers.PDF|publisher=Thomas Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Biomarkers==
* '''Embryonic: '''Embryonic biomarkers are very important to fetuses, as each cell's role is decided through the use of biomarkers. Research has been conducted concerning the use of [[embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs) in regenerative medicine. This is because certain biomarkers within a cell could be altered (most likely in the tertiary stage of their formation) to change the future role of the cell, thereby creating new ones. One example of an embryonic biomarker is the protein [[Oct-4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18763704 | doi=10.1002/pmic.200800073 | volume=8 | title=Cell surface biomarkers of embryonic stem cells | year=2008 | journal=Proteomics | pages=4025–35 | last1 = Nagano | first1 = K | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = Y | last3 = Isobe | first3 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[File:CTC - in situ RNA hybridization.jpg|thumb|Multiplex analysis of circulating tumor cells using QuantiGene ViewRNA CTC Platform]]'''Cancer:''' Biomarkers have an extremely high upside for therapeutic interventions in cancer patients.  Most cancer biomarkers consist of proteins or altered segments of DNA, and are expressed in all cells, just at higher rates in cancer cells.  There has not yet been one, universal tumor biomarker, but there is a biomarker for every type of cancer.  These tumor biomarkers are used to track the health of tumors, but cannot serve as the sole diagnostic for specific cancers. Examples of tumoral markers used to follow up cancer treatment are the [[Carcinoembryonic antigen|Carcinoembryonic Antigen]] (CEA) for colorectal cancer and the [[Prostate Specific Antigen]] (PSA) for prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tumor Markers|url = http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis/tumor-markers-fact-sheet|website = National Cancer Institute|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Cancer research identified [[Circulating tumor cell|Circulating Tumor Cells]] (CTCs) and [[Cell-free tumour DNA|Circulating Tumor DNA]] (ctDNA) as [[Metastasis|metastasizing]] tumor biomarkers with special cellular differentiation and prognostic skills. Innovative technology needs to be harnessed to determine the full capabilities of CTCs and ctDNA, but insight into their roles has potential for new understanding of cancer evolution, invasion and metastasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Blood-Based Analyses of Cancer: Circulating Tumor Cells and Circulating Tumor DNA|url = http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/4/6/650|journal = Cancer Discovery|date = 2014-06-01|issn = 2159-8274|pmc = 4433544|pmid = 24801577|pages = 650–661|volume = 4|issue = 6|doi = 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-1014|first = Daniel A.|last = Haber|first2 = Victor E.|last2 = Velculescu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[Image:Bolted joint 2.svg|thumb|150px|Screw joint|right]]
 [[Image:Bolted joint 1.svg|thumb|150px|Stud joint|right]]

'''Bolted joints''' are one of the most common elements in [[construction]] and machine design. They consist of [[fastener]]s that capture and join other parts, and are secured with the mating of [[screw thread]]s.

There are two main types of bolted joint designs: tension joints and shear joints.

In the tension joint, the bolt and clamped components of the joint are designed to transfer an applied tension load through the joint by way of the clamped components by the design of a proper balance of joint and bolt stiffness. The joint should be designed such that the clamp load is never overcome by the external tension [[force]]s acting to separate the joint. If the external tension forces overcome the clamp load (bolt preload) the clamped joint components will separate, allowing relative motion of the components.

The second type of bolted joint transfers the applied load in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the [[shear strength]] of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical as in the case where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include [[Clevis pin|clevis]] linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like [[lock washer]]s, thread [[adhesive]]s, and lock [[nut (hardware)|nuts]]).

Proper joint design and bolt preload provides useful properties:
* For cyclic tension loads, the fastener is not subjected to the full amplitude of the load; as a result, the fastener's [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] life is increased or—if the material exhibits an [[endurance limit]] its life extends indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As long as the external tension loads on a joint do not exceed the clamp load, the fastener is not subjected to motion that would loosen it, obviating the need for locking mechanisms. (Questionable under Vibration Inputs.)
*For the shear joint, a proper clamping force on the joint components prevents relative motion of those components and the [[fretting]] wear of those that could result in the development of fatigue cracks.

In both the tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in the bolt and resulting compression preload in the clamped components is essential to the joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured [[torque]] to the bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand the bolt then turning the nut down, torquing the bolt to the yield point, testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are very substantial.

== Theory ==
Typically, a bolt is tensioned (preloaded) by the application of a torque to either the bolt head or the nut. The applied torque causes the bolt to "climb" the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to the applied torque and is a function of the bolt diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut. The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.
  
[[Image:Bolted joint spring analogy.svg|440px|right]]

The clamp load, also called preload of a fastener, is created when a torque is applied, and so develops a tensile preload that is generally a substantial percentage of the fastener's [[screw|proof strength]]. Fasteners are manufactured to various standards that define, among other things, their strength. ''Torque charts'' are available to specify the required torque for a given fastener based on its ''property class'' (fineness of manufacture and fit) and ''grade'' (tensile strength).

When a fastener is torqued, a tension preload develops in the bolt and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be [[Scientific modelling|modeled]] as a spring-like assembly that has some assumed distribution of compressive strain in the clamped joint components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.

When the fastened parts are less stiff than the fastener (those that use soft, compressed gaskets for example), this model breaks down and the fastener is subjected to a tension load that is the sum of the tension preload and the external tension load.

In some applications, joints are designed so that the fastener eventually fails before more expensive components. In this case, replacing an existing fastener with a higher strength fastener can result in equipment damage. Thus, it is generally good practice to replace old fasteners with new fasteners of the same grade.

== Calculating the torque ==
Engineered joints require the torque to be chosen to provide the correct tension preload. Applying the torque to fasteners is commonly achieved using a [[torque wrench]].&lt;ref name="oberg1495"&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|McCauley|Heald|2004|p=1495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The required torque value for a particular fastener application may be quoted in the published standard document, defined by the manufacturer or calculated.  The side of the threaded fastening having the least friction should receive torque while the other side is counter-held or otherwise prevented from turning.

A common relationship used to calculate the torque for a desired preload takes into account the thread geometry and friction in the threads and under the bolt head or nut. The following assumes standard ISO or National Standard bolts and threads are used:

:&lt;math&gt;T = K P_{pre} d &lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;T &lt;/math&gt; is the required torque
:&lt;math&gt;K &lt;/math&gt; is the nut factor
:&lt;math&gt;P_{pre} &lt;/math&gt; is the desired preload
:&lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the bolt diameter

The nut factor K accounts for the thread geometry, friction, pitch. When ISO and Unified National Standard threads are used the nut factor is:&lt;ref name=Shigley/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{d_{m}}{2 d}\,\left(\frac{ \tan \psi +\mu  \sec \alpha} { 1 - \mu \tan \psi \sec \alpha}\right) + 0.625 \mu_{c}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; d_{m} &lt;/math&gt; = the mean thread diameter, close to pitch diameter.
:&lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; = nominal bolt diameter
:&lt;math&gt; \tan\psi &lt;/math&gt; = [[fastener|(thread pitch)]]/(pi * d&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)
:Thread Pitch = 1/N  where N is the number of threads per inch or mm
:&lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; = friction coefficient in the threads
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; = half the thread angle (typically 60°) = 30° 
:&lt;math&gt; \mu_{c}&lt;/math&gt; = friction coefficient under torqued head or nut

When &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \mu_{c}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.15, the dimensions used correspond to any size coarse or fine bolt, and the nut factor is K ≈ 0.20, the torque/preload relationship becomes

:&lt;math&gt;T = 0.20 P_{pre} d &lt;/math&gt;

A study of the effect of torquing two samples, one lubricated and the other unlubricated, 1/2 in.- 20 UNF bolts to 800&amp;nbsp;lb-in, produced the same mean preload of 7700&amp;nbsp;lbf. The preloads for the unlubricated bolt sample had a standard deviation from the mean value of 1100&amp;nbsp;lbf, whereas the lubricated sample had a standard deviation of 680&amp;nbsp;lbf. If the preload value and torques are used in the above relation to solve for the nut factor it is found to be K = 0.208, which is very close to the recommended value of 0.20

The preferred bolt preload for structural applications should be at least 75% of the fastener's proof load&lt;ref name="oberg1495"/&gt; for the higher strength fasteners and as high as 90% of the proof load for permanent fasteners. To achieve the benefits of the preloading, the clamping force must be higher than the joint separation load. For some joints, multiple fasteners are required to secure the joint; these are all hand tightened before the final torque is applied to ensure an even joint seating.

The preload achieved by torquing a bolt is caused by the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.

Either the bolt head or the nut can be torqued. If one has a larger bearing area or coefficient of friction it will require more torque to provide the same target preload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolt Science|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/faq.htm#3|work=Bolt Science Limited|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasteners should only be torqued if they are fitted in [[wiktionary:clearance hole|clearance hole]]s.

Torque wrenches do not give a direct measurement of the preload in the bolt.

More accurate methods for determining the preload rely on defining or measuring the ''screw extension'' from the nut. Alternatively, measurement of the angular rotation of the nut can serve as the basis for defining screw extension based on the fastener's [[thread pitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|McCauley|Heald|2004|p=1499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring the screw extension directly allows the clamping force to be very accurately calculated. This can be achieved using a [[dial test indicator]], reading deflection at the fastener tail, using a [[strain gauge]], or ultrasonic length measurement.

Bolt preload can also be controlled by torquing the bolt to the point of yielding. Under some circumstances, a skilled operator can feel the drop off of the work required to turn the torque wrench as the material of the bolt begins to yield. At that point the bolt has a preload determined by the bolt area and the  yield strength of the bolt material. This technique can be more accurately executed by specially built machines. Because this method only works for very high preloads and requires comparatively expensive tooling, it is only commonly used for specific applications, primarily in high performance engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highpowermedia.com/blog/3358/tightening-to-yield |title=Tightening to yield |publisher=High Power Media |date= |accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/tighten.htm |title=Methods of Tightening Threaded Fasteners |publisher=Boltscience.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no simple method to measure the tension of a fastener already in place other than to tighten it and identify at which point the fastener starts extending. This is known as ''re-torqueing''. An electronic torque wrench can be used on the fastener in question, so that the torque applied can be constantly measured as it is slowly increased in magnitude.

Recent developments enable tensions to be estimated by using ultrasonic testing. Another way to ensure correct tension (mainly in erecting steel) involves the use of crush-washers. These are washers that have been drilled and filled with orange [[Vulcanization#Room temperature vulcanization|RTV]]. When the orange rubber strands appear, the tension is correct.

Large-volume users (such as auto makers) frequently use computer-controlled [[nut driver]]s. With such machines, the computer in effect plots a graph of the torque exerted. Once the torque reaches a set maximum torque chosen by the designer, the machine stops.  Such machines are often used to fit wheelnuts and normally tighten all the wheel nuts simultaneously.

==Thread engagement==
''Thread engagement'' is the length or number of threads that are engaged between the screw and the female threads. Bolted joints are designed so that the bolt shank fails in tension before the threads fail in shear, but for this to hold true, a minimum thread engagement must be achieved. The following equation defines this minimum thread engagement:
&lt;ref name="threadengagement"&gt;{{Citation 
| title = Minimum Thread Engagement Formula and Calculation ISO 
| url = http://www.engineersedge.com/thread_strength/thread_minimum_length_engagement.htm 
| accessdate = 2010-02-08 
| postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_e = \frac{2 \times A_t}{0.5 \pi \left( D - 0.64952 p \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where L&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the thread engagement length, A&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the tensile stress area, D is the major diameter of the screw, and p is the pitch. This equation only holds true if the screw and female thread materials are the same. If they are not the same, then the following equations can be used to determine the additional thread length that is required:&lt;ref name="threadengagement"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{\text{tensile strength of external thread material}}{\text{tensile strength of internal thread material}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_{e2} = J \times L_e&lt;/math&gt;

Where L&lt;sub&gt;e2&lt;/sub&gt; is the new required thread engagement.

While these formulas give absolute minimum thread engagement, many industries specify that bolted connections be at least fully engaged. For instance, the [[FAA]] has determined that in general cases, at least one thread must be protruding from any bolted connection. [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/99c827db9baac81b86256b4500596c4e/$FILE/Chapter%2007.pdf]

== Failure modes ==
The most common mode of [[structural failure|failure]] is overloading: Operating forces of the application produce loads that exceed the clamp load, causing the joint to loosen over time or fail catastrophically.

Overtorquing might cause failure by damaging the threads and deforming the fastener, though this can happen over a very long time. Undertorquing can cause failures by allowing a joint to come loose, and it may also allow the joint to flex and thus fail under fatigue.

[[Brinelling]] may occur with poor quality washers, leading to a loss of clamp load and subsequent failure of the joint.

Other modes of failure include [[corrosion]], [[embedment]], and exceeding the [[shear stress]] limit.

Bolted joints may be used intentionally as [[sacrificial part]]s, which are intended to fail before other parts, as in a [[shear pin]].

== Locking mechanisms ==
[[Image:Car hub cotter pin.jpg|thumb|right|Bolted joints in an automobile wheel. Here the outer fasteners are four studs with three of the four nuts that secure the wheel. The central nut (with locking cover and [[Split pin|cotter pin]]) secures the wheel bearing to the spindle.]]

Locking mechanisms keep bolted joints from coming loose. They are required when [[vibration]] or joint movement will cause loss of [[clamp (tool)|clamp]] [[Structural load|load]] and joint failure, and in equipment where the [[security]] of bolted joints is essential. A prevalent test for the self-loosening behaviour is the [[Junker test]].
* Jam Nuts – Two nuts, tightened on each other.  In this application a thinner nut should be placed adjacent to the joint, and a thicker nut tightened onto it.  The thicker nut applies more force to the joint, first relieving the force on the threads of the thinner nut and then applying a force in the opposite direction.  In this way the thicker nut presses tightly on the side of the threads away from the joint, while the thinner nut presses on the side of the threads nearest the joint, tightly locking the two nuts against the threads in both directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/twonuts.htm|title=The use of two nuts to prevent self loosening|publisher=boltscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Friction-locking of threads – An insert on the internal threads (either metallic or non-metallic, e.g. [[Nyloc nut]]) or a plug/patch of non-metallic material on the external threads is installed. This material binds against the threads of the opposing fastener with a friction force and creates a prevailing torque, which resists the backing-out or loosening of the fastener.&lt;ref name="boltscience.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boltscience.com/pages/vibloose.htm|title=Vibration Loosening Of Bolts and Threaded Fasteners|publisher=boltscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Chemical locking compounds – The use of a chemical locking compound binds the threads together when the compound cures. Examples of such a compound includes [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] compounds such as [[Loctite]], which cures in the absence of oxygen and acts as an adhesive to lock the threads of the joint together.&lt;ref name="boltscience.com"/&gt;

==Bolt banging==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}

''Bolt banging'' occurs in buildings when bolted joints slip into "bearing under load", thus causing a loud and potentially frightening noise resembling a rifle shot that is not, however, of structural significance and does not pose any threat to occupants.  

A bolted joint between two elements may act as a bearing-type joint, or a friction joint.  In the friction joint, the elements are clamped together with enough force that the resultant friction between the clamped surfaces prevents them from slipping laterally over each other.

In the bearing joint, the bolt itself limits lateral movement of the elements by the shank of the bolt bearing upon the sides of the holes in the clamped elements.  Such joints require less clamping force, because a high level of friction between the clamped surfaces is not required. The clearance between the bolt and the holes means that some lateral movement may occur before the bolt bears against the sides of the holes. 

Even when designed as a bearing joint, the surface friction between the clamped elements may be sufficient to resist movement for some time, especially when the building may not yet be fully loaded – thus it operates initially as a friction joint.  When the lateral force becomes sufficient to overcome this friction, the clamped elements move until the sides of the holes bear against the shank of the bolt.  This movement – "slip into bearing" – usually starts and stops very suddenly, often releasing elastic energy in the associated elements, resulting in a loud but harmless bang.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, C.J.: "Steel Interchange: Banging Bolts", ''[http://msc.aisc.org/globalassets/modern-steel/archives/1999/07/1999v07_interchange.pdf MSC: Modern Steel Construction]'', July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chromosome.svg|thumb|In the diagram, (1) refers to a chromatid: one-half of two identical threadlike strands of a replicated [[chromosome]]. During cell division, the identical copies (called a "[[Sister chromatids|sister chromatid pair]]") are joined at the region called the [[centromere]] (2). Once the paired sister chromatids have separated from one another (in the [[anaphase]] of  [[mitosis]]) each is known as a daughter chromosome. The short arm of the right chromatid (3), and the long arm of the right chromatid (4), are also marked.]]

A '''chromatid''' (Greek ''khrōmat-'' 'color' + ''-id'') is one copy of a newly copied [[chromosome]] which is still joined to the original chromosome by a single centromere. 

Before replication, one chromosome is composed of one [[DNA]] molecule. Following replication, each chromosome is composed of two DNA molecules; in other words, [[DNA replication]] itself increases the amount of DNA but does ''not'' increase the number of chromosomes. The two identical copies—each forming one half of the replicated chromosome—are called chromatids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.about.com/library/glossary/bldefchromatid.htm|title=What is a Chromatid?|author=|date=|website=About.com|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later stages of cell division these chromatids separate longitudinally to become individual chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chromatid|title=Definition of CHROMATID|author=|date=|website=www.Merriam-Webster.com|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromatid pairs are normally genetically identical, and said to be [[Zygosity|homozygous]]; however, if mutation(s) occur, they will present slight differences, in which case they are [[Zygosity|heterozygous]]. The pairing of chromatids should not be confused with the [[ploidy]] of an organism, which is the number of [[Homologous chromosome|homologous versions]] of a chromosome.

[[Chromonema]] is the fibre-like structure in [[prophase]] in the primary stage of [[DNA condensation]]. In [[metaphase]], they are called chromatids.

==Sister chromatids==
{{Main|Sister chromatids}}
Chromatids may be sister or non-sister chromatids. A [[sister chromatid]] is either one of the two chromatids of the same [[chromosome]] joined together by a common [[centromere]]. A pair of sister chromatids is called a '''dyad'''. Once sister chromatids have separated (during the [[anaphase]] of mitosis or the anaphase II of [[meiosis]] during [[sexual reproduction]]), they are again called chromosomes. Although having the same genetic mass as the individual chromatids that made up its parent, the daughter "molecules" are called chromosomes in a similar way that one child of a pair of twins is not referred to as a single [[twin]]. 
The DNA sequence of two sister chromatids is completely identical (apart from very rare DNA copying errors).

[[Sister chromatid exchange]] (SCE) is the exchange of genetic information between two [[sister chromatids]].  SCEs can occur during [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]].  SCEs appear to primarily reflect DNA recombinational [[DNA repair|repair]] processes responding to [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] (see articles [[Sister chromatids]] and [[Sister chromatid exchange]]).

''Non-sister chromatids'', on the other hand, refers to either of the two chromatids of paired [[homologous chromosome]]s, that is, the pairing of a paternal chromosome and a maternal chromosome. In [[chromosomal crossover]]s, non-sister (homologous) chromatids form [[Chiasma (genetics)|chiasmata]] to exchange genetic material during the [[prophase I]] of [[meiosis]] (See [[Homologous recombination]]).

'''''De Mensurabili Musica''''' (concerning measured music) is a musical treatise from the early 13th century (medieval period, c. 1240)  and is the first of two treatises traditionally attributed to French music theorist [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]];&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Thomas. ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 628&lt;/ref&gt; the other is ''de plana musica'' &lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard. ''The Oxford History of western Music - I (Music from the earliest notations to the 16th Century)'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010) p196/7&lt;/ref&gt; (Concerning Plainchant). ''De Mensurabili Musica'' was the first to explain a modal rhythmic system that was already in use at the time: the [[rhythmic mode]]s.  The six rhythmic modes set out by the treatise are all in [[triple time]] and are made from combinations of the note values [[mensural notation|''longa'' (long) and ''brevis'' (short)]] and are given the names ''[[trochee]], [[Iamb (poetry)|iamb]], [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]], [[anapest]], [[spondaic]]'' and ''[[Tribrach (poetry)|tribrach]]'', although ''trochee, dactyl'' and ''spondaic'' were much more common. It is evident how influential Garlandia's &lt;ref&gt;There has been recent scholarly debate on whether Johannes de Garlandia actually wrote the treatise. Some music historians believe that he was simply editor of the treatises. More information can be found on his Wikipedia page.&lt;/ref&gt; treatise has been by the number of theorists that have used its ideas. Much of the surviving music of the [[Notre Dame School]] from the 13th century is based on the rhythmic modes set out in ''De Mensurabili Musica''.

'''Design objective''' (DO):  In [[telecommunication|communications]] systems, a desired performance characteristic for communications circuits and equipment that is based on engineering analyses, but (a) is not considered feasible to mandate in a [[standardization|standard]], or (b) has not been tested.  

DOs are used because applicable systems standards are not in existence. 

Examples of reasons for designating a performance characteristic as a DO rather than as a standard are (a) it may be bordering on an advancement in the state of the art, (b) the requirement may not have been fully confirmed by measurement or experience with operating circuits, and (c) it may not have been demonstrated that the requirement can be met considering other constraints, such as cost and size. 

A DO is sometimes established in a standard for developmental consideration. A DO may also specify a performance characteristic used in the preparation of specifications for development or [[procurement]] of new equipment or systems.

Design is the process of formulation of a plan for satisfaction of human needs

'''Developmental psychology''' is the [[scientific]] study of how and why [[human]] beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with [[infants]] and [[child]]ren, the field has expanded to include [[adolescence]], [[adult development]], [[aging]], and the entire lifespan. Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life.  This field examines change across three major dimensions: [[physical development]], [[cognitive development]], and socioemotional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/action/science/developmental/index.aspx|title=Developmental Psychology Studies Human Development Across the Lifespan|last=|first=|date=|website=www.apa.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709054242/http://www.apa.org/action/science/developmental/index.aspx|archive-date=2014-07-09|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including [[motor skills]], [[executive functions]], [[morality|moral understanding]], [[language acquisition]], [[social change]], [[personality]], emotional development, [[self-concept]], and [[identity formation]].

Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature ''and'' nurture on the process of human development, and processes of change in context and across time. Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior, and [[environmental factor]]s, including the [[social context]] and the [[built environment]]. Ongoing debates include biological [[essentialism]] vs. [[neuroplasticity]] and [[Developmental stage theories|stages of development]] vs. dynamic systems of development.

Developmental psychology involves a range of fields, such as [[educational psychology]], [[child psychopathology]], [[forensic developmental psychology]], [[child development]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[ecological psychology]], and [[cultural psychology]]. Influential developmental psychologists from the 20th century include [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Barbara Rogoff]], [[Esther Thelen]], and [[Lev Vygotsky]].

==Historical antecedents==
[[John B. Watson]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] are typically cited as providing the foundations for modern developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogan|first=John D|authorlink=John D. Hogan|title=Encyclopedia of Psychology|location=Volume 3|isbn=978-1-55798-652-8|pages=9–13|chapter=Developmental psychology: History of the field|editor=Alan E. Kazdin|editor-link=Alan E. Kazdin|accessdate=|doi=10.1037/10518-003|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th century Jean Jacques Rousseau described three stages of development: ''infants'' (infancy), ''puer'' (childhood) and ''adolescence'' in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]''. Rousseau's ideas were taken up strongly by educators at the time.

It generally focuses on how and why certain modifications throughout an individual’s life-cycle (cognitive, social, intellectual, personality) and human growth change over time. There are many theorists that have made a profound contribution to this area of psychology. For example, [[Erik Erikson]] developed a model of eight stages of psychological development. He believed that humans developed in stages throughout their lifetimes and this would affect their behaviors (Similar ideas to [[Sigmund Freud]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erikson and Erikson|first1=E and J. M.|title=The Life-Cycle Completed|date=1998|publisher=Norton and Company|edition=Extended version}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, psychologists familiar with the [[evolutionary theory]] of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] began seeking an evolutionary description of psychological development;&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; prominent here was the pioneering psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]],&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; who attempted to correlate ages of childhood with previous ages of humanity. [[James Mark Baldwin]] who wrote essays on topics that included ''Imitation: A Chapter in the Natural History of Consciousness'' and ''Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes''. [[James Mark Baldwin]] was heavily involved in the theory of developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]], whose concepts were developmental, significantly affected public perceptions.&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt;

==Theories==

===Psychosexual development===
{{Main|Psychosexual development}}
[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that we all had a conscious, preconscious, and unconscious level. In the conscious, we are aware of our mental process. The preconscious involves information that, though not currently in our thoughts, can be brought into consciousness. Lastly, the unconscious includes mental processes we are unaware of.

He believed there is tension between the conscious and unconscious because the conscious tries to hold back what the unconscious tries to express. To explain this he developed three personality structures: the id, ego, and superego. The id, the most primitive of the three, functions according to the pleasure principle: seek pleasure and avoid pain.&lt;ref name="Theories2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Theories of personality: understanding persons|last=Cloninger|first=Susan C.|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-25624-2|edition=6th|location=Boston|pages=19–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the superego.&lt;ref name="Snowden2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Freud|last=Snowden|first=Ruth|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-147274-6|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this, he proposed five universal stages of development, that each is characterized by the erogenous zone that is the source of the child's psychosexual energy. The first is the ''oral stage'', which occurs from birth to 12 months of age. During the oral stage, "the libido is centered in a baby's mouth." The baby is able to suck. The second is the ''anal stage'', from one to three years of age. During the anal stage, the child defecates from the anus and is often fascinated with their defecation. The third is the ''[[phallic stage]]'', which occurs from three to five years of age (most of a person's personality forms by this age). During the phallic stage, the child is aware of their sexual organs. The fourth is the ''latency stage'', which occurs from age five until puberty. During the latency stage, the child's sexual interests are repressed. Stage five is the ''[[genital stage]]'', which takes place from puberty until adulthood. During the genital stage, puberty starts happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/psychosexual.html|title=Psychosexual Stages|website=SimplyPsychology|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of cognitive development===
{{Main|Piaget's theory of cognitive development}}
[[Jean Piaget]], a Swiss theorist, posited that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through hands-on experience.&lt;ref name="WoodWoodBoyd2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering the world of psychology|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|year=2006|edition=2|author1=Wood, S.E.|author2=Wood, C.E.|author3=Boyd D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the adult's role in helping the child learn was to provide appropriate materials that the child can interact with and use to construct. He used [[Socratic questioning]] to get children to reflect on what they were doing, and he tried to get them to see contradictions in their explanations.

Piaget believed that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages, which he described in his theory on cognitive development. Each stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next step. He believed that these stages are not separate from one another, but rather that each stage builds on the previous one in a continuous learning process. He proposed four stages: ''sensorimotor'', ''pre-operational'', ''concrete operational'', and ''formal operational''. Though he did not believe these stages occurred at any given age, many studies have determined when these cognitive abilities should take place.&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"&gt;{{cite book|title=Edpsych : modules|last=Reese-Weber|first=Lisa Bohlin, Cheryl Cisero Durwin, Marla|publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages|isbn=978-0-07-809786-7|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=30–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of moral development===
{{Main|Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development}}
Piaget claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.&lt;ref name="higheststage2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|year=1973|title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment|journal=Journal of Philosophy|publisher=The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 70, No. 18|volume=70|issue=18|pages=630–646|doi=10.2307/2025030|jstor=2025030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on Piaget's work, [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime.&lt;ref name="dissertation2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|year=1958|title=The Development of Modes of Thinking and Choices in Years 10 to 16|journal=Ph. D. Dissertation, University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He suggested three levels of moral reasoning; pre-conventional moral reasoning, conventional moral reasoning, and post-conventional moral reasoning.  The pre-conventional moral reasoning is typical of children and is characterized by reasoning that is based on rewards and punishments associated with different courses of action. Conventional moral reason occurs during late childhood and early adolescence and is characterized by reasoning based on rules and conventions of society. Lastly, post-conventional moral reasoning is a stage during which the individual sees society's rules and conventions as relative and subjective, rather than as authoritative.&lt;ref name="Adolescence3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Adolescence|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-340548-3|edition=8th|location=Boston|pages=60–365|authorlink=Laurence Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg used the Heinz Dilemma to apply to his stages of moral development. The Heinz Dilemma involves Heinz's wife dying from cancer and Heinz having the dilemma to save his wife by stealing a drug. Preconventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality applies to Heinz's situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/kohlberg.html|title=Kohlberg|website=SimplyPsychology|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of psychosocial development===
{{Main|Erikson's stages of psychosocial development}}
German-American psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] and his collaborator and wife, [[Joan Erikson]], conceptualized eight stages of psychosocial development that they theorized healthy individuals pass through as they develop from infancy to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Thomas|first=Robert McG., Jr.|title=Joan Erikson Is Dead at 95; Shaped Thought on Life Cycles|date=8 August 1997|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/us/joan-erikson-is-dead-at-95-shaped-thought-on-life-cycles.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is called "Trust vs. Mistrust" takes place in infancy. The best virtue for the first stage is hope, in the infant learning who to trust and having hope for a supportive group of people to be there for him/her. The second stage is "Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt" with the best virtue being will. This takes place in early childhood where the child learns to become more independent by discovering what they are capable of where if the child is overly controlled, they believe to feel inadequate on surviving by themselves, which can lead to low self-esteem and doubt. The third stage is "Initiative vs. Guilt". The basic virtue that would be gained is the purpose and takes place in the play age. This is the stage where the child will be curious and have many interactions with other kids. They will ask many questions as their curiosity grows. If too much guilt is present, the child may have a slower and harder time interacting with other children. The fourth stage is "Industry (competence) vs. Inferiority". The basic virtue for this stage is competency which happens at the school age. This stage is when the child will try to win the approval of others and fit in and understand the value of their accomplishments. The fifth stage is "Identity vs. Role Confusion". The basic virtue gained is fidelity which takes place in adolescence. This is where the child will start to find who he/she is as a person in society. What sex role he/she picks. The sixth stage is "Intimacy vs. Isolation", which happens in young adults and the virtue gained is love. This is where the person will start to share his/her life with someone else intimately and emotionally. In not doing so, it could lead to isolation. The seventh stage is "Generativity vs. Stagnation". This happens in adulthood and the virtue gained would be care. We become stable and start to give back by raising a family and becoming involved in the community. The eighth stage is "Ego Integrity vs. Despair". This happens during maturity and wisdom is gained. When one grows old and they contemplate and look back and see the success or failure of their life. This is also the stage where one can also have closure and accept death without fearing anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=Erik Erikson|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/Erik-Erikson.html|year=2013|accessdate=23 July 2016|orig-year=2008|website=Simply Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages based on the model of hierarchical complexity===
{{Main|Model of hierarchical complexity}}
[[Michael Commons]] enhanced and simplified [[Bärbel Inhelder]] and Piaget's developmental theory and offers a standard method of examining the universal pattern of development. The Model of Hierarchical Complexity  (MHC) is not based on the assessment of domain-specific information, It divides the Order of Hierarchical Complexity of tasks to be addressed from the Stage performance on those tasks.  A stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participant's successfully addresses. He expanded Piaget's original eight stage (counting the half stages) to fifteen stages. The stages are : 0 Calculatory; 1 Sensory &amp; Motor; 2 Circular sensory-motor; 3 Sensory-motor; 4 Nominal; 5 Sentential; 6 Preoperational; 7 Primary; 8 Concrete; 9 Abstract; 10 Formal; 11 Systematic; 12 Metasystematic; 13 Paradigmatic; 14 Cross-paradigmatic; 15 Meta-Cross-paradigmatic. The order of hierarchical complexity of tasks predicts how difficult the performance is with an R ranging from 0.9 to 0.98.

In the MHC, there are three main axioms for an order to meet in order for the higher order task to coordinate the next lower order task. Axioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchy. These axioms are: a) defined in terms of tasks at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity task action; b) defined as the higher order task action that organizes two or more less complex actions; that is, the more complex action specifies the way in which the less complex actions combine; c) defined as the lower order task actions have to be carried out non-arbitrarily.

===Ecological systems theory===
{{Main|Ecological systems theory}}
[[File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|right|thumb|180x180px|{{center|Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory}}]]
Ecological systems theory, originally formulated by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], specifies four types of nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the systems. The four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development. The microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school. Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem. Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role. Macrosystem refers to the cultural values, customs and laws of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://explorable.com/ecological-systems-theory|title=Ecological Systems Theory|website=Explorable Psychology Experiments|last1=Sincero|first1=Sarah Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The microsystem is the immediate environment surrounding and influencing the individual (example: school or the home setting). The mesosystem is the combination of two microsystems and how they influence each other (example: sibling relationships at home vs. peer relationships at school). The exosystem is the interaction among two or more settings that are indirectly linked (example: a father's job requiring more overtime ends up influencing his daughter's performance in school because he can no longer help with her homework). The macrosystem is broader taking into account social economic status, culture, beliefs, customs and morals (example: a child from a wealthier family sees a peer from a less wealthy family as inferior for that reason). Lastly, the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition (example: a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life).&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"/&gt;

Since its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory, ''The Ecology of Human Development''&lt;ref&gt;Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979). ''The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ({{ISBN|0-674-22457-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments. As a result of this conceptualization of development, these environments—from the family to economic and political structures—have come to be viewed as part of the life course from childhood through to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Smith et al.2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Children's Development|publisher=Blackwell|edition=4|series=Basic psychology|location=Oxford, England|author1=Smith, P.K.|author2=Cowie, H.|author3=Blades, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zone of proximal development===
{{Main|Zone of proximal development}}
[[Lev Vygotsky]] was a Russian theorist from the Soviet era, who posited that children learn through hands-on experience and social interactions with members of his/her culture.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, D. L., D. T. Gilbert, and D. M. Wegner. Psychology. 2. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike Piaget, he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task (called the "zone of proximal development") could help children learn new tasks. This adult role is often referred to as the skilled "master," whereas the child is considered the learning apprentice through an educational process often termed "[[cognitive apprenticeship]]" Martin Hill stated that "The world of reality does not apply to the mind of a child." This technique is called "scaffolding," because it builds upon knowledge children already have with new knowledge that adults can help the child learn.&lt;ref name="vygotsky782"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind in Society|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1978|location=Cambridge, MA|author=Vygotsky, L.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky was strongly focused on the role of culture in determining the child's pattern of development, arguing that development moves from the social level to the individual level.&lt;ref name="vygotsky782" /&gt; In other words, Vygotsky claimed that psychology should focus on the progress of human consciousness through the relationship of an individual and their environment.&lt;ref name="vygotsky20102"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Activity Systems Analysis Methods: Understanding Complex Learning Environments|publisher=Springer Science|year=2010|location=New York, NY|author=Yamagata-Lynch, L.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that if scholars continued to disregard this connection, then this disregard would inhibit the full comprehension of the human consciousness.&lt;ref name="vygotsky20102" /&gt;

===Constructivism===
{{Main|Constructivism (psychological school)}}
Constructivism is a paradigm in psychology that characterizes learning as a process of actively constructing knowledge. Individuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting, organizing, and integrating information with other knowledge, often in the context of social interactions.  Constructivism can occur in two ways: individual and social. Individual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others.  Social constructivism is when individuals construct knowledge through an interaction between the knowledge they bring to a situation and social or cultural exchanges within that content.&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"/&gt;

Jean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist, proposed that learning is an active process because children learn through experience and make mistakes and solve problems. Piaget proposed that learning should be whole by helping students understand that meaning is constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viking.coe.uh.edu/~ichen/ebook/et-it/cognitiv.htm|title=Overview of Cognitive Constructivism|website=Cognitive Constructivist Theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary developmental psychology===
{{Main|Evolutionary developmental psychology}}

Evolutionary developmental psychology is a research paradigm that applies the basic principles of Darwinian [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]], to understand the development of human behavior and cognition. It involves the study of both the [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental mechanisms that underlie the development of social and [[cognitive]] competencies, as well as the [[epigenetic]] ([[gene-environment interaction]]s) processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|last2=Blasi|first2=Carlos Hernández|last3=Ellis|first3=Bruce J|isbn=978-1-118-75580-8|editor-link=|location=Volume 2|pages=905|chapter=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology|doi=|last1=Bjorklund|first1=David F|editor=David M. Buss|accessdate=|date=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EDP considers both the reliably developing, species-typical features of ontogeny (developmental adaptations), as well as [[Differential psychology|individual differences]] in behavior, from an evolutionary perspective. While evolutionary views tend to regard most individual differences as the result of either random genetic noise (evolutionary byproducts)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tooby|first=John|date=1990|title=On the universality of human nature and the uniqueness of the individual: The role of genetics and adaptation|url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/papers/jpersonality.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=58|issue=1|pages=17–67|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00907.x|pmid=2198338}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or idiosyncrasies (for example, peer groups, education, neighborhoods, and chance encounters)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The blank slate|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Chapter 19: Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than products of natural selection, EDP asserts that natural selection can favor the emergence of individual differences via "adaptive developmental plasticity."&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developmental plasticity and evolution|last=West-Eberhard|first=Mary Jane|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, human development follows alternative life-history strategies in response to environmental variability, rather than following one species-typical pattern of development.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

EDP is closely linked to the theoretical framework of [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP), but is also distinct from EP in several domains, including research emphasis (EDP focuses on adaptations of ontogeny, as opposed to adaptations of adulthood) and consideration of proximate ontogenetic and environmental factors (i.e., how development happens) in addition to more ultimate factors (i.e., why development happens), which are the focus of mainstream evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Carlos Hernandez|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F.|date=2003|title=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: A New Tool for Better Understanding Human Ontogeny|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Blasi/publication/275042203_Evolutionary_Developmental_Psychology_A_new_tool_for_better_understanding_human_ontogeny/links/553132e10cf27acb0dea90ec.pdf|journal=Human Development|volume=46|issue=5|pages=259–281|doi=10.1159/000071935|pmid=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment theory===
{{Main|Attachment theory}}
Attachment theory, originally developed by [[John Bowlby]], focuses on the importance of open, intimate, emotionally meaningful relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=x-Oki9MxalQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA45|title=Attachment Theory: Social, Developmental, and Clinical Perspectives|last=Goldberg|first=Susan|last2=Muir|first2=Roy|last3=Kerr|first3=John|date=2013-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135890520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment is described as a biological system or powerful survival impulse that evolved to ensure the survival of the infant. A child who is threatened or stressed will move toward caregivers who create a sense of physical, emotional and psychological safety for the individual. Attachment feeds on body contact and familiarity. Later [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed the [[Mary Ainsworth#Strange Situation|Strange Situation]] protocol and the concept of the secure base.

Theorists have proposed four types of attachment styles:&lt;ref name="Schacter4402"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology|last=Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner|publisher=Worth|year=2011|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant,&lt;ref name="Adolescence3"/&gt; and disorganized.&lt;ref name="Schacter4402" /&gt; Secure attachment is a healthy attachment between the infant and the caregiver. It is characterized by trust. Anxious-avoidant is an insecure attachment between an infant and a caregiver. This is characterized by the infant's indifference toward the caregiver. Anxious-resistant is an insecure attachment between the infant and the caregiver characterized by distress from the infant when separated and anger when reunited.&lt;ref name="Adolescence3" /&gt; Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent.&lt;ref name="Schacter4402" /&gt;

A child can be hindered in its natural tendency to form attachments. Some babies are raised without the stimulation and attention of a regular caregiver or locked away under conditions of abuse or extreme neglect. The possible short-term effects of this deprivation are anger, despair, detachment, and temporary delay in intellectual development. Long-term effects include increased aggression, clinging behavior, detachment, psychosomatic disorders, and an increased risk of depression as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Psychology|last=Myers|first=D.|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2008|isbn=1-57259-096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Level Psychology Through Diagrams|last=Hill|first=G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-918094-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}

Attachment style can affect the relationships between people. Attachment is established in early childhood and attachment continues into adulthood. An example of secure attachment continuing in adulthood would be when the person feels confident and is able to meet their own needs. An example of anxious attachment during adulthood is when the adult chooses a partner with anxious-avoidant attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201307/how-your-attachment-style-impacts-your-relationship|title=How Your Attachment Style Impacts Your Relationship|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Compassion Matters|last1=Firestone|first1=Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major debates==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}

===Nature vs nurture===
A significant issue in developmental psychology is the relationship between innateness and environmental influence in regard to any particular aspect of development. This is often referred to as "[[nature and nurture]]" or [[psychological nativism|nativism]] versus [[empiricism]]. A nativist account of development would argue that the processes in question are innate, that is, they are specified by the organism's [[genes]].

An empiricist perspective would argue that those processes are acquired in interaction with the environment. Today developmental psychologists rarely take such polarised positions with regard to most aspects of development; rather they investigate, among many other things, the relationship between innate and environmental influences. One of the ways this relationship has been explored in recent years is through the emerging field of [[evolutionary developmental psychology]].

One area where this innateness debate has been prominently portrayed is in research on [[language acquisition]]. A major question in this area is whether or not certain properties of human language are specified genetically or can be acquired through [[learning]]. The empiricist position on the issue of language acquisition suggests that the language input provides the necessary information required for learning the structure of language and that infants acquire language through a process of [[statistical learning]]. From this perspective, language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development, such as [[perceptual learning]].

The nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of language. Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] asserts that, evidenced by the lack of sufficient information in the language input, there is a [[universal grammar]] that applies to all human languages and is pre-specified. This has led to the idea that there is a special cognitive [[modularity of mind|module]] suited for learning language, often called the [[language acquisition device]]. Chomsky's critique of the behaviorist model of language acquisition is regarded by many as a key turning point in the decline in the prominence of the theory of behaviorism generally.&lt;ref name="Schlinger"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Schlinger, H.D. |year=2008 |title=The long good-bye: why B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior is alive and well on the 50th anniversary of its publication |journal=The Psychological Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Skinner's conception of "Verbal Behavior" has not died, perhaps in part because it has generated successful practical applications.&lt;ref name="Schlinger" /&gt;

===Continuity vs discontinuity===
Since theorists believe that development is a smooth, continuous process, individuals gradually add more of the same types of skills throughout their lives. Other theorists, however, think that development takes place in discontinuous stages. People change rapidly and step up to a new level, and then change very little for a while. With each new step, the person shows interest and responds to the world qualitatively.

===Stability vs change===
This issue involves the degree to which we become older renditions of our early experience or whether we develop into something different from who we were at an earlier point in development. It considers the extent to which early experiences ( especially infancy) or later experiences are the key determinants of a person's development.

Most lifespan developmentalists, recognise that extreme positions are unwise. Therefore, the key to a comprehensive understanding of development at any stage requires the ·interaction of different factors and not only one.

==Mechanisms of Development==
Developmental psychology is concerned not only with describing the characteristics of psychological change over time but also seeks to explain the principles and internal workings underlying these changes. Psychologists have attempted to better understand these factors by using [[model (abstract)|models]]. Developmental models are sometimes [[computer model|computational]], but they do not need to be.

A model must simply account for the means by which a process takes place. This is sometimes done in reference to changes in the [[human brain|brain]] that may correspond to changes in behavior over the course of the development. Computational accounts of development often use either [[symbol]]ic, [[connectionist]] ([[neural net]]work), or [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] models to explain the Mechanisms of Development.

==Research areas==

===Cognitive development===
{{Main|Cognitive development|Theory of cognitive development|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}
Cognitive development is primarily concerned with the ways that infants and children acquire, develop, and use internal mental capabilities such as: problem-solving, memory, and language. Major topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisition and the development of perceptual and motor skills. Piaget was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilities. His theory suggests that development proceeds through a set of stages from infancy to adulthood and that there is an end point or goal.

Other accounts, such as that of [[Lev Vygotsky]], have suggested that development does not progress through stages, but rather that the developmental process that begins at birth and continues until death is too complex for such structure and finality. Rather, from this viewpoint, developmental processes proceed more continuously. Thus, development should be analyzed, instead of treated as a product to obtain.

[[K. Warner Schaie]] has expanded the study of cognitive development into adulthood.  Rather than being stable from adolescence, Schaie sees adults as progressing in the application of their cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Schaie, K. W. (1990). Intellectual development in adulthood. In J. E. Birren &amp; K. W. Schaie (Eds.), Handbook of the psychology of aging, 3rd ed., (pp. 291-309). New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cognitive development has integrated the considerations of [[cognitive psychology]] and the psychology of [[individual differences]] into the interpretation and modeling of development.&lt;ref name="demetriou"&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K.F.M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology'' (pp. 179–269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] showed that the successive levels or stages of cognitive development are associated with increasing processing efficiency and [[working memory]] capacity. These increases explain differences between stages, progression to higher stages, and individual differences of children who are the same-age and of the same grade-level. However, other theories have moved away from Piagetian stage theories, and are influenced by accounts of [[domain-specific]] information processing, which posit that development is guided by innate evolutionarily-specified and content-specific information processing mechanisms.

===Social and emotional development===
{{Main|Social-emotional development in childhood|Social psychology}}
Developmental psychologists who are interested in social development examine how individuals develop social and emotional competencies. For example, they study how children form friendships, how they understand and deal with emotions, and how identity develops. Research in this area may involve study of the relationship between cognition or cognitive development and social behavior.

[[Emotional self-regulation|Emotional regulation]] or ER refers to an individual's ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contexts. In young children, this modulation is in part controlled externally, by parents and other authority figures. As children develop, they take on more and more responsibility for their internal state. Studies have shown that the development of ER is affected by the emotional regulation children observe in parents and caretakers, the emotional climate in the home, and the reaction of parents and caretakers to the child's emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Morris et al. (2009) National Institute of Health. "The Role of the Family Context in Development of Emotion Regulation." pp 1-36 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PSYCH305-11.2.pdf] Retrieved May 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Music also has an influence on stimulating and enhancing the senses of a child through self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;Oaklander, Violet. (2006) Hidden Treasure : A Map to the Child's Inner Self. London,   Karnac Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

A child's social and emotional development can be disrupted by motor coordination problems as evidenced by the environmental stress hypothesis.  The environmental hypothesis explains how children with coordination problems and [[developmental coordination disorder]] are exposed to several psychosocial consequences which act as secondary stressors, leading to an increase in [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing symptoms]] such as depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cairney|first1=John|last2=Veldhuizen|first2=Scott|last3=Szatmari|first3=Peter|title=Motor coordination and emotional-behavioral problems in children|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=2010|volume=23|pages=324–329|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e32833aa0aa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motor coordination problems affect fine and gross motor movement as well as perceptual-motor skills.  Secondary stressors commonly identified include the tendency for children with poor motor skills to be less likely to participate in organized play with other children and more likely to feel socially isolated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Social and emotional development focuses on 5 keys areas: Self-Awareness, Self Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Skills and Responsible Decision Making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SEL Competencies|url = http://www.casel.org/social-and-emotional-learning/core-competencies|website = CASEL|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical development===
Physical development concerns the physical maturation of an individual's body until it reaches the adult stature. Although physical growth is a highly regular process, all children differ tremendously in the timing of their growth spurts.&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;Eaton, Warren. "Physical Maturation", University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. Retrieved on 2012-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies are being done to analyze how the differences in these timings affect and are related to other variables of developmental psychology such as information processing speed. Traditional measures of physical maturity using x-rays are less in practice nowadays, compared to simple measurements of body parts such as height, weight, head circumference, and arm span.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

A few other studies and practices with physical developmental psychology are the phonological abilities of mature 5- to 11-year-olds, and the controversial hypotheses of left-handers being maturationally delayed compared to right-handers. A study by Eaton, Chipperfield, Ritchot, and Kostiuk in 1996 found in three different samples that there was no difference between right- and left-handers.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

===Memory development===
Researchers interested in memory development look at the way our memory develops from childhood and onward. According to [[Fuzzy-trace theory]], we have two separate memory processes: verbatim and gist. These two traces begin to develop at different times as well as at a different pace. Children as young as 4 years-old have verbatim memory, memory for surface information, which increases up to early adulthood, at which point it begins to decline. On the other hand, our capacity for gist memory, memory for semantic information, increases up to early adulthood, at which point it is consistent through old age. Furthermore, our reliance on gist memory traces increases as we age.&lt;ref name="Fuzzy-trace theory and children's false memories"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brainerd|first=C.J.|author2=Reyna, V.F.|title=Fuzzy-trace theory and children's false memories|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1998|volume=71|issue=2|pages=81–129|doi=10.1006/jcep.1998.2464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods and designs==

===Main research methods===
Developmental psychology employs many of the [[psychological research methods|research methods]] used in other areas of psychology. However, infants and children cannot be tested in the same ways as adults, so different methods are often used to study their development.

Developmental psychologists have a number of methods to study changes in individuals over time. Common research methods include systematic observation, including [[naturalistic observation]] or structured observation; self-reports, which could be clinical interviews or [[structured interviews]]; clinical or [[case study]] method; and [[ethnography]] or participant observation.&lt;ref name=Berk&gt;{{cite book |title=Infants and children: Prenatal through middle childhood |author=Laura E. Berk |edition=7 |year=2012 |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31–35}} These methods differ in the extent of control researchers impose on study conditions, and how they construct ideas about which variables to study.&lt;ref name=Bruning&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruning|first=David Moshman, John A. Glover, Roger H.|title=Developmental psychology : a topical approach|year=1987|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=0-316-58561-0|pages=82–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every developmental investigation can be characterized in terms of whether its underlying strategy involves the ''experimental'', ''correlational'', or ''case study'' approach.&lt;ref name=Achenbach&gt;{{cite book|last=Achenbach|first=Thomas M.|title=Research in development psychology.|year=1978|publisher=Free Pr.

===Research designs===
Most developmental studies, regardless of whether they employ the experimental, correlational, or case study method, can also be constructed using research designs.&lt;ref name=Bruning /&gt; Research designs are logical frameworks used to make key comparisons within research studies such as:
* [[cross-sectional design]]
* [[longitudinal design]]
* [[cohort study|sequential design]]
* [[microgenetic design]]

In a [[longitudinal study]], a researcher observes many individuals born at or around the same time (a [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]) and carries out new observations as members of the cohort age. This method can be used to draw conclusions about which types of development are universal (or [[norm (sociology)|normative]]) and occur in most members of a cohort. As an example a longitudinal study of early literacy development examined in detail the early literacy experiences of one child in each of 30 families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweducation.com/PhDabstractsummary.html A Longitudinal Study of Early Literacy Development and the Changing Perceptions of Parents and Teachers], Dr John Worthington, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers may also observe ways that development varies between individuals, and hypothesize about the causes of variation in their data. Longitudinal studies often require large amounts of time and funding, making them unfeasible in some situations. Also, because members of a cohort all experience historical events unique to their generation, apparently normative developmental trends may, in fact, be universal only to their cohort.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|40}}

In a [[cross-sectional study]], a researcher observes differences between individuals of different ages at the same time. This generally requires fewer resources than the longitudinal method, and because the individuals come from different cohorts, shared historical events are not so much of a [[lurking variable|confounding factor]]. By the same token, however, cross-sectional research may not be the most effective way to study differences between participants, as these differences may result not from their different ages but from their exposure to ''different'' historical events.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|41}}

A third study design, the [[cohort study|sequential design]], combines both methodologies. Here, a researcher observes members of different birth cohorts at the same time, and then tracks all participants over time, charting changes in the groups. While much more resource-intensive, the format aids in a clearer distinction between what changes can be attributed to an individual or historical environment from those that are truly universal.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|42}}

Because every method has some weaknesses, developmental psychologists rarely rely on one study or even one method to reach conclusions by finding consistent evidence from as many converging sources as possible.&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt;

==Life stages of psychological development==
&lt;!--THIS SECTION NEEDS WORK!--&gt;
{{See also|Child development stages}}

===Prenatal development===
{{Main|Prenatal development}}
{{See also|Fetal psychology}}
Prenatal development is of interest to psychologists investigating the context of early psychological development. The whole prenatal development involves three main stages: germinal stage, embryonic stage and fetal stage. Germinal stage begins at conception until 2 weeks; embryonic stage means the development from 2 weeks to 8 weeks; fetal stage represents 9 weeks until birth of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=K|last=Cherry|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/developmentalpsychology/a/prenataldevelop.htm|title=Stages of Prenatal Development|website=About Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016}} The senses develop in the womb itself: a fetus can both see and hear by the second trimester (13 to 24 weeks of age). The sense of touch develops in the embryonic stage (5 to 8 weeks).&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|97}} Most of the brain's billions of neurons also are developed by the second trimester.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|100}} Babies are hence born with some odor, taste and sound preferences, largely related to the mother's environment.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|101}}

Some [[primitive reflexes]] too arise before birth and are still present in newborns. One hypothesis is that these reflexes are vestigial and have limited use in early human life. [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]] suggested that some early reflexes are building blocks for infant sensorimotor development. For example, the [[tonic neck reflex]] may help development by bringing objects into the infant's field of view.&lt;ref name="butterworth"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Butterworth |first=G. |author2=Harris, M. |title=Principles of Developmental Psychology |year=1994 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=0-86377-280-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reflexes, such as the [[walking reflex]] appear to be replaced by more sophisticated voluntary control later in infancy. This may be because the infant gains too much weight after birth to be strong enough to use the reflex, or because the reflex and subsequent development are functionally different.&lt;ref name="bremner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bremner |first=J.G. |title=Infancy |year=1994 |publisher=Blackwell |edition=2 |isbn=0-631-18466-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that some reflexes (for example the [[moro reflex|moro]] and [[walking reflex]]es) are predominantly adaptations to life in the womb with little connection to early infant development.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt;  Primitive reflexes reappear in adults under certain conditions, such as neurological conditions like [[dementia]] or traumatic lesions.

[[Ultrasound]] has shown that infants are capable of a range of movements in the womb, many of which appear to be more than simple reflexes.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt; By the time they are born, infants can recognize and have a preference for their mother's voice suggesting some prenatal development of auditory perception.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt; Prenatal development and birth complications may also be connected to neurodevelopmental disorders, for example in [[schizophrenia]]. With the advent of [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[embryology]] and the neuroscience of prenatal development is of increasing interest to developmental psychology research.

Several environmental agents—[[teratogens]]—can cause damage during the prenatal period. These include prescription and nonprescription drugs, illegal drugs, tobacco, alcohol, environmental pollutants, infectious disease agents such as the [[rubella]] virus and the [[toxoplasmosis]] parasite, maternal malnutrition, maternal emotional stress, and Rh factor blood incompatibility between mother and child.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|102–115}} There are many statistics which prove the effects of the aforementioned substances. A leading example of this would be that, in America alone, approximately 100,000-375,000 'cocaine babies' are born on an annual basis. This is a result of an expectant mother abusing the drug while pregnant. 'Cocaine babies' are proven to have quite severe and lasting difficulties which persist throughout infancy and right throughout childhood. The drug also encourages behavioural problems in the affected children, as well as defects of various vital organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=One of five expectant mothers use cocaine, U.S. study finds|author=AP|work=Toronto star

===Infancy===
{{Main|Infant and child psychology|Infant cognitive development}}
From birth until the first year, the child is referred to as an [[infant]].&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt; Developmental psychologists vary widely in their assessment of infant psychology, and the influence the outside world has upon it, but certain aspects are relatively clear.

The majority of a newborn infant's time is spent in sleep. At first, this sleep is evenly spread throughout the day and night, but after a couple of months, infants generally become [[diurnal animal|diurnal]].

Infants can be seen to have six states, grouped into pairs:
* quiet sleep and active sleep ([[dream]]ing, when [[REM sleep]] occurs)
* quiet waking, and active waking
* fussing and [[crying]]

====Infant perception====
Infant perception is what a newborn can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.  These five features are better known as one's "five senses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bee |first=Denise Boyd, Helen |title=The developing child |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=978-0-205-25602-0 |page=36 |edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants respond to stimuli differently in these different states.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt;

* [[Visual perception|Vision]] is significantly worse in infants than in older children. Infant sight tends to be blurry in early stages but improves over time. Color perception similar to that seen in adults has been demonstrated in infants as young as four months, using habituation methods.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt; Infants get to adult-like vision in about six months.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|191}}
* [[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is well-developed prior to birth, unlike vision. Newborns prefer complex sounds to pure tones, human speech to other sounds, mother's voice to other voices, and the native language to other languages. Scientist believe these features are probably learned in the womb.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|151}} Infants are fairly good at detecting the direction a sound comes from, and by 18 months their hearing ability is approximately equal to an adult's.
* [[Olfaction|Smell]] and [[taste]] are present, with infants showing different expressions of disgust or pleasure when presented with pleasant odors (honey, milk, etc.) or unpleasant odors (rotten egg) and tastes (e.g. sour taste). Newborns are born with odor and taste preferences acquired in the womb from the smell and taste of amniotic fluid, in turn influenced by what the mother eats. Both breast- and bottle-fed babies around 3 days old prefer the smell of human milk to that of formula, indicating an innate preference.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|150}} There is good evidence for older infants preferring the smell of their mother to that of others.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt;
* [[Haptic perception|Touch and feel]] is one of the better-developed senses at birth considering it's one of the first senses to develop inside the womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Ruth Duskin |last2=Papalia |first2=Diane E. |title=A child's world: infancy through adolescence |year=2010 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-353204-2 |page=57 |edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is evidenced by the [[primitive reflexes]] described above, and the relatively advanced development of the [[somatosensory cortex]].&lt;ref name="Slater"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Infant Development |last1=Slater |first1=A. |last2=Lewis |first2=M. |isbn=0-19-928305-2 |publisher=OUP |location=Oxford |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pain]]: Infants feel pain similarly, if not more strongly than older children but pain-relief in infants has not received so much attention as an area of research.&lt;ref name="MatthewMatthew"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/pmj.79.934.438 |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |year=2003 |volume=79 |issue=934 |pages=438–43 |title=Assessment and management of pain in infants |last=Mathew |first=P.J. |last2=Mathew |first2=J.L. |url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/79/934/438 |pmid=12954954 |pmc=1742785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose is known to relieve pain in newborns.&lt;ref name="DilenElseviers"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.2010.00389.x |journal=Birth (Berkeley, Calif.) |year=2010 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=98–105 |title=Oral glucose solution as pain relief in newborns: results of a clinical trial |last1=Dilen |first1=Ben |last2=Elseviers |first2=Monique |pmid=20557532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language====
{{Main|Language development}}
Babies are born with the ability to discriminate virtually all sounds of all human languages.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|189}} Infants of around six months can differentiate between [[phoneme]]s in their own language, but not between similar phonemes in another language. At this stage infants also start to [[Babbling|babble]], producing phonemes.

====Infant cognition: the Piagetian era====
Piaget suggested that an infant's perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor development, which was required for the infant to link visual, tactile and motor representations of objects.&lt;ref&gt;Lefmann, T. &amp; Combs-Orme, T. 2013, "Early Brain Development for Social Work Practice: Integrating Neuroscience with Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development", Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, vol. 23, no. 5, pp. 640-647.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, it is through touching and handling objects that infants develop [[object permanence]], the understanding that objects are solid, permanent, and continue to exist when out of sight.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt;

[[File:Baby.jpg|thumb|200px|Special methods are used in the psychological study of infants.]]
Piaget's sensorimotor stage comprised six sub-stages (see [[Theory of cognitive development#Sensorimotor period|sensorimotor stages]] for more detail). In the early stages, development arises out of movements caused by [[primitive reflexes]].&lt;ref name="Gruber"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Piaget |first=J. |year=1977 |title=The essential Piaget |editor-first=H.E. |editor-last=Gruber |editor2-first=J.J. |editor2-last=Voneche |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-7100-8778-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovery of new behaviors results from [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning]], and the formation of [[habit (psychology)|habits]].&lt;ref name="Gruber" /&gt; From eight months the infant is able to uncover a hidden object but will persevere when the object is moved.

Piaget came to his conclusion that infants lacked a complete understanding of object permanence before 18 months after observing infants' failure before this age to look for an object where it was last seen. Instead, infants continue to look for an object where it was first seen, committing the "[[A-not-B error]]." Some researchers have suggested that before the age of eight to nine months, infants' inability to understand object permanence extends to people, which explains why infants at this age do not cry when their mothers are gone ("Out of sight, out of mind").

====Recent findings in infant cognition====
In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers have developed many new methods of assessing infants' understanding of the world with far more precision and subtlety than Piaget was able to do in his time. Since then, many studies based on these methods suggest that young infants understand far more about the world than first thought.

Based on recent findings, some researchers (such as [[Elizabeth Spelke]] and [[Renee Baillargeon]]) have proposed that an understanding of object permanence is not learned at all, but rather comprises part of the innate cognitive capacities of our species.

Other research has suggested that young infants in their first six months of life may possess an understanding of numerous aspects of the world around them, including:

* an early [[numerical cognition]], that is, an ability to represent number and even compute the outcomes of addition and subtraction operations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wynn |first1=Karen |authorlink1=Karen Wynn |year=1992  |title=Addition and subtraction by human infants |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=358 |issue= 6389|pages=749–750 |publisher= |doi= 10.1038/358749a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v358/n6389/abs/358749a0.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an ability to infer the goals of people in their environment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1998 | title = Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach | url = | journal = Cognition | volume =  69| issue = | pages =  1–34| doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(98)00058-4  | last1 = Woodward | first1 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an ability to engage in simple causal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leslie | first1 = A. | last2 = Keeble | first2 = S. | year = 1987 | title = Do six-month-old infants perceive causality?| url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 265–288 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(87)80006-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical periods of development====
There are [[critical period]]s in infancy and childhood during which development of certain perceptual, sensorimotor, social and language systems depends crucially on environmental stimulation.&lt;ref name="Siegler"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Siegler |first=Robert |year=2006 |title=How Children Develop, Exploring Child Development Student Media Tool Kit &amp; Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=0-7167-6113-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feral child]]ren such as [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]], deprived of adequate stimulation, fail to acquire important skills and are unable to learn in later childhood. The concept of critical periods is also well-established in [[neurophysiology]], from the work of [[Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel|Wiesel]] among others.

====Developmental delays====
Children with developmental delays (DD) are at heightened risk for developing clinically significant behavioral and emotional difficulties as compared to children with typical development (TD). However, nearly all studies comparing psychopathology in youth with DD employ TD control groups of the same chronological age (CA).This comorbidity of DD and a mental disorder is often referred to as dual diagnosis. Epidemiological studies indicate that 30–50% of youth with DD meet the clinical cutoff for behavioral and emotional problems and/or diagnosable mental disorder. Studies that include comparison samples of children with typical development (TD) highlight the considerable difference in risk for psychopathology, with the relative risk for youth with DD (to youth with TD) ranging from 2.8–4.1 to 1.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Toddler-hood===
{{Main|Toddler}}
Infants shift between ages of one and two to a developmental stage known as toddlerhood. In this stage, an infant's transition into toddlerhood is highlighted through self-awareness, developing maturity in language use, and presence of memory and imagination.

During toddlerhood, babies begin learning how to [[Walking|walk]], talk, and make decisions for themselves. An important characteristic of this age period is the [[Language development|development of language]], where children are learning how to communicate and express their emotions and desires through the use of vocal sounds, babbling, and eventually words.&lt;ref name=Upton&gt;{{cite book|last=Upton|first=Penney|title=Developmental Psychology: Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Learning Matters|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85725-276-3|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-control also begins to develop. At this age, children take initiative to explore, experiment and learn from making mistakes. Caretakers who encourage toddlers to try new things and test their limits, help the child become autonomous, self-reliant, and confident.&lt;ref name=ToddlerPlay&gt;{{cite book|last=Massi|first=Wendy S.|title=Toddler Play|year=2001|publisher=Creative Pub. international|isbn=0-86573-435-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the caretaker is overprotective or disapproving of independent actions, the toddler may begin to doubt their abilities and feel ashamed of the desire for independence. The child's autonomic development is inhibited, leaving them less prepared to deal with the world in the future. Toddlers also begin to identify themselves in [[gender role]]s, acting according to their perception of what a man or woman should do.&lt;ref name=UPton&gt;{{cite book|last=Upton|first=Penney|title=Developmental Psychology: Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Learning Matters|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85725-276-3|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socially, the period of toddler-hood is commonly called the "terrible twos".&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Barbara M.|title=Development Through Life : A Psychosocial Approach|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=1-111-34468-X|pages=215–217|author2=Newman, P. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toddlers often use their new-found language abilities to voice their desires, but are often misunderstood by parents due to their language skills just beginning to develop.  A person at this stage testing their independence is another reason behind the stage's infamous label. Tantrums in a fit of frustration are also common.

===Childhood===
{{See also|Early childhood}}
[[Erik Erikson]] divides childhood into four stages, each with its distinct social crisis:&lt;ref name="Bernardo J. Carducci 2009"&gt;Bernardo J. Carducci, ''The Psychology of Personality: Viewpoints, Research, and Applications'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009), 189.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Stage 1: [[Infancy]] (0 to 1½) in which the psychosocial crisis is Trust vs. Mistrust
:* Stage 2: Early childhood (2½ to 3) in which the psychosocial crisis is Autonomy vs. Shame and doubt
:* Stage 3: Play age (3 to 5) in which the psychosocial crisis is Initiative vs. Guilt. (This stage is also called the "pre-school age," "exploratory age" and "toy age."&lt;ref&gt;Vardhaman I.Q. Toys, "Vision," http://www.vardhamaniqtoys.com/vision.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;)
:* Stage 4: School age (5 to 12) in which the psychosocial crisis is Industry vs. Inferiority

'''Play (or preschool) ages 3–5.'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the earliest years, children are "completely dependent on the care of others." Therefore, they develop a "social relationship" with their care givers and, later, with family members. During their preschool years (3-5), they "enlarge their social horizons" to include people outside the family.&lt;ref&gt;Arland Thornton, ''The Well-being of Children and Families: Research and Data Needs'' (University of Michigan Press, 2001), 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive development#Preoperational stage|Preoperational]] and then [[Cognitive development#Concrete operational stage|operational]] thinking develops, which means actions are reversible, and egocentric thought diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Lightfoot, Michael Cole, Sheila R. Cole, ''The Development of Children'' (Macmillan, 2008), 275-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The motor skills of preschoolers increase so they can do more things for themselves. They become more independent. No longer completely dependent on the care of others, the world of this age group expands. More people have a role in shaping their individual personalities. Preschoolers explore and question their world.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Preschoolers (3-5 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/preschoolers.html&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Jean Piaget]], the child is "''a little scientist'' exploring and reflecting on these explorations to increase competence" and this is done in "a very independent way."&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Halpenny, Jan Pettersen, ''Introducing Piaget: A Guide for Practitioners and Students in Early Years Education'' (Routledge, 2013), 7, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Play is a major activity for ages 3–5. For Piaget, through play "a child reaches higher levels of cognitive development."&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Halpenny, Jan Pettersen, ''Introducing Piaget: A Guide for Practitioners and Students in Early Years Education'' (Routledge, 2013), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their expanded world, children in the 3-5 age group attempt to find their own way. If this is done in a socially acceptable way, the child develops the initiative. If not, the child develops guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Bob O'Connor, Christine Wells, Trent Applegate, ''Health: You and Your World Volume 1: Brief Edition'' (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2015), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who develop "guilt" rather than "initiative" have failed Erikson's psychosocial crisis for the 3-5 age group.

'''Middle childhood ages 6–12.'''&lt;br /&gt;
For Erik Erikson, the psychosocial crisis during middle childhood is Industry vs. Inferiority which, if successfully met, instills a sense of Competency in the child.&lt;ref name="Bernardo J. Carducci 2009" /&gt;

In all cultures, middle childhood is a time for developing "skills that will be needed in their society."&lt;ref name="Barbara Engler 2013"&gt;Barbara Engler, ''Personality Theories, 9th edition'' (Cengage Learning, 2013), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; School offers an arena in which children can gain a view of themselves as "industrious (and worthy)." They are "graded for their school work and often for their industry." They can also develop industry outside of school in sports, games, and doing volunteer work.&lt;ref name="Marc H. Bornstein 2010"&gt;Marc H. Bornstein, Deborah Lowe Vandell, Karen S. Rook, ''Lifespan Development: Infancy Through Adulthood'' (Cengage Learning, 2010), 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who achieve "success in school or games might develop a feeling of competence."

The "peril during this period is that feelings of inadequacy and inferiority will develop.&lt;ref name="Barbara Engler 2013" /&gt; Parents and teachers can "undermine" a child's development by failing to recognize accomplishments or being overly critical of a child's efforts.&lt;ref name="Marc H. Bornstein 2010" /&gt;
Children who are "encouraged and praised" develop a belief in their competence. Lack of encouragement or ability to excel lead to "feelings of inadequacy and inferiority".&lt;ref&gt;Megan Broutian, Milestones, "Your child: early school years (7 to 11 years) stage of development" in ''Your Child's Development'' online at http://behavioralchild.com/milestones/. Accessed October 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control]] (the CDC) divides Middle Childhood into two stages, 6–8 years and 9–11 years, and gives "developmental milestones for each stage."&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle.html and Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (9-11 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle2.html. Both accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Middle Childhood (7-10).''&lt;br /&gt;
Entering elementary school, children in this age group begin to thinks about the future and their "place in the world." Working with other students and wanting their friendship and acceptance become more important. This leads to "more independence from parents and family." As students, they develop the mental and verbal skills "to describe experiences and talk about thoughts and feelings". They become less self-centered and show "more concern for others".&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle.html. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Middle Childhood (9-11).''&lt;br /&gt;
For children ages 9–11 "friendships and peer relationships" increase in strength, complexity, and importance. This results in greater "peer pressure." They grow even less dependent on their families and they are challenged academically. To meet this challenge, they increase their attention span and learn to see other points of view.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle2.html. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
{{Main|Adolescent psychology}}
Adolescence is the period of life between the onset of puberty and the full commitment to an adult social role, such as worker, parent, and/or citizen. It is the period known for the formation of personal and social identity (see [[Erik Erikson]]) and the discovery of moral purpose (see [[William Damon]]). Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts and formal reasoning. A return to [[egocentric]] thought often occurs early in the period. Only 35% develop the capacity to reason formally during adolescence or adulthood. (Huitt, W. and Hummel, J. January 1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~moursund/Math/developmental_theory.htm|title=Developmental Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is divided into three parts, namely:
# Early Adolescence: 9 to 13 years 
# Mid Adolescence: 13 to 15 years and
# Late Adolescence: 15 to 18 years

The adolescent unconsciously explores questions such as "Who am I? Who do I want to be?" Like toddlers, adolescents must explore, test limits, become [[autonomous]], and commit to an [[identity (social science)|identity]], or [[sense of self]]. Different roles, behaviors and [[ideologies]] must be tried out to select an identity. Role confusion and inability to choose vocation can result from a failure to achieve a sense of identity through, for example, friends.

===Early adulthood===
{{Main|Young adult (psychology)}}
Early adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 18 to 25, and according to theorists such as Erik Erikson, is a stage where development is mainly focused on [[Interpersonal relationship|maintaining relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kastenbaum|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Adult Development|year=1993|publisher=Oryx Press|isbn=0-89774-669-4|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include creating bond of intimacy, sustaining friendships, and ultimately making a family. Some theorists state that development of intimacy skills rely on the resolution of previous developmental stages. A sense of identity gained in the previous stages is also necessary for intimacy to develop. If this skill is not learned the alternative is alienation, isolation, a fear of commitment, and the inability to depend on others.

A related framework for studying this part of the lifespan is that of [[emerging adulthood]]. Scholars of emerging adulthood, such as Jeffrey Arnett, are not necessarily interested in relationship development. Instead, this concept suggests that people transition after their teenage years into a period not characterized as relationship building and an overall sense of constancy with life, but with years of living with parents, phases of self-discovery, and experimentation.&lt;ref name=Twenge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Twenge|first=Jean M.|title=Review of emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties|journal=American Journal of Psychology|year=2008|volume=121|issue=4|pages=682–687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle adulthood===
{{Main|Middle age}}
Middle adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 25 to 69. During this period, middle-aged adults experience a conflict between generativity and stagnation. They may either feel a sense of contributing to society, the next generation, or their immediate community; or develop a sense of purposelessness.

Physically, the middle-aged experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, sensory keenness, and cardiac output. Also, women experience [[menopause]] and a sharp drop in the hormone [[estrogen]]. Men experience an equivalent endocrine system event to menopause. [[Andropause]] in males is a hormone fluctuation with physical and psychological effects that can be similar to those seen in menopausal females. As men age lowered testosterone levels can contribute to mood swings and a decline in [[spermatozoa|sperm]] count. Sexual responsiveness can also be affected, including delays in [[erection]] and longer periods of [[penile stimulation]] required to achieve [[ejaculation]].

===Old age===
{{Main|Old age}}

The [[World Health Organization]] finds "no general agreement on the age at which a person becomes old." Most [[Developed country|"developed countries"]] set the age as 60 or 65. However, in [[Developing country|developing countries]] inability to make "active contribution" to society, not chronological age, marks the beginning of old age.&lt;ref&gt;"Definition of an older or elderly person" on World Health Organization website at http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageingdefnolder/en/. Accessed October 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development]], old age is the stage in which individuals assess the quality of their lives. In reflecting on their lives, people in this age group develop a feeling of integrity if deciding that their lives were successful or a feeling of despair if evaluation of one's life indicates a failure to achieve goals.&lt;ref name="Miller2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia R.

==Parenting==
Parenting variables alone have typically accounted for 20 to 50 percent of the variance in child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Flaherty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flaherty|first=Serena Cherry|author2=Sadler, Lois S.|title=A Review of Attachment Theory in the Context of Adolescent Parenting|journal=Journal of Pediatric Health Care|date=1 March 2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=114–121|doi=10.1016/j.pedhc.2010.02.005|pmc=3051370|pmid=21320683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All parents have their own parenting styles. Parenting styles, according to [https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/kak33 Kimberly Kopko], are "based upon two aspects of parenting behavior; control and warmth. Parental control refers to the degree to which parents manage their children's behavior. Parental warmth refers to the degree to which parents are accepting and responsive to their children's behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kopoko|first1=Kimberly|title=Parenting Styles and Adolescents|journal=Cornell University Cooperative Extension|date=2007|pages=1–8|url=http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/outreach/parenting/research/upload/Parenting-20Styles-20and-20Adolescents.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parenting styles===
The following [[parenting styles]] have been described in the child development literature:

* Authoritative parenting is characterized as parents who have high parental warmth, responsiveness, and demandingness, but rate low in negativity and conflict.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Lorraine C.|author2=Clayton, Jennifer D. |author3=Rowley, Stephanie J. |title=Academic Socialization: Understanding Parental Influences on Children's School-Related Development in the Early Years.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2004|volume=8|issue=3|pages=163–178|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.8.3.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parents are assertive but not intrusive or overly restrictive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumrind|first=D.|title=The Influence of Parenting Style on Adolescent Competence and Substance Use|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=1 February 1991|volume=11|issue=1|pages=56–95|doi=10.1177/0272431691111004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of parenting is associated with more positive social and academic outcomes. The beneficial outcomes of authoritative parenting are not necessarily universal. Among African American adolescents, authoritative parenting is not associated with academic achievement without peer support for achievement.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; Children who are raised by authoritative parents are "more likely to become independent, self-reliant, socially accepted, academically successful, and well-behaved. They are less likely to report depression and anxiety, and less likely to engage in antisocial behavior like delinquency and drug use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewar PHD|first1=Gwen|title=The authoritative parenting style: Warmth, rationality, and high standards." A guide for the science-minded parent|url=http://www.parentingscience.com/authoritative-parenting-style.html|website=Parenting Science|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Authoritarian parenting is characterized by low levels of warmth and responsiveness with high levels of demandingness and firm control.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; These parents focus on obedience and they monitor their children regularly.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; In general, this style of parenting is associated with maladaptive outcomes.  The outcomes are more harmful for middle class boys than girls, preschool white girls than preschool black girls, and for white boys than Hispanic boys.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; Furthermore, the negative effects of authoritarian parenting among Asian Americans can be offset by positive peer support.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; Finally, among African Americans, some elements of authoritarian parenting such as firm control and physical discipline do not serve as predictive factors for negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt;
* Permissive parenting is characterized by high levels of responsiveness combined with low levels of demandingness.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; These parents are lenient and do not necessarily require mature behavior.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  They allow for a high degree of self-regulation and typically avoid confrontation.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Compared to children raised using the authoritative style, preschool girls raised in permissive families are less assertive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Additionally, preschool children of both sexes are less cognitively competent than those children raised under authoritative parenting styles.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;
* Rejecting or neglectful parenting is the final category. This is characterized by low levels of demandingness and responsiveness. These parents are typically disengaged in their child's lives, lacking structure in their parenting styles and are unsupportive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Children in this category are typically the least competent of all the categories.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;

===Mother and father factors===
Parenting roles in child development have typically focused on the role of the mother. Recent literature, however, has looked toward the father as having an important role in child development.  Affirming a role for fathers, studies have shown that children as young as 15 months benefit significantly from substantial engagement with their father.&lt;ref name="aredos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/2004-3/role.html|title=Fathers' Role in Children's Academic Achievement and Early Literacy. ERIC Digest.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Children with active, involved fathers have better social skills, are healthier, and do better in school", according to Duane Wilson, the Proud Fathers, Proud Parents program coordinator for the Michigan Department of Human Services (http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2125328669291708941 2:57)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a study in the U.S. and New Zealand found the presence of the natural father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Ellis, Child Development May/June 2003, 74:3, pp. 801–21&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, another argument is that neither a mother nor a father is actually essential in successful parenting, and that single parents as well as homosexual couples can support positive child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silverstein|first=Louise|author2=Carl Auerbach|title=Deconstructing the Essential Father|journal=American Psychologist|year=1999|volume=54|pages=397–407|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.397}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this set of research, children need at least one consistently responsible adult with whom the child can have a positive emotional connection. Having more than one of these figures contributes to a higher likelihood of positive child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Silverstein /&gt;

===Divorce===
Another parental factor often debated in terms of its effects on child development is divorce.  Divorce in itself is not a determining factor of negative child outcomes. In fact, the majority of children from divorcing families fall into the normal range on measures of psychological and cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name=Whiteside&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whiteside|first=Mary F.|author2=Becker, Betsy Jane|title=Parental factors and the young child's postdivorce adjustment: A meta-analysis with implications for parenting arrangements.|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|date=1 January 2000|volume=14|issue=1|pages=5–26|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.14.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of mediating factors play a role in determining the effects divorce has on a child, for example, divorcing families with young children often face harsher consequences in terms of demographic, social, and economic changes than do families with older children.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt; Positive coparenting after divorce is part of a pattern associated with positive child coping, while hostile parenting behaviors lead to a destructive pattern leaving children at risk.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt; Additionally, direct parental relationship with the child also affects the development of a child after a divorce.  Overall, protective factors facilitating positive child development after a divorce are maternal warmth, positive father-child relationship, and cooperation between parents.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt;

'''Dynamic SSL''' is an endpoint security technology developed by Daniel McCann and Nima Sharifimehr of NetSecure Technologies Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netsecuretechnologies.com/about-us/leadership-team&lt;/ref&gt;  Dynamic SSL was created to solve the endpoint security problem in public networks by transparently correcting the implementation flaws in SSL systems that expose sensitive data to interception and tampering.  Dynamic SSL is sometimes referred to as Dynamic TLS.

&lt;!--== Overview ==
Dynamic SSL is a software process that is meant to correct implementation flaws in SSL/TLS systems, which leave sensitive data open to interception and tampering at the endpoint.

An enhanced version of Dynamic SSL also provides protection against Man-in-the-Middle attacks.--&gt;

==Endpoint vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS systems==
Most implementations of SSL assume that the client computer is a secure environment for key negotiation, key storage, and encryption.  This is untrue in principle and in practice, as malicious technologies such as [[Spyware]], KeyJacking, and [[Man in the Browser]] have proven to be able to circumvent SSL by obtaining sensitive data prior to encryption.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Guhring, "Concepts against Man in the Browser Attack", 2006  http://www2.futureware.at/svn/sourcerer/CAcert/SecureClient.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Marchesini, S.W.Smith, Meiyuan Zhao, “Keyjacking: risks of the current client-side infrastructure,” Proceedings of the 2nd Annual PKI Research Workshop, 2003. pp. 80-95&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the reliance on the host PC for PKI certificate validation renders the infrastructure vulnerable to [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Serpanos D N, Lipton R J, "Defense Against Man-in-the-Middle Attack in Client-Server Systems with Secure Servers" 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--The problem is compounded when SSL implementation vulnerabilities are combined with a plaintext protocol such as HTTP, where it is relatively trivial to obtain sensitive data by monitoring the data stream prior to encryption.  This means most web applications, including those entrusted to protect sensitive information, are at risk.--&gt;

===Challenges for public networks===
Traditional solutions to endpoint security rely on custom protocols or proprietary authentication architectures that are not interoperable with SSL.  In many circumstances, particularly in anonymous or distributed environments where interoperability with SSL is a requirement, synchronization of client and server systems with a proprietary security protocol is simply not feasible.  This is known as the [[Endpoint Security Problem]] in public networks.

In layman's terms, the [[Endpoint Security Problem]] essentially asserts that any anonymous transaction through a web browser must inherently be at risk, and that it cannot be fixed without removing the anonymity of the transaction.  Since virtually all web transactions assume that the client is anonymous at the protocol level,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt&lt;/ref&gt; this means that any proposed third-party solution will essentially break the system.&lt;ref&gt;Note:  SSL client authentication does not solve this problem.  Since all clients in a web session are anonymous until authenticated, the act of authentication is therefore inherently a risky transaction which is subject to endpoint vulnerabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a fundamental vulnerability that undermines the entire web security infrastructure, rendering virtually ever web transaction at risk.

Dynamic SSL solves this fundamental problem by focusing on transparently closing the implementation vulnerabilities rather than on redefining a new protocol.  Therefore, the existing SSL system remains intact as the default secure communication protocol.  However, implementation vulnerabilities are solved to achieve endpoint security.

==Principles of Dynamic SSL==
The underlying principle in Dynamic SSL is that encryption of sensitive information cannot be performed in an untrusted environment, such as most personal computers, where the security of the encryption process could be compromised. Rather, encryption of sensitive information must be done outside of the personal computer.  Dynamic SSL assumes that the end user's computer is an untrusted environment, and can only be used as the channel to transmit sensitive information.  Dynamic SSL thus guarantees the security of sensitive data by ensuring that it is never present in the insecure environment.

==Implementations==
Typical implementations involve two core components: a secure environment which hosts the sensitive data to be protected, and a cryptographic proxy, which securely redirects the [[encryption]] of the host process of the insecure environment to a cryptographic provider within the secure environment which hosts the sensitive data.  An optional third component which controls the [[tokenization (data security)|tokenization]] process can be inserted at the application layer.  Nothing is required at the server end.

Generally speaking, the only change which is required on the endpoint computer is the replacement of the default [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] cryptographic provider with a Dynamic SSL cryptographic proxy.  Most operating systems and web browsers support pluggable cryptographic providers, meaning that most implementations will require no changes whatsoever to the application on either end of the system.

Dynamic SSL works by using a tokenization system for sensitive data in conjunction with secure redirection of cryptographic operations to a secure environment.  For example, rather than typing in your [[online banking]] [[password]] into a web browser, you would type in a meaningless token instead.  When the form is submitted, an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] request containing the token is generated, and sent to the SSL cryptographic provider for encryption and secure transmission to the remote server.  Instead of the encryption happening on the host PC, which may be compromised, the session is redirected to the secure environment (secure input device, server, etc..) which would contain your real online banking [[password]].  Inside the secure environment, the token within the HTTP request would get swapped out with your real online banking password at the moment of encryption.  The encrypted packet, containing your real online banking password, would then be returned to the SSL system of the host PC for transmission to the remote server.

From the server's perspective, the request appears like any other regular keyed-in request.  The packet was encrypted with the SSL session key negotiated with the client, and so is able to decrypt and process the packet as normal.  It cannot tell the difference between a regular SSL transaction and a Dynamic SSL transaction.

The only difference in the transaction was that the sensitive data was never present on the host PC. Any malicious attempt to harvest the data from the host PC would be unable to locate the data.

==Strengths and weaknesses==
Dynamic SSL is the only known approach to endpoint security that requires no changes to existing server systems, and can therefore be used to transparently retrofit existing systems for endpoint security, while retaining the benefits of using a proven standard like SSL.  By offloading cryptographic operations to a secure environment which acts as the point of origin for sensitive data, thereby ensuring the endpoint computer does not have access to said sensitive data, proactive protection from endpoint threats can in theory be achieved.

However, since Dynamic SSL is simply a process that is applied to SSL implementation, rather than a new protocol, it remains vulnerable to protocol vulnerabilities inherent within SSL, namely Man-in-the-Middle attacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opera.com/support/kb/view/944/&lt;/ref&gt;  Sharifimehr has proposed a supplementary solution involving Man-in-the-Middle Protection for Dynamic SSL.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smartswipe.ca/images/stories/site/dynamic-ssl-white-paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  His algorithm uses a combination of redundant cert verification and key tagging to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks and Keyjacking&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;John Marchesini, S.W.Smith, Meiyuan Zhao, “Keyjacking: risks of the current client-side infrastructure,” Proceedings of the 2nd Annual PKI Research Workshop, 2003. pp. 80-95&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;.  Most known implementations of Dynamic SSL include Sharifimehr's additional process, described below:

===Man-in-the-Middle protection===
Known valid root certificates are digitally signed by an independent third party.  When an X509 certificate arrives containing the authentication information for a remote website as part of the SSL authentication phase.  Since the root certificate signatures are redundantly verified in a secure environment against a pre-verified list of valid digital signatures for known valid root certificates, this prevents any compromise via tampering of the certificate authentication chain.  Phony certificates or certification chains can therefore be detected and the session rejected before it begins.

===Keyjacking protection===
Session and authentication keys are contextually bound to the operations which they are semantically required to perform, and may not be exported.  An encryption key may not be exported and used to decrypt the ciphertext which is encrypted.  In laymans terms, keys are "tagged" to ensure that they can never be exported for use outside of their intended use.

==Commercial applications==
A consumer product called SmartSwipe is the first known commercial application of Dynamic SSL.  It claims to provide security against malware and other client-side attacks while providing universal support for virtually every eCommerce merchant that uses SSL.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smartswipe.ca/benefits&lt;/ref&gt;  It is currently unknown whether other products are using this technology.

'''Energy policy''' is the manner in which a given entity (often governmental) has decided to address issues of [[energy development]] including [[energy production]], [[Resource distribution|distribution]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].  The attributes of energy policy may include [[legislation]], international treaties, incentives to investment, guidelines for [[energy conservation]], [[tax]]ation and other public policy techniques. Energy is a core component of modern economies. A functioning economy requires not only labor and capital but also energy, for manufacturing processes, transportation, communication, agriculture, and more. 

==Background==
Concerning the term of energy policy, the importance of implementation of an eco-energy-oriented policy at a global level to address the issues of global warming and climate changes should be accentuated.&lt;ref&gt;Eraldo Banovac, Marinko Stojkov, Dražan Kozak. Designing a global energy policy model, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Energy, Vol 170, Issue 1, February, 2017, pp. 2-11. https://doi.org/10.1680/jener.16.00005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research is ongoing, the "human dimensions" of [[energy use]] are of increasing interest to business, utilities, and policymakers. Using the [[social sciences]] to gain insights into energy [[consumer behavior]] can empower policymakers to make better decisions about broad-based [[climate and energy]] options. This could facilitate more [[efficient energy use]], [[renewable energy commercialization]], and [[carbon emission]] reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Armstrong, Catherine Wolfram, Robert Gross, Nathan S. Lewis, and [[M.V. Ramana]] et al., "The Frontiers of Energy", ''Nature Energy'', Vol 1, 11 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to energy is also critical for basic social needs, such as lighting, heating, cooking, and health care. As a result, the price of energy has a direct effect on jobs, economic productivity and business competitiveness, and the cost of goods and services.

==National energy policy==

===Measures used to produce an energy policy===
A national energy policy comprises a set of measures involving that country's laws, treaties and agency directives. The energy policy of a sovereign nation may include one or more of the following measures:

* statement of national policy regarding [[energy planning]], energy generation, transmission and usage
* [[legislation]] on commercial energy activities (trading, transport, storage, etc.)
* legislation affecting [[Efficient energy use|energy use]], such as [[Minimum Efficiency Performance Standards|efficiency standards]], [[emission standard]]s
* instructions for state-owned energy sector assets and organizations
* active participation in, co-ordination of and incentives for mineral [[fuel]]s exploration (see [[geological survey]]) and other energy-related [[research and development policy command ]]
* [[fiscal policy|fiscal policies]] related to energy products and services (taxes, exemptions, subsidies ...
* [[energy security]] and international policy measures such as:
** international energy sector treaties and alliances,
** general international trade agreements,
** special relations with energy-rich countries, including military presence and/or domination.

Frequently the dominant issue of energy policy is the risk of supply-demand mismatch (see: [[energy crisis]]). Current energy policies also address environmental issues (see: [[climate change]]), particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Rossi|first2=Piercarlo|title=National Energy Policies and Energy Security in the Context of Climate Change and Global Environmental Risks: A Theoretical Framework for Reconciling Domestic and International Law Through a Multiscalar and Multilevel Approach|journal=European Energy and Environmental Law Review|date=December 2, 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=232–244|ssrn=1970698|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some governments state explicit energy policy, but, declared or not, each government practices some type of energy policy. Economic and energy modelling can be used by governmental or inter-governmental bodies as an advisory and analysis tool (see: [[economic model]], [[Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems|POLES]]).

===Factors within an energy policy===

There are a number of elements that are naturally contained in a national energy policy, regardless of which of the above measures was used to arrive at the resultant policy.  The chief elements intrinsic to an energy policy are:

* What is the extent of energy self-sufficiency for this nation
* Where future energy sources will derive
* How future energy will be consumed (e.g. among sectors)
* What fraction of the population will be acceptable to endure [[energy poverty]]
* What are the goals for future [[energy intensity]], ratio of energy consumed to [[GDP]]
* What is the reliability standard for distribution reliability
* What environmental externalities are acceptable and are forecast
* What form of "portable energy" is forecast (e.g. sources of fuel for motor vehicles)
* How will energy efficient hardware (e.g. hybrid vehicles, household appliances) be encouraged
* How can the national policy drive province, state and municipal functions
* What specific mechanisms (e.g. taxes, incentives, manufacturing standards) are in place to implement the total policy
* What future consequences there will be for national security and foreign policy&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Michael S. 2013. ''Energy Policy Analysis: A Conceptual Framework''. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State, province or municipal energy policy==

Even within a state it is proper to talk about energy policies in [[plural]]. Influential entities, such as [[municipality|municipal]] or regional governments and energy industries, will each exercise  policy. Policy measures available to these entities are lesser in [[sovereignty]], but may be equally important to national measures.  In fact, there are certain activities vital to energy policy which realistically cannot be administered at the national level, such as monitoring [[energy conservation]] practices in the process of building construction, which is normally controlled by state-regional and municipal [[building code]]s (although can appear [[wiktionary:basic|basic]] federal legislation).

==Americas==

===Brazil===

{{Main article|Energy policy of Brazil}}

[[Brazil]] is the 10th largest [[energy]] consumer in the world and the largest in [[South America]]. At the same time, it is an important [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] producer in the region and the world's second largest [[ethanol fuel]] producer. The governmental agencies responsible for energy policy are the [[Ministry of Mines and Energy (Brazil)|Ministry of Mines and Energy]] (MME), the [[National Council for Energy Policy]] (CNPE, in the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-language]] acronym), the [[National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (Brazil)|National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels]] (ANP) and the [[Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency|National Agency of Electricity]] (ANEEL).&lt;ref name=weo1&gt;[[International Energy Agency|IEA]].

===Canada===

{{Main article|Energy policy of Canada}}

=== United States  ===
Currently, the major issues in U.S. energy policy revolve around the rapidly growing production of domestic and other North American energy resources. The U.S. drive toward energy independence and less reliance on oil and coal is fraught with partisan conflict because these issues revolve around how best to balance both competing values, such as environmental protection and economic growth, and the demands of rival organized interests, such as those of the fossil fuel industry and of the newer renewable energy businesses. {{Main article|Energy policy of the United States}}

==Europe==

===European Union===
{{Main article|Energy policy of the European Union}}

Although the [[European Union]] has legislated, set targets, and negotiated internationally in the area of energy policy for many years, and evolved out of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], the concept of introducing a mandatory common European Union energy policy was only approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] on October 27, 2005 in [[London]]. Following this the first policy proposals, ''Energy for a Changing World'', were published by the [[European Commission]], on January 10, 2007. The most well known energy policy objectives in the EU are 20/20/20 objectives, binding for all EU Member States. The EU is planning to increase the share of renewable energy in its final energy use to 20%, reduce greenhouse gases by 20% and increase energy efficiency by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obrecht|first1=Matevz|last2=Denac|first2=Matjaz|title=A sustainable energy policy for Slovenia : considering the potential of renewables and investment costs|journal=Journal of renewable and sustainable energy|date=2013|volume=5|issue=3|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jrse/5/3/10.1063/1.4811283 | doi = 10.1063/1.4811283|pages=032301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
{{main article|Energiewende in Germany}}

In September 2010, the German government adopted a set of ambitious goals to transform their national energy system and to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95% by 2050 (relative to 1990).&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{Main article|Energy policy of the United Kingdom}}

The [[energy policy of the United Kingdom]] has achieved success in reducing [[energy intensity]] (but still really high), reducing energy poverty, and maintaining energy supply reliability to date.{{when|date=September 2016}}  The United Kingdom has an ambitious goal to reduce [[carbon dioxide emissions]] for future years, but it is unclear whether the programs in place are sufficient to achieve this objective (the way to be so efficient as France is still hard).  Regarding energy self sufficiency, the United Kingdom policy does not address this issue, other than to concede historic [[energy self sufficiency]] is currently ceasing to exist (due to the decline of the [[North Sea oil]] production).  With regard to transport, the United Kingdom historically has a good policy record encouraging [[public transport]] links with cities, despite encountering problems with high speed trains, which have the potential to reduce dramatically domestic and short-haul European flights. The policy does not, however, significantly encourage [[hybrid vehicle]] use or [[ethanol fuel]] use, options which represent viable short term means to moderate rising transport fuel consumption.  Regarding [[renewable energy]], the United Kingdom has goals for [[wind energy|wind]] and [[tidal energy]].  The White Paper on Energy, 2007, set the target that 20% of the UK's energy must come from renewable sources by 2020.

===The Soviet Union and Russia===
{{Main article|Energy policy of the Soviet Union|Energy policy of Russia}}
The [[Soviet Union]] was the largest energy provider in the world until the late 1980s. [[Russia]], one of the world's [[energy superpower]]s, is rich in natural energy resources, the world’s leading net energy exporter, and a major supplier to the [[European Union]]. The main document defining the [[energy policy of Russia]] is the Energy Strategy, which initially set out policy for the period up to 2020, later was reviewed, amended and prolonged up to 2030. While Russia has also signed and ratified the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Numerous scholars note that Russia uses its energy exports as a foreign policy instrument towards other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Baran, Z. (2007).

==Asia==

===China===
{{Main article|Energy policy of China}}

===India===
{{Main article|Energy policy of India}}

The energy policy of [[India]] is characterized by trades between four major drivers:
* Rapidly growing economy, with a need for dependable and reliable supply of electricity, gas, and petroleum products;
* Increasing household incomes, with a need for affordable and adequate supply of electricity, and clean cooking fuels;
* Limited domestic reserves of [[fossil fuel]]s, and the need to import a vast fraction of the gas, crude oil, and petroleum product requirements, and recently the need to import coal as well; and
* Indoor, urban and regional environmental impacts, necessitating the need for the adoption of cleaner fuels and cleaner technologies.

In recent years, these challenges have led to a major set of continuing reforms, restructuring and a focus on [[energy conservation]].

===Thailand===

{{Main article|Energy Industry Liberalization and Privatization (Thailand)}}

The [[Energy Industry Liberalization and Privatization (Thailand)|energy policy of Thailand]] is characterized by 1) increasing energy consumption efficiency, 2) increasing domestic energy production, 3) increasing the private sector's role in the energy sector, 4) increasing the role of market mechanisms in setting energy prices.  These policies have been consistent since the 1990s, despite various changes in governments.  The pace and form of industry liberalization and privatization has been highly controversial.

===Bangladesh===
{{Main article|Energy policy of Bangladesh}}
The first National Energy Policy (NEP) of Bangladesh was formulated in 1996 by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral resources to ensure proper exploration, production, distribution and rational use of energy resources to meet the growing energy demands of different zones, consuming sectors and consumers groups on a sustainable basis.[1] With rapid change of global as well as domestic situation, the policy was updated in 2004. The updated policy included additional objectives namely to ensure environmentally sound sustainable energy development programmes causing minimum damage to environment, to encourage public and private sector participation in the development and management of energy sector and to bring the entire country under electrification by the year 2020.[2]

==Oceania==

===Australia===
{{Main article|Energy policy of Australia}}

Australia's energy policy features a combination of [[coal]] power stations and [[hydro electricity]] plants. The Australian government has decided not to build [[nuclear power]] plants, although it is one of the world's largest producers of uranium.

An '''extragalactic planet''', also known as an '''extragalactic [[exoplanet]]''', is a [[star]]-bound [[planet]], or [[rogue planet]], located outside of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. Due to the huge distances to such worlds, they would be very hard to detect directly. However, indirect evidence suggests that such planets may exist.&lt;ref name="ARX-20180202"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dai |first1=Xinyu |last2= Guerras |first2=Eduardo |title=Probing Planets in Extragalactic Galaxies Using Quasar Microlensing  |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=853 |issue=2 |pages=L27 |date=2 February 2018 |arxiv=1802.00049|bibcode=2018ApJ...853L..27D|doi=10.3847/2041-8213/aaa5fb }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NG-20180205"&gt;{{cite web |last=Zachos |first=Elaine |title=More Than a Trillion Planets Could Exist Beyond Our Galaxy - A new study gives the first evidence that exoplanets exist beyond the Milky Way. |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/exoplanets-discovery-milky-way-galaxy-spd/ |date=5 February 2018 |work=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=5 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GZM-20180205"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mandelbaum |first=Ryan F. |title=Scientists Find Evidence of Thousands of Planets in Distant Galaxy |url=https://gizmodo.com/scientists-find-evidence-of-thousands-of-planets-in-dis-1822727151 |date=5 February 2018 |work=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=5 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the most distant known planets are [[SWEEPS-11]] and [[SWEEPS-04]], located in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], approximately 27,710 light-years from the Sun, while the Milky Way is between 100,000–180,000 light years in diameter. This means that even galactic planets located further than that distance have not been detected.

==HIP 13044 b==
A planet with a mass of at least 1.25 times that of [[Jupiter]] had been potentially discovered by the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO) orbiting a star of extragalactic origin, even though the star now has been absorbed by our own galaxy. [[HIP 13044]] is a star about 2,000 light years away in the southern constellation of [[Fornax]],&lt;ref name="eso"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1045/|title=Planet from another galaxy discovered|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=ESO Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Helmi stream]] [[List of stellar streams|of stars]], a leftover remnant of a small galaxy that collided with and was absorbed by the Milky Way over 6 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Klement2010 /&gt; 

However, subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the potential planetary detection: for example an erroneous barycentric correction had been applied (the same error had also led to claims of planets around [[HIP 11952]] that were subsequently refuted). After applying the corrections, there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the star.&lt;ref name="JonesJenkins2014"/&gt; If it had been real, the Jupiter-like planet would have been particularly interesting, orbiting a star nearing the end of its life and seemingly about to be engulfed by it, potentially providing an observational model for the fate of our own planetary system in the distant future.

==Twin Quasar-related planet==
A microlensing event in the [[Twin Quasar]] [[gravitational lens]]ing system was observed in 1996, by [[Rudolph Schild|R. E. Schild]], in the "A" lobe of the lensed quasar. It is predicted that a 3-Earth-mass planet in the lensing galaxy, [[YGKOW G1]], caused the event. This was the first extragalactic planet candidate announced. This, however, is not a repeatable observation, as it was a one-time chance alignment. This predicted planet lies 4 billion light years away.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist (issue 2037), [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15120372.600-science--do-alien-worlds-throng-faraway-galaxy/ Do alien worlds throng faraway galaxy?] ''Govert Schilling'' 06 July 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extrasolar Visions, [http://www.extrasolar.net/planettour.asp?PlanetID=74 "The Q0957+561 Planet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330100014/http://www.extrasolar.net/planettour.asp?PlanetID=74 |date=2012-03-30 }} (accessed 1 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Andromeda galaxy planets==
A team of scientists has used gravitational microlensing to come up with a tentative detection of an extragalactic exoplanet in [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]], our nearest large galactic neighbor. The lensing pattern fits a star with a smaller companion, [[PA-99-N2]], weighing just around 6.34 times the mass of Jupiter.

'''Fern sports''' are plants that show marked change from the normal type or parent stock as a result of mutation. The term [[Morphotype]] is also used for any of a group of different types of individuals of the same species in a population. Fern [[frond]]s in sports are typically altered in several ways, such as the frond apex divided and [[Pinnate|pinna]]e similarly duplicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardenseeker.com/roses/rose-plant-sports.htm Plants Sports] Retrieved : 2011-07-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==

A. Boyd's Pteridomania] Retrieved : 2011-07-22&lt;/ref&gt; Scaly Male Fern [[Dryopteris affinis]] and Male Fern [[Dryopteris filix-mas]] have a number of commercially available and naturally occurring sports or subspecies. Examples are ''D. affinis polydactyla Dadds'', ''A. filix-femina plumosum'', ''A. filix-femina corymbiferum'', and ''D. filix-mas Barnesii''   &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hardyferns.com/dbase.asp Hardy Ferns] Retrieved : 2011-07-23&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Characteristics==
The frond of a sport may be branched at the tip and at the tips of the pinna, the colour may vary, and variegation may occur; fronds generally remain bilaterally symmetrical. Ferns sports remain normal in certain respects, such as viability with [[Sorus|sori]] and [[Indusium|indusia]] appearing normal. The frond stipe may be a different colour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferns.rogergolding.co.uk/ferngenus/athyrium/filixfemina.html Male Fern] Retrieved : 2011-07-23&lt;/ref&gt;

;Misidentification
[[File:Fern sports - insect damage.jpg|200px|thumb|Typical asymmetric frond resulting from likely insect damage.]]
Galls on ferns and other physical damage to fern fronds can be mistaken as sports, however this is usually asymmetric, ferns generally being bilaterally symmetrical. In ''Athyrium'' and ''Dryopteris'' species white maggots of ''Chirosia betuleti'' create mop-head galls on fern frond tips that look somewhat like fern sports, however this is physical damage and not a growth form.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, Page 288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rarity==
Ferns sports particularly suffered during the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] [[Pteridomania]] ('Fern-Fever') [[Social mania|craze]], when over collecting of fern species included over collecting unusual fern varieties.&lt;ref name="boyd"/&gt;

[[File:Gondwana 420 Ma.png|thumb|Gondwana 420 million years ago. View centered on the South Pole.]]
'''Gondwana''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ɡ|ɒ|n|d|ˈ|w|ɑː|n|ə}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gondwana|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gondwana|website= [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]]|publisher= Lexico Publishing Group|access-date=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Gondwanaland''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Gondwanaland|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gondwana|publisher=[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]]|access-date=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[supercontinent]] that existed from the [[Neoproterozoic]] (about 550 million years ago) until the [[Carboniferous]] (about 320 million years ago). It was formed by the [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] of several [[craton]]s. Eventually, Gondwana became the largest piece of [[continental crust]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era, covering an area of about {{Convert|100,000,000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Carboniferous, it merged with [[Euramerica]] to form a larger supercontinent called [[Pangaea]]. Gondwana (and Pangaea) gradually broke up during the [[Mesozoic]] Era. The remnants of Gondwana make up about two-thirds of today's continental area, including [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Antarctica]], [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], and the [[Indian Subcontinent]].

The formation of Gondwana began {{Circa}}&amp;nbsp;{{Ma|800|650|{{Abbr|Ma|million years ago}}}} with the [[East African Orogeny]]&amp;nbsp;– the collision of India and Madagascar with East Africa&amp;nbsp;– and was completed {{Circa}} {{Ma|600|530|Ma}} with the overlapping [[Brasiliano orogeny|Brasiliano]] and [[Kuunga orogeny|Kuunga]] orogenies&amp;nbsp;– the collision of South America with Africa and the addition of Australia and Antarctica, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|Van Der Voo|1997|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of concept==
The continent of Gondwana was named by Austrian scientist [[Eduard Suess]], after the [[Gondwana (India)|Gondwana region]] of central [[India]] which is derived from [[Sanskrit]] for "forest of the [[Gondi people|Gonds]]". The name had been previously used in a geological context, first by [[Henry Benedict Medlicott|H.B. Medlicott]] in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suess|1885|p=768}}: [https://archive.org/stream/dasantlitzderer02suesgoog#page/n760/mode/1up "Wir nennen es Gondwána-Land, nach der gemeinsamen alten Gondwána-Flora, … " (We name it Gondwána-Land, after the common ancient flora of Gondwána …)]&lt;/ref&gt; from which the Gondwana sedimentary sequences ([[Permian]]-[[Triassic]]) are also described.
The term "Gondwanaland" is preferred by some scientists in order to make a clear distinction between the region and the supercontinent.&lt;ref name="McL-2001-p272"&gt;{{Harvnb|McLoughlin|2001|loc=Gondwana or Gondwanaland?, pp. 272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:Kuunga2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Eastern Gondwana.  {{Ma|620|550|Ma}} post-collisional extension of the East African Orogeny in blue and {{Ma|570|530|Ma}} collisional metamorphism of the Kuunga orogeny in red.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|2003|loc=Fig. 10, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The assembly of Gondwana was a protracted process  during the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic, which however remains incompletely understood because of the lack of paleo-magnetic data.  Several [[Orogeny|orogenies]], collectively known as the [[Pan-African orogeny]], led to the amalgamation of most of the continental fragments of a much older supercontinent, [[Rodinia]].  One of those orogenic belts, the [[Mozambique Belt]], formed {{Ma|800|650|Ma}} and was originally interpreted as the [[Suture (geology)|suture]] between East (India, Madagascar, Antarctica, and Australia) and West Gondwana (Africa and South America). Three orogenies were recognized during the 1990s: the [[East African Orogeny]] ({{Ma|650|800|Ma}}) and [[Kuunga orogeny]] (including the [[Malagasy Orogeny]] in southern Madagascar) ({{Ma|550|Ma}}) – the collision between East Gondwana and East Africa in two steps, and the [[Brasiliano orogeny]] ({{Ma|660|530|Ma}}) – the succesive collision between South American and African [[craton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|Van Der Voo|1997|loc=Introduction, pp. 223–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stages of Gondwanan assembly overlapped with the opening of the [[Iapetus Ocean]] between [[Laurentia]] and western Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miashita|Yamamoto|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this interval, the [[Cambrian explosion]] occurred.
Laurentia was docked against the western shores of a united Gondwana for a short period near the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary, forming the short-lived and still disputed supercontinent [[Pannotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|Van Der Voo|1997|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mozambique Ocean]] separated the [[Congo Craton|Congo]]–[[Tanzania Craton|Tanzania]]–[[Bangweulu Block]] of central Africa from Neoproterozoic India (India, the [[Antongil]] Block in far eastern Madagascar, the [[Seychelles]], and the Napier and Rayner Complexes in [[East Antarctica]]). The [[Azania]] continent&lt;ref&gt;Defined but not named in {{Harvnb|Collins|Pisarevsky|2005}}: "Azania" was a Greek name for the East African coast&lt;/ref&gt; (much of central [[Madagascar]], the [[Horn of Africa]] and parts of [[Yemen]] and Arabia) was an island in the Mozambique Ocean.

The Australia/[[East Antarctic Shield|Mawson]] continent was still separated from India, eastern Africa, and Kalahari by {{Circa}} {{Ma|600|Ma}}, when most of western Gondwana had already been amalgamated. By {{Circa}} 550&amp;nbsp;Ma, India had reached its Gondwanan position, which initiated the Kuunga orogeny (also known as the Pinjarra orogeny). Meanwhile, on the other side of the newly forming Africa, Kalahari collided with Congo and Rio de la Plata which closed the [[Adamastor Ocean]].  {{Circa}} 540–530&amp;nbsp;Ma, the closure of the Mozambique Ocean brought India next to Australia–East Antarctica, and both North and South China were located in proximity to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|Bogdanova|Collins|Davidson|2008|loc=The birth of Gondwanaland (600–530 Ma), p. 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Positions of ancient continents, 550 million years ago.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Plate reconstruction|Reconstruction]] showing final stages of assembly of Gondwana, 550 Mya]]
As the rest of Gondwana formed, a complex series of orogenic events assembled the eastern parts of Gondwana (eastern Africa, Arabian-Nubian Shield, Seychelles, Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, East Antarctica, and Australia) {{Circa}} {{Ma|750|530|Ma}}. First the Arabian-Nubian Shield collided with eastern Africa (in the Kenya-Tanzania region) in the [[East African Orogeny]] {{Circa}}{{Ma|750|620|Ma}}. Then Australia and East Antarctica were merged with the remaining Gondwana {{Circa}} {{Ma|570|530|Ma}} in the [[Kuunga Orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|2003|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later Malagasy orogeny at about 550–515&amp;nbsp;Mya affected Madagascar, eastern East Africa and southern India. In it, Neoproterozoic India collided with the already combined Azania and Congo–Tanzania–Bangweulu Block, suturing along the [[Mozambique Belt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grantham|Maboko|Eglington|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Convert|18000|km|abbr=on}}-long [[Terra Australis Orogen]] developed along Gondwana's western, southern, and eastern margins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cawood|2005|loc=Definition and Tectonic Framework, pp. 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Proto-Gondwanan Cambrian arc belts from this margin have been found in eastern Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Antarctica.  Though these belts formed a continuous arc chain, the direction of subduction was different between the Australian-Tasmanian and New Zealand-Antarctica arc segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Münker|Crawford|2000|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peri-Gondwana development: Paleozoic rifts and accretions ==
A large number of terranes were accreted to Eurasia during Gondwana's existence but the Cambrian or Precambrian origin of many of these terranes remains uncertain.  For example, some Palaeozoic terranes and microcontinents that now make up Central Asia, often called the "Kazakh" and "Mongolian terranes", were progressively amalgamated into the continent [[Kazakhstania]] in the Late Silurian.  Whether these blocks originated on the shores of Gondwana is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=Marginal microcontinents and terranes, p. 1008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Early Palaeozoic the [[Armorican terrane]], which today form large parts of France, was part of either Peri-Gondwana or core Gondwana; the Rheic Ocean closed in front of it and the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean opened behind it.  Precambrian rocks from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] suggest it too probably formed part of core Gondwana before its detachment as an [[orocline]] in the [[Variscan orogeny]] close to the Carboniferous–Permian boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=Southern Europe, pp. 1008–1009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South-east Asia is made of Gondwanan and [[Cathaysia]]n continental fragments that were assembled during the Mid-Palaeozoic and Cenozoic.  This process can be divided into three phases of rifting along Gondwana's northern margin: firstly, in the Devonian, [[North China (continent)|North]] and [[South China (continent)|South China]], together with [[Tarim Block|Tarim]] and [[Quidam terrane|Quidam]] (north-western China) rifted, opening the Palaeo-Tethys behind them.  These terranes accreted to Asia during Late Devonian and Permian.  Secondly, in the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian, [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmerian terranes]] opened Meso-Tethys Ocean; [[Sibumasu]] and [[Qiantang terrane|Qiantang]] were added to south-east Asia during Late Permian and Early Jurassic.  Thirdly, in the Late Triassic to Late Jurassic, [[Lhasa terrane|Lhasa]], [[West Burma]], [[Woyla]] terranes opened the Neo-Tethys Ocean; Lhasa collided with Asia during the Early Cretaceous, and West Burma and Woyla during the Late Cretaceous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLoughlin|2001|loc=Cimmerian terranes, p. 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gondwana's long, northern margin had remained a mostly passive margin throughout the Palaeozoic.  The Early Permian opening of the Neo-Tethys Ocean along this margin produced a long series of terranes, many of which were and still are being deformed in the [[Geology of the Himalaya|Himalaya Orogeny]].  From Turkey to north-eastern India: the Taurides in southern Turkey; the Lesser Caucasus Terrane in Georgia; the Sanand, Alborz, and Lut terranes in Iran; the Mangysglak or Kopetdag Terrane in the Caspian Sea; the Afghan Terrane; the Karakorum Terrane in northern Pakistan; and the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in Tibet.  The Permian–Triassic widening of the Neo-Tethys pushed all these terranes across the Equator and over to Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=South-central and eastern Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southwestern accretions===
During the Neoproterozoic to Palaeozoic phase of the [[Terra Australis Orogen]] a series of terranes were rafted from the proto-Andean margin when the Iapteus Ocean opened, to be added back to Gondwana during the closure of that ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cawood|2005|loc=Peri-Gondwanan continental basement assemblages, pp. 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the paleozoic somne blocks which helped to form parts of the [[Southern Cone]] of South America, include a piece transferred from Laurentia when the west edge of Gondwana scraped against southeast Laurentia in the [[Ordovician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rapalini|2001}}; {{Harvnb|Rapalini|1998|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the [[Cuyania]] or Precordillera [[terrane]] of the [[Famatinian orogeny]] in northwest Argentina which may have continued the line of the [[Appalachians]] southwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalla Salda|de Luchi|Cingolani|Varela|1998|loc=Abstract}}; {{Harvnb|Vujovich|van Staal|Davis|2004|loc=Conclusions, p. 1053}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chilenia]] terrane accreted later against Cuyania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=V.A.|author-link=Víctor Alberto Ramos |last2=Jordan |first2=T.E.|last3=Allmendinger |first3=R.W.|last4=Mpodozis |first4=C.|author-link4=Constantino Mpodozis|last5=Kay |first5=S.M.|last6=Cortés |first6=J.M. |last7=Palma |first7=M. |date=October 1986 |title=Paleozoic terranes of the central Argentina-Chilean Andes |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Victor_Ramos8/publication/252991522_Paleozoic_Terranes_of_the_Central_Argentine-Chilean_Andes/links/02e7e524d832ecca1b000000.pdf |journal=Tectonics |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=855–880 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collision of the Patagonian terrane with the southwestern Gondwanan occurred in the late Paleozoic.

==Gondwana as part of Pangaea: Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic==
[[File:Laurasia-Gondwana.svg|thumb|Gondwana formed part of Pangaea for {{Circa}} 150&amp;nbsp;Ma&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|Bogdanova|Collins|Davidson|2008|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Pangaea}}
Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] formed the Pangaea supercontinent during the Carboniferous.  Pangaea began to break up in the Mid-Jurassic when the [[Central Atlantic magmatic province|Central Atlantic opened]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Van Der Voo|2002|loc=Data selection and reconstruction fits, p. 772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the western end of Pangaea, the collision between Gondwana and Laurasia closed the [[Rheic Ocean|Rheic]] and [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Palaeo-Tethys]] oceans.  The obliquity of this closure resulted in the docking of some northern terranes in the [[Marathon Uplift|Marathon]], [[Ouachita orogeny|Ouachita]], [[Alleghanian orogeny|Alleghanian]], and [[Variscan orogeny|Variscan]] orogenies, respectively.  Southern terranes, such as [[Chortis Block|Chortis]] and [[Oaxaca Terrane|Oaxaca]], on the other hand, remained largely unaffected by the collision along the southern shores of Laurentia.  Some Peri-Gondwanan terranes, such as [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and [[Florida]], were buffered from collisions by major promontories.  Other terranes, such as [[Carolina terrane|Carolina]] and [[Meguma terrane|Meguma]], were directly involved in the collision.  The final collision resulted in the Variscan-[[Appalachian Mountains]], stretching from present-day Mexico to southern Europe. Meanwhile, [[Baltica]] collided with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstania]] which resulted in the [[Uralian orogeny]] and [[Laurasia]].  Pangaea was finally amalgamated in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian, but the oblique forces continued until Pangaea began to rift in the Triassic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blakey|2003|loc=Assembly of Western Pangaea: Carboniferous–Permian, pp. 453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eastern end collisions occurred slightly later.  The [[North China Craton|North China]], [[South China Craton|South China]], and [[Indochina Block|Indochina]] blocks rifted from Gondwana during the middle Paleozoic and opened the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]].  North China docked with Mongolia and Siberia during the Carboniferous–Permian, followed by South China.  The [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmerian]] blocks then rifted from Gondwana to form the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Palaeo-Thethys]] and [[Tethys Ocean|Neo-Tethys]] oceans in the Late Carboniferous, and docked with Asia during the Triassic and Jurassic.  Western Pangaea began to rift while the eastern end was still being assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blakey|2003|loc=Assembly of Eastern Pangaea: Late Permian–Jurassic, p. 454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of Pangaea and its mountains had a tremendous impact on global climate and sea levels, which resulted in glaciations and continent-wide sedimentation.  In North America, the base of the [[Absaroka sequence]] coincides with the Alleghanian and Ouachita orogenies and are indicative of a large-scale change in the mode of deposition far away from the Pangaean orogenies.  Ultimately, these changes contributed to the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] and left large deposits of hydrocarbons, coal, evaporite, and metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blakey|2003|loc=Summary: significance of Pangaean events, pp. 454–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break-up of Pangaea began with the [[Central Atlantic magmatic province]] (CAMP) between South America, Africa, North America, and Europe.  CAMP covered more than seven million square kilometres over a few million years, reached its peak at {{Circa}} {{Ma|200|Ma}}, and coincided with the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marzoli|Renne|Piccirillo|Ernesto|1999|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reformed Gondwanan continent was not precisely the same as that which had existed before Pangaea formed; for example, most of [[Florida]] and southern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]] is underlain by rocks that were originally part of Gondwana, but this region stayed attached to North America when the [[Atlantic Ocean#Central Atlantic|Central Atlantic opened]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Gondwana Remnants in Alabama And Georgia: Uchee Is An 'Exotic' Peri-Gondwanan Arc Terrane, Not Part Of Laurentia | publisher = ScienceDaily | date = February 4, 2008 | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080204212810.htm | access-date=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Break-up==
===Mesozoic===
Antarctica, the centre of the supercontinent, shared boundaries with all other Gondwana continents and the fragmentation of Gondwana propagated clockwise around it.

Gondwana began to break up in the early [[Jurassic]] following the extensive and fast emplacement of the [[Karoo-Ferrar]] [[flood basalt]]s {{Circa}} {{Ma|184|Ma}}.  Before the Karoo plume initiated rifting between Africa and Antarctica, it separated a series of smaller continental blocks from Gondwana's southern, Proto-Pacific margin (along what is now the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]): the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], [[Marie Byrd Land]], [[Zealandia]], and [[Thurston Island]]; the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[Ellsworth–Whitmore Mountains]] (in Antarctica) were rotated 90° in opposite directions; and South America south of the [[Gastre Fault]] (often referred to as [[Tectonic evolution of Patagonia|Patagonia]]) was pushed westward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Encarnación|Fleming|Elliot|Eales|1996|loc=Early rifting and Gondwana breakup, pp. 537–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the Africa-Antarctica break-up can be studied in great detail in the fracture zones and magnetic anomalies flanking the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Royer|Patriat|Bergh|Scotese|1988|loc=Figg. 7 a–j, pp. 248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Madagascar block and the [[Mascarene Plateau]], stretching from the [[Seychelles]] to [[Réunion]], were broken off India; elements of this breakup nearly coincide with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. The India–Madagascar–Seychelles separations appear to coincide with the eruption of the [[Deccan Traps|Deccan basalts]], whose eruption site may survive as the [[Réunion hotspot]].  The Seychelles and the [[Maldives]] are now separated by the [[Central Indian Ridge]].

During the initial break-up in the Early Jurassic a [[transgression (geology)|marine transgression]] swept over the [[Horn of Africa]] covering Triassic [[planation surface]]s with [[sandstone]], [[limestone]], [[shale]], [[marl]]s and [[evaporite]]s.&lt;ref name=Abbate2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbate |first=Ernesto|last2=Bruni |first2=Piero|last3=Sagri |first3=Mario |date=2015|editor-last=Billi|editor-first=Paolo |title=Landscapes and Landforms of Ethiopia |chapter=Geology of Ethiopia: A Review and Geomorphological Perspectives|series=World Geomorphological Landscapes |location= |publisher= |pages=33–64 |isbn=978-94-017-8026-1 |author-link= |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-8026-1_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coltortietal2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coltorti |first1=M. |last2=Dramis |first2=F.|last3=Ollier |first3=C.D.|author-link3=Cliff Ollier |date=2007 |title=Planation surfaces in Northern Ethiopia |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=89 |issue= |pages=287–296 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The [[Atlantic Ocean#South Atlantic|opening of the South Atlantic Ocean]] divided West Gondwana (South America and Africa), but there is a considerable debate over the exact timing of this break-up.  Rifting propagated from south to north along Triassic–Early Jurassic lineaments, but intra-continental rifts also began to develop within both continents in Jurassic–Cretaceous sedimentary basins; subdividing each continent into three sub-plates.  Rifting began {{Circa}} {{Ma|190|Ma}} at Falkland latitudes, forcing Patagonia to move relative to the still static remainder of South America and Africa, and this westward movement lasted until the Early Cretaceous {{Ma|126.7|Ma}}.  From there rifting propagated northward during the Late Jurassic {{Circa}} {{Ma|150|Ma}} or Early Cretaceous {{Circa}} {{Ma|140|Ma}} most likely forcing dextral movements between sub-plates on either side.  South of the [[Walvis Ridge]] and [[Rio Grande Rise]] the [[Paraná and Etendeka traps|Paraná and Etendeka magmatics]] resulted in further ocean-floor spreading {{Circa}} {{Ma|130|135|Ma}} and the development of rifts systems on both continents, including the [[West and Central African Rift System|Central African Rift System]] and the [[Central African Shear Zone]] which lasted until {{Circa}} {{Ma|85|Ma}}.  At Brazilian latitudes spreading is more difficult to assess because of the lack of palaeo-magnetic data, but rifting occurred in Nigeria at the [[Benue Trough]] {{Circa}} {{Ma|118|Ma}}.  North of the Equator the rifting began after {{Ma|120.4|Ma}} and continued until {{Circa}} {{Ma|100|96|Ma}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|Müller|Zahirovic|Gaina|2012|loc=South Atlantic, pp. 217–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early Andean orogeny====
The first phases of [[Andean orogeny]] in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Early Cretaceous]] were characterized by [[extensional tectonics]], [[rift]]ing, the development of [[back-arc basin]]s and the emplacement of large [[batholith]]s.&lt;ref name=Ramosmemoir2009&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramos|2009|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46&gt;{{Harvnb|Charrier|Pinto|Rodríguez|2006|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is presumed to have been linked to the subduction of cold [[oceanic crust|oceanic]] [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt; During the mid to [[Late Cretaceous]] (ca. 90 million years ago) the Andean orogeny changed significantly in character.&lt;ref name=Ramosmemoir2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt; Warmer and younger oceanic lithosphere is believed to have started to be subducted beneath South America around this time. Such kind of subduction is held responsible not only for the intense contractional [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] that different lithologies were subject to, but also the [[mountain building|uplift]] and [[erosion]] known to have occurred from the Late Cretaceous onward.&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt; [[Plate tectonics|Plate tectonic]] reorganization since the mid-Cretaceous might also have been linked to the [[rift|opening]] of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Ramosmemoir2009/&gt; Another change related to mid-Cretaceous plate tectonic changes was the change of subduction direction of the oceanic lithosphere that went from having south-east motion to having a north-east motion at about 90 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Hoffmannetal2006&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoffmann-Rothe|Kukowski|Dresen|Echtler|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While subduction direction changed it remained oblique (and not perpendicular) to the coast of South America, and the direction change affected several [[subduction|subduction zone]]-parallel faults including [[Atacama Fault|Atacama]], [[Domeyko Fault|Domeyko]] and [[Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault|Liquiñe-Ofqui]].&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffmannetal2006/&gt;

===Cenozoic===
The [[Indian subcontinent]] began to collide with Asia {{Circa}} {{Ma|70|Ma}} since when more than {{Convert|1400|km|abbr=on}} of crust has been absorbed by the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]]-[[Tibet]]an orogen.  During the Cenozoic the orogen resulted in the construction of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] between the Tethyan Himalayas in the south and the [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]] and [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] mountains in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yin|Harrison|2000|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, South America was connected to North America via the [[Isthmus of Panama]], cutting off a circulation of warm water and thereby making the [[Arctic]] colder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luyendyk|Forsyth|Phillips|1972|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as allowing the [[Great American Interchange]].

The breakup of Gondwana can be said to continue in eastern Africa at the [[Afar Triple Junction]], which separates the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]], [[Nubian Plate|Nubian]], and [[Somali Plate|Somali]] plates, resulting in rifting in the [[Red Sea]] and [[East African Rift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jestin|Huchon|Gaulier|1994|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia–Antarctica separation====
In the Early [[Cenozoic]] Australia was still connected to Antarctica {{Circa}} 35–40° south of its current location and both continents were largely unglaciated.  A rift between the two developed but remained an embayment until the Eocene-Oligocene boundary when the Circumpolar Current developed and the glaciation of Antarctica began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|2006|loc=Palaeogeography, pp. 538–539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia was warm and wet during the Palaeocene and dominated by rainforest.  The opening of the Tasman Gateway at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary ({{Ma|33|Ma}}) resulted in abrupt cooling but the Oligocene became a period of high rainfall with swamps in southeast Australia.  During the Miocene a warm and humid climate developed with pockets of rainforests in central Australia but before the end of the period colder and drier climate severely reduced this rainforest.  A brief period of increased rainfall in the Pliocene was followed by drier climate which favoured grassland.  Since then the fluctuation between wet interglacial periods and dry glacial periods has developed into the present arid regime.  Australia has thus experienced various climate changes over a 15 million year period with a gradual decrease in precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|2006|loc=Conclusions, pp. 557–558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tasman Gateway between Australia and Antarctica began to open {{Circa}} {{Ma|40|30|Ma}}.  Palaeontological evidences indicate the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] (ACC) was established in the Late Oligocene {{Circa}} {{Ma|23|Ma}} with the full opening of the [[Drake Passage]] and the deepening of the Tasman Gateway.  The oldest oceanic crust in the Drake Passage, however, is {{Ma|34|29|Ma}}-old which indicates spreading between the Antarctic and South American plates began near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lagabrielle|Goddéris|Donnadieu|Malavieille|2009|loc=Timing of opening of the Drake Passage region, pp. 198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Deep sea environments in [[Tierra del Fuego]] and the [[North Scotia Ridge]] during the Eocene and Oligocene indicate a "Proto-ACC" opened during this period.  Later, {{Ma|26|14|Ma}}, a series of events severally restricted the Proto-ACC: change to shallow marine conditions along the North Scotia Ridge; closure of the Fuegan Seaway, the deep sea that existed in Tierra del Fuego; and uplift of the Patagonian Cordillera.  This, together with the reactivated [[Iceland plume]], contributed to global warming.  During the Miocene, the Drake Passage began to widen and as water flow between South America and the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] increased, the renewed ACC resulted in cooler global climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lagabrielle|Goddéris|Donnadieu|Malavieille|2009|loc=Conclusions, p. 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Eocene the northward movement of the Australian Plate has resulted in an [[arc-continent]] collision with the [[Philippine Sea Plate|Philippine]] and [[Caroline Plate|Caroline]] plates and the uplift of the [[New Guinea Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|Hall|2003|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the Oligocene to the late Miocene, the climate in Australia, dominated by warm and humid rainforests before this collision, began to alternate between open forest and rainforest before the continent became the arid or semiarid landscape it is today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Travouillon|Legendre|Archer|Hand|2009|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dryandra formosa-IMG 0335.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Banksia]]'', a [[Grevilleoideae|grevilleoid]] Proteaceae, is an example a plant with a Gondwanan distribution]]
The adjective "Gondwanan" is in common use in [[biogeography]] when referring to patterns of distribution of living organisms, typically when the organisms are restricted to two or more of the now-discontinuous regions that were once part of Gondwana, including the [[Antarctic flora]].&lt;ref name="McL-2001-p272" /&gt; For example, the plant family [[Proteaceae]], known from all continents in the Southern Hemisphere, has a "Gondwanan distribution" and is often described as an archaic, or [[relict]], lineage.  The distributions in Proteaceae is, nevertheless, the result of both Gondwanan rafting and later oceanic dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|Weston|Rutschmann|Sauquet|2007|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Cambrian diversification===
During the [[Silurian]] Gondwana extended from the Equator (Australia) to the South Pole (North Africa and South America) whilst Laurasia was located on the Equator opposite to Australia.  A short-lived [[Late Ordovician glaciation]] was followed by a Silurian [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|Hot House]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=SILURIAN: terrestrial life appears in the tropics, p. 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician extinction]], which resulted in 27% of marine invertebrate families and 57% of genera going extinct, occurred during this shift from Ice House to Hot House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=The First Extinction, p. 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the Ordovician ''[[Cooksonia]]'', a slender, ground-covering plant, became the first vascular plant to establish itself on land.  This first colonisation occurred exclusively around the Equator on landmasses then limited to Laurasia and, in Gondwana, to Australia.  In the Late Silurian two distinctive linages, [[Zosterophyllopsida|zosterophylls]] and [[Rhyniopsida|rhyniophytes]], had colonised the tropics.  The former evolved into the [[Lycopodiopsida|lycopods]], that were to dominate the Gondwanan vegetation over a long period, whilst the latter evolved into [[Equisetum|horsetails]] and [[gymnosperm]]s.  Most of Gondwana was located far from the Equator during this period and remained a lifeless and barren landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=The Silurian revolution, p. 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Gondwana drifted north during the [[Devonian]] which brought Gondwana and Laurasia close together.  Global cooling contributed to the [[Late Devonian extinction]] (19% of marine families and 50% of genera went extinct) and glaciation occurred in South America.  Before Pangaea had formed terrestrial plants, such as [[pteridophyte]]s, began to diversify rapidly resulting in the colonisation of Gondwana.  The [[Baragwanathia]] Flora, found only in the [[Yea Flora Fossil Site|Yea Beds]] of Victoria, Australia, occurs in two strata separated by {{Convert|1700|m|abbr=on}} or 30&amp;nbsp;Ma; the upper assemblage is more diverse and includes Baragwanathia, the first primitive [[herbaceous]] lycopod to evolve from the zosterophylls.  During the Devonian [[Lepidodendron|giant club mosses]] replaced the Baragwanathia Flora, introducing the first trees, and by the Late Devonian this first forest was accompanied by the [[progymnosperm]]s, including the first large trees ''[[Archaeopteris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=DEVONIAN: colonising Gondwana; The Second Extinction; Global colonisation of plants, pp. 151, 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Late Devonian extinction probably also resulted in [[Osteolepiformes|osteolepiform]] fishes [[Evolution of tetrapods|evolving into the amphibian tetrapods]], the earliest land vertebrates, in Greenland and Russia.  The only traces of this evolution in Gondwana are amphibian footprints and a single jaw from Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=Amphibian prelude, p. 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closure of the Rheic Ocean and the formation of Pangaea in the Carboniferous resulted in the rerouting of ocean currents which initiated an Ice House period.  As Gondwana began to rotate clockwise, Australia shifted south to more temperate latitudes.  An ice cap initially covered most of southern Africa and South America but began to spread to eventually cover most of the supercontinent, save for northern-most Africa-South America and eastern Australia.  Giant lycopod and horsetail forests continued to evolve in tropical Laurasia together with a diversified assemblage of true insects.  In Gondwana, in contrast, ice and, in Australia, volcanism decimated the Devonian flora to a low-diversity seed fern flora&amp;nbsp;– the pteridophytes were increasingly replaced by the gymnosperms which were to dominate until the Mid-Cretaceous.  Australia, however, was still located near the Equator during the Early Carboniferous and during this period [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyl]] and [[Lepospondyli|lepospondyl]] amphibians and the first [[amniote]] reptilians evolved, all closely related to the Laurasian fauna, but spreading ice eventually drove these animals away from Gondwana entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=CARBONIFEROUS: competing with ice, pp. 153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gondwana ice sheet melted and sea levels dropped during the Permian and Triassic global warming.  During this period, the extinct [[Glossopteridales|glossopterids]] colonised Gondwana and reached peak diversity in the Late Permian when coal-forming forests covered much of Gondwana.  The period also saw the evolution of [[Voltziales]]; one of the few plant orders to survive the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|end-Permian extinction]] (57% of marine families and 83% of genera went extinct) which came to dominate in the Late Permian and from whom true conifers evolved.  Tall lycopods and [[Equisetopsida|horsetails]] dominated the wetlands of Gondwana in the Early Permian.
Insects co-evolved with glossopterids across Gondwana and diversified with more than 200 species in 21 orders by the Late Permian, many known from South Africa and Australia.  Beetles and cockroaches remained minor elements in this fauna.  [[Tetrapod]] fossils from the Early Permian have only been found in Laurasia but they became common in Gondwana later during the Permian.  The arrival of the [[therapsid]]s resulted in the first plant-vertebrate-insect ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=PERMIAN: the glossopterid empire, pp. 153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern diversification===
During the Mid- to Late Triassic hot house conditions coincided with a peak in biodiversity&amp;nbsp;— the end-Permian extinction was enormous and so was the radiation that followed.  Two families of conifers, [[Podocarpaceae]] and [[Araucariaceae]], dominated Gondwana in the Early Triassic, but ''[[Dicroidium]]'', an extinct genus of fork-leaved seed ferns, dominated woodlands and forests of Gondwana during most of the Triassic.  Conifers evolved and radiated during the period with six of eight extant families already present before the end of it.  [[Bennettitales]] and [[Pentoxylales]], two now extinct orders of gymnospermous plants, evolved in the Late Triassic and became important in the Jurassic and Cretaceous.  It is possible that gymnosperm biodiversity surpassed later angiosperm biodiversity and that the evolution of angiosperms began during the Triassic but, if so, in Laurasia rather than in Gondwana.  Two Gondwanan classes, [[Lycopodiophyta|lycophytes]] and [[Equisetopsida|sphenophytes]], saw a gradual decline during the Triassic while ferns, though never dominant, managed to diversify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=TRIASSIC: the gymnosperm heyday, pp. 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brief ice house of the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]] had a dramatic impact on dinosaurs but left plants largely unaffected.  The Jurassic was mostly a hot house and while vertebrates managed to diversify in this environment, plants have left little evidence of such development, with the exception of [[Cheirolepidiaceae|Cheiroleidiacean]] conifers and [[Caytoniales]] and other groups of seed ferns.  In terms of biomass the Jurassic flora was dominated by conifers families and other gymnosperms that had evolved during the Triassic.  The [[Pteridophyte]]s, that had dominated during the Palaeozoic, were now marginalised, except for ferns.  In contrast to Laurentia, very few insect fossils have been found in Gondwana to a large extent because of widespread deserts and volcanism.  While plants had a cosmopolitan distribution, dinosaur evolved and diversified in a pattern that reflects  the Jurassic break-up of Panagaea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=JURASSIC: volcanism, conifers and bennettitaleans, pp. 156, 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cretaceous saw the arrival of the [[angiosperm]]s, or flowering plants, a group that probably evolved in western Gondwana (South America-Africa).  From there the angiosperms diversified in two stages: the [[Monocotyledon|monocots]] and [[magnoliids]] evolved in the Early Cretaceous followed by the [[Hamamelidaceae|hammamelid]] [[Dicotyledon|dicots]].  By the Mid-Cretaceous angiosperms constituted half of the flora in northeastern Australia.  There is, however, no obvious connection between this spectacular angiosperm radiation and an extinction event nor vertebrate/insect evolution.  Insect orders associated with pollination, such as [[beetle]]s, [[Fly|flies]], [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]], and [[Hymenoptera|wasps, bees, and ants]], radiated continuously from the Permian-Triassic long before the arrival of the angiosperms. Well-preserved insect fossils have been found in the lake deposits of the [[Santana Formation]] in Brazil, the [[Koonwarra, Victoria#Koonwarra fossil bed|Koonwarra Lake fauna]] in Australia, and the [[Orapa diamond mine]] in Botswana.&lt;ref name="And-Cretaceous"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=CRETACEOUS: of flowers and pollination, pp. 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dinosaurs continued to prosper but, as the angiosperm diversified, conifers, bennettitaleans and pentoxylaleans disappeared from Gondwana {{Circa}} 115&amp;nbsp;Ma together with the specialised herbivorous [[ornithischia]]ns whilst generalist browsers such as several families of [[Sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorph]] [[Saurischia]] prevailed.  The [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] killed off all dinosaurs except birds, but plant evolution in Gondwana was hardly affected by the event.&lt;ref name="And-Cretaceous" /&gt;
[[Gondwanatheria]] is an extinct group of non-[[theria]]n mammals with a Gondwanan distribution (South America, Africa, Madagascar, India, and Antarctica) during the Late Cretaceous and Palaeogene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gurovich|Beck|2009|loc=Introduction, pp. 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Xenarthra]] and [[Afrotheria]], two placental clades, are of Gondwanan origin and probably began to evolve separately {{Circa}} {{Ma|105|Ma}} when Africa and South America separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodburne|Rich|Springer|2003|loc=Gondwana and early mammal evolution, p. 375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nothofagus demis.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|The plant genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' illustrates Gondwanan distribution, having originated in the supercontinent and existing in present-day Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and South America's [[Southern Cone]]. Fossils have also recently been found in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|HaoMin|ZheKun|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[laurel forest]] of Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand have a number of other related species of the [[laurissilva]] de Valdivia, through the connection of the [[Antarctic flora]] as gymnosperms and deciduous angiosperm'' Nothofagus''. ''[[Corynocarpus laevigatus]]'' is called the bay of New Zealand, ''[[Laurelia novae-zelandiae]]'' belongs to the same genus ''[[Laurelia]]''. The sempervirens [[tree]] [[niaouli]] grows in Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand.  New Caledonia and New Zealand ecoregions became separated from Australia by [[continental drift]] 85 million years ago. The islands still retain plants that originated in Gondwana and spread to the Southern Hemisphere continents later. However, strong evidence exists of [[glaciation]] during the [[Carboniferous]] to [[Permian]] time, especially in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''Hemiboreal''' means halfway between the temperate and subarctic (or [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]]) zones. The term is most frequently used in the context of [[ecosystem]]s.

==Botany==
A hemiboreal forest has some characteristics of a boreal forest, and also shares features with temperate-zone forests to the south.  [[Coniferous]] trees predominate in the hemiboreal zone, but a significant number of [[deciduous]] species, such as [[aspen]]s, [[oak]]s, [[maple]]s, [[ash tree]]s, [[birch]]es, [[beech]]es, [[hazel]]s, and [[hornbeam]]s, also occur.

==Climate==
The term sometimes denotes the form of [[climate]] characteristic of the zone of hemiboreal forests&amp;mdash;specifically, the climates designated ''Dfb'', ''Dwb'' and ''Dsb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]] scheme.  On occasion, it is applied to all areas that have long, cold winters and warm (but not hot) summers&amp;mdash;including areas that are [[semiarid]] and [[arid]] based on average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].

==Examples==
Examples of locations with hemiboreal climates or ecosystems include: 
*Much of southern [[Canada]] (all of southeastern Canada except for parts of southern Ontario as well as the central Prairie Provinces outside the grasslands)
*Within the [[United States]]: most parts of  [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Minnesota]], along with eastern [[North Dakota]]
*The [[Southern Siberian rainforest]] in Russia includes hemiboreal forests.&lt;ref&gt;Chytry, Milan, et al. "Diversity of Forest Vegetation Across a Strong Gradient of Climatic Continentality: Western Sayan Mountains, South Siberia." Plant Ecology (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Southernmost [[Norway]] and Southern [[Sweden]] except the most southern municipalities.
*[[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]] and [[Estonia]].
*Coastal zone and archipelago of [[Turku]] in [[Finland]] and region of [[Åland]].

      <comment>Continuum is poorly used as an adjective in the previous instance. It's grammatically more common to use the noun form.

The '''infrared atmospheric window''' is the overall dynamic property of the [[earth's atmosphere]], taken as a whole at each place and occasion of interest, that lets some [[infrared radiation]] from the cloud tops and land-sea surface pass directly to space without intermediate absorption and re-emission, and thus without heating the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="P&amp;P 1976"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paltridge |first=G.W. |last2=Platt |first2=C.M.R.  |title=Radiative Processes in Meteorology and Climatology |publisher=Elsevier |year=1976 |isbn=0-444-41444-4 |pages=139–140, 144–7, 161–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDBRAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G&amp;Y 1989"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goody |first=R.M. |last2=Yung |first2=Y.L. |title=Atmospheric Radiation.

A large gap in the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] spectrum of water vapor, the main greenhouse gas, is most important in the dynamics of the window. Other gases, especially [[carbon dioxide]] and [[ozone]], partly block transmission.

An atmospheric window is a dynamic property of the atmosphere, while the spectral window is a static characteristic of the electromagnetic radiative absorption spectra of many [[greenhouse gases]], including water vapour. The atmospheric window tells what actually happens in the atmosphere, while the spectral window tells of one of the several abstract factors that potentially contribute to the actual concrete happenings in the atmosphere. Window radiation is radiation that actually passes through the atmospheric window. Non-window radiation is radiation that actually does not pass through the atmospheric window. Window wavelength radiation is radiation that, judging only from its wavelength, potentially might or might not, but is likely to pass through the atmospheric window. Non-window wavelength radiation is radiation that, judging only from its wavelength, is unlikely to pass through the atmospheric window. The difference between window radiation and window wavelength radiation is that window radiation is an actual component of the radiation, determined by the full dynamics of the atmosphere, taking in all determining factors, while window wavelength radiation is merely theoretically potential, defined only by one factor, the wavelength.

The importance of the infrared atmospheric window in the atmospheric energy balance was discovered by [[George Simpson (meteorologist)|George Simpson]] in 1928, based on G. Hettner's 1918&lt;ref name="Hettner 1918"&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Hettner |title=Über das ultrarote Absorptionsspektrum des Wasserdampfes |journal=Annalen der Physik (Leipzig) |series=4 |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=476–497 including foldout figure |year=1918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; laboratory studies of the gap in the absorption spectrum of water vapor. In those days, computers were not available, and Simpson notes that he used approximations; he writes: "There is no hope of getting an exact solution; but by making suitable simplifying assumptions . . . ."&lt;ref name="Simpson 1928"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aos.princeton.edu/WWWPUBLIC/gkv/history/climate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422013145/http://www.aos.princeton.edu/WWWPUBLIC/gkv/history/climate.html |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }} {{cite journal |first=G.C. |last=Simpson |title=Further Studies in Terrestrial Radiation |journal=Memoirs of the Royal Meteorological Society |volume=3 |issue=21 |pages=1–26 |year=1928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, accurate line-by-line computations are possible, and careful studies of the infrared atmospheric window have been published.

== Kinetics of the infrared atmospheric window ==

The infrared atmospheric window is a path from the land-sea surface of the earth to space. It separates two radiative components, window and non-window radiation, that are not of the kind that have kinetics suitable for description by the [[Beer-Lambert law]]. The window radiation and the non-window radiation from the land-sea surface are not defined in the terms that are necessary for the application of the Beer-Lambert Law. It would therefore be a logical and conceptual error to try to apply the Beer-Lambert Law either to window or non-window radiation considered separately.

The reason for this is that the window and non-window radiation have already been conditioned by the Beer-Lambert Law and the law cannot validly be re-applied to its own products. Logically, the Beer-Lambert Law applies to radiation of which the origin is known but the destination is unknown. Such is not the case for window and non-window radiation. Logically, it is part of the definition of window radiation that its destination is known, namely that it is destined to go to space, and likewise, by definition the destination of non-window radiation is known to be entire absorption by the atmosphere. Thus it makes sense to state the precise spectral distribution and spatial, especially altitudinal, distribution of locations of absorption of non-window radiation in the atmosphere. But none of those locations can be beyond the atmosphere; by definition, non-window radiation has zero probability of escaping absorption by the atmosphere; all of the locations of absorption are within the atmosphere. Radiation that can be described by the Beer-Lambert Law can partly escape absorption by the medium of interest; the law tells just how much that part is. This is a deep conceptual point that distinguishes the kinetic description of window and non-window radiation from the kinetic description of the kind of radiation that is covered by the Beer-Lambert Law.

Non-window radiation is by definition absorbed by the atmosphere, and its energy is thereby transduced into kinetic energy of atmospheric molecules. That kinetic energy is then transferred according to the usual dynamics of atmospheric energy transfer.

These kinetic principles for window and non-window radiation arise in the light of the definition of the atmospheric window as a dynamic property of the whole atmosphere, logically distinct from the electromagnetic spectral window.&lt;ref name="G&amp;Y 1989"/&gt;

== Mechanisms in the infrared atmospheric window ==

The infrared absorptions of the principal ''natural'' [[greenhouse gas]]es are mostly in two ranges. At wavelengths longer than 14&amp;nbsp;µm ([[micrometres]]), gases such as {{chem|link=carbon dioxide|CO|2}} and {{chem|link=methane|CH|4}} (along with less abundant [[hydrocarbons]]) absorb due to the presence of relatively long C-H and [[carbonyl]] [[chemical bond|bonds]], as well as water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) vapor absorbing in rotation modes. The bonds of {{chem|link=water|H|2|O}} and {{chem|link=ammonia|NH|3}} absorb at wavelengths shorter than 8&amp;nbsp;µm. Except for the bonds in {{chem|link=ozone|O|3}}, no bonds between carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms absorb in the interval between about 8 and 14&amp;nbsp;µm, though there is weaker continuum of absorption in that interval.&lt;ref name="P&amp;P 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G&amp;Y 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liou 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stull 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Houghton 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hettner 1918"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson 1928"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Daniel |first=J.S. |last2=Solomon |first2=S. |last3=Kjaergaard |first3=H.G. |last4=Schofield |first4=D.P. |title=Atmospheric water vapour complexes and the continuum |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=31 |pages=L06118 |year=2004 |doi=10.1029/2003GL018914 |url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GL018914|bibcode=2004GeoRL..31.6118D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over [[Côte d'Ivoire]], interferometrically recorded spectra of outgoing longwave radiation&lt;ref name="Hanel 1972"/&gt; show emission that has arisen from the cloud tops at a temperature of about 265 K and passed through the atmospheric window, and non-window emission that has arisen mainly from the troposphere at temperatures about 240 K. This means that, at the scarcely absorbed continuum of wavelengths (8 to 14&amp;nbsp;µm), the radiation emitted, by the earth's surface into a dry atmosphere, and by the cloud tops, mostly passes unabsorbed through the atmosphere, and is emitted directly to space; there is also partial window transmission in far infrared spectral lines between about 16 and 28&amp;nbsp;µm. Clouds are excellent emitters of infrared radiation. Window radiation from cloud tops arises at altitudes where the air temperature is low, but as seen from those altitudes, the water vapor content of the air above is much lower than that of the air at the land-sea surface. Moreover,&lt;ref name="Daniel 2004"/&gt; the water vapour continuum absorptivity, molecule for molecule, decreases with pressure decrease. Thus water vapour above the clouds, besides being less concentrated, is also less absorptive than water vapour at lower altitudes. Consequently, the effective window as seen from the cloud-top altitudes is more open, with the result that the cloud tops are effectively strong sources of window radiation; that is to say, in effect the clouds obstruct the window only to a small degree (see another opinion about this, proposed by Ahrens (2009) on page 43&lt;ref name="Ahrens 2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=C.D. |last=Ahrens |title=Meteorology Today |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont CA |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-495-55573-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Importance for life ==

Without the infrared atmospheric window, the Earth would become much too warm to support life, and possibly so warm that it would lose its water, as [[Venus]] did early in [[solar system]] history. Thus, the existence of an atmospheric window is critical to Earth remaining a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet]].

== Threats ==

In recent decades, the existence of the infrared atmospheric window has become threatened by the development of highly unreactive gases containing bonds between [[fluorine]] and either [[carbon]] or [[sulfur]]. The "stretching frequencies" of bonds between fluorine and other light [[nonmetal]]s are such that strong absorption in the atmospheric window will always be characteristic of compounds containing such bonds. This absorption is strengthened because these bonds are highly polar due to the extreme [[electronegativity]] of the fluorine atom. Bonds to other [[halogens]] also absorb in the atmospheric window, though much less strongly.

Moreover, the unreactive nature of such compounds that makes them so valuable for many industrial purposes means that they are not removable in the natural circulation of the Earth's atmosphere. It is estimated, for instance, that [[perfluorocarbon]]s ({{chem|link=Tetrafluoromethane|CF|4}}, {{chem|link=Hexafluoroethane|C|2|F|6}}, {{chem|link=Octafluoropropane|C|3|F|8}}) can stay in the atmosphere for over fifty thousand years, a figure which may be an underestimate given the absence of natural sources of these gases.

This means that such compounds have an enormous [[global warming potential]]. One kilogram of [[sulfur hexafluoride]] will, for example, cause as much warming as 23 tonnes of carbon dioxide over 100 years. Perfluorocarbons are similar in this respect, and even [[carbon tetrachloride]] ({{chem|CCl|4}}) has a global warming potential of 1800 compared to carbon dioxide.

Efforts to find substitutes for these compounds are still going on and remain highly problematic.

[[File:Galerie Colbert.jpg|thumb|The INHA is located in the Colbert Gallery]]
The '''Institut national d'histoire de l'art''' (INHA; National Institute for Art History) is a French research institute, created and governed by Decree No. 2001-621 (July 12, 2001) and situated in [[Paris]].

The Institute develops scientific activity and contributes to international cooperation in most fields of [[art history]] and heritage by exercising research, training and knowledge-diffusion. It is located in the Galerie Colbert in Paris, which houses the Department of Education and Research and the Richelieu Quadrilateral Area. The latter's Labrouste Room houses the Department of Documentation, which holds collections from the Art and Archeology Library founded by [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] in 1897 and donated in 1917 to the [[University of Paris]].

The INHA's mission is to promote international art historical research in all fields of the history of art. It pilots a large number of programs by gathering together university researchers and curators. It organises study days, symposiums, conferences and meeting-debates and develops different resources, documentary bases and research programs in art history. Each year, the INHA invites about sixty art historians, among them experienced researchers, academics, curators, art critics and doctoral students. Twice a year, the INHA publishes a scientific review on art history entitled ''Perspective''. Many documentary bases are to be found on the INHA's website.

The institute is located in Paris at 2, Rue Vivienne, in a former 17th century town house converted into a gallery in the 19th century. Its art history library, one of the largest in the world with more than {{formatnum:1700000}} documents, is located in the Labrouste room of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] at 58 rue de Richelieu.

The INHA provides access to external and internal online databases like [https://www.inha.fr/fr/ressources/outils-documentaires/acces-global-et-organise-aux-ressources-en-histoire-de-l-art-agorha.html AGORHA (''Accès global et organisé aux ressources en histoire de l’art'')] which allows several search modes in the different research fields of the INHA: [https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/jsp/portal/index.jsp general search] (or use « ''Rechercher'' » in the bar), [https://www.inha.fr/_contents/ametys-internal%253Asites/inha/ametys-internal%253Acontents/montee-de-version-d-agorha-apercu-des-nouveautes-article/_metadata/content/_data/rBtOsQxW1GywhbJvoKIEvJX4xm3Abz_aOUdCDp3zTWGgSS41vm-XB6J2M1rCTzU33ZVZFIuNerUFNetDEetmaftLiJg7ZKS1Zb0ec2bdC99b9g3gFWlorw-em_EHOCzivIj3CF97 simple search], expert search and search by links, in particular in the RETIF ([https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/ark:/54721/0014 ''répertoire des tableaux italiens dans les collections publiques françaises (XIIIe-XIXe siècles))''] which gives the {{formatnum:13761}} italian paintings held in French public collections.

[[File:Paul 1758 Patent Drawing.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Diagram of rollers and bobbin from Paul's 1758 patent.]]'''Lewis Paul''' (died 1759) was the original inventor of roller spinning, the basis of the [[water frame]] for [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] [[cotton]] in a [[cotton mill]].

==Life and work==
Lewis Paul was of [[Huguenot]] descent. His father was [[physician]] to [[Lord Shaftesbury]].  He may have begun work on designing a spinning machine for cotton as early as 1729, but probably did not make practical progress until after 1732 when he met [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]], a carpenter then working in [[Birmingham]] for a gun barrel forger.  Wyatt had designed a machine, probably for cutting files, in which Paul took an interest.

Roller spinning was certainly Paul's idea, and Wyatt built a machine (or model) for him.  Paul obtained a [[patent]] for this on 24 June 1738.  He then set about trying to license his machine, though some licences were granted in satisfaction of debts.  In 1741, he set up a machine powered by two [[donkey|asses]] in the Upper Priory in Birmingham, near his house in Old Square.

==Mills using the roller spinning patent==
[[Edward Cave]], a [[publisher]], obtained a licence and set up machines in a warehouse in [[London]]. In 1742, he acquired [[Marvel's Mill]] on the [[River Nene]] at [[Northampton]]. He rebuilt the mill to hold four or five water-powered spinning machines, each with 50 spindles.  This was thus the first [[cotton mill]].  Cave died on 10 January 1754, so that the mill passed to his brother William and his nephew Paul.  Samuel Touchet, a London merchant had the mill until 1755, but made no profit.  It may then have been let to Lewis Paul, but he died in 1759.  The Caves forfeited the lease for non-payment of rent in March 1761 and advertised the mill to let in November 1761.  By 1768, the mill had reverted to being a [[corn mill]].

Another mill that operated under Paul's patent was at [[Leominster]].  This was built in 1744 by John Bourn in partnership with Henry Morris of [[Lancashire]].  The mill burnt down in November 1754.

==Carding machines==
In 1748, [[Daniel Bourn]] and Lewis Paul separately obtained patents for [[carding]] machines, which were presumably used in the Leominster and Northampton mills respectively.  This carding technology of Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn seems to be the basis of later carding machines.

==Achievements==
The principle of his rolling spinning process was perfected by [[John Kay (spinning frame)|John Kay]] and [[Thomas Highs]] and promoted by [[Richard Arkwright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/manufacture_by_machine/01.ST.01/?scene=5&amp;tv=true |title=Rise of the factory system: Richard Arkwright |volume=Making the Modern World|publisher=The Science Museum}} Retrieved on 2008-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Peacock |first=Doug |url=http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/highs.htm |title=Thomas Highs and his spinning machines |publisher=Cotton Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514204334/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/highs.htm |archivedate=2008-05-14 |df= }} Retrieved on 2008-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul's machine seems only to have been modestly profitable, and it is not clear to what extent his work is reflected in Arkwright's much more successful machine, the [[water frame]], patented in 1769.   Like Paul and Bourn, Arkwright subsequently added a carding stage to his machinery, but his use of this as a means of continuing his patent rights beyond the expiry of his original patent failed, because the improvement was not his invention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3182">'''Lipid microdomains''' are formed when [[lipid]]s undergo lateral [[phase (matter)|phase]] separations yielding stable coexisting [[lamellar]] [[Lipid bilayer|domain]]s. These [[phase separation]]s can be induced by changes in [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[ionic strength]] or by the addition of [[divalent]] [[cation]]s or [[protein]]s. The question of whether such lipid microdomains observed in model lipid systems also exist in [[biomembrane]]s had motivated considerable research efforts. Lipid domains are not readily isolated and examined as unique species, in contrast to the examples of lateral [[heterogeneity]].
One can disrupt the membrane and demonstrate a heterogeneous range of [[wikt:composition|composition]] in the [[population]] of the resulting [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] or [[fragmentation (cell biology)|fragments]]. [[Electron microscopy]] can also be used to demonstrate lateral inhomogeneities in biomembranes.

Often, lateral heterogeneity has been inferred from biophysical techniques where the observed signal indicates multiple populations rather than the expected homogenous population. An example of this is the measurement of the [[diffusion coefficient]] of a [[fluorescent]] lipid analogue in soybean [[protoplast]]s. Membrane microheterogeneity is sometimes inferred from the behavior of [[enzyme]]s, where the enzymatic activity does not appear to be correlated with the [[average]] lipid [[physical state]] exhibited by the bulk of the membrane. Often, the methods suggest regions with different lipid [[Membrane fluidity|fluidity]], as would be expected of coexisting [[gel]] and [[liquid crystal]]line phases within the biomembrane. This is also the conclusion of a series of studies where differential effects of perturbation caused by ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]'' and ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]'' [[fatty acid]]s are interpreted in terms of preferential partitioning of the two liquid crystalline and gel-like domains.

The '''London International Awards''', or '''LIA''' (formerly known as '''London International Advertising Awards''',''' LIAA'''), are a worldwide awards annually honoring "pioneers, and embodiments of excellence" in advertising, digital media, production, design, music &amp; sound and branded entertainment. It was the first truly international advertising award of its kind to acknowledge all media and methods from all over the world to be judged by a diverse global jury.&lt;ref name="AdNews"&gt;[http://www.adnews.com.au/awards/london-international-awards "AdNews: London International Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Awards, founded in 1986 by President Barbara Levy, began by celebrating advertising in the realms of cinema, television, print, and radio internationally, evolving since its inception into 22 unique media types: Ambient, Billboard, Branded Entertainment, Design, Digital, Health &amp; Wellness, Health &amp; Wellness - Craft, Integration, Medical, Medical - Craft, Music &amp; Sound, Music Video, Non-Traditional, Package Design, Poster, Print, Production &amp; Post-Production, Radio &amp; Audio, Social Influencers, The NEW, Television/Cinema/Online Film and Verbal Identity.&lt;ref name="Categories"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/enter/categories/ "2017 Categories"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the word "Advertising" was removed from the competition's name to reflect the fact that it observes more than just "advertising" in an ever-changing industry.&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyFour"&gt;London International Awards 2004 Winners &amp; Finalists Annual, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, LIA, along with creative Faris Yakob, developed "The NEW,"&lt;ref name="Digital"&gt;Pont, Simon (2013). ''Digital State: How the Internet is Changing Everything''. Kogan Page, {{ISBN|978-0749468866}}&lt;/ref&gt; a medium that takes notice of new ''kinds'' of ideas rather than merely new ideas, for works that demonstrate concepts that don't fit comfortably among the standard media divisions, with a focus in fields of technology.&lt;ref name="Categories" /&gt;

In 2014, LIA added Branded Entertainment as a medium. The judging category, first chaired by Jimmy Smith of Amusement Park Entertainment, awards "creativity and the power of the idea across films, television programming, live events, audio, gaming and music videos that engage consumers by entertaining them, rather than through traditional advertising."&lt;ref name="Branded"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/press-release/lia-announces-the-inaugural-branded-entertainment-competition-led-by-jimmy-smith-amusement-park-entertainment/ "LIA Announces the Inaugural Branded Entertainment Competition Led by Jimmy Smith, Amusement Park Entertainment"] Press Release, May 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2016, LIA introduced a medium called [[Verbal Identity]],&lt;ref name="LBBVerbal"&gt;[https://lbbonline.com/news/lia-becomes-first-awards-festival-to-introduce-verbal-identity-category/ "LIA Becomes First Awards Festival to Introduce ‘Verbal Identity’ Category"]&lt;/ref&gt; centered on "the long-term verbal assets" of a brand, with sub-categories devoted to naming, taglines, copywriting and tone of voice.&lt;ref name="Categories" /&gt;

New developments for 2017 include the addition of a Health &amp; Pharma competition in response to a "large number of requests from creatives";&lt;ref name="HealthPharma"&gt;[https://www.adgully.com/lia-2017-adds-health-pharma-jeremy-perrott-to-chair-inaugural-juries-71201.html "LIA 2017 adds Health &amp; Pharma; Jeremy Perrott to Chair inaugural Juries"]&lt;/ref&gt; a Social Influencers medium "based on Creativity and Engagement",&lt;ref name="Social"&gt;[https://www.liaawards.com/enter/categories/the-influencer-awards/ "Social Influencers"]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Chinese Creativity Show featuring a unique red statue and executed through a first round of judging in [[China]] and a final judging session simultaneous with the annual LIA Judging.&lt;ref name="China"&gt;[http://www.bizcommunity.com/InBrief/45/12/13293.html "LIA Chinese Creativity Show to recognize works in Chinese"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIAChina"&gt;[http://www.liachina.com/ "LIA China"]&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[#Judging|Judging]])

== Judging ==
[[File:London International Awards Grand LIA Statue.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The statue for the Grand LIA award|Grand LIA Award]]
LIA is one of the largest and most comprehensive awards programs in its field.

As of 2017, the thirteen LIA Jury panels, each one headed by a Jury President, are composed of nearly 100 experienced members of agencies, production companies, design houses, and technology companies. These panels decide on the Gold, Silver and Bronze Statue Winners, as well as the finalists, with each Jury given the non-compulsory opportunity to award a '''Grand LIA''' to a piece of work that has achieved a Gold statue. The judging process is unique in that each Juror sees every piece of work entered within the medium/media that he or she is required to judge.&lt;ref name="2014 Jury Comments"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/jury-comments/2014/ "2014 Archives | LIA Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt; Judging is held annually in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] over a 7-to-10-day period in late September/early October.&lt;ref name="Key"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/ "Key Dates"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
[[File:London International Awards Gold Statue.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The statue for the Gold LIA award|Gold LIA Award]]
For 26 years, LIA held its one-night awards ceremony in London. In 2012, it was decided to allocate the budget for the ceremony in favor of bringing a small group of young International Creatives from around the world together to share their experiences and to discuss the future of advertising, design, production, brand-building and the overall state of the creative global markets.&lt;ref name="PressCreate"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/press/press_archive/press_article.cfm?press_id=370&amp;start=51 "LIA 2012 Judging and Inaugural Creative Conversations"] Press Release, October 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[#Creative LIAisons|Creative LIAisons]])

In 1985, LIA commissioned a British art student named Mary Griffiths to design the LIA statue. The 17" LIA statue is a winged figure that is hand cast in metal prior to a gold, silver, bronze, or black plating (for Grand LIA winners). It stands on a custom black nickel finished base with an engraved plate displaying the year, medium, category, client/brand and the recipient's name and location.&lt;ref name="Statue"&gt;[http://www.rsowens.com/m/Galleries/PrestigeAward "London International Award"] R.S. Owens, Prestige Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in 2010, the same year as the Awards' 25th Anniversary,&lt;ref name="Shoot"&gt;[https://www.shootonline.com/spw/45070 "London International Awards Honours Network of the Year Agency of the Year Production Company of the Year"] Shoot Publicity Wire, November 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; LIA awarded global '''Network of the Year''', '''Agency of the Year''', and '''Production Company of the Year''' designations. Subsequently, in 2011, LIA added '''Post-Production Company of the Year'''.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;[http://www.themill.com/awards "Awards - The Mill"] The Mill&lt;/ref&gt; '''Design Company of the Year,''' '''Independent Agency of the Year,''' '''Music &amp; Sound Company of the Year''' and '''Radio &amp; Audio Company of the Year''' have also been recognized in recent years.&lt;ref name="Winners&amp;Finalists"&gt;[http://2016.liaentries.com/winners/ "Winners &amp; Finalists"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, LIA gave a [[one-off]] award sponsored by [[JetBlue]] to filmmaker  [[Morgan Spurlock|Morgan Spurlock's]] ''[[POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold]]'', dubbed "The Greatest Award Ever Sold" for its analysis of product placement and the inner workings of the ad industry.&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyEleven"&gt;London International Awards 2011 26th Annual Winners &amp; Finalists, {{ISSN|1793-6039}}, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, LIA added '''Regional 'Of the Year'''' Awards to [[Australia]] / [[New Zealand]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], the [[Middle East]] / [[Africa]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref name="Regional"&gt;[https://www.liaawards.com/press-release/lia-announces-regional-year-awards-recognize-best-region/ "LIA Announces Regional 'Of The Year' Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt; as additional components of its global 'Of the Year' honors.

Entries submitted for consideration are required to have been broadcast, published, or released commercially with client approval in order to become part of the competition, accompanied by the payment of a required fee based on the category.&lt;ref name="Fees"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/enter/ "Rules of Entry"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In past years, LIA has published a hardbound, full-color Annual showcasing all of the winners and finalists from that given year.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/about/ "About LIA"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyEight"&gt;London International Awards 2008 23rd Annual Winners &amp; Finalists, {{ISSN|1793-6039}}, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative LIAisons ==
As a way of giving back to the industry, LIA launched the 'Creative Conversations' program in 2012. Composed of educational discussions centered on the future of advertising, brand-building and production, the campaign is enforced through a series of seminars, lunches, and dinners that run concurrent with judging. The organization and expenses, including that of travel and hotel accommodations, are wholly funded by LIA.&lt;ref name="CampaignBrief"&gt;[http://www.campaignbrief.com/2013/05/to-do-sunday-pm---london-inter.html "London International Awards Call for Entry Now Open - seven picked for jury duty from Australasia"] Campaign Brief, May 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the experience's purpose is to bridge relationships between veteran speakers and junior "Young Creatives" from across the globe, the advertising industry's "great teachers" and "young, energetic" minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hang Li|first1=Daniel|title=Comments|url=https://liaawards.com/creative-liaisons/attendees/2013/|website=www.liaawards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural 2012 speakers included: Ted Royer, Susan Credle, Israel Diaz, Sonal Dabral, Tony Calcao, Jeremy Craigen, Faris Yakob, Neil French, Phil Growick, Dörte Spengler-Ahrens, Bob Garfield, Jonathon Ker, Ralph van Dijk, and Scott Elias.

The program was renamed "Creative LIAisons" for the 2015 awards, with just under 100 invited attendees.&lt;ref name="FrontPage"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/creative-liaisons/ "Creative LIAisons"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daymond John]] returned as the Keynote Speaker, with other noteworthy speakers such as Amir Kassaei at [[DDB Worldwide]], John Merrifield from [[Google]], and Mark Tutssel of [[Leo Burnett Worldwide]] joining him.&lt;ref name="2015Speakers"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/creative_liaisons/speakers/2015/ "2015 Speakers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ludomusicology''' (also called '''video game music studies''' or '''video game music research''') is a field of academic research and scholarly analysis focusing on  [[video game music]], understood as the music found in [[video game]]s and in related contexts. It is closely related to the fields of [[musicology]] and [[Sound effect#Video games|interactive and games audio research]], and game music and audio are sometimes studied as a united phenomenon. Ludomusicology is also related to the field of [[game studies]], as music is one element of the wider video game text and some theories on video game functions are directly relevant to music.

Whereas the overarching areas of interactive and game audio research and game studies are highly interdisciplinary (ranging from [[Interface (computing)|interface]] research, [[Neurology|neurological research]], [[psychology]] and [[informatics]] to [[sound studies]], [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]]), ludomusicology as a subfield has been mainly driven by musicologists (albeit with an openness to interdisciplinary inquiry). Ludomusicology not only deals with music in games and music games as its subject matter, but is also interested in the ways in which games and their music have become subjects of playful engagement themselves, e.g. within the frame of fancultural practices. Additionally and more generally, game music challenges the ways in which we think about music, and subsequently how we study it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Elferen|first1=Isabella|title=Ludomusicology and the new drastic (Conference paper, unpublished)|journal=Creativity, Circulation and Copyright: Sonic and Visual Media in the Digital Age|date=28–29 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=Roger|title=Playing Games with Music (and Vice Versa): Ludomusicological Perspectives on Guitar Hero and Rock Band|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of anthologies and monographs dealing with the specific subject of game music and music in game culture is steadily increasing. The ludomusicological community now organizes conferences, runs subgroups within the musicological societies, and engages in discourse with scholarly colleagues in a wide range of related fields.

==History==
Academic research on video game music began in the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matthew|first1=Belinkie|title=Video game music: not just kid stuff|url=http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml|website=Videogame Music Archive|accessdate=26 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613143431/http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml|archivedate=16 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed through the mid 2000s. Early research on the topic often involved historical studies of game music, or comparative studies of video game music and film music (see, for instance, Zach Whalen's article "Play Along - An Approach to Videogame Music" which includes both).&lt;ref name="whalen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whalen|first1=Zach|date=November 2004|title=Play Along - An Approach to Videogame Music|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/0401/whalen/|journal=Game Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of video game music is also known by some as "ludomusicology" — a portmanteau of "[[ludology]]" (the study of games and gameplay) and "[[musicology]]" (the study and analysis of music) — a term coined independently by Guillaume Laroche and Roger Moseley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=Roger|editor1-last=Cook|editor1-first=Nicholas|editor2-last=Pettengill|editor2-first=Richard|title=Taking it to the bridge: music as performance|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|pages=283, 308|chapter=Playing games with music (and vice versa): ludomusicological perspectives on Guitar Hero and Rock Band}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karbani|first1=Tasneem|title=Summer research project was music to student's ears|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~publicas/folio/45/01/04.html|website=University of Alberta|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent figure in early video game music and audio research is Karen Collins, who is associate professor at the [[University of Waterloo]] and Canada Research Chair in Interactive Audio at the University of Waterloo Games Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Collins|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/english/people-profiles/karen-collins|website=University of Waterloo|accessdate=2 May 2017|date=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her monograph ''Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design'' (MIT Press 2008)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design|last1=Collins|first1=Karen|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262033787|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a seminal work in the field, and was influential in the subsequent development of video game music studies.

In 2012, the Ludomusicology Research Group held its inaugural conference at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was the first conference in the world to be focused specifically on video game music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2014 the inaugural North American Conference on Video Game Music was held at [[Youngstown State University]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both conferences have since been held annually, at varying locations in Europe and North America respectively.

In late 2016, the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.&lt;ref name="about-sssmg" /&gt; The SSSMG is the first international society dedicated to the study of video game music. In September 2017, the SSSMG announced the planned launch of a new journal dedicated to video game music and sound research, the ''Journal of Sound &amp; Music in Games''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/2017/09/04/announcement/|title=SSSMG Executive Committee Appointments &amp; Journal Announcement|last=Sweeney|first=Mark|date=4 September 2017|website=SSSMG|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of enquiry==
Ludomusicology examines any and all aspects of video game music and audio, some of which are described in brief here.

===Interactivity===
{{see also|Interactivity}}
Interactivity is one of the major differentiating qualities of video game music, distinguishing it from other screen media music through the incorporation of player actions. In interactive gameplay, the sound and music played by the game can respond to the actions of the player within the game.&lt;ref name="whalen" /&gt; Furthermore, as video games frequently feature non-linear or multi-linear timelines, their music can be similarly multi-threaded in both its form and its experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} Because each player takes an independently-chosen path through the game, any player’s experience of a game's music will be different (considered as a whole) to any other player's experience from the same game, even though constructed from the same basic elements. Therefore, the intent and output of the composer and the music's effect on the player (which similarly varies from player to player) must both be considered during analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Iain|title=Meaningful Play: Performativity, Interactivity and Semiotics in Video Game Music|journal=Musicology Australia|date=2014|volume=36|issue=2|pages=273–290|doi=10.1080/08145857.2014.958272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept to that of interactivity is that of [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]], which considers the ability of a video game to draw the player into a deep engagement with the game's diegetic space. Isabella van Elferen has developed a model of video game music immersion called "the ALI model", which understands player immersion to be a confluence of "musical affect, musical literacy and musical interaction":
* Affect: "personal investment in a given situation through memory, emotion and identification"
* Literacy: "fluency in hearing and interpreting... music through the fact of our frequent exposure to [it]", which builds on such literacy from other musical media
* Interaction: the player's reactions to music, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|last=Isabella|first=van Elferen|publisher=Equinox|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Kamp|editor-first=Michiel|location=Sheffield|pages=34–39|chapter=Analysing Game Musical Immersion: The ALI Model|editor-last2=Summers|editor-first2=Tim|editor-last3=Sweeney|editor-first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
{{see also|Video game music|Chiptune}}
Historical studies of video game music usually incorporate examinations of game music technology. Technological limitations of audio chips in early consoles and computer systems were, in many ways, instrumental in shaping the development of both the functions and aesthetics of game music. For example, Karen Collins describes how the [[Television Interface Adaptor|Television Interface Adapter]] in the [[Atari 2600]] created tones that could be out of tune by up to half a semitone; this led to minimal music in games for this platform, and substantial modifications to the music of ported games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|21–23}} Similarly, Melanie Fritsch observes the relative freedoms afforded to game composers by [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD audio]] (higher quality, though limited to 79.8 minutes) and later [[MP3]] (similar quality to CD audio but with compression minimising length restrictions), while also noting the challenges presented by writing increasingly detailed music to accompany hundreds of hours of gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Fritsch|first=Melanie|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=24–25|chapter=History of Video Game Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technology that has attracted significant academic attention is [[iMUSE]], a [[MIDI]]-based system developed by [[LucasArts]] that allowed dynamic and smooth musical transitions, which were triggered by game conditions but which would occur at musically expedient (pre-designated) positions in the soundtrack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|51–57}}

Ludomusicology also investigates muso-technological practices in fields surrounding video games. For example, scholarly attention is turning to [[chiptune]], which is the creation of music using old video game or sound chip hardware (a definition which is sometimes broadened to include the imitation of the resulting aesthetic).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Pasdzierny|first=Matthias|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=174–175|chapter=Geeks on Stage? Investigations in the World of (Live) Chipmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition===
{{see also|Video game music}}
Ludomusicology examines the composition of video game music, both in relation to and as distinct from other forms of [[Musical composition|music composition]]. Studies of game music compositional processes are often contributed by active [[composer]]s and industry practitioners (for example, [[Winifred Phillips]]'s book ''A Composer's Guide to Game Music'', and [[Stephen Baysted]]'s chapter "Palimpsest, Pragmatism and the Aesthetics of Genre Transformation: Composing the Hybrid Score to Electronic Arts' ''Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed''").&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Composer's Guide to Game Music|last=Phillips|first=Winifred|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|last=Baysted|first=Stephen|publisher=Equinox|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Kamp|editor-first=Michiel|location=Sheffield|pages=152–171|chapter=Palimpsest, Pragmatism and the Aesthetics of Genre Transformation: Composing the Hybrid Score to Electronic Arts' Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed|editor-last2=Summers|editor-first2=Tim|editor-last3=Sweeney|editor-first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant distinction of video game music composition is the need to incorporate the player's interactivity into the compositional process, and particularly as part of the negotiation of engagement and immersion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|35–36}} Composition is also at the nexus of creative potential and technological possibility, and throughout the development of game music (and particularly in its early phases) this has had significant effects on both compositional processes and game music aesthetics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|35}}

===Music video games===
{{see also|Music video game}}
Music video games, which use music as part of a dominant gameplay mechanism, are a focus of many ludomusicological studies. The clear relationship between music and gameplay in games like the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Rock Band]]'' series facilitates the study of performance and performativity within gameplay, and provokes questions of musical ideology, performance practice and multimedia pedagogy. Kiri Miller writes that music video games feature a smaller disparity between the actions of player and avatar than is usually present in video games, and that this can encourage heightened levels of physical and musical engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Playing Along: Digital Games, YouTube, and Virtual Performance|last=Miller|first=Kiri|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Roesner, Anna Paisley, and Gianna Cassidy have examined these phenomena within the classroom context, observing that music video games can inspire not only musical creativity, but the positive self-perception of musicality in students; they suggest that such effects can be used to encourage student engagement and development within both musical and non-musical curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music Video Games: Performance, Politics, and Play|last=Roesner|first=David|last2=Paisley|first2=Anna|last3=Cassidy|first3=Gianna|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Austin|editor-first=Michael|location=New York|pages=213–215|chapter=Guitar Heroes in the Classroom: The Creative Potential of Music Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to music in other screen media===
{{see also|Soundtrack|Film score}}
Because video games are (usually) screen-based media, there are strong links between the study of game music and the study of music in other screen-based media (like film and television). Concepts such as [[Diegesis#In film|diegesis]] and [[Acousmatic sound|acousmatics]], which originate in film and film audio studies, are broadly applicable to video game music analyses, often with minimal adjustment.&lt;ref name=whalen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medina-Gray|first1=Elizabeth|editor1-last=Donnelly|editor1-first=K.J.|editor2-last=Gibbons|editor2-first=William|editor3-last=Lerner|editor3-first=Neil|title=Music in Video Games: Studying Play|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=Meaningful Modular Combinations: Simultaneous Harp and Environmental Music in two ''Legend of Zelda'' Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are similarities between video game and film music techniques as varying stages throughout video game music history. For example, Neil Lerner notes a relationship between music in [[Silent film|early/silent cinema]] and game music aesthetics from the 1970s onwards, on the basis of "largely nonverbal communication system[s]" and "continuous musical accompaniment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music in Video Games: Studying Play|last=Lerner|first=Neil|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Donnelly|editor-first=K.J.|location=New York|pages=12|chapter=Mario's Dynamic Leaps: Musical Innovations (and the Specter of Early Cinema) in ''Donkey Kong'' and ''Super Mario Bros.''|editor-last2=Gibbons|editor-first2=William|editor-last3=Lerner|editor-first3=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Gregor Herzfeld compares the use of high energy music in ''[[Gran Turismo (video game)|Gran Turismo]]'' to the use of rock music in action films like ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', due to associations with risky and/or exciting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Herzfeld|first=Gregor|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is also well noted within ludomusicological discourse that video games are very different media to film and television due to the player's interaction. Consequently, the application of concepts like diegesis does require a nuanced approach that takes the peculiarities of the video game medium into account. For example, Collins observes that linear approaches to [[musical analysis]] (such as the observation of synchronicity between musical and visual cues) fail to address the non-linear timescales that are typical of video games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} This forms a basis of Collins's reiteration of a warning by video game theorists against "theoretical imperialism".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|5}}

===Research methods===
Several academics have written about the research methods involved in ludomusicology. One of the more comprehensive of these studies is found in Tim Summers's book ''Understanding Video Game Music'', in which Summers describes the process of "analytical play", wherein the analyst is "deliberately subverting the game's expectations of the player's actions.... At moments when game rules are tested, the architecture is often clearest. By playing experimentally (or using 'analytical play') to investigate the musical system in the game and comparing multiple play sessions, the musical mechanics of the game programming can be divined".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|35}} Summers places this analytical method alongside more conventional sources of research data, both from inside the game (e.g., programmatic and musical information, the latter of which frequently involves the application of conventional musicology and music theory to the video game music text) and from texts and communities surrounding the game.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|34–50}}

==Groups and Conferences==

===Ludomusicology Research Group===
The Ludomusicology Research Group is an inter-university research organisation focusing on the study of music in games, music games and music in video game culture, composed of four researchers: Michiel Kamp, Tim Summers, Melanie Fritsch, and Mark Sweeney.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.ludomusicology.org/about/|website=Ludomusicology|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they organise an annual international conference held in the UK or Europe (at the time of writing, the most recent was the Ludo2017 conference held at Bath Spa University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludo 2017|url=http://www.ludomusicology.org/past-events/ludo-2017/|website=Ludomusicology|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ludo2018 held in Leipzig, Germany, in April 2018, was the biggest Ludo-conference so far, attracting more than 80 participants from all over the world. The group was originally founded by Kamp, Summers and Sweeney in August 2011, who have also edited a collection of essays based around the study of game sound entitled ''Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music'', published in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kamp|editor1-first=Michiel|editor2-last=Summers|editor2-first=Tim|editor3-last=Sweeney|editor3-first=Mark|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|date=2016|publisher=Equinox|isbn=9781781791974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludomusicology|url=https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/ludomusicology/|website=Equinox|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also edited a double special issue of [https://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-issue,id=2999/ ''The Soundtrack''] and initiated a new book series called [http://www.ludomusicology.org/2017/04/20/new-book-series-studies-game-sound-music/ ''Studies in Game Sound and Music''] in 2017. In September 2016, Tim Summers' book ''Understanding Video Game Music'' was published by Cambridge University Press.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Tim|title=Understanding Video Game Music|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107116870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritsch officially joined the group in 2016. She had edited the 2nd issue of the online journal [http://www.act.uni-bayreuth.de/en/archiv/2011-02/index.html ''ACT - Zeitschrift für Musik und Performance''], published in July 2011 that included ludomusicological contributions written by Tim Summers, Steven Reale and James Brame. She had been a regular at the conferences since 2012 and published several book chapters on the topic. Whereas Kamp, Summers and Sweeney have a background in Musicology, Fritsch has her background in Performance Studies. Her doctoral thesis and first monograph "Performing Bytes. Musikperformances der Computerspielkultur" is scheduled for publication during 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://uni-bayreuth.academia.edu/mfritsch&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM)===
The North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM) is an international conference on video game music held annually in North America since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, B. I. (2014, January 18). [https://www.wired.com/2014/01/game-music/  There Really Is a Conference Where Nerds Study Videogame Music.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Checkpoint!: The floodgates have opened.

===Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG)===
In late 2016 the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.&lt;ref name="about-sssmg"&gt;{{cite web|title=About SSSMG|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/about-sssmg/|website=SSSMG|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSSMG has the aim of bringing together both practitioners and researchers from across the globe in order to develop the field's understanding of sound and video game music and audio. Its initial focus is the use of its website as a "hub" for communication and resource centralisation, including a video game music research bibliography (a project initially begun by the Ludomusicology Research Group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/bibliography/|website=SSSMG|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMS Ludomusicology Study Group===
The Ludomusicology Study Group of the [[American Musicological Society]] was founded in 2015 and "is dedicated to facilitating academic research on music interactive media", including holding a panel on video game music as part of the annual meetings of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gamemusicstudies.org/?page_id=12|title=About|work=Ludomusicology Study Group|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ludomusicology Society of Australia (LSA)===
The Ludomusicology Society of Australia was launched in April 2017, during the Ludo2017 conference in Bath, UK; it aims to "offer a centralised and local professional body nurturing game music studies for academics, people in industry and game music fans alike in the Australasian region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The LSA is here!|url=http://ludomusicologysociety.com.au/2017/03/07/hello-world/|website=The Ludomusicology Society of Australia|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first president, [[Joseph R. Williams]], designed a curriculum that required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, [[liberal arts]], and practical training. The curriculum excluded [[Latin language|Latin]] and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any [[classical language]]s in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily [[manual labour|manual labor]], which kept costs down for both the students and the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Darling, Birt. | title=City in the Forest; The Story of Lansing | location=New York | publisher=Stratford House | year=1950|page=121 | lccn=50008202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as [[elitism|elitist]]. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.

This gave the college a four-year curriculum and the power to grant master's degrees. Under the act, a newly created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution.&lt;ref name="sesquicentennial"/&gt; The college changed its name to '''State Agricultural College''', and its first class graduated in the same year. As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] had begun, there was no time for an elaborate graduation ceremony.  The first alumni enlisted to the [[Union Army]]. Williams died, and the following year, [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the First [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 to support similar colleges, making the Michigan school a national model.  Shortly thereafter, on March 18, 1863, the state designated the college its land-grant institution making Michigan State University one of the nation's first land-grant college.&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;{{Citation | title = The National Schools of Science | magazine = The Nation | page = 409 | date = November 21, 1867 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf0xAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;lpg=PA409&amp;dq=land+grant+kansas+february+16,+1863+pennsylvania+April#v=onepage&amp;q=land%20grant%20kansas%20february%2016%2C%201863%20pennsylvania%20April&amp;f=false | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160624102647/https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf0xAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;lpg=PA409&amp;dq=land+grant+kansas+february+16,+1863+pennsylvania+April#v=onepage&amp;q=land%20grant%20kansas%20february%2016%2C%201863%20pennsylvania%20April&amp;f=false | archivedate = June 24, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college first admitted women in 1870, although at that time there were no female residence halls. The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a "Women Course" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President [[Jonathan L. Snyder]] invited its president [[Booker T. Washington]] to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first woman African-American student to enroll at the College. Along with the Class of 1907, she received her degree from U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], commencement speaker for the Semi-Centennial celebration. The City of East Lansing was incorporated the same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Whitney. | title=East Lansing: Collegeville Revisited (Images of America) | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2002 | isbn=0-7385-2045-4 | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later the college changed its name to '''Michigan Agricultural College''' (M.A.C.).

=== Big Ten University ===
During the early 20th century, M.A.C. expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough it changed its name to '''Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science''' (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, [[John A. Hannah]], became president of the College.

After World War II, he began the largest expansion in the institution's history, with the help of the 1945 [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]], which helped World War II veterans gain college educations. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Heineman, Kenneth J. | title=Campus Wars: The Peace Movement at American State Universities in the Vietnam Era | location=New York | publisher=New York University Press | year=1993 | isbn=0-8147-3512-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Hannah continued MSU's expansion by co-founding Michigan State University–Oakland, now [[Oakland University]], with [[Matilda Dodge Wilson]]. Hannah also got the chance to improve the athletic reputation of M.S.C. when the [[University of Chicago]] resigned from the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 1946. Hannah lobbied to take its place, gaining admission in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Big 10 Now – Spartans Admitted|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=May 21, 1949|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years later, in its Centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan renamed the College as '''Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kuhn, Madison. | title=Michigan State: The First Hundred Years, 1855–1955 | location=East Lansing | publisher=Michigan State University Press | year=1955 | isbn=0-87013-222-9 | page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years afterward, the University governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the MSU Board of Trustees.

Since 1964, the institution has been '''Michigan State University'''.

=== Oakland University ===
In 1957, the donation of {{convert|1500|acre|km2}} in Pontiac Township, Oakland County, Michigan prompted creation of Michigan State University – Oakland.  That campus became the independent school, [[Oakland University]], in 1970.&lt;ref name="Oakland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/?id=1611&amp;sid=19|title=Oakland's History|publisher=Oakland University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716202800/http://www.oakland.edu/?id=1611&amp;sid=19|archivedate=July 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global Leadership Initiative, 2012 and Beyond ===
Since the end of the Hannah era in 1969, Michigan State shifted its focus from increasing the size of its student body to advancing its national and global reputation. In September 2005, president [[Lou Anna Simon]] called for MSU to become the global model leader for Land Grant institutions by 2012. Her plans included creating a new [[residential college]] and increased grants awarded from the [[National Institutes of Health]] past the US$100 million mark. While there are over 100 [[Land-grant universities]] in the United States, she stated she would like Michigan State University to be the leader.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, Bob.

The campus south of the river consists mostly of post-World War II [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] buildings, and is characterized by sparser foliage, relatively straight roadways, and many parking lots. The "2020 Vision" Master Plan proposes replacing these parking lots with [[multi-storey car park|parking ramps]] and green space,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://prod.gis.msu.edu/construction/update.jsp 2020 Vision Campus Master Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609102117/http://prod.gis.msu.edu/construction/update.jsp |date=June 9, 2010 }}".

As part of the master plan, the University erected a new bronze statue of ''[[Sparty|The Spartan]]'' in 2005 to be placed at the intersection of Chestnut and Kalamazoo, just south of the Red Cedar River. This replica replaced the original [[modernist]] [[terra cotta]] statue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Stanford, Linda | title=MSU Campus: Buildings, Places, Spaces | location=East Lansing, Michigan| publisher=Michigan State University Press | year=2002|isbn=0-87013-631-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can still be seen inside [[Spartan Stadium, East Lansing|Spartan Stadium]]. Notable academic and research buildings on the South Campus include the [[National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory|Cyclotron]], the [[Michigan State University College of Law|College of Law]], and the [[Facility for Rare Isotope Beams]] (FRIB).

This part of campus is home to the [[Michigan State University Horticulture Gardens|MSU Horticulture Gardens]] and the adjoining [[4-H]] Children's Garden. South of the gardens lie the [[Canadian National]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] railroads, which divide the main campus from thousands of acres of university-owned farmland. The university's agricultural facilities include the Horse, Dairy Cattle, Beef Cattle, Sheep, and Poultry Teaching and Research Farms, as well as the Air Quality Control Lab and the Diagnostics Center for Population and Animal Health.[[File:Wharton Center for Performing Arts.tif|thumb|The [[Wharton Center for Performing Arts]] hosts many productions throughout the year and was host to the final US Presidential Debate before the 1992 election.|257x257px]]

=== Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center ===
The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center doubles as a 4-star hotel and a business-friendly conference center. It is on the northwest corner of Michigan State University's campus, across from the [[Brody Complex]], on Harrison Road just south of Michigan Avenue. The hotel's 160 rooms and suites can accommodate anyone staying in East Lansing for a business conference, sporting event or an on-campus visit. Besides a lodging facility, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center is a "learning laboratory for the 300–400 students each year that are enrolled in The School of Hospitality Business and other majors." The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center strives to facilitate education by hosting conferences and seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kelloggcenter.com/about/history.html |title=Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721132424/http://www.kelloggcenter.com/about/history.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan State University is a participant in the [[Big Ten Academic Alliance]]. The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) is the academic consortium of the universities in the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Engaging in $10 billion in research in 2014–2015, BTAA universities provide powerful insight into important issues in medicine, technology, agriculture, and communities. Students at participating schools are also allowed "in-house" borrowing privileges at other schools' libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/library/reciprocal-borrowing/introduction |title=Reciprocal Library Borrowing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BTAA uses collective purchasing and licensing, and has saved member institutions $19 million to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/purchasing-and-licensing |title=Purchasing and Licensing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Course sharing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/SharedCourses.aspx|title=Sharing Access to Courses|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional development]] programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/Leadership.aspx|title=Leadership Development|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[study abroad]] and international collaborations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/GlobalCollaborations.aspx|title=Global Collaborations|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other initiatives are also part of the BTAA.

=== Endowment ===
MSU's (private, non-Morrill Act) [[financial endowment|endowment]] started in 1916 when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate [[R.E. Olds]] helped the program stay afloat with a gift of $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rodriguez, Michael | title=R.E. Olds and Industrial Lansing | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=0-7385-3272-X | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a time when MSU lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools (of the time), with barely over $100 million in endowment funds.

This changed dramatically in the 2000s (decade), when the University started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment. At the close of [[fiscal year]] 2004–2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school.&lt;ref&gt;Seguin, Rick. "[http://newsbulletin.msu.edu/jan2606/endowment.html Endowment surges in growth, rankings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902172725/http://www.newsbulletin.msu.edu/jan2606/endowment.html |date=September 2, 2006 }}".

Established in 1967, [[James Madison College]] is a smaller component residential college featuring multidisciplinary programs in the social sciences, founded on a model of liberal education.  James Madison College is housed in Case Hall. Classes in the college are small, with an average of 25 students, and most instructors are [[tenure]] track faculty.

'''Microscale chemistry''' (often referred to as '''small-scale chemistry''', in German: [[:de:Chemie im Mikromaßstab|'''Chemie im Mikromaßstab''']]) is an [[analytical method]] and also a [[teaching method]] widely used at [[school]] and at [[university]] levels, working with small quantities of [[chemical substance]]s. While much of traditional chemistry teaching centers on multi-gramme preparations, milligrammes of substances are sufficient for microscale chemistry. In universities, modern and expensive lab glassware is used and modern methods for detection and characterization of the produced substances are very common. In schools and in many countries of the Southern hemisphere, small-scale working takes place with low-cost and even no-cost material. There has always been a place for small-scale working in [[qualitative research|qualitative]] analysis, but the new developments can encompass much of chemistry a student is likely to meet.

== History ==
There are two main strands of the modern approach. 
One is based on the idea that many of the experiments associated with general chemistry (acids and bases, oxidation and reduction, electrochemistry, etc.) can be carried out in equipment much simpler (injection bottles, dropper bottles, syringes, wellplates, [[Pasteur pipette|plastic pipettes]]) and therefore cheaper than the traditional glassware in a laboratory, thus enabling the expansion of the laboratory experiences of students in large classes and to introduce laboratory work into institutions too poorly equipped for standard-type work. Pioneering development in this area was carried out by  Egerton C. Grey (1928),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grey |first=Egerton C |title=Practical Chemistry by Micro-Methods |year=1928 |publisher=W Heffer &amp; Sons Ltd |location=Cambridge |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmoud K. El-Marsafy (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.micrecol.de/chemarsafMCET| title = Microscale Chemistry Experimentation| accessdate = 2006-12-30| last = El-Marsafy| first = M K| year = 1989| work = MicrEcol| publisher = M.K.El-Marsafy| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235611/http://www.micrecol.de/chemarsafMCET| archivedate = 2007-09-26| df = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; in Egypt, Stephen Thompson in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.smallscalechemistry.colostate.edu| title = Small-Scale Chemistry| accessdate = 2006-12-30| last = Thompson| first = S| authorlink = | work = National Small-Scale Chemistry Centre| publisher = Colorado State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. A further application of these ideas was the devising by Bradley of the Radmaste kits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Bradley |first=J D |authorlink= |year=1999 |title=Hands-on practical chemistry for all |journal=Pure Appl. Chem. |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=817–823 |id= |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1999/71_05_pdf/bradley.pdf |accessdate=2006-12-30|doi=10.1351/pac199971050817 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; in South Africa, designed to make effective chemical experiments possible in developing countries in schools that lack the technical services (electricity, running water) taken for granted in many places.
The other strand is the introduction of this approach into synthetic work, mainly in organic chemistry. Here the crucial breakthrough was achieved by Mayo, Pike and Butcher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayo |first=D W |authorlink= |author2=R M Pike |author3=S S Butcher  |title=Microscale Organic Laboratory  |year=1986 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-471-82448-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Williamson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=K L |authorlink= |title=Macroscale and Microscale Organic Experiments |year=1989 |publisher=D C Heath |location=Lexington, Mass |isbn=0-669-19429-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who demonstrated that inexperienced students were able to carry out organic syntheses on a few tens of milligrams, a skill previously thought to require years of training and experience. These approaches were accompanied by the introduction of some specialised equipment, which was subsequently simplified by Breuer without great loss of versatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breuer |first=S W |authorlink= |title=Microscale Practical Organic Chemistry |year=1996 |publisher=Lancaster University |location= |id= }} The text of the book is available in electronical format free from the author.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a great deal of published material available to help in the introduction of such a scheme, providing advice on choice of equipment, techniques and preparative experiments and the flow of such material is continuing through a column in the ''Journal of Chemical Education'' called 'The Microscale Laboratory' that has been running for many years.
Scaling down experiments, when combined with modern projection technology, opened up the possibility of carrying out lecture demonstrations of the most hazardous kind in total safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.icu.ac.jp/MCE/MinisympoMCE_Tokyo06Web/ |title=MicroMiniSympo06Web |accessdate=2006-12-30 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The approach has been adopted worldwide. It has become a major presence on the educational scene in the US, it is used to a lesser extent in the UK and it is used in many countries in institutions with staff who are enthusiastic about it. For example, in India, small scale chemistry/ microscale chemistry is now implemented in a few universities and colleges.

The '''National Balloon Facility''', also known as the TIFR Balloon Facility, is a stratospheric-balloon launch base under the joint management of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (TIFR) and the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO). This institute is located at [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] near [[Electronics Corporation of India Limited]] (ECIL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stratocat.com.ar/bases/31e.htm|title=Stratospheric balloon launch bases and sites|publisher=StratoCat|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being the only major balloon facility in the world close to the [[Magnetic dip#Explanation|geomagnetic equator]], this facility is extensively used by researchers from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/about%20us.html|title=NBF History|publisher=TIFR|accessdate=19 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031029142857/http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/about%20us.html|archivedate=29 October 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ballooning activity in India was prompted by research into atmospheric exploration and cosmic ray studies. During the 1940s, Dr. [[Homi J. Bhabha]] of TIFR started sending balloons up to an altitude of 25&amp;nbsp;km to study secondary cosmic radiation. Due to unique geographic reasons [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] was selected for stratospheric balloon launches. After various diplomatic meetings arrangements were made by US and Indian organisations to jointly launch balloons from Hyderabad. The first launch had support of Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory (AFCRL) and TIFR.

The launches were carried out from two locations. US balloons were launched from [[Begumpet Airport]] and Indian balloons from [[Osmania University]] Campus. The first balloon was launched on 2 February 1961. During the first stage of the facility's operation, forty balloons were launched.

After five years all the facilities were consolidated at Osmania University and under management of [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] &amp; TIFR and around 170 balloons were launched.

After a few years with increasing demands for balloon flights, a relatively low population density and proximity to the geomagnetic equator, a permanent site at Hyderabad near ECIL was selected. However, presently due to rapid development this facility is today surrounded by several population settlements: by the [[Cherlapally Central Jail]] in the east;  [[Kamala Nagar, Hyderabad|Kamala Nagar]] in the west; and [[Electronics Corporation of India]] Ltd. in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stratocat.com.ar/bases/31e.htm|title=Stratospheric balloon launch bases and sites|publisher=StratoCat|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The campus contains a complete balloon manufacturing facility. The institute conducts balloon-based scientific experiments in X-ray and [[Infrared Astronomy]], and in [[Aeronomy]].
Balloons from this facility are launched twice in a year, i.e. in summer and winter. NBF also regularly monitors and analyses local weather at [[tropospheric]] and [[stratospheric]] altitudes, required for making decisions about balloon launches.

Under the High Altitude Balloon Development Project, a 61,000m³ indigenously developed balloon penetrated into the Mesosphere on 7 January 2014, for the first time in India. Until that time, only balloons from USA and Japan had accomplished this feat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/HAA_Record.html HAA Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the distinct ecosystems is the Riverine Forest. These are found on the lower flood plains along the rivers edge. The main species found here is one of the deciduous species; the [[Populus balsamifera|Balsam Poplar]]. These trees like a high volume of moisture and are able to tolerate flooding. They are distinguishable by their thick, gnarly bark and their larger, pointed leaves. These leaves have a distinct drip tip. The trees supply homes for the many native species of fauna. 

Other Key trees include [[Betula alleghaniensis|yellow birch]], [[Betula papyrifera|white birch]], [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]], [[Fagus grandifolia|American beech]], [[Tsuga canadensis|eastern hemlock]], [[white pine]], [[Pinus resinosa|red pine]], [[Quercus rubra|northern red oak]], [[Prunus pensylvanica|pin cherry]], and [[Picea rubens|red spruce]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[criminology]], the '''power-control theory of gender and delinquency''' (abbreviated as the '''power-control theory''') holds the gender distribution of [[:wikt:delinquency|delinquency]] is caused by stratification from [[gender role|gender relations]] within the [[family]].&lt;ref name="MessnerKrohn1989"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Steven F.

The theory states that the [[social class|class]], [[gender]], and type of family structure (e.g. [[egalitarian]] or [[patriarchal]]) will influence the severity of social/parental control practiced which will in turn set the "accepted norm" for the child/individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soc.umn.edu/~uggen/4141lec18.pdf|title=41481lec18|date=2008-04-03|work=Powerpoint notes|pages=2|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.

Power-control theory differs from other control theories that view crime as a cause of low [[social status]] (cited from book). This theory compares gender and parental control mechanisms in two different types of families; patriarchal and egalitarian to explain the differences in self-reported male and female misconduct. In patriarchal families, traditional gender roles were in practice, where the father would work outside the home, and the mother would be responsible for the child rearing. In egalitarian families, the household roles were shared equally between mothers and fathers.&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady 2007, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was originally posited by [[John Hagan (sociologist)|John Hagan]] and further developed by [[A. R. Gillis]] and [[John Simpson (sociologist)|John Simpson]] at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="clarify and extend"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hagan|first1=John |first2=A. R. |last2=Gillis |first3=John |last3=Simpson|date=January 1990|title=Clarifiying and Extending Power-Control Theory|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|publisher=University of Toronto|volume= 95|issue= 4|pages=1024–1037|jstor=2780649|doi=10.1086/229384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The power control theory was developed through a series of self-report surveys that was administered to high school students and their parents in suburban Toronto. Hagan and his colleagues contended that gender and the social class of the students' parents affected how much freedom these students had. For example, coming of age as they argued, was a more limiting experience than growing up as a male. Thereby, they found that the amount of power a parent had in the workplace was related to the control displayed in the household over their teenaged children. Moreover, parents who had the types of jobs where they must supervise the activities of subordinates also tended to be relatively tolerant of the trouble-making behaviour of their children, especially of their sons. This meant that teenaged boys are freer to deviate than teenaged girls. This study also found, focusing on relatively minor forms of deviance such as shoplifting and breaking street lights, that middle-class youth actually were freer to deviate than working-class youth.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 2007, p. 111"&gt;O'Grady 2007, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

According to Julian Tanner, he offers two interesting critical comments. Though the power control theory effectively explains common delinquency among ordinary youth, it does not explain violent and repetitive crime and, therefore, the power control theory cannot predict such behavior. In addition, the power control theory suggests that parents in egalitarian households are more likely to raise females as delinquent than a female growing up in a patriarchal family; however, UCR (uniform crime report) data shows that the opposite association exists and that the involvement in female labor force is actually related to lower levels of female delinquency. Also, after years of refining the power control theory, theorists have found the notion that mothers being more controlling over their daughters are more likely to be found in egalitarian families than patriarchal families, which is the opposite relationship the power control theory would likely predict.

When the theory was refined over the years, Singer and Levine (1988) found mixed support for the theory in their early attempts to test this theory. While mothers were seen to be more controlling over their daughters than their sons, the authors also found this to be more so with egalitarian than patriarchal families, which is a finding opposite to what power control theory would predict.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 2007, p. 111"/&gt;

==Theory extended beyond family==

The theory has been extended into adult social roles as well. Stratified behaviors typically associated with males, particularly those in authoritative positions, are now being seen more frequently in females attaining powerful roles. And like their male counterparts, their power is used to control those persons in subordinate roles, as indicated by the rise in reports of sexual harassment (cougar syndrome) and cronyism.

Despite the explanation of social roles, there has not been a feminist theory that is fully developed to explain for the uniqueness of female criminality. While males are reported to be more involved in every type of crime, females tend to be arrested for considerably minor property crimes. This is due to the idea that the character and level of female crime is not consistent with the traditional sociological explanations of crime.&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady 2007, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Many ornamental [[freshwater aquarium]] fish, including the cardinal tetra and the [[Discus (fish)|discus]] (''Symphysodon'' ssp.), are sourced from the [[Amazon River basin]] area.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The Rio Negro region is the home of more than 100 different species of fish that are important to the pet fish trade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.feow.org/ecoregions/details/rio_negro|title = 314: Rio Negro|date = |accessdate = 6 August 2015|website = Freshwater Ecoregions of the World|publisher = The Nature Conservancy|last = Petry|first = Paulo|last2 = Hales|first2 = Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact several species, including cardinal tetras, show the adaptive trait of [[iridescence]] which may provide lower visibility in a [[Blackwater river|blackwater]] environment.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Project ''Piaba'' started with an ecological [[Measurement|baseline]] study of the region which was conducted in 1989 by a group of researchers and students from the [[Federal University of Amazonas|Universidade do Amazonas]] (UA) and the National Institute of Amazon Research (INPA).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ornamental-fish-int.org/research-support/projeto-piaba|title = Project Piaba|last = Chao|first = Ning Labbish|date = May 2002|journal = Ornamental Fish International|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 6 August 2015|issue = 39|last2 = Prang|first2 = Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initial survey discovered and documented the importance of the fish trade to the local [[economy]] and it led the researchers to wonder about the impact the fishing had on the environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Development ==
In the 1950s, [[Herbert R. Axelrod]] and Willi Schwarz had begun shipping aquarium fish out of [[Barcelos, Amazonas|Barcelos]] in Brazil.&lt;ref name=PracFish&gt;[https://web.archive.org/save/http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/news/fishkeeping-news/articles/2017/5/30/obituary-dr-herbert-r-axelrod "Obituary: Dr. Herbert R. Axelrod"]. ''Practical Fishkeeping'', 30 May 2017. Archived 20 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Ning Labbish Chao and Gregory Prang founded Project ''Piaba'' in order to support the local fisheries and in concert with them, help protect the habitat of collected fishes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because of the "gentle" way the fish are caught and the fact that most of the fish caught for the aquarium trade are short-lived and would naturally die out during the dry season, the ecological impact of catching the fish is considered minimal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The fish are also not caught by fish farmers during their breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fishchannel.com/fish-species/freshwater-profiles/cardinal-tetra-2.aspx|title = Cardinal Tetra Fish Stats|date = |accessdate = 7 August 2015|website = Fish Channel|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cardinal tetra, especially, is considered a [[renewable resource]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/06/24/endangered-fish-dna-barcoding|title = Can DNA Barcoding Really Save Endangered Fish?|last = Conniff|first = Richard|date = 24 June 2013|work = Take Part|access-date = 7 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Project ''Piaba'' assesses the sustainability of the species farmed in the Rio Negro area by using the "[[F-distribution|F value]]" which estimates the portion of the catch from the total biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.opefe.com/PPiaba_webver.doc|title = Forever 'Project Piaba'|date = 2008|accessdate = 7 August 2015|website = Oregon Piranha Exotic Fish Exhibit (OPEFE)|publisher = |last = Chao|first = Ning Labbish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center of the Rio Negro aquarium trade, [[Barcelos, Amazonas|Barcelos]], now celebrates ornamental fish in a festival held every January in conjunction with the annual research expedition of Project ''Piaba''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A stadium, known as Piabodrome, was even built for the festival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first festival took place in 1994 and a permanent exhibit highlighting the fish was installed in Barcelos by Project ''Piaba'' that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tfhmagazine.com/details/articles/hope-along-the-rio-negro-part-1-the-view-from-manaus.htm|title = Hope Along the Rio Negro Part 1: The View From Manaus|last = Carey|first = Randy|date = March 2007|journal = The Fish Hobbyist Magazine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money donated by [[Ichthyology|ichthyologist]], [[Herbert R.

The project has acted as a case study for other, similar projects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Areas such as the [[Western Ghats]] in [[India]] and areas of [[Bali]] are beginning to use similar practices in order to make money from the fish trade and sustain the environment of the fish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Project ''Piab''a is often used to show how groups can support the environment while providing economic stimulus to a poor region of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.petproductnews.com/July-2015/International-Waters-Industry-Unfairly-Attacked--Again/|title = International Waters: Industry Unfairly Attacked...

[[File:HelenHillListenTotheRoosterFeb06.jpg|thumb|We may appear to be listening when we are not]]
'''Pseudo-listening''' is a type of '''non-listening''' that consists of appearing attentive in conversation while actually ignoring or only partially listening to the other speaker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/pseudolisten&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of pseudo-listening is not to listen, but to cater to some other personal need of the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Messages: The Communication Skill Book|last = McKay|first = Matthew|publisher = New Harbinger Publications|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-57224-592-1|location = Oakland, Ca|pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word pseudo-listening is a compound word composed of the individual words [[Pseudo-|pseudo]] (a Greek root meaning "not real or genuine"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = pseudo {{!}} not real or genuine|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pseudo|website = www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[listening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the definition of listening|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/listening?s=t|website = Dictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of pseudo-listening is trying to multitask by talking on the phone while watching television or completing work.&lt;ref name="Burch"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interpersonal Communication: Building Your Foundations for Success|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n9Txn-cKH80C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=pseudo+listening&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIy8qOtf21yAIVSD4-Ch1-NABD#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudo%2520listening&amp;f=false|publisher = Kendall Hunt|date = 2004-08-01|isbn = 9780757509544|first = Michelle|last = Burch|first2 = Michelle Burch|last2 = Coleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudo-listening is the most ineffective way to communicate because after the conversation one will not have retained much of the information that was said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Llangari|first1=Edwing|title=Pseudolistening|url=http://edwingllangari.efoliomn.com/pseudolistening|website=Edwing Llangari|publisher=myeflio|accessdate=10/9/2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible reasons ==

# Listening for ways someone can reject you.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter 9 Summary|url = http://faculty.mdc.edu/mroqueta/ch9summary.htm|website = Miami Dade College, Dr. Mildred Roqueta|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Forming your response to the speaker instead of focusing on what is being said.  
# Preoccupation, when there is too much on the mind of the listener, so that they cannot listen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The 1973 annual handbook for group facilitators|last = Pfeiffer|first = William|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|year = 1973|isbn = 9780787903800|location = San Diego|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Preexisting familiarity with the topic of conversation, which results in less effort to actively listen. 
# Only listening for information you want to hear, giving little attention to the rest. 
# Listening only for the flaws in their argument in order to gain an advantage over the speaker. 
# Social pressure to be courteous to those speaking. 
# Hope that they will believe you are listening and return the favor. 
# An effort to build others' views of you. 
# Desire not to hurt someone who is sharing experiences.

== In comparison to active listening ==

Individuals who are pseudo-listening may include minimal encouragers to compensate for their non-listening, such as nodding their heads, looking at the speaker, smiling at the appropriate times, and displaying other aspects of paying attention, so it may be difficult at times to distinguish between active listening and pseudo-listening. Similarly, broad answers or responses that are not relevant to the topic at hand also give away a pseudo-listener. These responses are known as '''tangential responses''' and often run alongside the topic being discussed, but ultimately have nothing to do with the main topic of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Julia|title=Interpersonal Communication|date=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-285-44583-0|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper listening is needed to internalize and comprehend material; without this developed skill, there is potential for either pseudo-listening or a total lack of listening. A person who is truly listening may display certain body language such as maintaining eye contact or positioning their body towards the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Communication and Interpersonal Relationships - Counseling and Health Services|url = http://drexel.edu/healthservices/resources/students/communication/|website = Counseling and Health Services|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real listening is done with the intent to understand a person's perspective, enjoy a person's company, learn new information, or provide assistance or comfort, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Intercultural communication: a teaching and learning framework {{!}} LLAS Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies|url = https://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/paper/1303|website = www.llas.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it affects communication ==

Pseudo-listening is most common in face-to-face communication, but it can also be expressed through phone calls, text messages and e-mails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Listen Like You Mean It|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jennifer-rosen/listen-like-you-mean-it_b_6136092.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective communication is dependent upon both the receiver and the sender to be fully aware of what is being said and heard. When one person projects their thoughts, and the receiver of the message is only pretending to listen, poor communication and possibly misunderstanding often occur. Babies spend their first few years listening to people around them in order to learn language (Childs, Acott-Smith, &amp; Curtis, 1999). According to Edwing Llangari people spend around half their lives listening to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://edwingllangari.efoliomn.com/pseudolistening|title = Edwing Llangari}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article from University of Colorado states that poor listening skills make good communication pretty much impossible to achieve. It says that, "no matter how much care one person or group takes to communicate their concerns, values, interests, or needs in a fair, clear, unthreatening way, if the listener is not willing to receive that information in that way, the communication will fail."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = I’m Sorry What Were You Saying? {{!}} A Look At Interpersonal Communication|url = http://blogs.longwood.edu/matthewmcpartland/2012/10/25/im-sorry-what-were-you-saying/|website = blogs.longwood.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== With couples ===

There are many negative effects on romantic relationships caused by pseudo-listening. These effects can range from making romantic partners feel upset, inhibiting the partner's ability to effectively solve problems, encouraging an unhealthy dependence on the listener, raising the partner's level of stress, making the relationship, as a whole, less stable, causing the romantic partner to be less satisfied with the relationship, and even causing negative effects on the romantic partner's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What are the consequences when you don't listen well?|url = http://www.youmeworks.com/consequences.html|website = www.youmeworks.com|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It’s important to recognize that there are two parts to any conversation, the person doing the talking and the person who is trying to actively listen.

=== With parents and children ===

Among families, teenagers engage in pseudo-listening the most. Teenagers may engage in pseudo-listening because they feel they have better things to do.They may also tune into distractions and act like they are listening. In doing so, it is evident that they listen only when they want to listen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ncur20.com/presentations/13/1388/paper.pdf|title = The Tricky Transition: Communication in the Mother and Adolescent-Daughter Relationship|last = Kraemer|first = Ashley A.|date = 2006|journal = UW-Whitewater Wisconsin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that as people get older, pseudo-listening skills increase. An experiment was done on first-grade and second grade children to see if they could repeat what the teacher had been saying. 90% of first graders and 80% of the second-graders could do so; but when the experiment was repeated with teenagers, only 44% of junior high students and 28% of senior high students could repeat their teachers’ remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baba|first1=Josephine|title=OVERCOMING CHALLENGES TO EFFECTIVE LISTENING-Faulty listening behavious|url=http://wecommunication.blogspot.com/2015/09/overcoming-challenges-to-effective.html|accessdate=Oct 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for parents to have good listening skills, because poor listening from parents can cause the child to be closed off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ncur20.com/presentations/13/1388/paper.pdf|title = The Tricky Transition: Communication in the Mother and Adolescent-Daughter Relationship|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In a classroom ===

[[File:Physical Sciences Classroom.jpg|thumb|Many students pseudolisten during class due to numerous distractions.]]
Recent studies reveal that students rarely encounter curriculum focused on learning and developing the skill of listening. It is possible for a student to go through every level of education without ever having a class teaching them how to listen effectively in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Who's Listening in the Classroom? A Research Paradigm.|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED407659|date = 1997-03-14|first = Charles H.|last = Swanson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often students fall victim to pseudo-listening because of all the distractions they have at their finger tips, such as phones, computers, social media, iPods, etc. Students will often pretend to be listening so that the professor of the class does not verbally chastise, or to avoid being perceived as rude. Effective listening from a teacher is a way of showing concern for their subordinates, which fosters cohesive bonds, commitment, and trust: this can help a class to pay attention and learn what is being taught.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Leaders===

Leadership often involves forming a commitment to the people one is leading, and a large part of this is related to active listening. Pseudo-listening undermines this commitment process and leads to ineffective leadership. Many people think they are listening to others all the time, and while they certainly may be hearing what these people are saying, they are engaging in pseudo-listening. Over time, pseudo-listening can not only weaken perceptions of one as  a leader, but can contribute to problems active listening could otherwise fix and lead to barriers against success in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/236257286?accountid=14472|title = The People Side of Leadership: An Overlooked Opportunity|last = Leheney|first = Mark|date = 2008|journal = Public Manager|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 37|issue = 2|pages = 15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the job, we may need to appear interested in what others say because of their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication Mosaics: An Introduction to the Field of Communication|last = Wood|first = Julia|publisher = Cengage Learning|year = 2010|isbn = 9781111786366|location = |pages = 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features that contribute ==
Things such as an accent, height, weight, scars, and even something as small as body posture can all contribute to an audience falling victim to pseudo-listening. Being self-conscious about some of these personal flaws as a speaker may inhibit the listeners experience. This lack of self-confidence could lead to other distractions made by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Be Less Self-Conscious|url = http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/01/26/how-to-be-less-self-conscious/|website = Psych Central.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt; While these physical flaws may lead to disinterest in the reader it could also contribute to nervous actions that may also distract the reader. A few examples of these nervous actions may include but are not limited to clenching your hands, adjusting your hair or clothing, and pacing back and forth while speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10 Public Speaking Habits To Avoid At All Costs|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/10-public-speaking-habits-to-avoid-2014-6|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions may lead to a disinterest in the context of a speech and an elevated interest in the person speaking or the environment surrounding them.

Environmental factors such as lighting, temperature, and furniture can affect the attention of the audience in relation to what the speaker has to say. Lighting that is too dark can make an audience tired and consequently disinterested in what the speaker has to say. Temperature and seating arrangements can distract an audience by causing them discomfort, shifting their focus to their own annoyance. Being too far from a speaker can also cause the audience to lose focus because of a sort of "[[Hawthorne effect]]. Physiological noise can also lead to distractions that take an audiences attention from the speaker. This noise may range from ailments and illness, all the way to emotions like arousal. Both sides of the spectrum can affect the audiences attention, for example, a speaker giving a speech while under the illness of a cold will have a stuffy nose or a recurring cough, which can take the audience's focus from the speaker to his cold. The audience can also be influenced by their own lives by shifting their focus on what they will eat for lunch, losing or finding a job, personal relationships, etc. These can all overshadow the messages and ideas that the speaker is trying to deliver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Listening|url = http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/a-primer-on-communication-studies/s05-listening.html|website = 2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facial features as distractions ===

[[File:Matt Wiman Pointy Mustache.jpg|thumb|Try listening to anything this guy has to say - you might find yourself pseudolistening]]
Because facial hair is a striking characteristic of one's face, people often notice and focus on an individual's facial hair. Because of this, listeners may fall victim to pseudolistening. Instead of making eye contact, listeners might focus on the speaker's mustache or beard instead of [[active listening|actively listening]]. Facial hair is distracting to both listeners and observers.This concept can also be applied to situations in which a person has something stuck in his teeth, has visible mucus in his nose, or has conspicuous piercings and tattoos on his face.

=== How to avoid it  ===
Effective listening is crucial to proper communication in everyday life. However, active listening is not a natural process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are You Really Listening?|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/02683949210018331|journal = Journal of Managerial Psychology|pages = 17–21|volume = 7|issue = 6|doi = 10.1108/02683949210018331|first = Marilyn M.|last = Helms|first2 = Paula J.|last2 = Haynes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, even people who consider themselves good listeners often only listen with 25% efficiency.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Effective Listening|url = http://www.wright.edu/~scott.williams/LeaderLetter/listening.htm|website = www.wright.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 9 Things Good Listeners Do Differently|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/habits-of-good-listeners_n_5668590.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active listening involves attentive body language, restating comments and emotions of the speaker, and repeating their ideas back in order to check comprehension accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Training Married Couples in Listening Skills: Effects on Behavior, Perceptual Accuracy and Marital Adjustment|jstor = 584144|journal = Family Relations|date = 1981-04-01|pages = 297–306|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.2307/584144|first = Diana R.|last = Garland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to improve your listening skills. Begin by observing your conversations, and pay special notice to the times you begin to get distracted or ignore the other person and see how it affects your relationships. Once you understand your patterns in conversations, it's easier to change the negative aspects of your conversations. There are three main guidelines everyone should follow if they want to become effective listeners. The most important guideline is being mindful, that is, being disciplined and committed when trying to listen. The next guideline is adapting to listening appropriately because it is beneficial to be skilled in many listening behaviors and to know when each is important. The final guideline to becoming an effective listener is listening actively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interpersonal Communication: Everyday Encounters|last = Wood|first = Julia|publisher = Cenage Learning|year = |isbn = 978-1-305-63452-7|location = Boston, Massachusetts|pages = 182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To listen actively, keep eye contact with the speaker, nod when a message is understood, etc. Paraphrasing what was said in order to communicate to the speaker that you understood their message correctly will also improve listening skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://faculty.northseattle.edu/wholt/bus236/lessons/s05files/listen2.pdf|title = Active Listening: Hear What People are Really Saying|date = |accessdate = 10/7/2015|website = MindTools|publisher = MindTools|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A good tag phrase for paraphrasing is "What I'm hearing you say is...", followed by the question, "Is that right?" This combination of repeating back and asking for confirmation of accuracy frees the speaker to correct any previous ineffective communication.

=== Signs someone is not listening ===
One way to detect pseudolistening is eye fixation: in relaxed conversations, the eye tends to wander or look at other parts of your face. We also tend to smile at one another to reinforce that we agree with them and are listening. The pseudo-listener will do the same but will often smile for too long. During a conversation between two people, their bodies will face each other. A false listener, however, will not have engaged body language; instead, whether their feet face away or they sit next to rather than across from the other person, it is as if their body is trying to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 7 Signs Someone's Not Listening To You|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/signs-someone-is-not-listening-2014-6|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
* Ambushing: Waiting to trap the speaker in his/her own words or ideas; mostly used to support a belief or to prove something.
* Assimilation to Prior Messages: Believing new messages relate to past messages; forgetting that communication changes.
* Critical Listening: Not to be confused with defensive listening, critical listening is listening to analyze and understand the speaker's messages, written or spoken.&lt;ref name="Burch"/&gt; 
* Defensive Listening: A form of listening where the remarks by the speaker are taken personally, so the listener seeks a way to defend themselves against the perceived attack.&lt;ref name="Burch"/&gt;
* Filling in the Gaps: After hearing the beginning, assuming that the information given is the whole story.
* Insensitive Listening: Failing to notice hidden meanings or nonverbal cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poor Listening Habits|url = http://www.theexecutiveadvisory.com/toolkit/poor_listenting_habits.html|website = www.theexecutiveadvisory.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Insulated Listening: Avoiding certain topics.
* Selective Listening: Only paying attention to what one is interested in while ignoring and avoiding the rest of the information given.
* Stage-Hogging: Not really caring for what others have to say: only worried about yourself.

===False representations===

Auditory processing disorder is when a person "is perfectly aware of sounds" yet their brain abnormally deciphers the sounds. This could easily be confused with pseudo-listening because it effects a listeners' reading comprehension. The two differ because auditory processing disorder uncontrollable and unintentional, while pseudolistening is typically done purposely.

'''Ruth Deborah Gates''' (March 28, 1962 – October 25, 2018) was the Director of the [[Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology]] and the first woman to be President of the [[International Society for Reef Studies]]. Her research was dedicated to understanding [[coral reef]] ecosystems, specifically coral-algal symbiosis and the capacity for corals to acclimatize under future [[climate change]] conditions.&lt;ref name=gs&gt;{{Google scholar id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Gates was inspired by the documentary ''[[The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/a-radical-attempt-to-save-the-reefs-and-forests|title=A Radical Attempt to Save the Reefs and Forests|work=The New Yorker|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=2016-04-18|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied biology at [[Newcastle University]] where she earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1984.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gatescorallab.com/ruth-gates|title=Ruth Gates|website=gatescorallab.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She fell in love with corals during a diving trip to the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hawaiibusiness.com/20-for-the-next-20-2016/|title=20 for the Next 20: 2016|date=2016-03-03|work=Hawaii Business Magazine|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 she moved to the [[West Indies]] to study corals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She completed her [[PhD]] at [[Newcastle University]] in 1989 on seawater temperature and [[algal]]-[[cnidaria]]n [[symbiosis]].&lt;ref name=gatesphd&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Newcastle upon Tyne|url=https://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/18918380?style=html|title=Seawater temperature and algal-cnidarian symbiosis|first= Ruth Deborah|last=Gates|date=1989|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.346445}}|website=jisc.ac.uk|oclc=557254204}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career and research==
After her PhD, Gates was appointed a [[postdoctoral researcher]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She spent thirteen years working as a junior researcher in California. She was there during the 1998 [[bleaching event]] that killed more than 15 % of corals across the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gates joined the [[Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology]] 2003.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tetiaroasociety.org/ruth-gates|title=Ruth Gates {{!}} Tetiaroa Society|website=www.tetiaroasociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied corals and reefs, learning how they function and working on ways to slow their decline.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She worked on [[Coconut Island]], trying to identify why some corals survive bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/03/corals-ocean-temperature/|title=Some Corals May Adapt to Warming Seas|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her group monitored the ecosystems of coral reefs to understand how a changing environment impacted coral health.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gatescorallab.com/monitoring-reefs|title=Monitoring Reefs|website=gatescorallab.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corals in shallow patches like [[Kāneʻohe Bay]] are subject to high temperatures and irradiance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Alongside seawater temperature, they measure photosynthetic active radiation, salinity and nutrient composition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This allowed them to build [[3D modeling|3D models]] of reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TheJohnburns84|title=Ke'ei|date=2015-10-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxZLu7wByKY&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They study the [[symbiodinium]] that live within coral tissues.

==Controversy==
{{Main|Hashima_Island#World_Heritage_Site_approval_controversy}}
The inclusion of some of these properties as UNESCO Heritage sites faced concerns and objections from Korea, due to the fact that conscripted Korean civilians and Chinese prisoners-of-war were forced to work under harsh conditions at seven of these sites during Japan's [[World War II]] mobilization policies. Recent academic research has questioned the Japanese government's compliance with UNESCO regulations and requirements with respect to the Hashima site.&lt;ref&gt;https://apjjf.org/2018/01/Palmer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social media mining''' is the process of obtaining [[big data]] from user-generated content on social media sites and [[mobile apps]] in order to extract patterns, form conclusions about users, and act upon the information, often for the purpose of advertising to users or conducting research. The term is an analogy to the resource extraction process of [[mining]] for rare minerals. Resource extraction mining requires mining companies to sift through vast quantities of raw ore to find the precious minerals; likewise, social media mining requires human data analysts and automated software programs to sift through massive amounts of raw social media data in order to discern patterns and trends relating to social media usage, online behaviours, sharing of content, connections between individuals, online buying behaviour, and more. These patterns and trends are of interest to companies, governments and not-for-profit organizations, as these organizations can use these patterns and trends to design their strategies or introduce new programs, new products, processes or services.

Social media mining uses a range of basic concepts from [[computer science]], [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] and [[statistics]]. Social media miners develop [[algorithm]]s suitable for investigating massive files of social media data. Social media mining is based on theories and methodologies from  [[social network analysis]], [[network science]], [[sociology]], [[ethnography]], optimization and mathematics. It encompasses the tools to formally represent, measure and model meaningful patterns from large-scale social media data.&lt;ref name="Zafarani"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zafarani |first1=Reza |last2=Abbasi |first2=Mohammad Ali |last3=Liu |first3=Huan |title=Social Media Mining: An Introduction |year=2014 |url=http://dmml.asu.edu/smm |accessdate = 15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, major corporations, governments and not-for-profit organizations engaged in social media mining to obtain data about customers, clients and citizens.

==Background==

As defined by Kaplan and Haenlein,&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Andreas M. |last2=Haenlein |first2=Michael|title=Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of social media |year=2010 |journal = Business Horizons | volume = 53 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; social media is the "group of internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content." There are many categories of social media including, but not limited to, social networking (Facebook or LinkedIn), microblogging (Twitter), photo sharing (Flickr, Photobucket, or Picasa), news aggregation (Google reader, StumbleUpon, or Feedburner), video sharing (YouTube, MetaCafe), livecasting (Ustream or Twitch.tv), virtual worlds (Kaneva), social gaming (World of Warcraft), social search (Google, Bing, or Ask.com), and instant messaging (Google Talk, Skype, or Yahoo! messenger).

The first social media website was introduced by [[GeoCities]] in 1994. It enabled users to create their own homepages without having a sophisticated knowledge of [[HTML]] coding. The first social networking site, [[SixDegrees.com]], was introduced in 1997. Since then, many other social media sites have been introduced, each providing service to millions of people. These individuals form a virtual world in which individuals (social atoms), entities (content, sites, etc.) and interactions (between individuals, between entities, between individuals and entities) coexist. Social norms and human behavior govern this virtual world. By understanding these social norms and models of human behavior and combining them with the observations and measurements of this virtual world, one can systematically analyze and mine social media. Social media mining is the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful patterns from data in social media, resulting from social interactions. It is an interdisciplinary field encompassing techniques from computer science, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, network science, sociology, ethnography, statistics, optimization, and mathematics. Social media mining faces grand challenges such as the big data paradox, obtaining sufficient samples, the noise removal fallacy, and evaluation dilemma.
Social media mining represents the virtual world of social media in a computable way, measures it, and designs models that can help us understand its interactions. In addition, social media mining provides necessary tools to mine this world for interesting patterns, analyze information diffusion, study influence and homophily, provide effective recommendations, and analyze novel social behavior in social media.

== Uses ==

Social media mining is used across several industries including business development, social science research, health services, and educational purposes.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"&gt;Zafarani, R., Ali Abbasi, M., Liu, H., (2014). Social Media Mining. Cambridge University Press. http://dmml.asu.edu/smm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh, A., (2017). "Mining of Social Media data of University students." ''Education and Information Technologies'', 22: 1515-1526.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the data received goes through [[social media analytics]], it can then be applied to these various fields. Often, companies use the patterns of connectivity that pervade social networks, such as assortativity—the social similarity between users that are induced by influence, homophily, and reciprocity and transitivity.&lt;ref name="Tang, J. 2016"&gt;Tang, J., Chang, Y., Aggarwal, C., Liu, H., (2016). "A Survey of Signed Network Mining in Social Media". ''ACM Computing Surveys'', 49: 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These forces are then measured via statistical analysis of the nodes and connections between these nodes.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Social analytics also uses [[sentiment analysis]], because social media users often relay positive or negative sentiment in their posts.&lt;ref name="Adedoyin-Olowe, M. 2013"&gt;Adedoyin-Olowe, M., Gaber, M., &amp; Stahl, F., (2013). "A Survey of Data Mining Techniques for Social Media Analysis."&lt;/ref&gt; This provides important social information about users' emotions on specific topics.&lt;ref&gt;Laeeq, F., Nafis, T., &amp; Beg, M. (2017). "Sentimental Classification of Social Media using Dating Mining." ''International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science'', 8: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

These three patterns have several uses beyond pure analysis. For example, influence can be used to determine the most influential user in a particular network.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Companies would be interested in this information in order to decide who they may hire for [[influencer marketing]]. These influencers are determined by recognition, activity generation, and novelty—three requirements that can be measured through the data mined from these sites.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Analysts also value measures of homophily: the tendency of two similar individuals to become friends.&lt;ref name="Tang, J. 2016"/&gt; Users have begun to rely on information of other users' opinions in order to understand diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="Adedoyin-Olowe, M. 2013"/&gt; These analyses can also help create recommendations for individuals in a tailored capacity.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; By measuring influence and homophily, online and offline companies are able to suggest specific products for individuals consumers, and groups of consumers. Social media networks can use this information themselves to suggest to their users possible friends to add, pages to follow, and accounts to interact with.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13014">'''Social physics''' or '''sociophysics''' is a field of science which uses mathematical tools inspired by [[physics]] to understand the behavior of human crowds. In a modern commercial use, it can also refer to the analysis of social phenomena with [[big data]].

Social physics is closely related to [[econophysics]] which uses physics methods to describe [[economics]].

==History==
The first elements of social physics were outlined in French social thinker [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]]’s first book, the 1803 ''Lettres d’un Habitant de Geneve'', which described the idea of describing society using laws similar to those of the physical and biological sciences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iggers|first=Georg G.|year=1959|title=Further Remarks about Early Uses of the Term "Social Science"|jstor=2708121|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|volume=20|issue=3|pages=433–436|doi=10.2307/2708121}}&lt;/ref&gt; His student and collaborator was [[Auguste Comte]], a French philosopher widely regarded as the founder of [[sociology]], who first defined the term in an essay appearing in ''Le Producteur'', a journal project by Saint-Simon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Comte defined social physics as&lt;blockquote&gt;Social physics is that science which occupies itself with social phenomena, considered in the same light as astronomical, physical, chemical, and physiological phenomena, that is to say as being subject to natural and invariable laws, the discovery of which is the special object of its researches. &lt;/blockquote&gt;After Saint-Simon and Comte, Belgian statistician [[Adolphe Quetelet]], proposed that society be modeled using [[mathematical probability]] and [[social statistics]]. Quetelet's 1835 book, ''Essay on Social Physics: Man and the Development of his Faculties'', outlines the project of a social physics characterized by measured variables that follow a [[normal distribution]], and collected data about many such variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1v8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sur+l%27homme+et+le+d%C3%A9veloppement+de+ses+facult%C3%A9s,+ou+Essai+de+physique+sociale&amp;ei=gAuuS_OPJZ7WMO2TvZcM&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Sur l'homme et le Développement de ses Facultés, ou Essai de Physique Sociale|last=Quetelet|first=Adolphe|publisher=Imprimeur-Libraire|year=1835|isbn=|volume=1-2|location=Paris|pages=|language=French|trans-title=Essay on Social Physics: Man and the Development of his Faculties|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently repeated anecdote is that when Comte discovered that Quetelet had appropriated the term 'social physics', he found it necessary to invent a new term 'sociologie' (sociology) because he disagreed with Quetelet's collection of statistics.

There have been several “generations” of social physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iberall|first=Arthur|year=1984|orig-year=Presented at Annual Conference of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations (ISCSC), Syracuse, May 1980|title=Contributions to a Physical Science for the Study of Civilizations|journal=Journal of Social and Biological Structures|volume=7|issue=3|pages=259–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation began with Saint-Simon, Comte, and Quetelet, and ended with the late 1800s with historian [[Henry Adams]]. In the middle of the 20th century, researchers such as the American astrophysicist [[John Q. Stewart]] and Swedish geographer [[Reino Ajo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contributions to "Social Physics": a Programme Sketch with Special Regard to National Planning|last=Ajo|first=Reino|publisher=Royal University of Lund|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that the spatial distribution of social interactions could be described using gravity models. Physicists such as [[Arthur Iberall]] use a [[homeokinetics]] approach to study social systems as complex self-organizing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iberall|first=A|year=1985|title=Outlining social physics for modern societies - locating culture, economics, and politics: The Enlightenment reconsidered|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=82|pages=5582–84|doi=10.1073/pnas.82.17.5582|pmc=390594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Iberall|first1=A|last2=Hassler|first2=F|last3=Soodak|first3=H|last4=Wilkinson|first4=D|year=2000|title=Invitation to an Enterprise: From Physics to World History to Civilizations’ Study|journal=Comparative Civilization Review|volume=42|pages=4–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a homeokinetics analysis of society shows that one must account for flow variables such as the flow of energy, of materials, of action, reproduction rate, and value-in-exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Iberall| first=Arthur S.|title=Homeokinetics: The Basics|publisher=Strong Voices Publishing|year=2016|location=Medfield, MA|isbn=978-0-990-53614-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently there have been a large number of social science papers that use mathematics broadly similar to that of [[physics]], and described as “[[computational social science]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Lazer, D., Pentland, A., et al ''Science'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800s, Adams separated “human physics” into the subsets of social physics or social mechanics (sociology of interactions using physics-like mathematical tools)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Phillip|year=2002|orig-year=A talk presented at ‘Horizons in Complex Systems’ Messina, Sicily, Italy, 2001|title=The physical modelling of society: a historical perspective|url=http://www.if.ufrj.br/~mbr/econofisica/intro/artigos/Physica.A.314.1.2002.pdf|journal=Physica A|volume=314|issue=1-4|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/s0378-4371(02)01042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social thermodynamics or sociophysics, (sociology described using mathematical invariances similar to those in [[thermodynamics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Alan|title=Notes on Some Concepts in Social Physics|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1435-5597.1969.tb01460.x/abstract|journal=Regional Science|publisher=Regional Science Association International|volume=22|issue=1|pages=159–193|doi=10.1111/j.1435-5597.1969.tb01460.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dichotomy is roughly analogous to the difference between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]].

==Recent work==
In modern use “social physics” refers to using “[[big data]]” analysis and the mathematical laws to understand the behavior of human crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GEORGE|first=Gerard|last2=HAAS|first2=Martine R.|last3=PENTLAND|first3=Alex|year=2014|title=Big Data and Management: From the Editors|url=http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/4621/|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=57|issue=2|pages=321–326|doi=10.5465/amj.2014.4002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core idea is that data about human activity (e.g., phone call records, credit card purchases, taxi rides, web activity) contain mathematical patterns that are characteristic of how social interactions spread and converge. These mathematical invariances can then serve as a filter for analysis of behavior changes and for detecting emerging behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/predictive-analytics/|title=Predictive Analytics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent books about social physics include [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Professor [[Alex Pentland]]’s book ''Social Physics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Physics: How Good Ideas Spread—the Lessons from a New Science|last=Pentland|first=Alex|publisher=Penguin|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] editor [[Mark Buchanan]]’s book ''The Social Atom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Atom - why the Rich get Richer, Cheaters get Caught, and Your Neighbor Usually Looks Like You|last=Buchanan|first=Mark|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=x - xi|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular reading about sociophysics include English physicist [[Philip Ball]]’s ''Why Society is a Complex Matter''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Society is a Complex Matter: Meeting Twenty-First Century Challenges with a New Kind of Science|last=Ball|first=Philip|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Dirk Helbing]]'s ''The Automation of Society is next'' or American physicist [[Albert-László Barabási|Lazlo Barabasi]]’s book ''Linked''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linked: The New Science of Networks|last=Barabási|first=Albert-László|publisher=Perseus Books Group|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blockchain, Cryptography, and Social Physics Applications==
Over the past few years, Social Physics has been shown to be a potent analytics tool for a variety of applications where either data is anonymized or only metadata is available, as is typical of crytographic and [[blockchain]] systems. This is because Social Physics is primarily about interactions between elements, so that the form of the data is often irrelevant.  

Following are a few examples for the use of Social Physics applied to Blockchain and Crypto systems:
* Social Physics for Financial Interaction. In a recent MIT PhD [http://people.csail.mit.edu/pkrafft/papers/krafft-thesis-final.pdf Thesis], a social physics approach to [[cryptocurrency]] market buy/sell timing was shown to drive “bubbles” in [[AltCoin|AltCoins]]. In this experiment, carefully timed investments totaling just a few dollars often drove more than 5000 times increase in AltCoin market value.
* Social Physics for breaking cryptographic anonymization. A recent ruling of the US Supreme Court cited the use of Social Physics for the efficient re-identification of cryptographically anonymized metadata (similar to [[Bitcoin]] transactions), discouraging defense agencies and private companies from collecting and using this so-called "anonymized" data&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre de|last2=Radaelli|first2=Laura|last3=Singh|first3=Vivek Kumar|last4=Pentland|first4=Alex “Sandy”|date=2015-01-30|title=Unique in the shopping mall: On the reidentifiability of credit card metadata|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6221/536|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6221|pages=536–539|doi=10.1126/science.1256297|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25635097}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Social Physics for Anti-Money Laundering (AML). Social Physics was used to uncover a collaborating network of bitcoin addresses, an arrangement often used to launder stolen Bitcoins. This was done using a handful of known malicious addresses, that were used as “seeds” for the Social Physics “behavioral similarity detection” algorithm, resulting in an accurate detection of dozens of additional members of the network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1003255394|title=New solutions for cybersecurity|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Shrobe, Howard E.,, Shrier, David L.,, Pentland, Alex, 1952-|year=|isbn=9780262535373|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=|chapter=11|oclc=1003255394}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Commercial use==


Most recently, research by [[Alex Pentland|Prof. Alex “Sandy” Pentland]] and [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr Yaniv Altshuler]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] has combined social physics with [[Machine learning|Machine Learning]] to improve the performance of machine learning applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/research/highlights/tuning-social-networks-gain-wisdom-crowd|title=Tuning Social Networks to Gain the Wisdom of the Crowd {{!}} MIT Media Lab|website=www.media.mit.edu|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.endor.com Endor], a company co-founded by [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr. Altshuler]], utilized social physics to introduce a predictive intelligence platform that automates the process of answering predictive business questions, using natural language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mit.edu/2017/endor-inventing-google-predictive-analytics-1220|title=Inventing the “Google” for predictive analytics|work=MIT News|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A ICO of 50 million USD was also conducted by Endor.

In the field of [[cyber-security]], a team headed by [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr Altshuler]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] has shown how the concept of social physics, manifested as mathematical invariances that are embedded in large datasets, can be used in order to generate new and highly efficient types of attacks on behavioral information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altshuler|first=Yaniv|last2=Aharony|first2=Nadav|last3=Pentland|first3=Alex|last4=Elovici|first4=Yuval|last5=Cebrian|first5=Manuel|year=2011|title=Stealing Reality: When Criminals Become Data Scientists (or Vice Versa)|url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~yanival/IEEE_Intelligent_Systems.pdf|journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems|volume=26|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faculty of Political Sciences''' ({{lang-sr| Факултет политичких наука Универзитета у Београду / Fakultet političkih nauka Univerziteta u Beogradu}}, abbreviated FPN) is a constituent institution of the [[University of Belgrade]] which focuses on education and research in the fields of political science, international relations, journalism and communication studies, and social policy and social work. It was established in 1968, as a first faculty of this type in former Yugoslavia.

The building, built in the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style, is located in the urban neighborhood of [[Voždovac]], close to the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. The Faculty of Political Sciences offers [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], [[Master of Arts|MA]] and [[PhD]] programmes, as well as advanced professional development programmes.

==History==

The Faculty of Political Sciences was established in 1968, after the National Assembly of Serbia brought an establishment act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bg.ac.rs/files/sr/univerzitet/glasnik-zakoni/zbornik/knjiga3/3_119.pdf |title=ZAKON O FAKULTETU POLITIČKIH NAUKA U BEOGRADU |language=Serbian |date=1968-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first institution of its kind in [[former Yugoslavia]]. Since its founding to 2013, it has educated more than 8,100 students, with 975 of them having completed [[Master of Arts|MA]] programmes, and 464 having defended their [[PhD]] theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/the-faculty/about-us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Faculty of Political Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[alumni]] have become recognized experts and scholars, professors and high ranking government officials.

Many of the faculties of political sciences, established subsequently in other parts of the [[former Yugoslavia]] were formed from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences as a core, and a large number of professors at the various faculties of political sciences in all the countries of the [[former Yugoslavia]], had obtained their academic titles at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences.

Celebration of the faculty's 40th anniversary was held in the hall of the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] in November 2008. It was sponsored by the President of Serbia. An international conference "State and Democracy" was held as a part of anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/125/Dru%C5%A1tvo/29858/Jubilej++FPN-a.html |title=Jubilej FPN-a |publisher=Radio Television of Serbia |date=2008-11-27 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic staff==

The [[University of Belgrade]] Faculty of Political Sciences has among its academic staff some of the most eminent experts in the field of political sciences, as well as in a range of others ([[economy]], [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[history]], etc.)  Amongst them, there are many widely recognized within the domestic and international academic community, as well as former or current high government officials – Ministers, Ambassadors, etc.

Notable members of the academic staff include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/teachers-and-staff |title=Teachers and Staff |publisher=Faculty of Political Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dragan Veselinov]], [[Government of Serbia (2001-2004)|Minister of Agriculture]] (2001-2003)
*[[Ivo Visković]], [[Embassy of Serbia in Berlin|Ambassador of Serbia to Germany]] (2009-2013)
*[[Slobodan Samardžić]], [[Cabinet of Serbia (2007–2008)|Minister for Kosovo-Metohija]] (2007-2008)
*[[Čedomir Čupić]], Chairman of the Board of The Anti-Corruption Agency of the Republic of Serbia (2009-2011)
*[[Tanja Miščević]], [[Chief Negotiator]] for [[Serbia’s accession negotiations with the EU]], former [[State secretary]] of the [[Cabinet of Serbia (2008–2012)|Ministry of Defence]] of the Republic of Serbia (2008-2012)

==Student life==
Student life at the Faculty includes a diverse array of student activities. Student organisations at the Faculty of Political Sciences include a [[Debate Club]], European Students Forum, Youth Team Initiative [http://timfpn.weebly.com TIM], Serbian Political Forum [http://spf.fpn.bg.ac.rs SPF], United Nations Club, Diplomatic Forum, Action for Political Emancipation of Youth [https://web.archive.org/web/20110806005218/http://apem.org.rs/ APEM] and many others. Students also elect their representatives (Student Vice-Dean and the [[Students' Union|Student Parliament]]) to represent their interests in the Faculty bodies, participate in the evaluation of studies and the faculty, and secure the involvement and participation of students in all matters and issues of interest to them.

Students periodically publish their own newspaper – ''Politikolog'' (The Political Scientist), and take part in various competitions through their sports club. Also, students of [[journalism]] prepare radio and TV shows which are broadcast on radios and televisions with national frequencies.

==Professional gatherings==
Students have the opportunity to participate in numerous events and gatherings (national and international). Student Conference at [[Kopaonik]] which is held every year provides them with the chance to discuss the most recent developments in both domestic and international politics with prominent experts, professors and diplomats. Study trips that are organized every year include visits to Serbia's diplomatic missions across Europe, [[European Parliament]], [[European Court of Human Rights]], [[United Nations]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and many other institutions. Also, a regional gathering of political sciences students called "Politijada" is being held every year with students from [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Slovenia]] taking part.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4941">A '''vector-based graphical user interface''' is a mostly conceptual type of [[graphical user interface]] where elements are drawn using [[Vector graphics|vector]] rather than [[Raster graphics|raster]] information.

[[Image:3D GUI.png|thumb|200px|An example of a vector-based window, found in a privately funded vector-based graphical user interface research project.]]

[[File:2D Vector GUI.png|thumb|2D GUI. All window decorations and elements inside them are vector-based, the background is generated from multiple sine waves and the shapes are defined in-runtime. The final image is rasterized, anti-aliased and optionally composited, here the compositing is disabled.]]

==Pros and cons==
The benefits of a completely vector-based graphical user interface would include:
:*more efficient, independent scalability; The resolution (measured in [[dots per inch]] or DPI) could be set higher or lower than 1px:1px without causing [[pixelation]], enabling better use of high resolution monitors.

Cons might include:
:*Difficulty integrating raster-based applications. With some effort, this could be accomplished by texturing the entire raster-based application to a vector-based plane (though the disadvantages of raster-based graphics would still stand).
:*Slower rendering, greater system requirements. Because today's monitors display only raster-based information, the vector information would have to be rasterized (and optionally [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliased]]) before appearing.

==Usage in 3D graphical user interfaces==
Since current [[3D computer graphics|3D Graphics]] are usually vector-based, rather than raster-based, vector-based graphical user interfaces would be suitable for 3D graphical user interfaces. This is because raster-based 3D models take up an enormous amount of memory, as they are stored and displayed using [[voxel]]s. Current [[operating systems]] such as [[Windows Vista]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[UNIX|UNIX-based]] operating systems (including [[Linux]]) have enjoyed much benefit from using 3D graphical user interfaces. In Windows Vista, for example, [[Windows Aero|Flip3D]] textures each window to a 3D plane based on vector graphics. Even though the window itself is still raster-based, the plane onto which it is textured is vector-based. As a result, the windows, when rotated, appear flat. In Linux desktops, [[Compiz Fusion]] can texture each raster-based workspace onto a 3D vector-based cube.  As operating systems evolve, eventually the entire window would be made from 3D vector graphics, so that when rotated, it does not appear "flat". Also, advanced lighting may make 3D graphical user interfaces more aesthetically pleasing.

==Usage in 2D graphical user interfaces==
As most computer monitors become more and more [[dots per inch|high resolution]], everything displayed would be smaller. However, if the screen resolution were turned down, everything would appear pixelated. Thus, [[resolution independence]] is currently being designed to solve this problem. With raster graphics, all icons need to be extremely high resolution, so as to not appear pixelated on higher resolution screens. This may take up enormous amounts of memory, and hard disk space.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} If vector graphics were used instead, it could be easily scalable and never lose data nor appear pixelated.

Some Graphical User Interfaces on [[Operating System]]s such as [[IRIX]] use vector-based icons.  A number of vector-based icon sets are also available for window managers such as [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]].

With Windows, applications built using [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] (which is native{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} to [[Windows Vista]], but can be downloaded for [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003|Server 2003]]) are vector-based and scale losslessly based on Windows [[Dots per inch|DPI]] settings.  However, even without this, it has always been possible to build applications to be DPI-aware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms969894.aspx MSDN: How to Write High-DPI Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in Vista, the [[Desktop Window Manager]] detects when an app is not DPI aware and, if the computer is set to a different DPI than normal, uses bitmap scaling to render the window at a larger size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/archive/2006/08/07/690704.aspx High DPI Support in Windows Vista Aero]&lt;/ref&gt;

New version of [[AmigaOS]] 4.1 enhanced in 2008 its [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] with 2D vector graphical interface based on [[Cairo (Graphics)|Cairo]] libraries, but pragmatically integrated it with a 3D Compositing Engine based on [[Alpha Channel|Porter-Duff]] Routines.
