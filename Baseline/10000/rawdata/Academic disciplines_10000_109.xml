      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5334">The '''Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act''' of 1998 is an [[Alabama]] statute that criminalizes the sale of [[sex toy]]s.  The law has been the subject of extensive litigation and has generated considerable national controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Jay. Women Fight Alabama Sex Toy Ban, ''Chicago Sun Times'', Feb 18, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Judge Overturns Alabama's Sex Toy Ban, ''The New York Times, March 30, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== The statute ==

The statute was originally sponsored by State Senator [[Tom Butler (Alabama politician)|Tom Butler]] of [[Madison, Alabama]] as a measure to prohibit nude dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Challen.  Sex toys never 'focus of bill'. ''Huntsville Times'', May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  It prohibits "any person to knowingly distribute, possess with intent to distribute, or offer or agree to distribute any obscene material or any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs for any thing of pecuniary value."&lt;ref name="Code of Alabama"&gt;[http://law.onecle.com/alabama/criminal-code/13A-12-200.2.html Code of Alabama - Title 13A: Criminal Code - Section 13A-12-200.2 - Distribution, possession with intent to distribute, production, etc., of obscene material prohibited; penalties; distribution of fines]&lt;/ref&gt; First-time offenders face a $10,000 fine and a year in prison, while repeat offenders can face up to ten years in prison.&lt;ref name="Code of Alabama"/&gt; Exemptions exist for "bona fide medical, scientific, educational, legislative, judicial or law enforcement purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Challen. State set to enforce ban on sex toys, ''Huntsville Times'' Oct 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The law's most outspoken backers have been a coalition of [[Christian right|Conservative Christians]] led by Dan Ireland of the Alabama Citizens' Action Program.  Ireland has defended the law on the grounds that "laws are made to protect the public" and "sometimes you have to protect the public against themselves."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lyman, Brian. Ban on sex toys targeted. ''Mobile Register'', Dec. 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal challenges ==

Sherri Williams, an adult novelty dealer, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] challenged the statute on constitutional grounds.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-02-22-toys_x.htm High court declines to review Alabama's sex-toys ban] ''USA Today'', February 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the precedent of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', finding a right to engage in consensual homosexual sex, also guaranteed a right to sell sex toys.  After initially winning their case, ''Williams vs. Alabama'', in federal district court, Williams lost appeals to the [[11th Circuit Court of Appeals|11th Circuit]].&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/30/us/national-news-briefs-federal-judge-overturns-alabama-s-sex-toy-ban.html National News Briefs; Federal Judge Overturns Alabama's Sex Toy Ban], ''The New York Times'', March 30, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;   The Supreme Court refused to hear the case.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

Ross Winner, the owner of Love Stuff, a chain store which sells sex toys, subsequently sued to have the statute declared unconstitutional under the Alabama Constitution.  Winner's position is that "a person should have the ability to come in and purchase a sexual device without having to have a reason."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs42.com/content/localnews/story/Love-Stuff/rDqpEplHt0iO3X6ibdiLXA.cspx Love Stuff] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718230109/http://www.cbs42.com/content/localnews/story/Love-Stuff/rDqpEplHt0iO3X6ibdiLXA.cspx |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Alabama Supreme Court ruled against him on September 11, 2009, and the statute's ban is now in effect.

[[Alabama House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[John Rogers (Alabama politician)|John Rogers]] of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] has repeatedly introduced legislation to repeal the ban, but each bill has been defeated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, adult toys continue to be sold as novelty and educational items. Adult clothing is marketed as costumes.

== Public reaction ==

San Francisco radio personality Big Joe Lopez held a protest outside the federal courthouse in Huntsville, Alabama, giving away sex toys to passersby.&lt;ref&gt;Faulk, Kent.  San Francisco Radio Personality Protests Sex Toy Ban, ''Birmingham News'', Feb. 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toy drive ===

In 2007, Alabama politician [[Loretta Nall]], a former [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate for governor, launched a well-publicized "toy drive" to send sex toys to Alabama Attorney General [[Troy King]], a staunch defender of the law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37901">[[File:Crosby Garrett Helmet on auction at Christies.jpg|300px|thumb|An art auction, as in this one at Christies, is an example of one part of the art market where buyers and sellers of art meet to conduct transactions in the art market]]
:{{see also|Art valuation|Art auction}}
The art market is represented by a marketplace of buyers and sellers trading in the commodities, services, and works-of-art commonly associated with the various arts. The art market is also concerned with the production of new art which enters the art market. The art market is an example of one type of marketplace, among many different types of markets which occur in economics. In particular, the art market has many similarities with other marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet, as well as significant distinguishing factors indicative of its differences from other types of markets in economics.

==The art market economic model==
The [[Economics of the arts and literature#The market for artworks|art market]] operates in an economic model that considers more than [[supply and demand]]: it is a hybrid type of [[prediction market]] where art is bought and sold for values based not only on a work's perceived cultural value, but on both its past monetary value as well as its predicted future value. The market has been described as one where producers don't make work primarily for sale, where buyers often have no idea of the value of what they buy, and where middlemen routinely claim reimbursement for sales of things they have never seen to buyers they have never dealt with.&lt;ref name="platter"&gt;Plattner, Stuart, [http://www.stuartplattner.com/AA-ART-Paradox.pdf A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Market for Contemporary Fine Art], ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100(2):482-493, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the market is not transparent; private sales data is not systematically available&lt;ref name="Coslor"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|date=April 2016|title=Transparency in an opaque market: Evaluative frictions between "thick" valuation and "thin" price data in the art market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300307|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=50|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private sales represent about half of market transactions.

===Market size===
Unlike the volumes in the [[securities market]] where millions of people and firms participate in buying and selling financial interests, or the [[Commodity market|commodities market]] where measures of raw or primary products are exchanged using standardized contracts, art market activity largely follows the demands of a more limited array of private collectors, museums, and large corporate interests as the principal market participants.&lt;ref name="microcosm"&gt;The art market sees itself as a microcosm: it lists its collectors in the hundreds, as opposed to the securities market which has millions of participants. ''ARTnews'': [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 The Top Ten] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003020/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 |date=16 October 2009 }}, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 The ARTnews 200 Top Collectors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003056/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 |date=16 October 2009 }}. One art writer, however, answered the question: "Do you see the art world as a microcosm of other broader, power communities?" with the following observation: "I'm not sure if it's a microcosm or the shape of things to come. Its manic internationalism...." [http://www.vmagazine.com/2008/11/111208-insider-art/ Insider Art]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''V Magazine'', 2008-11-12, vmagazine.com.  Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate collectors, however, can have a disparately large market impact, for instance, ''[[Spear's Wealth Management Survey|Spear's]]'' reported in 2015 that [[British Rail]] began investing in art for its pension fund beginning in 1974 (prior to privatization), spending about £40M or approximately 3% of its funds on art, before selling those assets between 1987&amp;ndash;1999.&lt;ref name="britrailspears"&gt;Lindsay, Ivan, [http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/#.U4W0eSj8iZQ Go Figure], ''Spear's'', spearswms.com, 21 January 2011; free [https://web.archive.org/web/20140529052940/http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/ archived version]. Accessed 17 November 2015. The article also mentions that British Rail Pension realized an annualized return of 11.3% because of a number of factors particular to the market at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; British Rail's efforts realized profits, particularly due to the Impressionist portfolio, but the collection was liquidated because it came to be seen as an illegitimate investment area, particularly as alternative investments became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|last2=Spaenjers|first2=Christophe|date=November 2016|title=Organizational and epistemic change: The growth of the art investment field|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300782|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=55|pages=48–62|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because original artworks are not [[Fungibility|fungible]] like [[stock]]s, they have valuation challenges not similarly affecting securities,&lt;ref name="baumol"&gt;Baumol, William J., [http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf Unnatural Value: Or Art Investment as Floating Crap Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425235014/http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf |date=25 April 2012 }}, ''The American Economic Review'', 76:2 (May 1986), pp. 10-14, Papers and Proceedings of the Ninety-Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association,; ''Journal of Arts Management and Law'' (now ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''), 15:3, 1985, pp. 47-60. {{DOI|10.1080/07335113.1985.9942162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with dynamics of what Karpik calls singularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9215.html|title=Valuing the Unique|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, because the art market's participants are far more limited in number than the securities or commodities markets, because artworks are not fungible, and because art valuation relies to a great extent on the advice and enthusiasm of a variety of specialized market analysts, these limitations each in turn dictate the size of the market and increase the risk that some items may be over or undervalued.

===Market timing===
The art market moves in cycles with activity generally peaking in the spring and autumn when the major auction houses traditionally schedule auctions, and results in the market being seasonal rather than ongoing.&lt;ref name="sched"&gt;[http://www.artmarket.com/ Art Market Cycles], artmarket.com, retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  While private sales take place all year, those sales are often not publicized as auctions are and thus do not affect the market until they become known.

Art valuations made for an autumn auction may be unrealistic for the following spring auction season because fortunes in the financial markets during one season can affect the art market in the following season, and equity markets do significantly impact the art market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goetzmann|first=William N|last2=Renneboog|first2=Luc|last3=Spaenjers|first3=Christophe|date=May 2011|title=Art and Money|url=http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=101|issue=3|pages=222–226|doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volatility in the financial markets often causes volatility in the art market as happened in the contraction of the art market during the [[2008–2012 global recession|2008-2009 recession]]&lt;ref&gt;For more on the economic background causing the market contraction, see also the [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence]].&lt;/ref&gt; when sales at [[Sotheby's]], [[Christie's]], and [[Phillips de Pury &amp;amp; Company]] were less than half the previous year: November 2008, $803.3 million compared to November 2007, $1.75 billion; and between 2000 and 2003 when the annual volume of art works sold at auction dropped 36%.&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;&lt;ref name="contraction"&gt;Esterow, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 How to Buy in 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015210756/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 |date=15 October 2009 }}, ''ARTnews'', March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, the art market can fare reasonably well despite volatility in the stock market such as happened from January 1997 through May 2004 when the average quarterly fluctuation in the Artprice Global Index was two to three times smaller than the same statistic for the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] and the [[S&amp;P 500]].&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;

As art market participants' fortunes wax and wane in the financial markets, buying power evolves and affects participants' ability to afford highly valued works, resulting in new buyers and sellers entering, leaving, or re-entering the market, and an artwork sold to offset losses in the financial market might be sold for substantially more or substantially less than its last {{H:title|price for which work sold at auctioneer's hammer strike|hammer value|link=no}} at auction.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;Gerber, Manuel, [http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf Primary Art Market Investments - A Safe Haven when All Else Suddenly Correlates?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002174957/http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf# |date=2013-10-02 }}, Prime Art Management Ltd., published in ''Art Fund Tracker'', Nov. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s during the stock-market boom, the art market expanded in turn with prices soaring to new heights, and investment firms took a greater interest in the art market and began to study it in-depth.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, [http://i1.exhibit-e.com/collectionofmodernart/39049d22.pdf The Art of Portfolio Diversification]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Maastricht University, March 2004. (art as an asset class)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goetzmann"&gt;Goetzmann, William N., Accounting for Taste: Art and the Financial Markets Over Three Centuries, ''The American Economic Review'', 83(5), Dec. 1993, pp. 1370-1376.&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the previously non-transparent art market became more accessible via the increasing availability of indices and online data&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ"&gt;Campbell, R.A.J., [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID978467_code230208.pdf?abstractid=978467&amp;rulid=6936564&amp;mirid=1 Art as a Financial Investment], Erasmus Univ., Rotterdam, Maastricht Univ., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; although researchers discovered biased price estimates in the auction houses.&lt;ref name="mei"&gt;Mei, J. and Moses, M., [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jmei/estimates.pdf Vested Interest and Biased Price Estimates: Evidence from an Auction Market], ''The Journal of Finance'', 60(5), 2005, pp. 2409-2435.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art sometimes has transient fashionability that also can affect its value: what sells well for a time may be supplanted in the market by new styles and ideas in short order. For instance, in the spring of 2008 a collector offered over $80 million for Jeff Koons' stainless-steel ''Rabbit'', and yet a year later, of four works in the fall auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York, only two of his pieces sold well and one failed to sell entirely.&lt;ref name="inflatable"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14941205 Inflatable investments, The volatile art of Jeff Koons], ''[[The Economist]]'', 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Christie's sold Koons' ''Balloon Flower'' sculpture for $16.9 million.&lt;ref name="koonsballoon"&gt;Christie's, [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/jeff-koons-balloon-flower/5371708/lot/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5371708&amp;sid=e5ce29ac-d2b6-41b6-9092-7aacf3e6974b Auction result, Sale 2355 / Lot 23], christies.com, retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary and secondary markets===
The art market as a whole is affected by its two main parts: the primary art market, where new art comes to the market for the first time, and the secondary market, for existing art that has been sold at least once before. Once a work is sold on the primary market it enters the secondary market, and the prices for which it sold in the primary market have a direct bearing on the work's value in the secondary market. Supply and demand affect the secondary market more than the primary market because works new to the market, mainly contemporary art, have no market history for predictive analysis and thus valuation of such work is more difficult, and more speculative.&lt;ref name="gerald"&gt;Gerard and Louis, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V64-3YRSMF4-28/2/44fafa98be1c97504c5a1fdc722b55ba On pricing the priceless: Comments on the economics of the visual art market], ''European Economic Review'', Elsevier, vol. 39(3-4), April 1995, pp. 509-518. (membership required).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery, dealer, consultant, and agent promotion as well as collectors acting as [[alpha consumer]]s (trend-setters) are the forces at work in valuing primary market works.

===Market entry barriers===
As with [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] stocks, works by "blue-chip" or well-known artists are generally valued more highly than works by unknown artists since it is hard to predict how an unknown artist's work will sell, or whether it will sell at all. [[barriers to entry|High barriers to market entry]] for artists&lt;ref name="jeffri"&gt;Jeffri, Joan, Philanthropy and the American artist: A historical overview, ''[[International Journal of Cultural Policy|The European Journal of Cultural Policy]]'', 3(2), 2009, pp. 207-233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barriers"&gt;Jackson, M.R., et al, [http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411311_investing_in_creativity.pdf Investing in Creativity: A study of the support structure for US artists], ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society'', 2004. PDF from Urban Institute, urban.org.&lt;/ref&gt; create scarcity in the supply and demand portion of the market, in turn driving up prices and raising questions of [[Financial market efficiency|efficiency]].&lt;ref name="bonus"&gt;Bonus, H., Ronte, D., Credibility and economic value in the visual arts, ''Journal of Cultural Economics'' 21, 1997 103–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adler"&gt;Adler, M., [http://www.columbia.edu/~ma820/Stardom%20and%20Talent.pdf ''Stardom and Talent''], in Handbook of the Economics of Art and Culture, Vol. 1, Chap. 25, 2006, pp. 895-906.&lt;/ref&gt; While a high market entry barrier may result in having a smaller pool of artwork producers in the auction-level portion of the market, and in greater market predictability by virtue of that smaller pool and thus more reliable valuation measures, its axiomatic effect is of lesser artistic diversity negatively impacting the size of the buyer pool.&lt;ref name="schonfeld"&gt;Schönfeld and Reinstaller, [http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/inst/vw1/papers/wu-wp90.pdf ''The effects of gallery and artist reputation on prices in the primary market for art'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Working Paper, Department of Economics, Vienna University of Economics &amp; B.A., May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, gallerists and art dealers consider what types of works are currently in vogue before deciding to represent a new artist and are highly selective in those choices in order to maintain a level of quality that is saleable. All these concerns are in play when gallerists set prices for emerging artists at a much lower level than for established artists.

===Market transparency===
With the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]], the art market faced criticism for its lack of transparency, its [[Byzantinism|Byzantine]] valuation methods, and a perceived lack of ethical behavior enabled by structural inadequacies in the market itself. In response, a 2009 debate occurred between valuation-setting members of the art market on the proposition that "the art market is less ethical than the stock market". At the end of the debate the audience determined that those debating in agreement with the proposition won the debate.&lt;ref name="morality"&gt;Saltz, Jerry, [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/saltz/saltz3-6-09.asp Morality Play], artnet.com, 2009-03-06, discussing the debate and its outcome. Participants included art dealers Richard Feigen and Michael Hue-Williams, collector Adam Lindemann on the "pro" side, and artist [[Chuck Close]], critic Jerry Saltz, and auctioneer Amy Cappellazzo opposing. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpsTNdYeG6U debate video] is available on [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note in the debate was the identification of "chandelier bidding" as a practice perceived as ethically questionable. The debaters described "chandelier bidding" as bids from the chandelier, or bids from an unknown source, meaning both the bidding by the auction houses on behalf of the sellers whose items the houses are auctioning (a [[conflict of interest]]), and bidding by unidentified bidders having no intention of buying but bidding in order to drive prices up, all practiced because the auction houses keep secret from bidders a seller's [[Reservation price|reserve price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/arts/design/as-art-market-rise-so-do-questions-of-oversight.html|title=As Art Market Soars, So Do Questions of Oversight|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=27 January 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=9 June 2017|last2=Flynn|first2=Kevin|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, also in response to criticism on the lack of market transparency and counterarguments that more transparency would ruin the market,&lt;ref name="adaa"&gt;Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), [http://www.artdealers.org/events.forum30.html Art Industry Summit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216122400/http://www.artdealers.org/events.forum30.html |date=16 December 2011 }}, Transparency in the market: can we have more of it?, 3 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'' in association with the Art Dealers Association of America convened an Art Industry Summit panel discussion between major art market decision makers, where panelists discussed whether there was a need for more transparency.&lt;ref name="transpADAA"&gt;ADAA and The Art Newspaper, Transparency in the market...can we have more of it?, videos [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1662 Part 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193922/http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1662# |date=2016-03-04 }}, [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1661 Part 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305172450/http://theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1661# |date=2016-03-05 }}, and [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1660 Part 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110955/http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1660# |date=2016-03-04 }}, Host Anna Somers Cocks, ''The Art Newpapaper'', 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists argued over whether auction houses have built-in conflicts of interest by representing sellers with secret reserves, while at the same time representing to buyers initial valuations on those works at auction time. The debate also included the issue of first and third-party guaranteed bids, and whether sellers' reserve prices should be disclosed so that participants no longer bid on an object they have no chance of buying. In response to criticisms regarding chandelier bidding and unidentified third-party guaranteed bids, Christie's International chairman Edward Dolman countered that, without a secret reserve, illegal cartels of bidders would know in advance information that could facilitate their manipulation of the market and corruption of final valuation by selling price at auction.&lt;ref name="transpADAA2"&gt;ADAA, video 3 at 22:05 min, et seq..&lt;/ref&gt;

With the art market's weaknesses (especially lack of transparency and conflicts of interests) becoming better known, serious external conversations about market regulation have begun among major market players; for example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' noted that in early 2015, participants at the January [[World Economic Forum]] meeting attended a lunch seminar where the speaker warned that the global art market needs to be regulated because of systemic weaknesses which enable inside information trading, tax evasion, and money laundering.&lt;ref name="gapper"&gt;Gapper, John, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150125081849/http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2015/01/art-worlds-shady-dealings-under-scrutiny-at-davos Art world’s shady dealings under scrutiny at Davos], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 22 January 2015. Accessed 17 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of academic research, there is work on the opacity of price formation in finance and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Géraldine|last2=Oosterlinck|first2=Kim|last3=Szafarz|first3=Ariane|title=Art market inefficiency|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033|journal=Economics Letters|volume=121|issue=1|pages=23–25|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Competitors ===
Christie's and Sotheby's are the leading auction venues. In 2002, [[LVMH]] acquired Swiss art advisory firm de Pury &amp; Luxembourg and merged it with Phillips to form [[Phillips de Pury &amp; Company]], with the aim of breaking the duopoly at the top of the market.

=== Segments ===
Fine art auctions are generally held separately for Impressionist and Modern art as well as for Post-war and Contemporary Art. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s works remain the most coveted lot as of 2004. In 2008 just over  million of art by [[Damien Hirst]] was sold at auction, a world record for a living artist; however in 2009, Hirst’s annual auction sales had shrunk by 93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/16990811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estimates ===
"Estimates" often reflect the [[consignor]]'s ambitions as much as the auction specialist's considered opinion. They do not reflect commissions. To secure consignments, auction houses concede high estimates to suit the requirements of art owners.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/arts/08iht-melikian08.html When Auction Estimates Go Haywire], ''[[The New York Times]]'', nytimes.com, October 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Before an auction, interested buyers typically turn for advice to the auction house specialist who quotes the estimate and often recommends going beyond in order to secure the item.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/arts/18iht-melik19.1.9319140.html Behind stellar sales of art market, a dangerous game], ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commissions and Buyer's Premium ===
Auction houses operate contractually on behalf of sellers of goods, charging sellers a fixed [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] (fee) amounting to a percentage of the “hammer price” for which a lot is sold.&lt;ref name="horror"&gt;{{cite journal
 | title = Hammer houses of horror
 | magazine = [[The Economist]]
 | date = July 24, 1997
 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/152446
 | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie's published its commissions in September 1995, with its fees ranging from 20% on the least expensive lots to 2% on lots sold for over m; Sotheby's followed suit.&lt;ref name="horror" /&gt; For Phillips de Pury &amp; Company, final prices include commission of 25% of the first  20% of the next  to  million, and 12% of the rest, with estimates not reflecting commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/arts/design/14auction.html Phillips Sale Totals Less Than Half the Low Estimate] ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, November 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Objects sold are also subject to a further fee called the "[[buyer's premium]]", 15% being typical, with the term implying that by virtue of selling an object, the auction house performs a service for the buyer subject to remuneration. Thus, both the seller and the buyer of an object or lot sold by the major auction houses pay a fee. First implemented in 1975 by Christie's, the assessment of a buyer's premium is one of several auction-house practices to which art dealers object.&lt;ref&gt;Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Kathryn Graddy, Anatomy of the Rise and Fall of a Pricefixing Conspiracy: Auctions At Sotheby’s And Christie’s, ''Journal of Competition Law and Economics'', 1(1), 3–20, March 2005, {{doi|10.1093/joclec/nhi003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance-based fees ===
Beginning in 2014, Christie's charged 2 percent of the hammer price of a work that meets or exceeds its high estimate. The fee does not apply to online only sales.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Gerlis (September 26, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 Christie's takes another 2%] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928075542/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 |date=2014-09-28 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guarantees ===
An auction house may offer a guaranteed selling price, or "guaranteed minimum", a practice designed to give sellers confidence to consign works and to give potential bidders reassurance that there are others willing to buy an item.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thornton]], [https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/11/art-market Financial machinations at auctions], ''The Economist'', economist.com, November 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Auction houses have offered guarantees since the early 1970s to encourage collectors to sell their artworks: ''The Art Newspaper'' reported that guarantees were first introduced in 1971 at Sotheby’s, when 47 [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]s and other works from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] were offered with a guaranteed minimum; similar arrangements followed in 1972 and 1973 for the Ritter and Scull collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 2008 when the market turned sour, Christie's and Sotheby's had to pay out at least  million on works for which they guaranteed a minimum price but which failed to sell. In order to reduce their exposure to such losses, boost the market, and reduce volatility, the main auction houses now prefer that third parties take on this financial risk via "third-party guarantees" or "irrevocable bids": using this practice the auction houses sell a work to a third party for a minimum price prior to the auction and this selling price then becomes the “reserve” below which the artwork will not be sold. If bidding for specified works stops at the minimum price, which remains undisclosed, the "third party" acquires the lot; if bidding exceeds the reserve, the third party splits any profit from its sale with the consignor and with the auction house, the percentage going to each party varying with the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Online sales ===
[[File:Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art).jpg|thumb|A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade]]
In May 1999, [[Teo Spiller]] sold a web art project Megatronix to Ljubljana Municipal Museum, which was by the New York Times announced as the first sell of an [[Internet art]] [[net.art]].&lt;ref&gt;Mirapaul, M [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/artsatlarge/13artsatlarge.html "There May Be Money in Internet Art After All"], ''The New York Times, 1999-05-13''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Sotheby's abandoned its partnership with [[eBay]] after it lost millions through its various attempts to sell fine art over the internet.&lt;ref name="duopoly"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/1612774 Just the two of us - The duopoly in fine-art auctions is weakened but very much alive] ''The Economist'', economist.com, February 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;


==What Counts==
The [[art sale|art market]] can also be used to understand what “counts” as part of art history. [[Art dealers]] and auctioneers organize material for distribution to collectors. Two of the largest, and oldest, art auction houses are [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]], and each hold frequent sales of great [[antiquities]] and [[Art Object|art objects]].

==Black Market==
In addition to upstanding practices, a [[black market]] exists for great art, which is closely tied to [[art theft]] and [[art forgery]]. No auction houses or dealers admit openly to participating in the black market because of its illegality, but exposés suggest widespread problems in the field. Because demand for art objects is high, and security in many parts of the world is low, a thriving trade in [[illicit antiquities]] acquired through [[looting]] also exists. Although the art community nearly universally condemns looting because it results in destruction of [[Archaeological site|archeological sites]], [[looted art]] paradoxically remains omnipresent. Warfare is correlated with such looting, as is demonstrated by the recent [[archaeological looting in Iraq]].

{{Crossdressing|history}}
A '''breeches role''' (also '''pants role''' or '''trouser role''', ''[[Travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'' or "Hosenrolle") is a role in which an actress appears in male clothing. [[Breeches]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|tʃ|ᵻ|z}}, also "britches"), tight-fitting knee-length pants, were the standard male garment at the time breeches roles were introduced. 

In opera it also refers to any male character that is sung and acted by a female singer. Most often the character is an adolescent or a very young man, sung by a [[mezzo-soprano]] or [[contralto]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Budden J. Breeches part. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The operatic concept assumes that the character is male, and the audience accepts him as such, even knowing that the actor is not. Cross-dressing female characters (e.g., Leonore in ''[[Fidelio]]'' or Gilda in Act III of ''[[Rigoletto]]'') are not considered breeches roles. The most frequently performed breeches roles are Cherubino (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''), Octavian (''[[Der Rosenkavalier]])'', Hansel (''[[Hansel und Gretel (opera)|Hansel und Gretel]]'') and Orpheus (''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Euridice]]''), though the latter was originally written for a male singer, first a [[castrato]] and later, in the revised French version, an [[haute-contre]].

Because non-musical stage plays generally have no requirements for vocal range, they do not usually contain breeches roles in the same sense as opera. Some plays do have male roles that were written for adult female actors, and (for other practical reasons) are usually played by women (e.g., ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''); these could be considered modern-era breeches roles. However, in most cases, the choice of a female actor to play a male character is made at the production level; [[Hamlet#Hamlet as a character|Hamlet]] is not a breeches role, but [[Sarah Bernhardt]] once played Hamlet ''as'' a breeches role. When a play is spoken of as "containing" a breeches role, this ''does'' mean a role where a female character pretends to be a man and uses male clothing as a disguise.

== History ==
When the London theatres re-opened in 1660, the first professional actresses appeared on the public stage, replacing the boys in dresses of the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] era. To see real women speak the risqué dialogue of [[Restoration comedy]] and show off their bodies on stage was a great novelty, and soon the even greater sensation was introduced of women wearing male clothes on stage. Out of some 375 plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700, it has been calculated that 89, nearly a quarter, contained one or more roles for actresses in male clothes (see Howe). Practically every Restoration actress appeared in trousers at some time, and breeches roles would even be inserted gratuitously in revivals of older plays.

Some critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, have argued that these [[cross-dressing]] roles subvert conventional [[gender roles]] by allowing women to imitate the roistering and sexually aggressive behaviour of male Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]], but Elizabeth Howe has objected in a detailed study that the male disguise was "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object". The epilogue to [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''Sir Anthony Love'' (1690) suggests that it does not much matter if the play is dull, as long as the audience can glimpse the legs of the famous "breeches" actress [[Susanna Verbruggen|Susanna Mountfort]] (also known as Susanna Verbruggen):

:You'll hear with Patience a dull Scene, to see,
:In a contented lazy waggery,
:The Female Mountford bare above the knee.

Katharine Eisaman Maus also argues that as well as revealing the female legs and buttocks, the breeches role frequently contained a revelation scene where the character not only unpins her hair but as often reveals a breast as well. This is evidenced in the portraits of many of these actresses of the Restoration.

Breeches roles remained an attraction on the British stage for centuries, but their fascination gradually declined as the difference in real-life male and female clothing became less extreme. They played a part in [[Victorian burlesque]] and are traditional for the [[principal boy]] in [[pantomime]].

== Opera ==
Historically, the list of roles that are considered to be breeches roles is constantly changing, depending on the tastes of the opera-going public. In early Italian opera, many leading operatic roles were assigned to a [[castrato]], a male castrated before puberty with a very strong and high voice. As the practice of castrating boy singers faded, composers created heroic male roles in the mezzo-soprano range, where singers such as [[Marietta Alboni]] and Rosamunda Pisaroni specialised in such roles.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; (See ''[[Serse|Xerxes]]'' below.)

Currently, many castrato roles are being reclaimed by men. As the training and use of [[countertenor]]s becomes more common, there are more men with these very high voices to sing these roles.

Casting directors are left with choices such as whether to cast the young Prince Orlofsky in [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss II's]] ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' for a woman or man; both commonly sing the role. When played by a mezzo, the prince looks like a woman, but sounds like a boy. When played by a counter-tenor, he looks like a man, but sings like a woman. This disparity is made even clearer if, as in this case, there is also spoken dialogue.

The term ''Travesty'' (from the Italian ''travesti'', disguised) applies to any roles sung by the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;Budden J. Travesty. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term is a ''skirt role'', a female character to be played by a male singer, usually for comic or visual effect. These roles are often ugly stepsisters or very old women, and are not as common as trouser roles. As women were not allowed to sing on stage in the [[Papal States]] during the [[Baroque period]], many female operatic roles which premiered in those areas were originally written as skirt roles for [[castrato|castrati]] (e.g. ''Mandane'' and ''Semira'' in [[Leonardo Vinci]]'s [[Artaserse (Vinci)|Artaserse]]). Britten's Madwoman in ''[[Curlew River]]'' and the Cook in Prokofiev's ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'' are examples. The role of the witch in Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', although written for a mezzo-soprano is now more regularly{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} sung by a tenor, who sings the part an octave lower. In the same opera the "male" roles of Hänsel, the Sandman, and the Dewman are however meant to be sung by women.

'''Brookhaven National Laboratory''' ('''BNL''') is a [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|United States Department of Energy national laboratory]] located in [[Upton, New York]], on [[Long Island]], and was formally established in 1947 at the site of [[Camp Upton]], a former [[List of United States Army installations|U.S. Army base]]. Its name stems from its location within the [[Brookhaven, New York|Town of Brookhaven]], approximately 60 miles east of [[New York City]].

Research at BNL specializes in nuclear and high energy physics, energy science and technology, environmental and bioscience, nanoscience and national security. The 5,300 acre campus contains several large research facilities, including the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] and [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]]. Seven [[Nobel prize]]s have been awarded for work conducted at Brookhaven lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/nobel/ |title=Nobel Prizes at BNL |publisher=Bnl.gov |access-date=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
BNL is staffed by approximately 2,750 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support personnel, and hosts 4,000 guest investigators every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/about/|title=About BNL|publisher=BNL.gov|accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory has its own police station, fire department, and [[ZIP code]] (11973).  In total, the lab spans a {{convert|5265|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} area that is mostly coterminous with the hamlet of [[Upton, New York]]. BNL is served by a rail spur operated as-needed by the [[New York and Atlantic Railway]]. Co-located with the laboratory is the Upton, New York, forecast office of the [[National Weather Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/okx/ |title=NWS Forecast Office New York, NY |date=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation===
Brookhaven National Lab was originally owned by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and is now owned by that agency's successor, the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). DOE subcontracts the research and operation to universities and research organizations.  It is currently operated by Brookhaven Science Associates LLC, which is an equal partnership of [[Stony Brook University]] and [[Battelle Memorial Institute]]. From 1947 to 1998, it was operated by [[Associated Universities, Inc.]] (AUI), but AUI lost its contract in the wake of two incidents: a 1994 fire at the facility's high-beam flux reactor that exposed several workers to radiation and reports in 1997 of a tritium leak into the groundwater of the [[Long Island Central Pine Barrens]] on which the facility sits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10614FD3B5A1B7B93C3A91788D85F438485F9 Atomic Laboratory on Long Island to Be Mighty Research Center – New York Times – March 1, 1947]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1997/5/21/laboratory-loses-federal-contract-pin-fallout/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundations===
Following [[World War II]], the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission]] was created to support government-sponsored peacetime research on atomic energy. The effort to build a [[nuclear reactor]] in the American northeast was fostered largely by physicists [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] and [[Norman Foster Ramsey Jr.]], who during the war witnessed many of their colleagues at [[Columbia University]] leave for new remote research sites following the departure of the [[Manhattan Project]] from its campus. Their effort to house this reactor near [[New York City]] was rivalled by a similar effort at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to have a facility near [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Involvement was quickly solicited from representatives of northeastern universities to the south and west of [[New York City]] such that this city would be at their geographic center. In March 1946 a nonprofit corporation was established that consisted of representatives from nine major research universities — [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University of Rochester]], and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crease |first=Robert P. |date= 1999|title= Making Physics: A Biography of Brookhaven National Laboratory|url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 17 considered sites in the Boston-Washington corridor, [[Camp Upton]] on [[Long Island]] was eventually chosen as the most suitable in consideration of space, transportation, and availability. The camp had been a training center from the [[United States Army|US Army]] during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  After the latter war, Camp Upton was deemed no longer necessary and became available for reuse. A plan was conceived to convert the military camp into a research facility.

On March 21, 1947, the Camp Upton site was officially transferred from the [[U.S. War Department]] to the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)]], predecessor to the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]].

===Research and facilities===
====Reactor history====
In 1947 construction began on the first [[nuclear reactor]] at Brookhaven, the [[Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor]]. This reactor, which opened in 1950, was the first reactor to be constructed in the United States after World War II.  The [[High Flux Beam Reactor]] operated from 1965 to 1999. In 1959 Brookhaven built the first US reactor specifically tailored to medical research, the [[Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor]], which operated until 2000.

====Accelerator history====
[[File:Satoshi Ozaki 1991.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[Satoshi Ozaki]] posed with a magnet for the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] in 1991]]
In 1952 Brookhaven began using its first [[particle accelerator]], the [[Cosmotron]]. At the time the Cosmotron was the world's highest energy accelerator, being the first to impart more than 1 [[GeV]] of energy to a particle. The Cosmotron was retired in 1966, after it was superseded in 1960 by the new [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] (AGS). The AGS was used in research that resulted in 3 [[Nobel prize]]s, including the discovery of the [[muon neutrino]], the [[charm quark]], and [[CP violation]]. The [[National Synchrotron Light Source]] operated from 1982 to 2014 and was involved with two Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. It has since been replaced by the [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]]. The [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC) has been operational since 2000. One of the world's only two operating heavy-ion colliders, RHIC is as of 2010 the second-highest-energy collider after the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. RHIC is housed in a tunnel 2.4 miles (3.9&amp;nbsp;km) long and is visible from space.

====Other discoveries====

In 1958, Brookhaven scientists created one of the world's first [[video game]]s, [[Tennis for Two]]. In 1968 Brookhaven scientists patented [[Maglev]], a transportation technology that utilizes [[magnetic levitation]].

==Off-site contributions==
It is a contributing partner to [[ATLAS experiment]], one of the four detectors located at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC).  It is currently operating at [[CERN]] near [[Geneva]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/ATLAS/|title=BNL {{!}} Brookhaven and the Large Hadron Collider|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brookhaven was also responsible for the design of the SNS accumulator ring in partnership with [[Spallation Neutron Source]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].

Brookhaven plays a role in a range of neutrino research projects around the world, including the [[Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment]] in China and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/science/neutrinos.php|title=BNL {{!}} Neutrino Research History|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public access==
[[File:National Synchrotron Light Source II.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior of [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]] facility in 2012, during a Brookhaven National Laboratory "Summer Sundays" public tour.]]
For other than approved Public Events, the Laboratory is closed to the general public. The lab is open to the public on several Sundays during the summer for tours and special programs. The public access program is referred to as 'Summer Sundays' and takes place on four Sundays from mid-July to mid-August, and features a science show and a tour of the lab's major facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/stakeholder/summersundays.php|title=BNL {{!}} Summer Sundays|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory also hosts science fairs, science bowls, and robotics competitions for local schools, and lectures, concerts, and scientific talks for the local community. The Lab estimates that each year it enhances the science education of roughly 35,000 kindergarten to 12th grade LI students, more than 200 undergraduates, and 550 teachers from across the United States.

== Controversy and environmental cleanup ==
In January 1997, ground water samples taken by BNL staff revealed concentrations of tritium that were twice the allowable federal drinking water standards—some samples taken later were 32 times the standard. The tritium was found to be leaking from the laboratory's High Flux Beam Reactor's spent-fuel pool into the aquifer that provides drinking water for nearby Suffolk County residents.

DOE's and BNL's investigation of this incident concluded that the tritium had been leaking for as long as 12 years without DOE's or BNL's knowledge. Installing wells that could have detected the leak was first discussed by BNL engineers in 1993, but the wells were not completed until 1996. The resulting controversy about both BNL's handling of the tritium leak and perceived lapses in DOE's oversight led to the termination of AUI as the BNL contractor in May 1997.

The responsibility for failing to discover Brookhaven's tritium leak has been acknowledged by laboratory managers, and DOE admits it failed to properly oversee the laboratory's operations. Brookhaven officials repeatedly treated the need for installing monitoring wells that would have detected the tritium leak as a low priority despite public concern and the laboratory's agreement to follow local environmental regulations. DOE's on-site oversight office, the Brookhaven Group, was directly responsible for Brookhaven's performance, but it failed to hold the laboratory accountable for meeting all of its regulatory commitments, especially its agreement to install monitoring wells. Senior DOE leadership also shared responsibility because they failed to put in place an effective system that encourages all parts of DOE to work together to ensure that contractors meet their responsibilities on environmental, safety and health issues. Unclear responsibilities for environment, safety and health matters has been a recurring problem for DOE management.

Since 1993, DOE has spent more than US$580 million on remediating soil and groundwater contamination at the lab site and completed several high-profile projects. These include the decommissioning and decontamination of the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/brookhaven-lab-reactor-fully-decommissioned-1.4027164|title=Lab reactor fully decommissioned|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; removal of mercury-contaminated sediment from the Peconic River, and installation and operation of 16 on- and off-site groundwater treatment systems that have cleaned more than 25 billion gallons of groundwater since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/community/cleanup/|title=Environmental Cleanup, Brookhaven National Laboratory|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after winning the contract to operate the lab in 1997, BSA formed a Community Advisory Council (CAC) to advise the laboratory director on cleanup projects and other items of interest to the community. The CAC represents a diverse range of interests and values of individuals and groups who are interested in or affected by the actions of the Laboratory. It consists of representatives from 26 local business, civic, education, environment, employee, government, and health organizations. The CAC sets its own agenda, brings forth issues important to the community, and works to provide consensus recommendations to Laboratory management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/stakeholder/cac.php|title=BNL {{!}} Community Advisory Council|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5870">'''Classroom walkthrough''' is a model of [[professional development]] for [[teacher]]s. Clinical supervision, or the practice of [[classroom]] observation and [[feedback]] has been one of the most often used tool in evaluating teacher performance, however the extent to which it helps teachers to improve their instruction is questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Pajak,E (2001). Clinical supervision in a standards based environment: Opportunities and challenges. Journal of teacher education. Sage Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the classroom walkthrough, not designed for evaluation, but for the purpose of professional development, has gained increasing popularity.&lt;ref&gt;David, J.L. (2008). What research says about classroom walkthroughs. Educational Leadership. 65(4), 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Instructional leadership is critical to the improvement of teaching and learning and plays a significant role with student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Leithwood,K. Louis,K. Anderson, S. &amp; Wahlstrom, K. (2004). Review of research. How leadership influences learning. NY: The Wallace Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[school]]s to respond and adapt, systems must exist that create the capacity to collectively process and apply knowledge about teaching and learning. &lt;ref&gt;Louis, K. (2006). Changing Culture of Schools: Professional Community, Organizational 	Learning and Trust. Journal of School Leadership.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning within a school is fostered when a group can identify a problem, and create a plan to collectively solve it.&lt;ref&gt;Masci, F., Cuddapah, J., Pajak, E. (2008) Becoming an agent of stability: keeping your 	school in balance during the perfect storm. American Secondary Education. 36 (2) 	57-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The walkthrough model, derived from [[Hewlett-Packard]]’s supervisory practice of [[Management By Wandering Around]], has been portrayed as an effective and efficient system to collect data regarding instructional practices and provide feedback.&lt;ref name="Downey, C. 2004"&gt;Downey, C., Steffy, B., English, F., Frase, L. Poston, W. (2004). The Three Minute 	Classroom Walk-Through: Changing School Supervisory Practice One Teacher at 	a Time. Thousand Oaks, CA. Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot Eisner suggests that to be effective, leaders must spend one third of their time in classrooms, and when principals spend more time in classrooms, teachers report a positive perception of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, E. (2002). The Arts and Creation of Mind. New Haven Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For teacher quality to improve, Sergiovanni states that [[leadership]] is the key.&lt;ref&gt;Sergiovanni,T. (2006) Rethinking Leadership, Thousand Oaks, CA: Crowin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; School improvement relies heavily on the working relationship between instructional leaders and teachers. The success of the organization is sustained when the leaders serve as teachers for others.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks,D. (2007). Leading for results. Thousand Oaks.CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The classroom walkthrough model consists of a series of frequent classroom visits where the observer(s) are present to look for predetermined evidence of specific practices. The observations last anywhere from two to forty-five minutes, and are intended to support the [[Staff_development|faculty]] in the delivery of instruction and [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;Downey, C. Steffy, B. English, F. Frase, L. Poston, W. (2004). The Three minute classroom walk-through: Changing school supervisory practice one teacher at a time. Thousand Oaks, CA. Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn Downey is known for her early work in the development of the classroom walkthrough model, however, there are several models available and some school districts have created their own. The aim of the classroom walkthrough is to provide direct and specific feedback to teachers based on the snapshot observed. The feedback can then be given to an individual, or the observer may provide a report of patterns noted during the walkthroughs.&lt;ref&gt;Downey,C. Steffy, B. English, F. Frase, L. Poston, W. (2004). The Three minute classroom walk-through: Changing school supervisory practice one teacher at a time. Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Staff Development Council, walkthroughs, sometimes referred to as "learning walks," provide the opportunity to:

*Reinforce attention to instructional practices
*Gather data about instructional practice and student learning
*Stimulate collegial conversation about teaching and learning
*Learn from other participants
*Deepen understandings and improve practices through continuous feedback &lt;ref&gt;National Staff Development Council, http://www.nsdc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cognitive Science and Neuropsychology Program''' has been organised by [[Csaba Pléh]], in 1999 at the Institute of Psychology, [[University of Szeged]]. The aim of the program is to introduce the theories and methods of [[cognitive science]] and [[neuropsychology]] both to undergraduate students and researchers from other fields. The program welcome guest professors, international students and other interested students and researchers for participation and collaboration. The program has the intent of becoming an interface between cognitive labs and disciplines in cognitive science, broadly conceived in [[Central Europe]]. In 2011-2012 the members of this group left University of Szeged. This group is not exist anymore. The members went to the [[University of Debrecen]], the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], [[Eötvös Loránd University]], etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="619">The '''Compliance problem''' is a problem in [[contractarian ethics]]. It states that it is in the individuals' best interest to agree to contracts, but not to comply to them.

[[Thomas Hobbes]] first outlined the compliance problem in [[The Leviathan]] with the character called 'the foole'. His suggested solution was political [[coercion]] and oppression.

[[David Gauthier]] is the current leading philosopher on the compliance problem. His suggested solution includes the theory of [[minimax relative concession]]. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/]

Inspired by California's [[California Legislative Analyst's Office|Legislative Analyst's Office]] that manages the state budget in a strictly nonpartisan fashion, the CBO was created as a nonpartisan agency by the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]]. It has earned the reputation of a trusted, in-house quasi-[[think tank]] for the Congress. 

There is a consensus among economists that "the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
The Congressional Budget Office was created by Title II of the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]] (Pub. L. 93-344), which was signed into law by President [[Richard Nixon]] on July 12, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Adam Kelsey|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/spicers-rebuke-puts-spotlight-congressional-budget-office-amid/story?id=46017070|title=What the CBO does and how it gets its numbers|date=March 13, 2017|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official operations began on February 24, 1975, with [[Alice Rivlin]] as director.&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;Philip Joyce, [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/PJ_WorkingPaper9_Feb11_Final.pdf The Congressional Budget Office at Middle Age], Working Paper #9, Hutchins Center on Fiscal &amp; Monetary Policy, [[Brookings Institution]] (February 17, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBO's creation stems from a fight between President Richard Nixon and a Democratic-controlled Congress. Congress wanted to protect its [[power of the purse]] from the executive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Sarah Binder|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/15/this-is-why-the-congressional-budget-office-will-likely-survive-republican-attacks/|title=This is why the Congressional Budget Office will likely survive Republican attacks|website=Washington Post|date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/13/14860856/congressional-budget-office-cbo-explained|title=The Congressional Budget Office, explained|work=Vox|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBO was created "within the legislative branch to bolster Congress’s budgetary understanding and ability to act. Lawmakers' aim was both technical and political: Generate a source of budgetary expertise to aid in writing annual budgets and lessen the legislature’s reliance on the president's [[Office of Management and Budget]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since its creation, the CBO has since supplanted the OMB "as the authoritative source of information on the economy and the budget in the eyes of Congress, the press, and the public."&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt;

==Mission==
The Congressional Budget Office is [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]], and produces "independent analyses of budgetary and economic issues to support the Congressional budget process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/2016-IntroToCBO.pdf|title=Introduction to CBO|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the agency releases reports and cost estimates for proposed legislation, without issuing any policy recommendations.

With respect to estimating spending for Congress, the Congressional Budget Office serves a purpose parallel to that of the [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|Joint Committee on Taxation]] for estimating revenue for Congress, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] for estimating revenues for the [[Executive (government)|Executive branch]]. This includes projections on the effect on [[national debt]] and cost estimates for legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/about/overview|title=Introduction to CBO|date=21 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Section 202(e) of the Budget Act requires the CBO to submit periodic reports about fiscal policy to the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House]] and [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget|Senate]] budget committees to provide baseline projections of the federal budget. This is currently done by preparation of an annual ''Economic and Budget Outlook'' plus a mid-year update. The agency also each year issues ''An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals'' for the upcoming fiscal year per a standing request of the [[Senate Committee on Appropriations]]. These three series are designated essential titles distributed to [[Federal depository library|Federal Depository Libraries]] and are available for purchase from the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Publishing Office]]. The CBO often provides testimony in response to requests from various Congressional committees and issues letters responding to queries made by members of Congress.

==Divisions==
The Congressional Budget Office is divided into eight divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staffing and Organization|url=http://www.cbo.gov/about/our-organization-and-people/|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Director==

The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]] jointly appoint the CBO Director after considering recommendations from the two budget committees. The term of office is four years, with no limit on the number of terms a director may serve. Either house of Congress, however, may remove the director by resolution. At the expiration of a term of office, the person serving as Director may continue in the position until his or her successor is appointed. The list of directors of the CBO are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs//data/2005/upl-meta-crs-8028/RL31880_2005Oct18.pdf |title=Congressional Budget Office: Appointment and Tenure of the Director and Deputy Director}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Whereas politicians on both sides of the aisle have criticized the CBO when its estimates have been politically inconvenient,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-na-pol-cbo-report-qa-20170314-story.html|title=What is the CBO, and can you trust its numbers on the Republican healthcare plan?|last=Lee|first=Don|date=2017-03-14|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; economists and other academics overwhelmingly reject that the CBO is partisan or that it fails to produce credible forecasts.

A March 2017 survey of leading economists shows a consensus behind the notion that "adjusting for legal restrictions on what the CBO can assume about future legislation and events, the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/the-cbo|title=The CBO|publisher=[[Initiative on Global Markets]] (IGM), [[University of Chicago]] [[Booth School of Business]]|language=en-US|date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MIT economist [[David Autor]], the "CBO has a good track record with a very difficult assignment. It errs, but not systematically or with partisan intent."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Yale economist [[Christopher Udry]], "There is no credible evidence of partisan bias."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Economist [[Walter E. Williams]] wrote in 1998 that the CBO was well-regarded for its "honest numbers" on fiscal and economic matters.&lt;ref name="Joyce" /&gt; According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "the CBO’s analyses and forecasting are regarded as good or better than others doing similar work... economists say that the CBO’s economic projections generally compare favorably against other outfits, and its long-term budget estimates have been fairly accurate."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder, the CBO "has emerged over its history as a neutral analyst of congressional budgets and cost estimates for proposed legislation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agency has "a nonpartisan staff culture".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Historically, the [[House Budget Committee]] and [[Senate Budget Committee]] have insulated the CBO from external pressures and attempts to politicize or weaken the office.&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt; Professor Philip Joyce of the [[University of Maryland School of Public Policy]] writes:

{{quote|This is quite surprising, in a sense, given the partisan nature of the Congress. It is not necessarily that these partisans have embraced nonpartisanship as a positive end in itself, however. Rather, the Budget Committees (and especially their leadership and staff) have recognized that a weak CBO (one that does not have a reputation for objective analysis, and whose conclusions are viewed as partisan) is not in their interest. A weak CBO weakens the Budget Committees, and indeed weakens Congress as a whole in its inevitable battles with the executive over budget and economic policy.&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt;}}

The conservation and restoration of time-based media art is a complex undertaking within the field of conservation that includes understanding both physical and digital conservation methods; there are many facets of time-based media conservation. Its major aim is to detect and monitor short and long-term changes that an artwork may undergo in response to its environment, technological developments, exhibition-design, or technicians' preferences.&lt;ref name="guggenheimENP"&gt;Guggenheim Museum (n.d.).

Examples of time-based media include artworks and installations composed of video, audio, film, slides, software-based art or other forms of technology-based artworks.&lt;ref name="smithsonianND"/&gt; A time-based media artwork will consist of the medium- for example a video tape or DVD, the equipment it is played on, and any additional installation components.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"&gt;Iles, Chrissie and Huldisch, Henriette (2005). Keeping Time: On Collecting Film and Video Art in the Museum. In ''Collecting the New''. Altshuler, Bruce (Ed.) NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Works containing video and/or audio may at times be referred to as "4D" (four-dimensional), referencing time as the fourth dimension, in addition to the other three dimensions in artwork: length, width, and height. Some time-based media works may overlap, in some respects, with [[New media art|New Media Art]]. Other terms that may also refer to time-based media art include "variable media art", "electronic art", "moving-image art", "technology-based art" and "time-based media". Time-based media collections may be housed in libraries and archives, but time-based media art collections are typically housed in museums, where film and video are collected as fine art and where the collection is typically smaller than in a library or archive.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Museums are more likely to collect video and installation-specific equipment as well.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; The majority of time-based media art is completed on noncommercial films stocks, such as 8mm or 16mm, on videotape, or via a digital means. Time-based media art is differentiated from professional or commercial film-making.

== Preservation and conservation strategies ==
Guidelines for collecting and preserving time-based media art are still evolving, and standards have not yet been reached.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Generally though, video and film must be looked at differently because of the difference between the two mediums, despite having the similarity of being recorded in time. Thus procedures for preservation and conservation will vary between the mediums. Video is a coded system, the information stored on the magnetic or digital tape can be retrieved only with a specific electronic playback device; the images on the film strip, however, are legible on their own, though the projector provides the only means by which they can be viewed.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; When collecting film and video art, a master and at least one sub-master should be obtained. In some cases, and exhibition copy will be obtained as well, in other cases it will be copied by the museum. The Guggenheim Museum provides preservation models for [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/7-2_TBM_Practices_5.pdf Analog Standard Definition Video], [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/7-2_TBM_Practices_6.pdf Digital Standard Definition Video], and [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/7-2_TBM_Practices_7.pdf High Definition Video]. Some conservators recommend that sub-masters be in digital format, as analog tape suffers from [[generation loss]], each time it is duplicated.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Digital formats can suffer from generation loss as well, but it can be avoided through good practice. The sub-master will be used to make new copies of the work and the format of the sub-master needs to be updated when it nears obsolescence. Obsolescence is of particular concern to time-based media art conservationists as many artworks are tied to hardware which is no longer manufactured or supported. File formats reaching obsolescence are another concern, as operating systems change and old formats are replaced by newer ones. Fortunately there are some methods in place to help prevent the total loss of time-based media artworks.

=== Preventative measures ===
The protection against physical loss, technological obsolescence, and digital loss of the file are important aspects of a holistic approach to preservation strategies. Measures must also be taken against environmental factors, such as humidity and pests to ensure the long-term preservation of any physical media. [[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated Pest Management]] is an important part of any museum preventative conservation plan. It is important to note that preventative measures do not stop deterioration fully, they merely prolong the time it takes for the media to deteriorate. Some media, like certain film stocks, are more stable than others, and some media, such as magnetic videotape are potentially unstable, so again different approaches will be necessary.

==== Storage and maintenance of physical objects ====
Good storage practices help ensure the long-life of an artwork and should be incorporated into a museum's conservation strategy. Storage practices vary by media, so a museum will need to employ a range of storage options to best care for their time-based media art collections. A variety of physical media, such as film, tape, and disks must be stored properly to prevent physical loss. Prevention is the best measure of protection against loss. How media is stored will be dependent on the type of media it is, film has different considerations than disks or videotape. Generally, time-based media storage will require cool temperatures and low humidity.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"&gt;IMAP. (2009). Preservation 101. Retrieved from www.imappreserve.org/pres_101/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film''' - film reels are typically stored in their metal or plastic canisters, laid flat, and stacked on top of each other. Film must be stored in a climate-controlled room due to its susceptibility to heat and humidity. Film may also have additional special storage considerations, which may involve low temperature freezes to retard further damage.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service (n.d.) Cold Storage. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/coldstorage/html/intro1_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303014739/http://www.nps.gov/museum/coldstorage/html/intro1_1.html |archivedate=2015-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; How stable the film is depends largely on the type of stock, but film, if well taken care of, is generally able to last for long periods of time. Film has been made on a variety of materials, including nitrate-based stock (see: [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|Nitrocellulose]]) and acetate-based stocks, and polyester-backed film, each have their own considerations. Nitrate film must be handled carefully, as it is highly flammable; [[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the .22vinegar syndrome.22|cellulose acetate film]] stocks are at risk of vinegar syndrome, whereas polyester-backed films are not.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt; Film is stored in a colder environment than other time-based media, and different types of film have different optimum storage temperatures. "Color film should be stored at the coldest possible temperature to reduce fading," 0-30 degrees Fahrenheit, while black and white film can be stored at a temperature of 25-50 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

'''Magnetic Videotape'''- Magnetic videotape was never meant to last, and often has a short life (often only a few decades) especially if exposed to warm or humid conditions.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Videotapes, should be stored in upright, under cool, dry, dust-free conditions.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Videotapes may be stored in polypropylene cases, but without paper inside the cases and "magnetic media should never be stored at temperatures below 46 degrees Fahrenheit".&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt; Magnetic media should also be kept away from magnetic sources, which could demagnetize them.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

'''Optical Digital Media''' - DVDs and CDs are another media that will need storage space. Optical media should be stored in hard plastic jewel cases or other inert plastic containers; avoid storage in plastic sleeves. DVDs and CDs can be stored at temperatures ranging from 62-68 degrees Fahrenheit, with 33-45% relative humidity, but cooler temperatures are recommended to ensure a longer life.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

'''Playback Devices''' - Because time-based media is dependent on technology to view it, playback devices must also be stored. There are some devices that will apply to many works in a time-based media art collection, but specific types of technological devices may be required for the art or preferred by the artist. Maintaining the technology that the time-based media art is played on is one conservation strategy, and what is stored depends on the device. Consumer products, for example, are not meant for repeated viewing on such a large scale and are usually not expected to have a long enough life to maintain the device well into the future. Due to rapid changes in video technology and the high cost of maintaining and storing equipment, storage and maintenance of some playback devices may not practical for a museum as a primary strategy.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Museums do at times need to store obsolete technology though, such as VCRs, old computers, video game systems, etc., particularly if they have been customized for the artwork by the artist. In these cases, conservation strategies could included acquiring spare parts (early on in the acquisition process, before the technology goes out of manufacture), making new components if necessary, and/or "recreating significant features by inexact substitution" (in order words, using the "best match").&lt;ref name="PLManagement"&gt;Laurenson, Pip (2005). The Management of Display Equipment in Time-based Media Installations. Tate Papers. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/7344 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926045821/http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/7344 |archivedate=2015-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until better solutions are found, keeping and maintaining old technology will remain a necessity. Unlike video equipment, film equipment is far more stable and museums may be more likely to conserve the equipment along with the media because there is less upkeep and film equipment does not need constant replacement due to obsolescence.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; A working projector will always run film. Technological devices should be stored in a clean, climate controlled environment, as humidity can be damaging to electronic components.

====Digital preservation====
Digital files must be preserved and stored as well, otherwise they also risk degradation. Due to the large amounts of storage space that may be needed, museums may want to employ the use of a digital repository that offers digital preservation as a service. Repositories will keep the digital file stored, perform migration (moving the old format to a new, usable format), and typically offer some guarantee of preservation for a specified period of time. Artists may also wish to seek out a repository for storage of their digital artwork. Rhizome's [http://rhizome.org/artbase/?ref=header Artbase] is an online archive that seeks to preserve contemporary digital art. Part of digital media storage is to ensure continuity of the digital file through format changes, thus migration becomes a likely strategy. Some conservators recommend that medium upgrades take place at least every five years, making duplication a main strategy of digital conservation.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt;

Time-based media art that either has an inherent digital component (i.e. a born-digital work) or has been digitized will have the need to be preserved digitally. While this work may not entirely be completed by the conservator, conservators will be aware of the methods used to preserve digital media. The Variable Media Approach, a strategy that comes from the Guggenheim Museum's Variable Media Initiative research, offers a way in which to define the artwork "independently from medium so that the work can be translated once its current medium is obsolete." &lt;ref&gt;Variable Media Network (n.d.) Retrieved from http://www.variablemedia.net/e/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is a methodology that approaches a work as independent from its media, so that is may be thought of as a behavior and not something tied to its hardware.&lt;ref&gt;Depocas, Alain  (2003). The Guggenheim Museum and the Daniel Langlois Foundation: The Variable Media Network. Retrieved from http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=98&lt;/ref&gt; This process looks to preserve works despite the uncertainty of technological developments of the future. By making a work independent from its medium, the Variable Media Approach hopes to ensure the life of the artwork well into the future, beyond the obsolescence of all current technology. The approach encompasses four aspects: Storage, Migration, Emulation, and Reinterpretation.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"&gt;Guggenheim Museum. (n.d.). The Variable Media Initiative. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/variable-media |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423083848/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/variable-media |archivedate=2015-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage is the most basic strategy. Migration simply means to copy the files to new storage media. With migration, conservators preserve the original aspects of the work. Emulation is not as straight forward, it involves some amount of interpretation and is more an imitation of the original work. In the context of digital media, "emulation offers a powerful technique for running an out-of-date computer on a contemporary one".&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; Reinterpretation is the most radical strategy, as it involves recreation of the work.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt;

When formats or storage media become obsolete, "time-based art is typically migrated to newer, accessible platforms".&lt;ref name="SICollaborations"&gt;Smithsonian Institution (2010). Collaborations in Conserving Time-Based Art: A Summary of Discussion Group Sessions of a Colloquium. Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.si.edu/content/tbma/documents/Time-Based-Art_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505095855/http://www.si.edu/content/tbma/documents/Time-Based-Art_Report.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This will mean updating the file format so that it is playable on newer technology. In some cases, this may not be in keeping with the artist's wishes, as he or she may wish to continue viewings of their work in a specific format. If the format is integral to the work, then upkeep becomes more involved and maintaining the usability of the artwork against the odds of obsolescence in both media and technology becomes a major preservation challenge.&lt;ref name="SICollaborations"/&gt; For this reason, it is encouraged that artists allow for some flexibility in future iterations of the artwork.

=== Examination and documentation ===
Examining and documenting the physical state of an object is an important part of understanding its overall condition. The process of examination and documentation will alert conservators to any problems that need immediate or future attention.

==== Physical examination ====
The physical components of time-based media art must be examined in order to understand their physical condition. With film, physical examination will identify a variety of deterioration processes, such as vinegar syndrome in safety films or color dye fading in color film stock. It is important to identify these early, not only to try to prevent further deterioration, but to intervene with treatment or to make a duplicate copy. Without the examination process, time-based media may degrade beyond repair and possibly be lost entirely.

==== Condition assessments ====
Condition assessments are procedures that are carried out by conservators or other collections care professionals to document the overall condition of an object. These assessments are necessary for all the types of media and technology associated with time-based media art. The assessments stay in the object's file and give future conservators insight into the object's life history. They are performed upon intake of an object into a collection, before and after the object goes on loan, and as necessary. They make note of any physical issues that may be present, such as tears, stains, scratches, or other damage. Film is especially vulnerable to tears and warping, while DVDs and CDs scratch easily. Other issues cannot be seen, such as demagnetization of tape, and require other methods of examination. After the condition of a physical object is assessed, the examiner may recommend treatment if necessary.

Independent Media Arts Preservation (IMAP) recommends taking certain steps to assessing the condition of time-based media: 1) Examine the container - damage on the outside of a container could mean damaged media inside the container. Cases should be examined for dents, stains, and molds or fungus. 2) Check for odor - it may be an indication that the media has deteriorated. Vinegar syndrome emits a vinegar-like odor when present. If media smells musty it could indicate magnetic decay. 3) Examine the surface and the edges - look for powder, dust, dirt and residue, they may indicate deterioration or surface contamination. 4) Identify the format - Knowing the media format is important to proper handling. 5) Play the tape - In some cases it may be necessary to play the tape, a process that if not handled carefully could damage the media. Playback can detect "noise, color shift, distortion, and timing flaws".&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

==== Further documentation ====
Because time-based media has a fourth dimension of time, not present in other types of works, additional documentation to understand the allographic nature of the media may be required, and is recommended. Such documents include the Guggenheim Museum's [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/Iteration_Report.pdf Iteration Report] or [http://variablemediaquestionnaire.net/ Variable Media Questionnaire] (VMQ), developed as part of the Variable Media Initiative. The reports collect information about the nature or behavior of the art, so that future curators and conservators can understand it from an artistic and behavioral point of view, as well as a technical point of view. This allows museum professionals to recreate, or make a new iteration, of a particular time-based media artwork. The most common behaviors assigned to time-based media art are interactive, encoded, and networked.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; Because a new viewing of a time-based work can only be an iteration, by making each viewing as close to the artist's desires as possible, the nature of the artwork is conserved.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; The reports collect information such as how to install the artwork, what the space (walls, floors, ceilings, additions) should look like and how it should be arranged, how equipment should be installed, and the technical set-up of the work. Each iteration will be dependent on the physical constraints of the room, so that no two installations will be completely alike. In the VMQ, an artist can order his or her preferences for technical specifications and whether any technology other than the original is allowed to be used. The reports are an important means of understanding how to set-up a work and make it as close to the prior iterations as possible.

===Research===
The history of time-based media art is not long, compared to more traditional forms of art. Much research is still needed in this area in order to move toward and achieve standardizations of practice.

====Research projects====
Two major research projects into time-based media include the Guggenheim Museum's [http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/variable-media Variable Media Initiative] and the Smithsonian's [http://www.si.edu/tbma/about Time Based Media and Digital Art Working Group].

=====The Variable Media Initiative=====
The Guggenheim Museum's research has led to the Variable Media Approach, and the Variable Media Questionnaire, a tool of the Variable Media Approach. Beginning in 1999, the Variable Media Initiative is one of the museum's most well-known research initiatives. Originally funded by a grant from the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science, and Technology in Montreal, Canada, the Variable Media Network (VMN) has grown into a group of international institutions and consultants, including University of Maine, the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archives, Franklin Furnace, Rhizome.org, and Performance Art Festival &amp; Archives &lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; It defined a new approach to documenting contemporary artworks dependent on media, by defining the media as "variable", the artwork becomes untangled from its material aspects, allowing preservation of the work through time without loss of meaning.

===Treatment===
Treatment methods of time-based media art include a mix of both traditional and new techniques. Not all of the work will fall to a conservator, because of the highly technical nature of some of the devices, "certain tasks have to be delegated to respective experts, such as media technicians, video engineers, programmers, film-lab professionals, service technicians, and similar specialists".&lt;ref&gt;Guggenheim Museum (n.d.). Establishing New Practices. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/time-based-media/establishing-new-practices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420201942/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/time-based-media/establishing-new-practices |archivedate=2015-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maintenance of the technology is an important part of the conservation process for many works of art.

====Treatment of physical objects====
Time-based media conservators will treat and maintain a variety of objects, including film reels, projectors, computers, TVs, and other types of technology. In cases of videotape and DVDs, migration of the work to another format will more likely be the case. Because there are so many types of media that support time-based media art, treatment of each type will vary. While the prevention of physical film degradation is important, the preservationist's main goal is to preserve the image, as the film itself often decays rapidly and beyond repair (see: [[Film preservation|Film Preservation]]). Film preservation falls into several categories: conservation, which is the "protection of the original film artifact"; duplication, which is the "making of a surrogate copy"; and restoration, which is the attempt to "reconstruct a specific version of a film", which will include piecing together footage from all known sources.&lt;ref name="NFPFGuide"&gt;National Film Preservation Foundation (2004). The Film Preservation Guide: The basics for archives, libraries, and museums. San Francisco, CA: National Film Preservation Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Film restoration will involve the use of duplicates, not the originals.&lt;ref name="NFPFGuide"/&gt; Duplication of an original to a new and stable film stock (a continuing process, as eventually the duplicate will degrade) and repairing tears in the physical film are common types of treatment for film stock. There is a growing need to understand digital processes of duplication as well. While much duplication still requires that film be moved to a new and stable film stock, digital has been advancing as a method of duplication, though many argue it should not be used alone as digital files are unproven in the long term (see again: [[Film preservation|Film Preservation]]).

In the case of technology, treatment will look more like maintenance and will be required to keep the object functional. Obsolescence of technology is a major concern as discussed under Storage and Maintenance of Physical Objects.

=== Education and outreach  ===

====Access====
Access is the process through which artistic content is shared with public, such as providing researchers access to materials for scholarly work. Museums will more likely lend copies for study purposes, though study of the original may be warranted at times.

====Community outreach====
Festivals such as Portland's [[Time-Based Art Festival]] take place annually and are reflective of the general acceptance of time-based media art outside the walls of the museum.

== Education and training==

===Educational programs===
There are few conservation programs specific to time-based media art, but the [http://www.hkb.bfh.ch/en/ Bern University of the Arts] in Bern, Switzerland offers an MA program for the Conservation of Modern Materials and Media. Programs that include some aspect of time-based media include [https://www.rochester.edu/College/FMS/graduate/selznick.html The Selznick Graduate Program in Film and Media Preservation at the University of Rochester] in New York and [http://cinema.tisch.nyu.edu/page/miap.html New York University's Moving Image Archiving and Preservation program]. At UCLA, there is an [http://mias.gseis.ucla.edu/ M.A. in Moving Image Archive Studies]. The latter three programs deal primarily in archival film preservation, which requires specialized training in a variety of film stocks. A film preservationist must be knowledgeable about and trained to work with many types of film. In a museum context, the film is more likely to be consumer sizes like super 8mm and 16mm, not the 35mm that is used in commercial film making, as they are the preferred medium of artist and amateur filmmakers. Typically, the 35mm stock will be more prevalent in a library or archive. Because of the few formalized education programs in time-based media, most conservators of time-based media art make their way there through a professional path.

===Professional training===
Independent Media Arts Preservation (IMAP) is a non-profit organization that offers training to professionals within time-based media art preservation to include workshops, cataloging training, public programs, one-on-one assessments, and technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Independent Media Arts Preservation (n.d.).

Although the members of an epistemic community may originate from a variety of academic or professional backgrounds, they are linked by a set of unifying characteristics&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; for the promotion of collective amelioration and not collective gain.&lt;ref name="sebenius 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebenius|first=James K.|title=Challenging conventional explanations of international cooperation: negotiation analysis and the case of epistemic communities|journal=[[International Organization]]|volume=46|issue=1|pages=323–365|publisher =[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0020818300001521|date= Winter 1992|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300001521 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is termed their "normative component".&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; In the big picture, epistemic communities are socio-psychological entities that create and justify knowledge. Such communities can constitute of only two persons and yet gain an important role in building knowledge on any specific subject. Miika Vähämaa has recently suggested that epistemic communities consist of persons being able to understand, discuss and gain self-esteem concerning the matters being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Vähämaa | first = Miika | title = Groups as epistemic communities: social forces and affect as antecedents to knowledge | journal = [[Social Epistemology (journal)|Social Epistemology]] | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–20 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/02691728.2012.760660 | date = January 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02691728.2012.760660 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

Some theorists argue that an epistemic community may consist of those who accept one version of a story, or one version of validating a story. [[Michel Foucault]] referred more elaborately to [[Mathesis (philosophy)|mathesis]] as a rigorous [[episteme]] suitable for enabling cohesion of a [[discourse]] and thus uniting a community of its followers.  In [[philosophy of science]] and [[systems science]] the process of forming a self-maintaining epistemic community is sometimes called a [[mindset]].  In [[politics]], a tendency or [[Political factions|faction]] is usually described in very similar terms.

Most researchers carefully distinguish between epistemic forms of community and "real" or "bodily" [[community]] which consists of people sharing [[risk]], especially bodily risk.

It is also problematic to draw the line between modern ideas and more ancient ones, for example, [[Joseph Campbell]]'s concept of [[mythology|myth]] from [[cultural anthropology]], and [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of [[archetype]] in [[psychology]]. Some consider forming an epistemic community a deep human need, and ultimately a mythical or even religious obligation. Among these very notably are [[E. O. Wilson]], as well as [[Ellen Dissanayake]], an American historian of [[aesthetics]] who famously argued that almost all of our broadly shared [[conceptual metaphor]]s centre on one basic idea of safety: that of "home".

From this view, an epistemic community may be seen as a group of people who do not have any specific history together, but search for a common idea of home as if forming an [[intentional community]].  For example, an epistemic community can be found in a network of professionals from a wide variety of disciplines and backgrounds.&lt;ref name="reinalda184"&gt;{{citation | last = Verdun | first = Amy | contribution = The increase influence of EU monetary institutions in determining national policies: a transnational monetary elite at work | editor-last1 = Reinalda | editor-first1 = Bob | editor-last2 = Verbeek | editor-first2 = Bertjan | title = Autonomous policy making by international organizations | page = 184 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1998 | series = Routledge/ECPR Studies in European Political Science Series | isbn = 9780415164863 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed in Peter M. Haas's definitive text,&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; an epistemic community is made up of a diverse range of academic and professional experts, who are allied on the basis of four unifying characteristics:

# a ''shared set of normative and principled beliefs'' which provide a value-based rationale for the social action of community members; 
# ''shared causal beliefs'' which are derived from their analysis of practices leading or contributing to a central set of problems in their domain and which then serve as the basis for elucidating the multiple linkages between possible policy actions and desired outcomes;
# ''shared notions of validity'', i.e. intersubjective, internally defined criteria for weighing and validating knowledge in the domain of their expertise; and
# a ''common policy enterprise'', or a set of common practices associated with a set of problems to which their professional competence is directed, presumably out of the conviction that human welfare will be enhanced as a consequence.

Thus, when viewed as an epistemic community, the overall enterprise of the expert members emerges as the product of a combination of shared beliefs and more subtle conformity pressures, rather than a direct drive for concurrence (Michael J. Mazarr). Epistemic communities also have a "normative component" meaning the end goal is always for the betterment of society, rather than self gain of the community itself (Peter M. Haas).

In international relations and political science, an [[Epistemic community (international relations)|epistemic community]] can also be referred to as a global network of knowledge-based professionals in scientific and technological areas that often affect policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Morin, Jean-Frédéric, Louafi, Sélim, Orsini Amandine and Mohamed Oubenal, Boundary organizations in regime complexes: a social network profile of IPBES, Journal of International Relations and Development, 2016, http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_et_al._2016_ipbes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Environmental Governance==
The global environmental agenda is increasing in [[complexity]] and [[interconnectivity|interconnectedness]].&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; Often environmental policymakers do not understand the technical aspects of the issues they are regulating.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=Peter M.|authorlink=Peter M. Haas|title=Obtaining international environmental protection through epistemic consensus|journal=Millennium Journal of International Studies|volume=19|issue=3|pages=347–363|publisher =[[Sage Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1177/03058298900190030401|date= December 1990|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03058298900190030401 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects their ability to define state interests and develop suitable solutions within cross-boundary [[environmental regulation]].&lt;ref name="litfin 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Litfin | first = Karen T. | title = Environment, wealth, and authority: global climate change and emerging modes of legitimation | journal = [[International Studies Review]], special issue: Continuity and Change in the Westphalian Order | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–148 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1521-9488.00207 | jstor = 3186430 | date = Summer 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1521-9488.00207 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, conditions of [[uncertainty]] are produced which stimulate a demand for new information.&lt;ref name="zito2001a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Zito | first = Anthony R. | title = Epistemic communities, collective entrepreneurship and European integration | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 585–603 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760110064401 | date = January 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760110064401 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental [[crises]] play a significant role in exacerbating conditions of uncertainty for decision-makers.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; Political elites seek expert knowledge and advice to reduce this technical uncertainty, on issues including:
* the scale of environmental problems,
* cause-and-effect interrelations of ecological processes, and
* how ([[science]]-based) policy options will play out.&lt;ref name="meijerink 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Meijerink | first = Sander | title = Understanding policy stability and change. the interplay of advocacy coalitions and epistemic communities, windows of opportunity, and Dutch coastal flooding policy 1945–2003 | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1060–1077 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760500270745 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760500270745 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, epistemic communities can frame environmental problems as they see fit, and environmental decision-makers begin to make policy-shaping decisions based on these specific depictions.&lt;ref name="zito 2001b"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Zito | first = Anthony R. | title = Epistemic communities, European Union governance and the public voice | journal = Science and Public Policy | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 465–476 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.3152/147154301781781183 | date = December 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3152/147154301781781183 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial identification and bounding of environmental issues by epistemic community members is very influential.&lt;ref name="toke 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Toke | first = Dave | title = Epistemic communities and environmental groups | journal = Politics | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–102 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9256.00091 | date = May 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9256.00091 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can limit what would be preferable in terms of national interests, frame what issues are available for collective debate, and delimit the policy alternatives deemed possible.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"/&gt; The political effects are not easily reversible.&lt;ref name="adler and haas 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Adler| first1=Emanuel|last2=Haas|first2=Peter M.|authorlink2=Peter M. Haas|title=Conclusion: epistemic communities, world order, and the creation of a reflective research program|journal=[[International Organization]], special issue: Knowledge, Power, and International Policy Coordination|volume=46|issue=1|pages=367–390|publisher =[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0020818300001533|jstor=2706960|date= Winter 1992|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300001533 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epistemic community vision is institutionalised as a collective set of understandings reflected in any subsequent policy choices.&lt;ref name="adler and haas 1992"/&gt;

This is a key point of power. Policy actors are persuaded to conform to the community’s consensual, knowledge-driven ideas without the epistemic community requiring a more material form of power.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; Members of successful communities can become strong actors at the national and international level as decision-makers attach responsibility to their advice.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt;

As a result, epistemic communities have a direct input on how international cooperation may develop in the long term.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"/&gt; Transboundary environmental problems require a unified response rather than patchwork policy efforts, but this is problematic due to enduring differences of state interest and concerns over reciprocity.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; The transnational nature of epistemic communities means numerous states may absorb new patterns of logic and behaviour, leading to the adoption of concordant state policies.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"/&gt; Therefore, the likelihood of convergent state behaviour and associated international coordination is increased.

International cooperation is further facilitated if powerful states are involved, as a quasi-structure is created containing the reasons, expectations and arguments for coordination.&lt;ref name="adler and haas 1992"/&gt; Also, if epistemic community members have developed authoritative bureaucratic reputations in various countries, they are likely to participate in the creation and running of national and international institutions that directly pursue international policy coordination, for example, a [[regulatory agency]], [[think tank]] or governmental research body.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt;

As a result, epistemic community members in a number of different countries can become connected through intergovernmental channels, as well as existing community channels, producing a [[transnational governance]] network, and facilitating the promotion of international policy coordination. An example of a scientific epistemic community in action is the 1975 collectively negotiated Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP), a marine [[pollution control]] regime for the [[Mediterranean Sea]] developed by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].&lt;ref name="haas 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas |first=Peter M.|authorlink=Peter M.

[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Thermophile]]s, a type of extremophile, produce some of the bright colors of [[Grand Prismatic Spring]], [[Yellowstone National Park]]]]
An '''extremophile''' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|extremus}}'' meaning "extreme" and Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|philiā}}'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}}) meaning "love") is an [[organism]] that thrives in physically or geochemically [[extreme environment|extreme conditions]] that are detrimental to most [[life|life on Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rampelotto | first1 = P.

==Characteristics==
In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that [[microbial life]] has great flexibility for surviving in extreme environments—niches that are acidic or extraordinarily hot, for example—that would be completely inhospitable to [[complex organisms]]. Some scientists even concluded that life may have begun on Earth in [[hydrothermal vent]]s far under the ocean's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/merlaunch.pdf |title=Mars Exploration Rover Launches - Press kit |accessdate=14 July 2009 |date=June 2003 |format=PDF |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
There are many classes of extremophiles that range all around the globe, each corresponding to the way its environmental niche differs from mesophilic conditions. These classifications are not exclusive. Many extremophiles fall under multiple categories and are classified as [[polyextremophile]]s. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth's surface are thermophilic and barophilic such as ''Thermococcus barophilus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1999 | title = Thermococcus barophilus sp. nov., a new barophilic and hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated under high hydrostatic pressure from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent | doi = 10.1099/00207713-49-2-351 | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 351–359 | pmid=10319455 | last1 = Marteinsson | first1 = VT | last2 = Birrien | first2 = JL | last3 = Reysenbach | first3 = AL | last4 = Vernet | first4 = M | last5 = Marie | first5 = D | last6 = Gambacorta | first6 = A | last7 = Messner | first7 = P | last8 = Sleytr | first8 = UB | last9 = Prieur | first9 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt; A polyextremophile living at the summit of a mountain in the [[Atacama Desert]] might be a [[radioresistant]] [[xerophile]], a [[psychrophile]], and an [[oligotroph]].

===Terms===
; [[Acidophile (organisms)|Acidophile]]: An organism with optimal growth at [[pH]] levels of 3 or below

; [[Alkaliphile]]: An organism with optimal growth at [[pH]] levels of 9 or above

; [[Anaerobe]]: An organism that does not require [[oxygen]] for growth such as ''[[Spinoloricus cinzia]]''. Two sub-types exist: [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobe]] and [[obligate anaerobe]]. A facultative anaerobe can tolerate anaerobic and aerobic conditions; however, an obligate anaerobe would die in the presence of even trace levels of oxygen

; [[Cryptoendolith]]: An organism that lives in microscopic spaces within rocks, such as pores between aggregate grains; these may also be called [[endolith]], a term that also includes organisms populating fissures, [[aquifer]]s, and faults filled with groundwater in the deep subsurface

; [[Halophile]]: An organism requiring at least 0.2[[molarity|M]] concentrations of salt ([[Sodium chloride|NaCl]]) for growth&lt;ref&gt;Cavicchioli, R. &amp; Thomas, T. 2000. Extremophiles. In: J. Lederberg. (ed.) Encyclopedia of Microbiology, Second Edition, Vol. 2, pp. 317–337. Academic Press, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Hyperthermophile]]: An organism that can thrive at temperatures above 80&amp;nbsp;°C, such as those found in hydrothermal systems

; [[Hypolith]]: An organism that lives underneath rocks in cold deserts

; [[Lithoautotroph]]: An organism (usually bacteria) whose sole source of [[carbon]] is [[carbon dioxide]] and exergonic inorganic [[oxidation]] ([[chemolithotrophs]]) such as ''[[Nitrosomonas europaea]]''; these organisms are capable of deriving energy from reduced mineral compounds like [[pyrite]]s, and are active in [[geochemical cycle|geochemical cycling]] and the weathering of parent [[bedrock]] to form soil

; [[Metallotolerant]]: Capable of tolerating high levels of dissolved heavy metals in solution, such as [[copper]], [[cadmium]], [[arsenic]], and [[zinc]]; examples include ''[[Ferroplasma]] sp.,'' ''[[Cupriavidus metallidurans]]'' and [[GFAJ-1]]&lt;ref name='refute'&gt;{{cite news | title = Studies refute arsenic bug claim | date = 9 July 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18770964 | work = BBC News | accessdate =10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= GFAJ-1 Is an Arsenate-Resistant, Phosphate-Dependent Organism |journal=Science |date=8 July 2012 |id= |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/07/06/science.1218455 |accessdate =10 July 2012 |doi=10.1126/science.1218455 |pmid=22773139 |volume=337 |issue=6093 |pages=467–70 |last1=Erb |first1=Tobias J. |last2=Kiefer |first2=Patrick |last3=Hattendorf |first3=Bodo |last4=Günther |first4=Detlef |last5=Vorholt |first5=Julia A.|author5-link=Julia Vorholt|bibcode = 2012Sci...337..467E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Absence of Detectable Arsenate in DNA from Arsenate-Grown GFAJ-1 Cells |journal=Science |date=8 July 2012 |id= |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/07/06/science.1219861 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |doi=10.1126/science.1219861 |pmid=22773140 |pmc=3845625 |volume=337 |issue=6093 |pages=470–3 |last1=Reaves |first1=Marshall Louis |last2=Sinha |first2=Sunita |last3=Rabinowitz |first3=Joshua D. |last4=Kruglyak |first4=Leonid |last5=Redfield |first5=Rosemary J.|arxiv = 1201.6643 |bibcode = 2012Sci...337..470R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Oligotroph]]: An organism capable of growth in nutritionally limited environments

; [[Osmophile]]: An organism capable of growth in environments with a high sugar concentration

; [[Piezophile]]: Also referred to as [[barophile]], is an organism that lives optimally at high [[pressure]]s such as those deep in the ocean or underground;&lt;ref name="DworkinFalkow2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dworkin|first1=Martin|last2=Falkow|first2=Stanley|title=The Prokaryotes: Vol. 1: Symbiotic Associations, Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqh43LFTGBQC&amp;pg=PA94|date=13 July 2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-25476-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; common in the deep terrestrial subsurface, as well as in [[oceanic trench]]es.

; Polyextremophile: A '''polyextremophile''' (faux Ancient Latin/Greek for 'affection for many extremes') is an organism that qualifies as an extremophile under more than one category

; [[Psychrophile]]/Cryophile: An organism capable of survival, growth or reproduction at temperatures of -15&amp;nbsp;°C or lower for extended periods; common in cold soils, [[permafrost]], [[polar ice]], cold ocean water, and in or under alpine snowpack. Psychrophilic organisms live in environments at temperature below -15&amp;nbsp;°C. Low temperatures cause the energy within proteins to slow, which prevents them from functioning.  Their proteins have adapted their amino acid composition to live in  cold conditions. They have a high amount of [[glycine]] amino acids, which small size allows for more flexibility within the protein once it is folded. Psychrophiles also have a low concentration of charged amino acids, hydrophobic (non-polar) amino acids, and proline residues. The low amount of charged amino acids reduces the amount of interactions between them, while the reduced amount of hydrophobic (non-polar) amino acids allows the non-polar core of the protein to be smaller. Psychrophilic proteins have a small amount of [[proline]] amino acids because they cause a rigid structure. These adaptations allow psychrophilic proteins to be more flexible so they do not freeze under cold conditions.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'/&gt;

; [[Radioresistant]]: Organisms resistant to high levels of [[ionizing radiation]], most commonly ultraviolet radiation, but also including organisms capable of resisting nuclear radiation

; [[Thermophile]]: An organism that can thrive at temperatures between 45–122&amp;nbsp;°C. Normally high temperatures cause proteins to unfold and prevent them from functioning; thermophilic proteins have adapted their proteins to cope with these conditions. They have a higher amount of [[cysteine]] amino acids, which form [[disulfide bond]]s once the protein has folded. These disulfide bonds cause the protein to fold up tighter and become more rigid. They also have more charged amino acids, both positive and negative, that interact with each other to increase how rigid the protein is. When proteins become more rigid they are less likely to unfold due to high temperature. Even one extra disulfide bond can raise the temperature at which the protein folds by 6&amp;nbsp;°C. These adapted proteins allow thermophilic extremophiles to survive at high temperatures.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'/&gt;

; [[Thermoacidophile]]: Combination of [[thermophile]] and [[Acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]] that prefer temperatures of 70–80&amp;nbsp;°C and pH between 2 and 3

; [[Xerophile]]: An organism that can grow in extremely dry, desiccating conditions; this type is exemplified by the soil microbes of the [[Atacama Desert]]
&lt;!--; [[GFAJ-1]]: An [[organism]] in the family [[Halomonadaceae]] that can tolerate extreme levels of [[arsenic]], but [[GFAJ-1]] can go a step further. When starved of [[phosphorus]], it can incorporate [[arsenic]] into its [[DNA]] and continue growing.--&gt;

== In astrobiology ==
[[Astrobiology]] is the study of the [[abiogenesis|origin]], [[evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]]: [[extraterrestrial life]] and [[Earliest known life forms|life on Earth]]. Astrobiology makes use of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], [[solar physics]], [[biology]], [[molecular biology]], [[ecology]], [[planetary science]], [[geography]], and [[geology]] to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize [[biosphere]]s that might be different from that on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life and death of planet Earth |last1=Ward |first1=P.

For example, analogous deserts of [[Antarctica]] are exposed to harmful [[UV radiation]], low temperature, high salt concentration and low mineral concentration. These conditions are similar to those on [[Mars]]. Therefore, finding viable microbes in the subsurface of Antarctica suggests that there may be microbes surviving in [[Endolith|endolithic communities]] and living under the Martian surface. Research indicates it is unlikely that Martian microbes exist on the surface or at shallow depths, but may be found at subsurface depths of around 100 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Wynn-Williams|first1=D.

Recent research carried out on extremophiles in [[Japan]] involved a variety of [[bacteria]] including ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an [[ultracentrifuge]] at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 [[Gravity of Earth|g]] (i.e. 403,627 times the gravity experienced on Earth). ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of [[supernova]]s. Analysis showed that the small size of [[prokaryotic cell]]s is essential for successful growth under [[hypergravity]].

On September 2015, scientists from [https://www.cnr.it/en CNR-National Research Council] of Italy reported that [[Sulfolobus solfataricus|''S.soflataricus'']] was able to survive under Martian radiation at a wavelength that was considered extremely lethal to most bacteria.

On June 2016, scientists from Brigham Young University conclusively reported that [[endospore]]s of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' were able to survive high speed impacts up to 299±28&amp;nbsp;m/s, extreme shock, and extreme deceleration. They pointed out that this feature might allow endospores to survive and to be transferred between planets by traveling within meteorites or by experiencing atmosphere disruption. Moreover, they suggested that the landing of spacecraft may also result in interplanetary spore transfer, given that spores can survive high-velocity impact while ejected from the spacecraft onto the planet surface. This is the first study which reported that bacteria can survive in such high-velocity impact. However, the lethal impact speed is unknown, and further experiments should be done by introducing higher-velocity impact to bacterial endospores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barney|first1=Brandon L.|last2=Pratt|first2=Sara N.|last3=Austin|first3=Daniel E.|title=Survivability of bare, individual Bacillus subtilis spores to high-velocity surface impact: Implications for microbial transfer through space|journal=Planetary and Space Science|date=June 2016|volume=125|pages=20–26|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2016.02.010|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063315300088|bibcode=2016P&amp;SS..125...20B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
New sub-types of -philes are identified frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life lives in the liquid [[asphalt]] lake, [[Pitch Lake]]. Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the asphalt lake in populations ranging between 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells/gram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25051/ Microbial Life Found in Hydrocarbon Lake.] ''the physics arXiv blog'' 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulze-Makuch, Haque, Antonio, Ali, Hosein, Song, Yang, Zaikova, Beckles, Guinan, Lehto, Hallam. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2047 Microbial Life in a Liquid Asphalt Desert.]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, until recently [[boron]] tolerance was unknown but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria.

== Industrial uses ==
The thermoalkaliphilic [[catalase]], which initiates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water, was isolated from an organism, ''[[Thermus brockianus]]'', found in [[Yellowstone National Park]] by [[Idaho National Laboratory]] researchers. The catalase operates over a temperature range from 30&amp;nbsp;°C to over 94&amp;nbsp;°C and a pH range from 6–10. This catalase is extremely stable compared to other catalases at high temperatures and pH. In a comparative study, the ''T. brockianus'' catalase exhibited a half life of 15 days at 80&amp;nbsp;°C and pH 10 while a catalase derived from ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' had a half life of 15 seconds under the same conditions. The catalase will have applications for removal of hydrogen peroxide in industrial processes such as pulp and paper bleaching, textile bleaching, food pasteurization, and surface decontamination of food packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/idaho_national_laboratory_biological_systems/352/bioenergy_and_industrial_microbiology/2660 |title=Bioenergy and Industrial Microbiology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |website=Idaho National Laboratory |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA transfer==
Over 65 prokaryotic species are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation, the ability to transfer DNA from one cell to another cell followed by integration of the donor DNA into the recipient cell's chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnsborg | first1 = O | last2 = Eldholm | first2 = V | last3 = Håvarstein | first3 = LS. | year = 2007 | title = Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function | url = | journal = Res Microbiol | volume = 158 | issue = 10| pages = 767–78 | doi = 10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 | pmid = 17997281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several extremophiles are able to carry out species-specific DNA transfer, as described below.  However, it is not yet clear how common such a capability is among extremophiles.

The bacterium ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' is one of the most radioresistant organisms known.  This bacterium can also survive cold, dehydration, vacuum and acid and is thus known as a polyextremophile.  ''D. radiodurans'' is competent to perform [[Transformation (genetics)|genetic transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moseley | first1 = BE | last2 = Setlow | first2 = JK. | year = 1968 | title = Transformation in Micrococcus radiodurans and the ultraviolet sensitivity of its transforming DNA | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 176–83 | pmid = 5303325 | doi=10.1073/pnas.61.1.176|bibcode = 1968PNAS...61..176M | pmc=285920}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recipient cells are able to repair DNA damage in donor transforming DNA that had been UV irradiated as efficiently as they repair cellular DNA when the cells themselves are irradiated.

'''Forensic electrical engineering''' is a branch of [[forensic engineering]], and is concerned with investigating electrical failures and accidents in a legal context.   Many forensic electrical engineering investigations apply to fires suspected to be caused by electrical failures.   Forensic electrical engineers are most commonly retained by insurance companies or attorneys representing insurance companies, or by manufacturers or contractors defending themselves against [[subrogation]] by insurance companies. Other areas of investigation include [[accident]] investigation involving [[electric shock|electrocution]], and [[intellectual property]] disputes such as [[patent]] actions. Additionally, since electrical fires are most often cited as the cause for "suspect" fires an electrical engineer is often employed to evaluate the electrical equipment and systems to determine whether the cause of the fire was electrical in nature.

==Goals==
The ultimate goal of these investigations is often to determine the legal liability for a [[fire]] or other [[accident]] for purposes of [[insurance]] [[subrogation]] or an injury lawsuit.   Some examples include:
* ''Defective appliances'':   If a property fire was caused by an appliance which had a manufacturing or design defect (for example, a [[coffee maker]] overheating and igniting), making it unreasonably hazardous, the insurance company might attempt to collect the cost of the fire damage ("subrogate") from the manufacturer; if the fire caused personal injury or death, the injured party might also attempt an injury lawsuit against the manufacturer, in addition to the carrier of health or life insurance attempting subrogation.
* ''Improper workmanship'':   If, for example, an [[electrician]] made an improper installation in a house, leading to an electrical fault and fire, he or she could likewise be the target of subrogation or an injury lawsuit (for this reason, electricians are required to carry liability insurance).
* ''Electrical injury'':   If an electrical fault or unreasonably hazardous electrical system causes an [[Electric shock|electrical injury]] ("electrocution" if the injury is fatal), the party responsible for the electrical accident can be the target of insurance subrogation or an injury lawsuit.
* ''Equipment failure'': if electrical equipment stops functioning, it can cause a loss of income (such as a factory losing productivity due to inoperative equipment) or additional damage (such as food products spoiling due to loss of refrigeration), and again be the subject of a subrogation or liability case.   Liability in such a case can also include the cost of repairing or replacing the equipment, which can be substantial.

==Applications==
Forensic electrical engineers are also involved in some [[arson]] and set-fire investigations; while it is not common for arsonists to cause electrical failures to ignite fires, the presence of electrical appliances and systems in many fires scenes often requires them to be evaluated as possible accidental causes of the fire.   Some electrical means of ignition, when discovered, are fairly obvious to an [[origin and cause investigator]] and most likely do not require consulting with a forensic electrical engineer.   (Note that "arson" refers specifically to a criminal act, subject to criminal prosecution; a more general term is a "set fire".   A homeowner setting a fire deliberately in order to defraud an insurance company might be prosecuted for arson by a government body; however, the insurance company would concern itself only with denying the insurance claim, possibly leading to a civil lawsuit.)

Patent disputes may also require the expert opinion of an electrical engineer to advise a court. Issues in conflict may include the precise meaning of technical terms, especially in the [[claim (patent)|patent claim]]s, the [[prior art]] in a particular product field and the [[inventive step and non-obviousness|obviousness]] of various patents.

==Liability==
Most states have a statute of ultimate repose (similar to, but not to be confused with, a statute of limitations) that limits the length of time after which a party can legally be held liable for their negligent act or defective product.  Many states have a "useful life" statute of ultimate repose.  Therefore, a determination of the length of time the product would normally be expected to be used before wearing out needs to be made. For example, a refrigerator might have a longer "useful life" than an electric fan; an airplane might have a longer useful life than a car.  Some states pick an arbitrary number of years for the statute of ultimate repose.  It may be short (six or seven years) or longer 15 or 25 years.  If a coffee maker starts on fire after the statute of ultimate repose has expired, the manufacturer can no longer be held liable for manufacturing or design defects.  The statute of ultimate repose is different from the statute of limitations.  In a state with a short statute of ultimate repose, it is common that a person's right to bring a claim in court expires before their injury ever occurs.  Thus, if a defective product (for example a car) caused a collision when the steering failed, but the collision occurred after the expiration of a statute of ultimate repose, no claim could be brought against the manufacturer for selling a defective product.  The right to bring the claim expired before the claim even occurred.

== Background ==
The word '''embolalia''' comes from the Greek word ''embolos'' which means 'something thrown in', from the word ''emballo-'' meaning 'to throw in',&lt;ref name="Etymology of embolia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?embolalia|title=embolalia - Definition|first=|last=mondofacto|website=www.mondofacto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''-lalia'' meaning 'speech, chattering and babbling; abnormal or disordered form of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordinfo.info/unit/1140|title=lalo-, lallo-, lalio-, lal-, -lalia, -lalic + - Word Information|website=wordinfo.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern linguists led by [[Leonard Bloomfield]] in 1933 call these "hesitation forms", the sounds of stammering (uh), stuttering (um, um), throat-clearing (ahem!), stalling (well, um, that is), interjected when the speaker is groping for words or at a loss for the next thought.&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite news|last=Safire|first=William|title=On Language; Impregnating the Pause|work=The New York Times|page=8|date=16 June 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/16/magazine/on-language-impregnating-the-pause.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French psychiatrist [[Jules Séglas]], on the other hand, referred to the term embolalia, as "the regular addition of prefixes or suffixes to words" and mentioned that the behavior is sometimes used by normal individuals to demonstrate to their interlocutor that they are paying attention to the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Harry Levin and Irene Silverman called formulaic language ''"vocal segregates"'' in their 1965 paper on '''hesitation phenomena''' and found out from their experiments on children that these segregates seem to be less voluntary hesitation phenomena and may be signs of uncontrolled emotionality under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Characteristics ==

===Linguistic features===

====Definition of formulaic sequences====

According to ''The Canadian Modern Language Review'', formulaic sequences are "fixed combinations of [[word]]s that ... can facilitate [[fluency]] in speech by making pauses shorter and less frequent, and allowing longer runs of speech between pauses".&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/canadian_modern_language_review/v063/63.1wood.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A formulaic sequence is "a sequence, continuous or discontinuous, of words or other elements, which is, or appears to be, prefabricated: that is, stored and retrieved whole from memory at the time of use, rather than being subject to generation or analysis by the language grammar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wray|first=Alison|authorlink=Alison Wray|title=Formulaic Language and the Lexicon|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521022126|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They can be found everywhere in language use and "make up a large proportion of any discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt (Ed.)|first=Norbert|title=Formulaic Sequences in Action: An Introduction. In: Schmitt, Norbert (Ed.) Formulaic Sequences: Acquisition, Processing and Use|year=2004|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formulaic sequences can be of any length and can be used to express messages, functions, social solidarity and process information very fast without communication misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt (Ed.)|first=Norbert|title=Formulaic Sequences in Action: An Introduction. In: Schmitt, Norbert (Ed.) Formulaic Sequences: Acquisition, Processing and Use|year=2004|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Morphology and phonology====

''Filled pauses''

Filled pauses consist of repetitions of syllables and words, reformulation or false starts where speakers rephrase their speech to fit the representation they best perceive, grammatical repairs, and partial repeats that often involve searching for the right words in one's lexicon to carry across an intended meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freed|first=B.|title=Second Language Acquisition in a Study Abroad Context|year=1995|publisher=Amsterdam /Philadelphia: John Benjamins  Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are basically three distinct forms for filled pauses: (i) an elongated central vowel only; (ii) a nasal murmur only; and (iii) a central vowel followed by a nasal murmur.&lt;ref name=Moniz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moniz|first=H. |author2=Mata, A. I. |author3=Viana, M. C.|title=On Filled Pauses and Prolongations in European Portuguese.|journal=Interspeech|year=2007|pages=2645–2648|url=http://www.inesc-id.pt/pt/indicadores/Ficheiros/4060.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a schwa-like quality [ə:], appears to be the most commonly used, some speakers consistently using the neutral vowel [ɨ:] instead, and others use both vowels in the same sentence, depending on the quality of the previous word last vowel.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; Filled pauses vocalizations may be built around central vowels and speakers may differ in their preferences, but that they do not appear to behave as other words in the language.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; The lengthening of words ending in a coronal fricative, for instance, could be obtained by prolonging the entire rhyme and/or the fricative only.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; Most of the time, however, the neutral vowel [ɨ:] is appended to achieve the desired effect.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt;

''Prolonged pauses''

Similarly to filled pauses, single occurrences of prolonged pauses occurring between stretches of fluent speech, may be preceded and followed by silent pauses, as they most often occur on function words with a CV or V structure.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; Even though they are not always central, the vowels of such syllables may be as long as the ones observed for filled pauses.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt;

''Retraced and unretraced restarts''

Riggenbach's 1991 study of fluency development in Chinese learners of English had an analysis of repair phenomena, which included retraced restarts and unretraced restarts.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach&gt;Riggenbach, H. (1991). Towards an understanding of fluency: A microanalysis of nonnative speaker conversations. Discourse Processes, 14: 423–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Retraced restarts refer to the reformulations whereby a portion of the original utterance is duplicated.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; They can either involve repetition, that is, the precise adjacent duplication of a sound, syllable, word or phrase, or insertion, which refers to a retraced restart with the addition of new unretraced lexical items.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; Conversely, unretraced restarts refer to reformulations that reject the original utterance, similarly known as false starts.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt;

====Semantics and pragmatics====
The semantics of formulaic language have often been debated on, and to date, there lacks a consensus on whether or not [[filler words]] are intentional in speech and whether or not they should be considered as words or if they are simply side effects of difficulties in the planning process of speech by speakers. Bailey &amp; Ferriera's (2007) paper&lt;ref name=bailey&gt;{{Citation
 | title = The processing of filled pause disfluencies in the visual world

 | isbn = 9780080449807
 | last1 = Bailey | first1 =  Karl G. D.
 | last2 =  Ferreira | first2 =  Fernanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that there is little evidence to suggest that the use of filler words are intentional in speech and that they should not be considered as words in the conventional sense.

Filler words consist of "Non-lexical fillers" and "Lexical fillers".&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; "Non-lexical fillers" are recognized as fillers that are not words and "Lexical fillers" are recognized as fillers that are words and both types of fillers are thought to contain little or no semantic information.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; However, some filler words are used to express certain speech acts. "Yeah", a "Lexical filler", is used to give affirmation, introduce a new topic, shows speaker's perception and understanding, and occurs after a speech management problem when the speakers does not how to continue their speech.&lt;ref name=fischer&gt;{{Citation

Research has shown that people were less likely to use formulaic language in general topics and domains they were more well-versed in, because they were more adept at selecting the appropriate terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=S. |author2=F.

====Syntax====
Formulaic language is more likely to occur at the beginning of utterance or phrase and the reason is because it is presumed that there is a greater demand on planning processes at these junctures.&lt;ref name=schnadt&gt;Schnadt, M. J., and M. Corley. submitted. Buying time in spontaneous speech: How speakers accommodate lexical difficulty.&lt;/ref&gt; Features of formulaic language, like filled pauses or repetitions, are most likely to occur immediately prior to the onset of a complex syntactic constituent.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=H. H.|author2=Wasow, T.|title=Repeating words in spontaneous speech.|journal=Cognitive Psychology |year=1998|pages=201–242|url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~herb/1990s/Clark.Wasow.98.pdf |format=PDF| doi = 10.1006/cogp.1998.0693|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filled pauses are also likely after the initial word in a complex constituent, especially after function words.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt; Therefore, listeners might be able to use the presence of a recent filled pause to predict that an ambiguous structure, and this trait is in favor of a more complex analysis .&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;

There are several different types of formulaic language. One type is relatively universal, often transcending differences in language and to some degree culture. Simple fillers like "Uhm", "Uh", or "Er" are used by many different people in many different settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com.ezlibproxy1.ntu.edu.sg/public/tocnode?query=embolalia&amp;widen=1&amp;result_number=1&amp;from=search&amp;id=g9781405135221_chunk_g978140513522113&amp;type=fuzzy&amp;fuzzy=0&amp;slop=1|title=Blackwell Reference Online - Formulaic Sequences and Language Disorders.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, these types of fillers are considered innocuous, and are often overlooked by listeners, as long as they are not utilized so often that they overshadow the remainder of the conversation.&lt;ref name=Kuniper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuniper|first=K.|title=On the Linguistic Properties of Formulaic Speech.|journal=Oral Tradition |year=2000|pages=279–305|url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/15ii/6_kuiper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of formulaic language are ingrained within specific cultures, and in fact are sometimes considered an identifying characteristic of people who share a particular religion, or live in a specific geographical region.&lt;ref name=Kuniper /&gt; Along with accents, formulaic language of this type is sometimes considered colorful and somewhat entertaining. Writers often make use of this type of speech to give the characters in their writings additional personality, helping to make them unique.&lt;ref name=wisegeek /&gt;

''Fluency''

The study conducted by Dechert (1980) that investigated the speech performance of a German student of English revealed that there is a tendency for speech pauses to be situated at breaks that are consistent with "episodic units".&lt;ref name=Dechert&gt;[Dechert, HW. (1980). Pauses and intonation as indicators of verbal planning in second-language speech productions: Two examples from a case study. In Dechert, HW &amp; Raupach, M. (Eds.), Temporal variables in speech (pp. 271-285).]&lt;/ref&gt; Dechert (1980) found that the more fluent utterances exhibited more pauses at those junctures and lesser within the "episodic units", leading him to posit that the study subject was able to use the narrative structure to pace his own speech with natural breaks in order for him to scout for the words and phrases that are to follow subsequently.&lt;ref name=Dechert /&gt;

Through the comparison of the story retelling utterances collated of second language learners, Lennon (1984) discovered notable disparities in the distribution of pauses between recounting  in the research subjects' first and second languages respectively.&lt;ref name=Lennon&gt;[Lennon, P. (1984). Retelling a story in English. In HW, Dechert, D. Mehle, 8c M. Raupauch (Eds.), Second Language Productions (pp. 50-68). Turbingen: Gunter Narr Verlag.]&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that all of the pauses were found to be located either at clause breaks or following nonintegral components of the clause, without pauses within the clauses.&lt;ref name=Lennon /&gt; On the other hand, the narrators who spoke using their second language exhibited different patterns, with a higher frequency of pauses occurring within the clauses, leading to the conclusion posited by Lennon to be that the speakers seem to be "planning within clauses as well as in suprasegmental units", and hence, the occurrence of pauses within clauses and not at the intersection of clauses could well be an indicator distinguishing fluent and confluent speech.&lt;ref name=Lennon /&gt;

===Discourse features===

====Cognitive load====
[[Cognitive load]] is an important predictor of formulaic language.&lt;ref name=corley /&gt; More [[Speech disfluency|disfluency]] is found in longer utterances&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Speech rate====
Formulaic phrases are uttered more quickly than comparable non-formulaic phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexicallab.com/2015/02/words-are-difficult-to-define/|title=2  Words are difficult to define|work=Lexical Lab|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech rate is closely related to cognitive load.&lt;ref name=O&gt;{{Citation

In fast conditions, cognitive processes that result in a phonetic plan, fail to keep up with articulation, and thus, the articulation of the existing plan is restarted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Frequency of words====
In Beattie and Butterworth's (1979) study, low frequency content words and those rated as contextually improbable were preceded by hesitations such as fillers.&lt;ref name=beattie&gt;{{Citation

L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers, when choosing to use low frequency words in their speech, are aware, and are more likely to be disfluent.&lt;ref name=beattie /&gt; This is further supported by Schnadt and Corley where they found that prolongations and fillers increased in words just before multiple-named or low frequency items.&lt;ref name=schnadt /&gt;

====Domain (addressor vs. addressee)====
Humans are found to be more disfluent overall when addressing other humans as compared to when addressing machines.&lt;ref name=oviatt /&gt; More instances of formulaic language is found in dialogues than in monologues.&lt;ref name=oviatt&gt;{{Citation

==Functions==

===Comprehension cues===

There is a common agreement that [[disfluencies]] are accompanied by important modifications both at the segmental and prosodic levels and that speakers and listeners use such cues systematically and meaningfully. Thus they appear as linguistic universal devices that are similar to other devices and are controlled by the speaker and regulated by language specific constraints.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; In addition, speech disfluencies such as fillers can help listeners to identify upcoming words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | title = How listeners compensate for disfluencies in spontaneous speech

 | journal = Journal of Memory and Language

 | last2 = Schober       | first2 =  M. F.
 | doi=10.1006/jmla.2000.2753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While formulaic language can serve as a useful cue that more is to come, some people do develop an unconscious dependence on these filler words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Visualizing Spoken Discourse: Prosodic Form and Discourse Functions of Interruptions

 | last1 = Yang | first1 =  Li-Chiung
 | doi=10.3115/1118078.1118106}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this is the case, it is necessary to correct the problem by making the speaker be aware of their over-reliance on formulaic language production and by training the person to make more efficient use of other verbal strategies. As the individual gains confidence and is less apt to have a need for filler words, the predilection toward formulaic language is then able to gradually diminish.&lt;ref name=wisegeek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-automatic-speech.htm|title=What is Automatic Speech?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by Foxtree (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox Tree | first1 = J. E. | year = 2001 | title = Listeners' uses of um and uh in speech comprehension | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 320–326 | doi=10.3758/bf03194926}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that both English and Dutch listeners were faster to identify words in a carrier sentence when it was preceded with an "Uh" instead of without an "Uh", which suggested that different fillers have different effects as they might be conveying different information.&lt;ref name=corley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corley|first=M.|author2=Stewart, O. W.|title=Hesitation Disfluencies in Spontaneous Speech: The Meaning of ''um''.|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|year=2008|pages=589–602|url=http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/martinc/offprints/cs_llc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer and Brandt-Pook also found out that discourse particles mark thematic breaks, signal the relatedness between the preceding and following utterance, indicate if the speaker has understood the content communicated, and support the formulation process by signalling possible problems in speech management.&lt;ref name=fischer /&gt;

While fillers might give listeners cues about the information being conveyed, Bailey &amp; Ferreira's study&lt;ref name=Disfluencies&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Disfluencies influence syntactic parsing

A "Good Cue" leads the listener to correctly predict the onset of a new constituent (Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase), whereas a "Bad Cue" leads the listener to incorrectly predict the onset of a new constituent.&lt;ref name=Disfluencies /&gt; "Good Cue" make it easier for listeners to process the information they have been presented while "Bad Cue" make it harder for listeners process the relevant information.&lt;ref name=Disfluencies /&gt;

There is strong empirical evidence that speakers use formulaic language in similar ways across languages and that formulaic language plays a fundamental role in the structuring of spontaneous speech, as they are used to achieve a better synchronization between interlocutors by announcing upcoming topic changes, delays related to planning load or preparedness problems, as well as speaker's intentions to take/give the floor or to revise/abandon an expression he/she had already presented.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt;

===Communicative goals===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that parts of formulaic language, such as fillers, serve a communicative function and are considered integral to the information the speaker tries to convey, although they do not add to the propositional content or the primary message.&lt;ref name=foxtree /&gt; Instead, they are considered part of a collateral message where the speaker is commenting on her performance.&lt;ref name=foxtree /&gt; Speakers produce filled pauses (e.g. "Uh" or "Um") for a variety of reasons, including the intention to discourage interruptions or to gain additional time to plan utterances.&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;

Another communicative goal includes the attention-impelling function,&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt; which explores another purpose of hesitation forms as being to dissociate oneself slightly from the harsh reality of what is to follow.&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt; With the use of a beat of time filled with a meaningless interjection, uncommitted people who are "into distancing" make use of such formulaic language to create a little distance between themselves and their words, as if it might lessen the impact of their words.&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt;

However, not all forms of formulaic language are considered appropriate or harmless.There are examples of formulaic language production that lean towards being offensive, for instance, the use of anything considered to be [[profanity]] within a given culture.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt;

In this form, the speech is usually the insertion of [[swear words]] within the sentence structure used to convey various ideas. At times, this use of formulaic language comes about due to the individual being greatly distressed or angry.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt; However, there are situations where swear words are inserted unconsciously even if the individual is extremely happy.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt; When the use of swear words is called to the attention of the individual, he or she may not even have been aware of the usage of such formulaic language.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt;

==Neurological basis==

===Medical cases===

====Aphasia====
{{Main article|Aphasia}}
Many patients who suffer from [[aphasia]] retain the ability to produce formulaic language, including conversational speech formulas and swear words—in some cases, patients are unable to create words or sentences, but they are able to swear. Also, the ability to pronounce other words can change and evolve during the process of recovery, while pronunciation and use of swear words remain unchanged.&lt;ref name="journal.frontiersin.org"/&gt;

Patients who are affected by [[transcortical sensory aphasia]], a rare form of aphasia, have been found to exhibit formulaic language that is characterised by "lengthy chunks of memorized material".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csuchico.edu/~pmccaffrey/syllabi/SPPA336/336unit8.html McCaffrey, Patrick. Transcortical Sensory Aphasia. ''The Neuroscience on the Web Series: Neuropathologies of Language and Cognition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apraxia of speech====
{{Main article|Apraxia of speech}}
[[Apraxia of speech]] can also occur in conjunction with [[dysarthria]] (muscle weakness affecting speech production) or aphasia (language difficulties related to neurological damage).&lt;ref name=apraxia&gt;[http://speakeffectively.com/apraxia.shtml Britchkow, Ela. (2005). Apraxia. ''Speakeffectively.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the articulatory characteristics of apraxia of speech found in adults includes speech behavior that "exhibits fewer errors with formulaic language than volitional speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Childhood apraxia of speech (developmental verbal dyspraxia). Retrieved on 9 March 2012.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of apraxia of speech include difficulties in imitating speech sounds, imitating no-speech movements, such as sticking out the tongue, groping for sounds, and in severe cases, the inability to produce any sounds, inconsistent errors and a slow rate of speech. However, patients who suffer from apraxia of speech may retain the ability to produce formulaic language, such as "thank you" or "how are you?".&lt;ref name=apraxia /&gt; Apraxia of speech can also occur in conjunction with dysarthria, an illness which inflicts muscle weakness affecting [[speech production]]), or aphasia, which causes language difficulties related to neurological damage.&lt;ref name=apraxia /&gt;

Children with developmental coordination disorder are unable to formulate certain kinds of voluntary speech; however, they may speak set words or phrases spontaneously, constituting formulaic language—although they may not be able to repeat them on request.&lt;ref name=DVD /&gt;

A '''fuzzy number''' is a generalization of a regular, real number in the sense that it does not refer to one single value but rather to a connected set of possible values, where each possible value has its own weight between 0 and 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dijkman|first=J.G|last2=Haeringen|first2=H van|last3=Lange|first3=S.J de|title=Fuzzy numbers|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-247X(83)90253-6|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|language=en|volume=92|issue=2|pages=301–341|doi=10.1016/0022-247x(83)90253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This weight is called the [[Membership function (mathematics)|membership function]]. A fuzzy number is thus a special case of a convex, normalized [[fuzzy set]] of the real line.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hanss]], 2005. ''Applied Fuzzy Arithmetic, An Introduction with Engineering Applications''. Springer, {{ISBN|3-540-24201-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like [[Fuzzy logic]] is an extension of [[Boolean logic]] (which uses absolute truth and falsehood only, and nothing in between), fuzzy numbers are an extension of [[real numbers]]. Calculations with fuzzy numbers allow the incorporation of [[uncertainty]] on parameters, properties, geometry, initial conditions, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3642">The '''Gender Parity Index''' ('''GPI''') is a [[socioeconomic]] index usually designed to measure the relative access to [[education]] of males and females. This index is released by UNESCO. In its simplest form, it is calculated as the quotient of the number of females by the number of males enrolled in a given stage of education ([[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]], etc.). It is used by international organizations, particularly in measuring the progress of developing countries. The Institute for Statistics of [[UNESCO]] also uses a more general definition of GPI: for any development indicator one can define the GPI ''relative'' to this indicator by dividing its value for females by its value for males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/aims/Pattaya_SCB_Jun05/Gender_Parity_Index_-_Michael_Koronkiewicz.pdf |title=Gender Parity Index|last=Koronkiewicz|first=Michael |publisher=UNESCO Bangkok|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some UNESCO documents consider gender parity in [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001472/147259M.pdf|title=Education for All (EFA) in least developed countries|date=2006|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNESCO describes attempts to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education and emphasizes the plight of girls in unequal access in third world countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/aims/Pattaya_SCB_Jun05/Gender_Parity_Index_-_Michael_Koronkiewicz.pdf |title=Gender Parity Index|last=Koronkiewicz|first=Michael |publisher=UNESCO Bangkok|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the GPI ignores the gender disparity that benefits first-world women in [[tertiary education]] as in Iceland, for example, where 65% of students enrolling in tertiary education are female.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12254">'''Guided reading''' is 'small-group reading instruction designed to provide differentiated teaching that supports students in developing reading proficiency'.&lt;ref name=PF /&gt; The small group model allows students to be taught in a way that is intended to be more focused on their specific needs, accelerating their progress.

==Introduction==
'''Guided reading''' is a method of teaching reading, common in England and Wales through the influence of the [[National Literacy Strategy]] (later superseded by the [[Primary National Strategy]]). It remains recommended practice in some authorities,&lt;ref name=LGfL /&gt; this is despite discontinued hosting and support of the [[Primary National Strategy]] from the United Kingdom's [[Department for Education]].&lt;ref name=DfE /&gt;

In the United States, Guided Reading is a key component to the Reading Workshop model of literacy instruction. Guided Reading sessions involve a teacher and a small group, ideally of two to four children although groups of five or six are not uncommon. The session would have a set of objectives to be taught during a session lasting approximately 20 minutes. While guided reading takes place with one group of children, the remaining children are engaged in quality independent or group literacy tasks, with the aim of allowing the teacher to focus the small group without interruption.  Guided Reading is usually a daily activity in English and Welsh primary school classrooms and involves every child in a class over the course of a week. In the United States, Guided Reading can take place at both the primary and intermediate levels. Each Guided Reading group meets with the teacher several times throughout a given week. The children are typically grouped by academic ability, [[Fountas and Pinnell reading levels|reading levels]], or strategic/skill-based needs.

There is a lack of research on Guided Reading, but some studies have found it to be beneficial for students. In South Africa, The Literacy Leadership Project were able to let four Foundation Phase teachers implement Guided Reading for students of the Aregorogeng Primary School. Over the course of 8 months, results were able to demonstrate an improvement in student’s engagement and motivation on literacy (Makumbila and Rowland, 2016). Another study from Canada indicated that about 80% of 25 middle school students who received Guided Reading had an increase in reading proficiency (Lyons and Thompson, 2012).

Although there are positive aspects to this type of reading instruction, there are also two main challenges that exist at every grade level. According to Irene Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell, "some students will work on very basic reading skills such as word analysis and comprehending simple texts" while other students may be working on more advanced reading skills and strategies with increasingly challenging texts.  In addition, "all students need instructional support so they can expand their competence across a greater variety of increasingly challenging texts." (Fountas and Pinnell). Thus, it takes a lot of strong planning and organization from the part of the teacher in order to successfully implement Guided Reading so that it meets the needs of all learners. Simultaneously, “a teacher’s goal is to strive to provide the most effective instruction possible and to match the difficulty of the material with the student’s current abilities. Materials should provide a challenge that is “just right” for the students” (Iaquinta, 2006). Guided Reading is a complex approach and teachers are essential in the development and execution of a [[Balanced literacy|Balanced Literacy]] program.

A critical component of the Reading Workshop is text selection; it must be purposeful and have the needs of the learners in mind. According to Fountas and Pinnell, as a teacher reads "a text in preparation for teaching, you decide what demands the text will make on the processing systems of the readers." Texts should not be chosen to simply teach a specific strategy. Rather, the texts should be of such high quality that students can apply a wide range of reading comprehension strategies throughout the reading. "One text offers many opportunities to learn; you must decide how to mediate the text to guide your students' learning experiences" (Fountas and Pinnell).

Steps for a Lesson

Before Reading: A Teacher will access background knowledge, build schema, set a purpose for reading, and preview the text with students. Typically a group will engage in a variety of pre-reading activities such as predicting, learning new vocabulary, and discussing various text features. If applicable, the group may also engage in completing a "picture walk." This activity involves scanning through the text to look at pictures and predicting how the story will go.  The students will engage in a conversation about the story, raise questions, build expectations, and notice information in the text (Fountas and Pinnell).

During Reading: The students will read independently within the group. As students read, the teacher will monitor student decoding and comprehension. The teacher may ask students if something makes sense, encourage students to try something again, or prompt them to use a strategy.  The teacher makes observational notes about the strategy use of individual readers and may also take a short running record of the child's reading.  The students may read the whole text or a part of the text silently or softly for beginning readers (Fountas and Pinnell).

After Reading: Following the reading, the teacher will again check students' comprehension by talking about the story with the children. The teacher returns to the text for teaching opportunities such as finding evidence or discussing problem solving.  The teacher also uses this time to assess the students' understanding of what they have read.  The group will also discuss reading strategies they used during the reading.  To extend the reading, students may participate in activities such as drama, writing, art, or more reading (Fountas and Pinnell).

==Features commonly found in a 'Guided Reading' session==
*'''Book Introduction'''
''Adult with group''. Prepare the children, providing support through reading the title, talking about the type of text, looking at the pictures and accessing previous knowledge. Aim to give them confidence without reading the book to them. If necessary, locate and preview difficult new words and unfamiliar concepts or names. A variety of books/genres can be used.


*'''Strategy Check'''
''Adult with group''. Introduce or review specific reading strategies that the children have been taught and remind them to use these when reading.

*'''Independent Reading'''
''Individuals''. Children read the book at their own pace. Monitor individuals and use appropriate prompts to encourage problem-solving. Praise correct use of reading strategies.

*'''Returning to the Text'''
''Adult with group''. Briefly talk about what has been read to check children's understanding. Praise correct use of reading strategies.

*'''Response to the Text'''
''Adult with group''. Encourage children to respond to the book either through a short discussion where they express opinions, or through providing follow-up activities.

*'''Re-reading Guided Text'''
"Individuals." Provide a 'familiar book' box for each group, containing texts recently used in Guided Reading. Children can re-read texts to themselves or with a partner as an independent activity to give them opportunities to develop fluency and expression and build up '[[reading miles]]'.

==Models==
There are three models of guided reading that can be used based upon the above structure depending upon the National Curriculum (NC) level that the group is reading at.  The models do overlap.

===Early Model===
This model is used for children who are reading up to about NC level 1A/2C.  In this model the book introduction, strategy check, independent reading, return to text and response to text all take place generally within one session.  This is aided by the fact that the books suitable for children reading at this stage are very short. (Baker, Bickler and Bodman)

===Transitional Model===
This model is used for children who are reading at NC level 2C to 3C/B.  Generally two guided sessions will be needed to read a book.  The first session generally focuses on the book introduction, strategy check and independent reading.  Whilst children are reading at their own pace, it is important to start to introduce an element of silent reading.  This is to develop the skills of meaning making when reading independently.  Because books at this stage are generally longer, it is not possible to read the whole book in one session.  Once the children have done some reading in the session they can be asked to read the rest of the book prior to the second session.  This session then focuses on returning to the text and responding to the text.  These are the more able children and not those at level 1

===Fluent Model===
Readers working at a NC level of 3B upwards will need the fluent model of guided reading.  Here it is not necessary for children to read the text during the guided sessions.  At these levels children can generally decode the words.  What is important is that they discuss the meaning that they make from the text which will form the basis of the discussion.  Therefore, the session tends to focus on return to text and response to the text with the strategy check implicit in the discussions.

This article details the history and status of '''Heritage conservation in [[Hong Kong]]''', as well as the role of various stakeholders.

An indication of the size of the built heritage in Hong Kong is given by a territory-wide survey conducted by the [[Antiquities and Monuments Office]] (AMO) between 1996 and 2000, which recorded some 8,800 buildings. The preservation of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] is also an emerging theme.

==Historic buildings==
[[File:HK CausewayBayTinHauTemple.JPG|thumb|The [[Tin Hau temples in Hong Kong|Tin Hau Temple]] in Causeway Bay is a declared monument since 1982.]]
As of 20 May 2016, there were 114 [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong|declared monuments]] in Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Monument/form/DM_Mon_List_e.pdf List of declared monuments on LCSD website]&lt;/ref&gt; and as of February 2013, there were 917 graded historic buildings (153 Grade I, 322 Grade II, 442 Grade III), of which 203 were owned by the Government and 714 by private bodies.&lt;ref name="Audit60"&gt;Report No. 60 of the Director of Audit, [http://www.aud.gov.hk/pdf_e/e60ch01.pdf Chapter 1: "Conservation of monuments and historic buildings"], 28 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grading system===
Grades for historic buildings are defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-eng.pdf Results of the Assessment of 1,444 Historic Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade I]]: "Buildings of outstanding merit, which every effort should be made to preserve if possible."
* [[List of Grade II historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade II]]: "Buildings of special merit; efforts should be made to selectively preserve."
* [[List of Grade III historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade III]]: "Buildings of some merit; preservation in some form would be desirable and alternative means could be considered if preservation is not practicable."

===Surveys and assessment===
[[File:King Yin Lei SingChiu.jpg|thumb|[[King Yin Lei]] was declared a monument in 2008 after media had reported that its owner had begun demolishing the building.]]
A territory-wide survey on historic buildings conducted by the Antiquities and Monuments Office (AMO) between 1996 and 2000 recorded some 8,800 buildings. A more detailed survey conducted between 2002-2004 focused on 1,444 buildings.&lt;ref name="Completion"&gt;[http://www.devb-wb.gov.hk/press_releases_and_publications/UMPR/index.aspx?langno=1&amp;nodeid=1779&amp;Branch=W&amp;lstYear=2009&amp;PressReleaseID=11946 Press Release: "Completion of the assessment of 1,444 historic buildings announced". March 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005,&lt;ref name="Completion" /&gt; a seven-member Expert Panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-A.pdf Composition of the Expert Panel for the Assessment of 1,444 Historic Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt; comprising historians and members of the [[Hong Kong Institute of Architects]], [[Hong Kong Institute of Planners]] and [[Hong Kong Institute of Engineers]] was formed by the Antiquities Advisory Board (AAB) to assess the heritage value of these buildings. The assessment was completed on March 19, 2009. As part of this work, the AMO proposed changes in the grading of historic buildings: 212 buildings to be Grade I, 366 to be Grade II, and 576 to be Grade III, and no grading for the remaining 290 ones.&lt;ref name="Completion" /&gt; Current grades may be increased, decreased or removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-E.pdf List of the Historic Buildings in Building Assessment (as of 18 March 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation initiatives==
[[File:1881 Heritage 200905.jpg|thumb|Adaptive reuse: the [[Former Marine Police Headquarters Compound]], a declared monument, is being transformed into a heritage hotel with food and beverage outlets, and retail facilities.]]
Conservation initiatives include:

==Issues==

===Demolitions===
[[File:QP Hungerstrike.jpg|thumb|Public protest against the demolition of [[Queen's Pier]]: hunger strikers occupied the location in July 2007.]]
The demolition of several historic buildings has led to public protest in recent years. This included the [[Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier]] (demolition completed in early 2007) and [[Queen's Pier]], demolished in February 2008.

===Other issues===
Other issues include:
* Ownership of historic buildings and private owners' rights
* Funding of Heritage conservation programs

==Intangible cultural heritage==
The preservation of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] is an emerging theme in Hong Kong, with The Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee having held its first meeting on July 9, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/ppr_release_det2.php?id=190 Press release: "Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee holds first meeting".

'''Human behavioral ecology''' ('''HBE''') or '''human evolutionary ecology''' applies the principles of [[evolutionary theory]] and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] to the study of [[human behavior]]al and [[cultural diversity]]. HBE examines the [[adaptation|adaptive]] design of [[Trait (biological)|trait]]s, [[behaviors]], and [[life history theory|life histories]] of humans in an [[ecological]] context. One aim of modern human behavioral ecology is to determine how ecological and [[social]] factors influence and shape behavioral flexibility within and between human [[populations]]. Among other things, HBE attempts to explain variation in human behavior as adaptive solutions to the competing life-history demands of growth, development, [[reproduction]], parental care, and mate acquisition.

HBE overlaps with [[evolutionary psychology]], [[Human ecology|human]] or [[cultural ecology]], and [[decision theory]]. It is most prominent in disciplines such as [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]] where [[human evolution]] is considered relevant for a holistic understanding of
[[human behavior]] or in [[economics]] where [[Psychological egoism|self-interest]], [[methodological individualism]], and [[Maximization (economics)|maximization]] are key elements in modeling behavioral responses to various ecological factors. 

==Evolutionary theory==

Human behavioral ecology rests upon a foundation of evolutionary theory. This includes aspects of both general evolutionary theory and established middle-level evolutionary theories, as well. Aspects of general evolutionary theory include:
*'''[[Natural selection]]''', the process by which individual [[organism]]s with favorable [[trait (biological)|traits]] are more likely to survive and [[biological reproduction|reproduce]].
*'''[[Sexual selection]]''', the [[scientific theory|theory]] that competition for mates between individuals of the same sex results in differential mating and reproduction.
*'''[[Kin selection]]''', the changes in [[gene frequency]] across generations that are driven at least in part by interactions between related individuals, and
*'''[[Inclusive fitness]]''', the sum of an individual's own reproductive success, (natural and sexual selection), plus the effects the individual's actions have on the reproductive success of that individual's kin, (kin selection).

Middle-level evolutionary theories used in HBE include:
*The theory of '''[[parental investment]]''', which predicts that the sex making the largest investment in [[lactation]], nurturing and protecting [[offspring]] will be more discriminating in mating and that the sex that invests less in offspring will compete for access to the higher investing sex.
*'''[[Parent-offspring conflict]]''', which predicts that because the genetic interests of parents and offspring are not identical, offspring will be selected to manipulate their parents in order to ensure higher investment, and that, conversely, parents will be selected to manipulate their offspring.
*The theory of '''[[reciprocal altruism]]''', a form of [[altruism]] in which one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocation]].
*The '''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]''', which proposes that parents should invest more in the sex that gives them the greatest reproductive payoff (grandchildren) with increasing or marginal investment.
*'''[[r/K selection theory]]''', which, in [[ecology]], relates to the selection of traits in organisms that allow success in particular environments. [[r-selected]] species – in unstable or unpredictable environments – produce many offspring, any individual one of which is unlikely to survive to adulthood, while [[K-selected]] species – in stable or predictable environments – invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a better chance of surviving to adulthood.
*'''[[Evolutionary game theory]]''', the application of [[population genetics]]-inspired models of change in gene frequency in populations to [[game theory]].
*'''[[Evolutionarily stable strategy]]''', which refers to a [[strategy (game theory)|strategy]], which if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any competing alternative strategy.

==Basic principles==

===Ecological selectionism===

Ecological selectionism refers to the assumption that humans are highly flexible in their behaviors. Furthermore, it assumes that various ecological forces select for various behaviors that optimize humans' inclusive fitness in their given ecological context.

===The piecemeal approach===

The piecemeal approach refers to taking a [[reductionist]] approach as opposed to a [[holistic]] approach in studying human socioecological behavior. Human behavioral ecologists assume that by taking complex social phenomena, (e.g., marriage patterns, foraging behaviors, etc.), and then breaking them down into sets of components involving decisions and constraints that they are in a better position to create models and make predictions involving human behavior. An example would be examining marriage systems by examining the ecological context, mate preferences, the distribution of particular characteristics within the population, and so forth.

===Conditional strategies===

Human behavioral ecologists assume that what might be the most adaptive strategy in one environment might not be the most adaptive strategy in another environment. Conditional strategies, therefore, can be represented in the following statement:
*In environmental context X, engage in adaptive strategy A.
*In environmental context Y, engage in adaptive strategy B.

===The phenotypic gambit===

The phenotypic gambit refers to the simplifying assumption that [[complex traits]], such as behavioural traits, can be modelled as if they were controlled by single distinct alleles, representing alternate strategies. In other words, the phenotypic gambit assumes that "selection will favour traits with high fitness ...irrespective of the particulars of inheritance."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Alden Smith and Bruce Winterhalder.

===Modeling===
[[Model (abstract)|Theoretical models]] that human behavioral ecologists employ include, but are not limited to:

*'''[[Optimal foraging theory]]''', which states that organisms focus on consuming the most energy while expending the least amount of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|title=Multiple Optima in Hoabinhian flaked stone artefact palaeoeconomics and palaeoecology at two archaeological sites in Northwest Thailand|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|date=December 2013|volume=32|issue=4|pages=553–564|doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2013.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Life history theory]]''', which postulates that many of the [[physiological]] traits and behaviors of individuals may be best understood in relation to the key maturational and reproductive characteristics that define the life course.
*'''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis|Sex allocation theory]]''', which predicts that parents should bias their reproductive investments toward the offspring sex generating the greatest fitness return.
*The '''[[polygyny threshold model]]''', which suggests that [[polygyny]] is driven by female choice of mates who control more resources relative to other potential mates in the population.

The '''International Technical Development Center''' (ITDC, German ''Internationales Technisches Entwicklungszentrum'' ''ITEZ'') is one of the engineering and design centers of [[Groupe PSA]], and was the main engineering and design centre of [[General Motors]] in Europe, having been sold with the complete Opel/Vauxhall automobile business and the two brands [[Opel]] and [[Vauxhall]] to the [[Groupe PSA]] by August 1, 2017.

==Structure==
It is situated in [[Rüsselsheim am Main]] (Ruesselsheim) in the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] of [[Hesse]], Germany. It is situated next to the [[Opel Rüsselsheim Plant]], separated only by the [[Mainbahn]] railway line. Next to it is the European Design Center, and also the Opel business administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europe.autonews.com/article/20160313/ANE/160319969/gm-appoints-veteran-brazilian-executive-as-europe-engineering-chief Automotive News Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[File:GM-Design-Center Ruesselsheim 50-years LWEOS0537.JPG|thumb|left|Opel Design Center celebrating 50 years in June 2014]]
It is one of PSA's technical development and design centers in Europe, being formerly the main design centre for General Motors in Europe. It has been assigned the leading role as "Competence Center" in a number of areas, among them ''alternative fuels'' and adaptation for the US market. On April 4, 2018 PSA and Opel announced that a group in the ITEZ would lead the development of a special platform for [[Light Commercial Vehicles]] and lead future LCV development from conception to production.

The '''Irish Planning Institute''' ('''IPI''') is an all-island professional body representing professional planners engaged in [[Spatial planning|physical]] and [[environmental planning]] in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. 

The IPI works with both its members and other built environment professionals to promote and improve the quality of planning, to represent the views of the planning profession and to contribute to education and environmental awareness in the wider community.

This is achieved through the hosting of conferences and CPD Events for its members; awarding, recognising and publishing best practice; making submissions on behalf of the planning profession on national policies, governance and other relevant publications and papers; and by representing the values of planning and planning professionals in the general media.

== Activities ==

The Irish Planning Institute is an active member of the [[ECTP-CEU|European Council of Spatial Planners]] and has held the Presidency of this organisation. Through this involvement, the Institute not only represents Irish planning interests abroad but also forges important links with sister institutions in Europe. It is also a member of the Global Planners Network.

The IPI inspects and accredits on invitation a number of planning courses in universities and other third level educational institutions across the island of Ireland. The Institute is also a nominating body to [[Seanad Éireann]] and to [[An Bord Pleanála]].

The Irish Planning Institute lobbies central [[Government of Ireland|Government]] on new legislation and on planning policy at national, regional and local levels.  It also from time to time issues statements on current topics of public interest and debate.

The IPI publishes "Pleanáil" which is the only technical publication on planning theory and professional planning practice published in Ireland. 

Through its annual National Planning Conference, the Institute offers a major forum for the debate of planning and related topics.  It also organises the National Planning Awards every two years and a series of CPD events throughout the year to promote best practice and to inform our membership regarding new approaches and policies.

== Membership ==

The Irish Planning Institute has six categories of membership: Fellowship, Corporate, Graduate, Student, Affiliate and Honorary. 

'''Fellowship''' is generally awarded to professionally qualified planners who have considerable professional planning experience and who have made an important contribution to the development of the Institute. 

'''Corporate Membership''', which is the main class of membership, is open to professionally qualified planners those who have reached a standard of knowledge, skill and professional experience necessary to engage in planning in Ireland, in the public sector or in private practice.  This class of membership is also open to qualified professional planners who are full members of the member Institutes of the European Council of Spatial Planners, and to recently qualified planners from other countries, subject to appropriate post-qualification experience, under the provisions of the [[Directive (European Union)|European Directive]] on Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications.

'''Graduate Membership''' is available to those who have acquired an IPI accredited planning qualification and, under certain circumstances, those who have been awarded planning qualifications which have not been accredited by the IPI.

Persons engaged in a programme of formal study leading to an IPI accredited planning qualification from a planning school are eligible for '''Student Membership''' of the Institute.

'''Affiliate Membership''' can be awarded to persons who have a professional qualification that is related to planning, who have been engaged in approved research or practice related to planning and who have been engaged in approved research or practice relating to planning, and who have made a special contribution to planning in Ireland.

'''Honorary Membership''' is generally awarded as an honour on an individual whose special interests have been deemed by the Institute to have made an outstanding contribution to planning.

== Governance ==

The Council of the IPI, which is the governing body of the Institute, is directly elected by the Members by postal ballot.

The aims of the Planning Institute are: 

* To raise the standards of planning.
* To articulate professional planning opinion.
* To improve and promote the status of the planning profession.
* To contribute to planning education.
* To encourage environmental awareness in the community.
* To represent Irish planning interests abroad.

There are a number of regional and sectoral branches within the Institute.  The Regional Branches are: the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] Branch, the [[Midlands Region, Ireland|Midland]] Branch, the [[Mid-West Region, Ireland|Mid-West]] Branch, the [[West Region, Ireland|Western]] Branch, the [[South-East Region, Ireland|South Eastern]] Branch, the [[Greater Dublin Area]] Branch and the [[Northern Ireland|Northern]] Branch (covering members in Northern Ireland).  The sectoral Branch is the Private Practice Branch, covering members working in private practice throughout the island of Ireland.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}
The '''killer ape theory''' or '''killer ape hypothesis''' is the theory that [[war]] and interpersonal [[aggression]] was the driving force behind [[human evolution]]. It was originated by [[Raymond Dart]] in the 1950s; later it was developed further in ''[[African Genesis]]'' by [[Robert Ardrey]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="Ardrey"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Ardrey| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Ardrey
| title = African Genesis: A Personal Investigation Into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man
| year = 1961 | publisher = [[Atheneum Books]]| location = New York
| isbn = 978-0-00-211014-3 | oclc = 556678068 | lccn = 61015889
| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Yg1AAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory, the ancestors of humans were distinguished from other [[primate]] species by their greater aggressiveness and this aggression remains within humanity, which retains many [[murder]]ous instincts.

The theory gained notoriety for suggesting that the urge to do [[violence]] was a fundamental part of human [[psychology]]. The [[hunting hypothesis]] is often associated with the theory, because of similarities and because Robert Ardrey has developed both.

==Definition==
The expression ''killer ape'' does not mean an outstanding aggressive kind of ape; in fact the term refers to anthropological analysis of human aggression. Accordingly, the killer ape is a notably belligerent species on which our instincts might be rooted, because this very ancestor could establish itself due to its special aggression.

As founder of this thesis, [[Raymond Dart|Raymond A. Dart]] (1893–1988) dealt with this issue in his professional article ''The predatory transition from ape to man'', 1953.&lt;ref name="Dart"&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Dart| first = Raymond Arthur| authorlink = Raymond Dart

==The predatory transition from ape to human==

===The step from ape to human===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] refers to the Australian anatomist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] (1871–1937), a specialist in anthropology.

The question is what exactly caused the evolutionary step from ape to human. Basically, there are three versions: the increase of brain size, the acquisition of speech, or upright posture. [[Grafton Elliot Smith|Smith]] excludes this last option; otherwise the traditional erect gibbon would be a possible ancestor of humans. For him, the most relevant differentiator was the bigger brain. It would have made the bipedal movement possible and would have accelerated the enlargement through common use of its hands, which are no longer needed for locomotion.

Until [[Raymond Dart]] found the [[Australopithecus africanus]] (1925a), this controversial problem could not be solved.

===The "Taung Child"===
This approximately 2.5 million year old cranial bone, also known as “[[Taung Child]]”, was a first proof of bipedal apes. [[Robert Broom]] (1866–1951), primarily a Scottish physician, who spent his life as an archeologist in Australia since 1892, agreed to this statement, too. Five years later he decided to spend the rest of his life in South Africa. His excavations from 1946 pointed into the same direction, when he also discovered bones from the [[Australopithecus africanus]].

However, further examinations showed that, in these cases, the size of the brain was not to be equated with the evolution’s level. In fact, it is much more popular to connect the accomplishment of more and more complex movements directly with an evolutionary response, which caused the brain to grow.

Both [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Broom|Broom]], as well as [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), agreed that this new type of locomotion brought a remarkable advantage in comparison to other co-specifics, to rival animals or to the quarry.

===The findings of Makapan===
Osseous findings at a limestone cave located in Makapan, South-Africa, led to the question to what extent this advantage, in combination with a more and more improved skill using tools, affected the behavior of the apes.

These findings showed explicit cracks and fractures, which are likely to be done on purpose. Additionally, there were clubs, bludgeons and spears formed by the long limb bones or the horns of antelopes. This new special weapon leaves small punctured, round, and triangular holes in skulls, depending on how it was formed.

This new development in building weapons shows a clear increase concerning the aggression of the animals.

===The "proto-men"===
[[Raymond Dart|Dart]] carries that issue to extremes and equips this new type of ‘carnivorous and killing’ apes (“proto-men” in his own words) with weapons. Furthermore, he describes them as organized in a tribe, so they were able to hunt bigger animals. The ability of making fire and remarkable social skills prompt [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] to bring them more in line with humans.

Observations from Sgt. H. B. Potter (Zululand, South Africa) show that this kind of development is still up to date as it is mentioned in ''The predatory transition from ape to man'' by [[Raymond Dart]].&lt;ref name="Dart"/&gt; He describes a pride of baboons that hunts antelopes. Indeed, he admits that this depends on seasonal circumstances, because nutrition was rare. Nevertheless, he proves explicit behavior.

===The eating habits===
Concerning the eating habits from then until now, [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] argues that there has always been an ambition to eating meat: grubs and insects, bigger mammals and even human flesh (i.e. distinctive [[cannibalism]]) are the results.

A deficit from “animal proteins” has to be compensated, so consuming meat is essential to survive.

==Reception==
The comment written by the editor of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] article Dr. Alan H. Kelso shows how few scientists accepted the new ideas of [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] and [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]]. Not only did Dart require a long time to publish his work, but also the epilogue contains notices like: “Professor Dart’s thesis that the South African apemen, at the stage they were found, were omnivorous, must be considered as proven. Of course, they were only the ancestors of the modern Bushmen and Negroes, and of ''nobody else''.”

Another obvious piece of evidence would be the rejection of [[Raymond Dart|Dart’s]] thesis by a scientific convention at [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] ([[Zambia]], Southern Africa), which led [[Robert Ardrey|Ardrey]] into writing his book ''African Genesis''. He felt himself forced to defend the opinion of his mentor.

The ethologist [[Konrad Lorenz]] also showed interest in similar ideas, in his book ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Lorenz"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Lorenz | first = Konrad | authorlink = Konrad Lorenz
| title = On Aggression
| year = 1966 | publisher = [[Methuen Publishing]] | location = London
| isbn = 978-0-415-28320-5 | oclc = 72226348| lccn = 67072318
| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rIVK7wuY3kIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction he describes rival butterfly fish defending their territory, leading him to raise the question of whether humans, too, tend to intraspecific conflict.

The [[Seville Statement on Violence]], released under US auspices in 1986, rejected violence and in particular [[warfare]] as genetically determined.

A 2008 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Dan Jones stated that "A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought." Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the [[Cinderella effect]]). [[Chimpanzee]]s have violence between groups which have similarities to raids and violence between human groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for human non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower among humans living in small group societies than among chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between [[ingroup and outgroup]] which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies. This suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced [[blood feud]]s due to better functioning [[justice system]]s may have contributed to declining intra-group violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = D. | title = Human behaviour: Killer instincts | doi = 10.1038/451512a | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7178 | pages = 512–515 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18235473| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that man is naturally warlike has been refuted in for example the book ''War, Peace, and Human Nature'' (2013), edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]].&lt;ref name=Haas&amp;Piscitelli&gt;See for example Jonathan Haas and [[Matthew Piscitelli]] (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/2968441/The_Prehistory_of_Warfare_Misled_by_Ethnography?login=&amp;email_was_taken=true "The Prehistory of Warfare: Misled by Ethnography"] In War, Peace, and Human Nature edited by [[Douglas P. Fry]], pp. 168-190. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in fiction==
Movies such as ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) show that this issue affected common people, too. In fact, it’s based on [[Pierre Boulle]]’s novel of the same title, but the content is almost similar to the topic.

This theory can be seen in the opening sequence of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and also appears in the television show ''[[Sliders]]'', which made extensive use of the killer ape theory in storyline arcs involving the Kromaggs.  (The names of ''Dart'' and ''[[Ardrey]]'' were combined by the professor Arturo character in the series into "''Drayer''" who purportedly came up with his world's "killer ape theory".)

'''Leisure studies''' is a branch of the [[social sciences]] that focuses on understanding and analyzing [[leisure]]. [[Recreation]] and [[tourism]] are common topics of leisure research.

The [[National Recreation and Park Association]] is the national organization in the United States for leisure studies, and offers [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] to many universities to offer courses of study ([[Academic degree|degree]] programs) in leisure studies.

The ''Journal of Leisure Research''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr|title=Journal of Leisure Research|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'' are some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wilderdom.com/journals/journalsRecreation&amp;Leisure.htm|title=Peer-reviewed Journals in Recreation &amp; Leisure Studies|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholarly US [[academic journal]]s of leisure studies.



==History==

While leisure studies has existed for much longer, a first centralized organization for directing leisure studies was established in [[Birmingham, England]], in May 1975, and is known as the Leisure Studies Association. In 1984, the first international conference was held by the LSA at the [[University of Sussex]] in Brighton, which also set the record as the largest LSA event held to date with over 275 attendees. LSA conferences are widely regarded as some of the most attended events for leisure researchers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leisurestudies.org/history-of-lsa|title=ORIGINS OF LSA - Leisure Studies Association|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Pursuing a degree in leisure studies will give students the opportunity to learn how to incorporate leisure into recreational activities and [[tourism]]. Students take a wide variety of classes ranging from [[psychology]] and [[social sciences]] to [[biology]] and [[anatomy]]. Students learn how to improve and foster a healthy life through leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinedegrees.org/degrees/leisure-studies/|title=Leisure Studies Degrees|work=Online Degrees|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leisure activities==
The leisure activities that people who work in leisure studies deal with include a very broad range of activities. Most of the activities can be separated into 3 sub-categories: sport and recreation, tourism, and leisure.
[[Sport]] and [[recreation]] activities is one of the broadest categories in leisure studies. This includes sports, both traditional and non-traditional, and any indoor or outdoor physical activities done for recreational purposes. Sport and recreation activities includes, but is not limited to, [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[running]], [[hiking]], [[weight training|weight lifting]], [[playing]] [[games]] and other [[outdoor recreation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors/parks-recreation-fitness-parks-recreation-leisure-studiesM|title=Big Future by The College Board|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tourism]] describes the traveling for leisure purposes. Destinations include [[public parks|parks]] and [[national parks]], [[hiking|hikes]], and domestic and foreign [[city|cities]].

All other activities that are not considered to be a part of sport and recreation or tourism are included general leisure activities. This category is quite vast, and includes, but are not limited to, [[yoga]], [[the arts]], [[nature conservation]], and other hobbies.&lt;ref name="csulb.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careers.csulb.edu/monographs/cohhs_recreatio.html|title=Careers Profiles|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5447">'''Linear partial information (LPI)''' is a method of making decisions based on insufficient or [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy information]]. LPI was introduced in 1970 by Polish–Swiss mathematician [[Edward Kofler]] (1911–2007) to simplify [[Decision making|decision]] processes. Compared to [[Fuzzy set|other methods]] the LPI-fuzziness is [[algorithm]]ically simple and particularly in [[decision making]], more practically oriented. Instead of an [[indicator function]] the decision maker [[linear]]izes any fuzziness by establishing of linear restrictions for fuzzy probability distributions or normalized weights. In the LPI-procedure the decision maker [[linear]]izes any fuzziness instead of applying a membership function. This can be done by establishing [[stochastic]] and non-stochastic LPI-relations. A mixed stochastic and non-stochastic fuzzification is often a basis for the LPI-procedure. By using the LPI-methods any fuzziness in any decision situation can be considered on the base of the [[linear]] [[fuzzy logic]].

== Definition ==
Any Stochastic Partial Information '''SPI(p)''', which can be considered as a solution of a [[linear]] [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] [[system]], is called Linear Partial Information '''LPI(p)''' about probability '''p'''. It can be considered as an LPI-fuzzification of the probability '''p''' corresponding to the concepts of linear fuzzy logic.

== Applications ==
;The MaxEmin Principle
: To obtain the maximally warranted [[expected value]], the decision maker has to choose the [[strategy]] which maximizes the minimal [[expected value]]. This procedure leads to the MaxEmin – Principle and is an extension of the [[Bernoulli's principle]].
;The MaxWmin Principle
: This principle leads to the maximal guaranteed [[weight function]], regarding the extreme weights.
;The Prognostic Decision Principle (PDP)
: This principle is based on the [[prognostic|prognosis]] interpretation of strategies under fuzziness.

== Fuzzy equilibrium and stability ==
Despite the fuzziness of information, it is often necessary to choose the optimal, most cautious strategy, for example in economic planning, in conflict situations or in daily decisions. This is impossible without the concept of fuzzy equilibrium. The concept of fuzzy stability is considered as an extension into a time interval, taking into account the corresponding stability area of the decision maker. The more complex is the model, the softer a choice has to be considered. 
The idea of fuzzy equilibrium is based on the optimization principles. Therefore, the MaxEmin-, MaxGmin- and PDP-stability have to be analyzed. The violation of these principles leads often to wrong predictions and decisions.

== LPI  equilibrium point ==
Considering a given LPI-decision model, as a [[convolution]] of the corresponding fuzzy states or a disturbance set, the fuzzy equilibrium strategy remains the most cautious one, despite of the presence of the fuzziness. Any deviation from this strategy can cause a loss for the decision maker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4435">'''Liège Space Center''' (French: Centre spatial de Liège, CSL) is a research center of the [[University of Liège]] in Belgium. It holds a hundred people, half of whom are engineers and scientists.  The activities of the CSL are specialized in optics, space technologies and space environment testing.

{{TOC right}}

==History==
The CSL is run by the space group of the Institute of [[Astrophysics]] of the University of Liège. The space group, formed in the mid-1960s, began its activities by observations of [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] rocket probes. Twenty payloads have been launched, mainly from the base at [[Kiruna]] in Sweden.

In 1972, the space group realized the instrument mapping the sky in ultraviolet light from the European satellite [[TD-1A]]. This mapping led to catalogs containing new information on more than 30,000 hot stars. CSL studied and realized prototypes of some detectors of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].

In the early 1980s, CSL participated in the development of the "[[Halley Multicolour Camera]]", which embarked aboard the spacecraft [[Giotto]], photographed the nucleus of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1986.

Since 1988, CSL has been prime contractor for the instrument "Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope" launched on the satellite NASA / ESA SOHO in 1995; it photographed the solar corona.

CSL has also contributed actively to these projects:

* XMM / Newton through the development of 'Optical Monitor "
* INTEGRAL by the optics and mechanics of "Optical Monitor Camera"
* IMAGE ([[NASA]]'s medium explorer) through the implementation of the optomechanical an imaging spectrometer in ultraviolet.

==Activities==

===Space Instrumentation===
Active in the field of instrumentation from the '70s, CSL participates in the development of various instruments, for example most recently:
* PACS, which is currently flying aboard the satellite Herschel ESA;
* a heliospheric imager for NASA's mission SECCHI / STEREO;
* several parts of the French satellite COROT;
* several important elements of the MIRI instrument for the James Web Space Telescope;
* the whole telescope SWAP for observing the sun from minisatellite PROBA2.

===Installation of space tests===
Parallel to these activities related to the development of scientific instruments, the Space Center of Liege is now one of four testing facilities of the European Space Agency (ESA) and specializes in the performance evaluation of satellite payloads, under observation as well as astrophysics geophysics. Optical vacuum tables, in the halls of high level of cleanliness, can describe the behavior of instruments submitted to a restored space environment. Tests can be performed from temperatures of -270&amp;nbsp;°C to +120&amp;nbsp;°C with interferometric stability. The vacuum chambers with optical benches range from 1 m³ to 200 m³ in volume. Many space experiments have been tested at CSL, up from METEOSAT satellite Planck, through the instruments of Hipparcos and XMM / Newton.

The facilities allow CSL and implement environmental testing in a space environment but also on mechanical testing machine for vibration required to certify the equipment during launches. These vibration tests can be performed in [[cryogenic]] conditions, which is required for infrared mission equipments which are cooled before launch (ISO, Herschel).

The CSL has equipment to measure the state of molecular and particulate cleanliness.

===Technological developments===
Center of excellence in optics, the CSL has adopted advanced equipment and specialized in various technological activities for terrestrial and space applications. For example:
* surfaces polished by ion beam;
* surface structures with microscopic irregularities controlled by ion beam;
* deposition of thin films and optical coatings;
* microfabrication technology (networks, integrated optics, ...);
* developments in the field of photovoltaics, including the development of concentrators for solar panels for space and terrestrial applications;
* development of sensors for monitoring the integrity (health monitoring).

'''The London Centre for Nanotechnology''' is a multidisciplinary research centre in physical and biomedical [[nanotechnology]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It brings together three institutions that are world leaders in nanotechnology, [[University College London]], [[Imperial College London]] and [[King's College London]]. It was conceived from the outset with a management structure allowing for a clear focus on exploitation and commercialisation. Although based at UCL's campus in [[Bloomsbury]], the LCN includes research in departments of Imperial's [[South Kensington]] campus and in King's [[Strand, London|Strand]] campus.

The LCN's work requires it to draw on the combined skills of multiple departments, including medicine, chemistry, physics, electrical and electronic engineering, biochemical engineering, materials and earth sciences, and two leading business centres. The LCN’s stated vision is to become Europe’s premier research centre in nanotechnology applied to health care, information technology and the environment.

==History==

The London Centre for Nanotechnology was established as a joint venture between UCL and [[Imperial College London]] in 2003 following the award of a £13.65m higher education grant under the Science Research Infrastructure Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2698649.stm | title=London's little idea|accessdate=31 October 2010|publisher=BBC News| date=27 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2981480.stm | title=Nanotech under the microscope|accessdate=31 October 2010 | publisher=BBC News| date=12 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006 the LCN installed the first monochromated electron microscope in the UK at its site on the [[Imperial College London]] campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/news/2006/october/20100601.asp | title=UK researchers unveil country's most powerful microscope|accessdate=31 October 2010 | publisher=Chemistry World| date=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 the LCN published research about the possibility of using microscopic "nanoprobes" to discover new drugs to combat [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7663437.stm| title='Nanotech search' for antibiotics|accessdate=31 October 2010 | publisher=BBC News| date=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009 a team at the Science and Technology Facilities Council's ISIS facility led by Stephen Bramwell of the LCN published research showing that single magnetic charges be made to behave and interact like electrical ones through the use of the magnetic monopoles that exist in [[spin ice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8307804.stm| title='Magnetic electricity' discovered|accessdate=31 October 2010 | publisher=BBC News| date=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King's College London]] joined the LCN in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=King's College London joins powerhouse of nanotechnology research |url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news-article.aspx?id=00e47784-a09f-4283-b9b7-d510af277484 |website=King's College London |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LCN's research is organised around three themes, which it characterizes as follows:

•	'''Information Technology:''' Computing and communications needs continue to grow and underpin all other human endeavours. Current technologies are limited and new nanotechnology-driven paradigms such as quantum computing and spintronics are needed.

•	'''Health care:''' Under development are specialised sensors and novel cancer-diagnosis systems, as well as new insights into cellular biophysics and nanotechnology-based instrumentation.

•	'''Planet Care:''' The LCN uses its expertise, ranging from biology to chemistry and materials science, to conduct research in areas including novel photovoltaics, new approaches to exploring current energy supplies, low-power lighting and computing, new materials, instrumentation for the nuclear industry, and storing hydrogen efficiently at room temperature.

[[Image:Jiu Xiao Huan Pei.jpg|thumb|300px|A famous [[Tang Dynasty]] guqin "Jiu Xiao Huan Pei". The [[guqin]] has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favored by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement.]]

'''Music history''', sometimes called historical musicology, is the highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of [[musicology]] that studies music from a historical viewpoint.
In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music (e.g., the history of [[Music of India|Indian music]] or the history of [[Rock music|rock]]). In practice, these research topics are often categorized as part of [[ethnomusicology]] or [[cultural studies]], whether or not they are [[ethnography|ethnographically based]]. The terms "music history" and "historical musicology" usually refer to the history of the notated music of Western elites, sometimes called "art music" (by analogy to art history, which tends to focus on elite art).

The methods of music history include source studies (esp. [[manuscript]] studies), [[paleography]], [[philology]] (especially [[textual criticism]]), style criticism, historiography (the choice of [[historical method]]), [[musical analysis]], and [[iconography]]. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of [[music theory]]. Some of the intellectual products of music historians include editions of musical works, [[biographies|biography]] of composers and other musicians, studies of the relationship between [[word]]s and music, and the reflections upon the place of music in [[society]].

==Pedagogy==
Although most performers of classical and traditional instruments receive some instruction in music, art pop, or rock and roll history from teachers throughout their training, the majority of formal music history courses are offered at the [[college]] level.  In Canada, some music students receive training prior to undergraduate studies because examinations in music history (as well as music theory) are required to complete Royal Conservatory certification at the Grade 9 level and higher

Most medium and large institutions will offer both types of courses.  The two types of courses will usually differ in length (one to two semesters vs. two to four), breadth (many music appreciation courses begin at the [[Baroque music|late Baroque]] or [[Classical music era|classical]] eras and might omit music after [[World War II|WWII]] while courses for majors traditionally span the period from the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]] to recent times), and depth. Both types of courses tend to emphasize a balance among the acquisition of musical [[repertory]] (often emphasized through listening examinations), study and analysis of these works, biographical and cultural details of music and musicians, and writing about music, perhaps through [[music criticism]].

More specialized seminars in music history tend to use a similar approach on a narrower subject while introducing more of the tools of research in music history.The range of possible topics is virtually limitless.  Some examples might be "Music during [[World War I]]," "Medieval and Renaissance [[musical instrument|instrumental]] music," "Music and Process," "[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''Don Giovanni''."

The methods and tools of music history are nearly as many as its subjects and therefore make a strict categorization impossible. However, a few trends and approaches can be outlined here. Like in any other historical discipline, most research in music history can be roughly divided into two categories: the establishing of factual and correct data and the interpretation of data. Most historical research does not fall into one category solely, but rather employs a combination of methods from both categories. It should also be noted that the act of establishing factual data can never be fully separate from the act of interpretation.

'''Archival work''' may be conducted to find connections to music or musicians in a collection of documents of broader interests (e.g., [[Vatican Secret Archives|Vatican]] pay records, letters to a patroness of the arts) or to more systematically study a collection of documents related to a musician.  In some cases, where records, scores, and letters have been digitized, [[Archive|archival]] work can be done online. One example of a composer for whom archival materials can be examined online is the [[Arnold Schoenberg]] Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoenberg.at/ Schoenberg.at]&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Performance practice''' draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Scholars investigate questions such as which instruments or voices were used to perform a given work, what tempos (or tempo changes) were used, and how (or if) ornaments were used. Although [[performance practice]] was previously confined to early music from the Baroque era, since the 1990s, research in performance practice has examined other historical eras, such as how early Classical era piano concerti were performed, how the early history of recording affected the use of vibrato in classical music, or which instruments were used in [[Klezmer]] music.

'''Biographical studies''' of composers can give a better sense of the chronology of compositions, influences on style and works, and provide important background to the interpretation (by performers or listeners) of works.  Thus biography can form one part of the larger study of the cultural significance, underlying program, or agenda of a work; a study which gained increasing importance in the 1980s and early 1990s.

'''Sociological studies''' focus on the function of music in society as well as its meaning for individuals and society as a whole. Researchers emphasizing the social importance of music (including classical music) are sometimes called [[New musicology|New musicologists]].

'''Semiotic studies''' are most conventionally the province of music analysts rather than historians.  However, crucial to the practice of musical semiotics – the interpretation of meaning in a work or style – is its situation in a historical context.  The interpretative work of scholars such as [[Kofi Agawu]] and [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]] fall between the analytic and the music historical.

==History==

===Before 1800===
The first studies of Western musical history date back to the middle of the 18th century. [[Giovanni Battista Martini|G.B. Martini]] published a three volume history titled ''Storia della musica'' (''History of Music'') between 1757 and 1781. [[Martin Gerbert]] published a two volume history of sacred music titled ''De cantu de musica sacra'' in 1774. Gerbert followed this work with a three volume work ''Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra'' containing significant writings on sacred music from the 3rd century onwards in 1784.

===1800–1950===
[[Image:Beethoven opus 101 manuscript.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s manuscript sketch for [[Piano Sonata No. 28 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 28]], Movement IV, ''Geschwind, doch nicht zu sehr und mit Entschlossenheit'' ([[Tempo|Allegro]]), in his own handwriting. The piece was completed in 1816.]]
In the 20th century, the work of [[:de:Johannes Wolf (Musikwissenschaftler)|Johannes Wolf]] and others developed studies in [[Medieval music]] and early [[Renaissance music]]. Wolf's writings on the history of musical notation are considered to be particularly notable by musicologists. Historical musicology has played a critical role in renewed interest in [[Baroque music]] as well as medieval and Renaissance music. In particular, the [[authentic performance]] movement owes much to historical musicological scholarship. Towards the middle of the 20th century, musicology (and its largest subfield of historical musicology) expanded significantly as a field of study.  Concurrently the number of musicological and music journals increased to create further outlets for the publication of research.  The domination of German language scholarship ebbed as significant journals sprang up throughout the West, especially America.

==Critiques==

=== Exclusion of disciplines and musics ===
In its most narrow definition, historical musicology is the music history of Western culture. Such a definition arbitrarily excludes disciplines other than history, cultures other than Western, and forms of music other than "classical" ("art", "serious", "high culture") or notated ("artificial") – implying that the omitted disciplines, cultures, and musical styles/genres are somehow inferior. A somewhat broader definition incorporating all musical humanities is still problematic, because it arbitrarily excludes the relevant (natural) sciences (acoustics, psychology, physiology, neurosciences, information and computer sciences, empirical sociology and aesthetics) as well as musical practice.  The musicological sub-disciplines of [[music theory]] and music analysis have likewise historically been rather uneasily separated from the most narrow definition of historical musicology.

Within historical musicology, scholars have been reluctant to adopt postmodern and critical approaches that are common elsewhere in the humanities. According to [[Susan McClary]] (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;1285) the discipline of "music lags behind the other arts; it picks up ideas from other media just when they have become outmoded." Only in the 1990s did historical musicologists, preceded by feminist musicologists in the late 1980s, begin to address issues such as gender, sexualities, bodies, emotions, and subjectivities which dominated the humanities for twenty years before (ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;10). In McClary's words (1991, p.&amp;nbsp;5), "It almost seems that musicology managed miraculously to pass directly from pre- to postfeminism without ever having to change – or even examine – its ways." Furthermore, in their discussion on musicology and rock music, Susan McClary and Robert Walser also address a key struggle within the discipline: how musicology has often "dismisse[d] questions of socio-musical interaction out of hand, that part of classical music's greatness is ascribed to its autonomy from society." (1988,  p.&amp;nbsp;283)

=== Exclusion of popular music ===
According to [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], the strongest criticism of (historical) musicology has been that it generally ignores popular music. Though musicological study of popular music has vastly increased in quantity recently, Middleton's assertion in 1990—that most major "works of musicology, theoretical or historical, act as though popular music did not exist"—holds true. Academic and conservatory training typically only peripherally addresses this broad spectrum of musics, and many (historical) musicologists who are "both contemptuous and condescending are looking for types of production, musical form, and listening which they associate with a ''different'' kind of music...'classical music'...and they generally find popular music lacking"

He cites three main aspects of this problem (p.&amp;nbsp;104–6). The terminology of historical musicology is "slanted by the needs and history of a particular music ('classical music')." He acknowledges that "there is a rich vocabulary for certain areas [harmony, tonality, certain part-writing and forms], important in musicology's typical corpus"; yet he points out that there is "an impoverished vocabulary for other areas [rhythm, pitch nuance and gradation, and timbre], which are less well developed" in Classical music. Middleton argues that a number of "terms are ideologically loaded" in that "they always involve selective, and often unconsciously formulated, conceptions of what music ''is''."

As well, he claims that historical musicology uses "a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation," 'notational centricity' (Tagg 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;28–32). As a result, "musicological methods tend to foreground those musical parameters which can be easily notated" such as pitch relationships or the relationship between words and music. On the other hand, historical musicology tends to "neglect or have difficulty with parameters which are not easily notated", such as tone colour or non-Western rhythms. In addition, he claims that the "notation-centric training" of Western music schools "induces particular forms of ''listening'', and these then tend to be applied to ''all'' sorts of music, appropriately or not". As a result, Western music students trained in historical musicology may listen to a [[funk]] or [[Latin American music|Latin]] song that is very rhythmically complex, but then dismiss it as a low-level musical work because it has a very simple melody and only uses two or five chords.

Notational centricity also encourages "reification: the score comes to be seen as 'the music', or perhaps the music in an ideal form." As such, music that does not use a written score, such as jazz, blues, or folk, can become demoted to a lower level of status. As well, historical musicology has "an ideology slanted by the origins and development of a particular body of music and its aesthetic...It arose at a specific moment, in a specific context – nineteenth-century Europe, especially Germany – and in close association with that movement in the musical ''practice'' of the period which was codifying the very repertory then taken by musicology as the centre of its attention." These terminological, methodological, and ideological problems affect even works sympathetic to popular music. However, it is not "that musicology ''cannot'' understand popular music, or that students of popular music should abandon musicology."  (Middleton, p.&amp;nbsp;104).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6014">'''Narcotizing dysfunction''' is a theory that as [[mass media]] inundates people on a particular issue, they become apathetic to it, substituting knowledge for action.&lt;ref&gt;Baran ''et al.'' pp.179-80 quotation: {{quotation|one of the first media effects to be studied in some depth using functional analysis was the '''narcotizing dysfunction''', the idea that as news about an issue inundates people, they become apathetic to it... These findings were disturbing because they suggested that even when media are effective at surveying the environment and calling attention to societal problems (a manifest function), ... media coverage might "[[narcotics|narcotize]]" [the public] so that they become apathetic and decide that they are powerless to do anything (a latent dysfunction).}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the vast supply of communications Americans receive may elicit only a superficial concern with the problems of society. This would result in real societal action being neglected, while superficiality covers up mass [[apathy]]. Thus, it is termed "[[wikt:dysfunctional|dysfunctional]]" as it indicates the inherent dysfunction of both [[mass media]] and [[social media]] during controversial incidents and events. The theory assumes that it is not in the best interests of people to form a social mass that is politically apathetic and inert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eşitti|first=Şakir |url=https://asosindex.com/cache/articles/sosyal-medyanin-uyusturan-etkisi-f187234.pdf|title=Narcotizing Effect of Social Media|date=April 2016|department=Rethinking the Contributions of Social Media to Democracy and Social Movements|journal=Cankiri Karatekin University Journal of Institute of Social Sciences|format=PDF|volume=7 |issue=1|page=1023|id=ASOS f187234|accessdate=August 7, 2018|quote=...social media can act against political participation &amp; grass roots mobilization because social media &amp; other internet based technologies "discourage face-to-face communication"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irfanerdogan.com/dergiweb2008/24/13.pdf| title=Mass communication, popular taste, and organized social action|vauthors=Lazarsfeld PF, Merton RK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''narcotizing dysfunction'' was identified in the article ''Mass Communication, Popular Taste and Organized Social Action'', by [[Paul F.

Mass media's overwhelming flow of information has caused the populace to become passive in their social activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eşitti|first=Şakir|date=2016-04-01|title=Narcotizing Effect of Social Media|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301685342_Narcotizing_Effect_of_Social_Media|journal=Çankırı Karatekin Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Enstitüsü Dergisi|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the individual is assailed with information about a huge range of issues and problems and they are knowledgeable about or able to discuss these issues, they believe they are helping to resolve these issues. As more time is spent educating oneself on current issues, there is a decrease in time available to take organized social action. Courses of action may be discussed, but they are rather internalized and rarely come to fruition. In short, people have unwittingly substituted knowledge for action.&lt;ref name="M+L-1957" /&gt; People's consciences are clear, as they think they have done something to address the issue. However, being informed and concerned is not a replacement for action. Even though there are increasing numbers of political messages, information, and advertisements available through traditional media and online media, [[political participation]] continues to decline. People pay close attention to the media, but there is an overexposure of messages that can get confusing and contradictory so people do not get involved in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UKKzMtuS2EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=gx1KP6lvC2&amp;dq=narcotizing+dysfunction&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=narcotizing+dysfunction&amp;f=false|title=MediaWriting: Print, Broadcast, and Public Relations|first1=Rik|last1=Whitaker|first2=Janet|last2=Ramsey|first3=Ronald D.|last3=Smith|date=19 December 2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203886700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &lt;i&gt;narcotizing dysfunction&lt;/i&gt; gained popularity from its use in the 1948 article ''Mass Communication, Popular Taste, and Organized Social Action'', by Paul F. Lazarsfeld and Robert K. Merton. In Lazarsfeld and Merton's article, it appears as the third function of mass media's problematic social effects, alongside social status conferral function and the enforcement of social norms.

The '''Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment''' ({{lang-nl|Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu}} or simply ''RIVM''),  is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] research institute that is an independent agency of the Dutch [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport]].

RIVM performs tasks to promote [[public health]] and a safe living [[Natural environment|environment]] by conducting research and collecting knowledge worldwide. The results are used to support the Dutch government in formulating its policy. RIVM's primary tasks are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onderzoekinformatie.nl/en/oi/nod/organisatie/ORG1236213/ Search of the Dutch Research Data Base (NOD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rivm.nl/en/aboutrivm/ About RIVM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221023446/http://www.rivm.nl/en/aboutrivm/ |date=2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RIVM is located in [[Bilthoven]] and employs over 1500 people, many of whom work in multidisciplinary fields.

==History==

RIVM was founded in 1910 when the Central Laboratory for Public Health was created and the present size of the institute is the result of a merger between three government institutes in 1984. RIVM has now become a large, complex organisation with many different international links and a range of activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciesin.org/IC/rivm/about.html The Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)] (at Columbia University, New York, USA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==

The RIVM organisation consists of three domains with specific knowledge and expertise: Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology (Centre for Infectious Disease Control), Environment and Safety (including environmental incident service), Public Health and Health Services (including food and food safety).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5758">'''Nicolaes Jonghelinck''' (1517-1570) was a merchant banker and art collector in [[Antwerp]]. He is best known for his collection of paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Frans Floris]]. His brother was the sculptor [[Jacques Jonghelinck]].
[[File:Bescriivinge_van_de_paelen_der_vriiheiit_van_Antwerpen_-_Iongelinck.jpg|thumb|''Iongelinck''. Fortification listed on map of Antwerp dated 1582]]
In the archives of Antwerp, a writ of guarantee by Jonghelinck, dated 15 February 1566 and declaring to be worth 16.000 [[guilder]]s, for his friend ''Daniel de Bruyne'' lists "sixteen paintings by Bruegel, among them the Tower of Babel, a painting with the title Christ carrying the Cross, the twelve Months of the Year, and all the others whichever they might be". Jonghelinck probably commissioned these paintings though that has not been recorded, for his fortified country house outside of Antwerp that was designed by his brother Jacques in 1547 and sold in 1554 to Nicolaes. It can still be seen on a map dated 1582 though it was destroyed during the [[Fall of Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Vöhringer – ''Pieter Bruegel. 1525/30-1569'', Tandem Verlag 2007 (h.f.ullmann imprint) S. 116f {{ISBN|978-3-8331-3852-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Months of the Year==
Though it is known that Jonghelinck owned 16 paintings by Bruegel at the time of his death, the specific list is unknown and for many years art historians assumed that this cycle of paintings included either four panels for the four seasons or twelve panels for all twelve months. Now it is assumed they represent six bi-monthly pairs, with one missing.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/261005 record 261005] for ''Hunters in the Snow'' in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; They are assumed to be a continuation of an older tradition to make cyclical images of the [[Labours of the Months]], but they were hung by Jonghelinck in his chateau and therefore may simply have been ordered as wall decorations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/28954879/Plus_semper_quam_pingitur_The_Catholic_Bruegel Plus semper quam pingitur: The Catholic Bruegel] by German art historian Nils Büttner&lt;/ref&gt;
The surviving ''Months of the Year cycle'' are:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The Tower of Babel==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)|Tower of Babel]]]]
Bruegel's ''Tower of Babel'' is one of several paintings in the possession of Jonghelinck that came into the collection of the City of Antwerp and later found their way into the Austrian Imperial collection of Vienna through [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khm.at/objektdb/detail/323 Turmbau zu Babel] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller version by Breugel's hand is in Rotterdam, dated to the same period, which indicates the popularity of the subject in Jonghelinck's day.

==The Procession to Calvary==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 007.jpg|thumb|[[The Procession to Calvary (Bruegel)|The Procession to Calvary]]]]
[[Michael Francis Gibson]] wrote an art-historical book entitled ''The Mill and the Cross,'' which served as the basis for the 2011 film ''[[The Mill and the Cross]],'' directed by [[Lech Majewski (film director)|Lech Majewski]].  The film sets into their historical context in sixteenth-century Flanders the characters in the painting and the circumstances of the painting's creation.  The films stars [[Rutger Hauer]] as Bruegel and [[Michael York]] as his patron Jonghelinck.

==Labours of Hercules==
[[File:Hercules Killing the Lernean Hydra.jpg|thumb|Hercules Killing the Lernean Hydra]]
Another artist in the collection of Jonghelinck was [[Frans Floris]], who made ten panels of the [[Labours of Hercules]] (which are now lost and only known through later engravings).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1519665&amp;partId=1 The Labours of Hercules] on the [[British Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Floris also made seven compositions on the liberal arts for Jonghelinck, which were later exported to Genua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1521662&amp;partId=1 Seven Liberal Arts / Grammatica] on the [[British Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Nicolaas Jonghelinck is listed as the first owner in 1566 (referring to the writ of guarantee above) for several of the paintings that have survived in the Austrian Imperial collection and are still in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] today. For example, the record for ''The Gloomy Day'', or ''Düsterer Tag (Vorfrühling)'', shows in their provenance record ''Nicolaas Jongelinck; 1594 Geschenk der Stadt Antwerpen an [[Archduke Ernest of Austria|Erzherzog Ernst]]; 1595 Nachlass Erzherzog Ernst; [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II.]]; Slg. [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria|Leopold Wilhelm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khm.at/objektdb/detail/325/ Düsterer Tag (Vorfrühling)] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], '''nomos''' refers to provisional codes (habits or customs) of social and political behavior, socially constructed and historically (even geographically) specific. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jarratt|first=Susan Carole Funderburgh|title=Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured|year=1991|publisher=Southern Illinois UP|location=Carbondale}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek νόμος, and it refers not only to explicit laws but to all of the normal rules and forms people take for granted in their day-to-day activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=Law, Legislation and Liberty|year=1982|publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415522298|pages=90–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomos stands for order, valid and binding on those who fall under its jurisdiction; thus it is a social construct with ethical dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostwald|first=Martin|title=Nomos and the Beginnings of the Athenian Democracy|year=1969|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a belief, opinion or point of view; it is a human invention.

== History of the term ==

[[Carl Schmitt]] began using the term in his 1934 publication "On the Three Types of Juristic Thought"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|others=trans Joseph Bendersky|title=On the Three Types of Juristic Thought |year=2004|publisher=Praeger|pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the "concrete order" of a people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehring|first=Reinhard|title=Carl Schmitt: A Biography|year=2014|publisher=Polity|isbn=9780745652245|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; before extending its use into his 1950 book "The Nomos of the Earth in the International Law of the Jus Publicum Europaeum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schmitt/#LibCosFouIntOrd|title=Carl Schmitt|last=Vinx|first=Lars|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bergerian nomos ===

After Schmitt, the next influential writer to use the term in a modern context is [[Peter L. Berger]]. Berger writes of human beings fashioning a world by their own activity (1967:5). Berger sees this taking place through a continual threefold cycle between individuals and society: externalisation, objectivation and internalization. The world thus fashioned has an order&amp;mdash;a set of principles&amp;mdash;which comes to be read onto society by individuals through externalisation and objectivation, and also internalised in each individual. This order thus comes to be assumed, spoken of, and placed into social discourse to be treated as common sense. This ordering of the world and experience, which is a corporate and social process as well as an individual one, is a nomos.

Berger writes of 'The socially established nomos' being understood 'as a shield against terror. Put differently, the most important function of society is nomization.' (1967:22). We all need that structuring nomos; it provides us with stability, predictability, a frame of reference in which to live. The alternative is the chaos and terror of what Berger calls anomy.

To be most effective, the nomos must be taken for granted. The structure of the world created by human and social activity is treated not as contingent, but as self-evident. 'Whenever the socially established nomos attains the quality of being taken for granted, there occurs a merging of its meanings with what are considered to be the fundamental meanings inherent in the universe.' (1967:24-25). Berger sees this happening in all societies, and while the nomos is expressed in religious terms in 'archaic societies', 'In contemporary society, this archaic cosmization of the social world is likely to take the form of "scientific" propositions about the nature of men rather than the nature of the universe.' (1967:25).

So this process of world-construction is not necessarily religious, but its expression has most often been religious. Later Berger explores the part religious belief has played in nomoi: providing a connection with the cosmic—seeking to provide a completeness to that religious world-view.

'Every human society is an edifice of externalized and objectivated meanings, always intending a meaningful totality. Every society is engaged in the never completed enterprise of building a humanly meaningful world. Cosmization implies the identification of this humanly meaningful world with the world as such, the former now being grounded in the latter, reflecting it or being derived from it in its fundamental structures. Such a cosmos, as the ultimate ground and validation of human nomoi, need not necessarily be sacred. Particularly in modern times there have been thoroughly secular attempts at cosmization, among which modern science is by far the most important. It is safe to say, however, that originally all cosmization had a sacred character.' (1967:27).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=The Sacred Canopy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coverian nomos===

The next landmark in the use of the term is generally thought to be by [[Robert Cover]], who argued in his influential 1982 paper [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3690&amp;context=fss_papers Nomos and Narrative] that while the mechanisms of law and social control are part of law, that students of the law, and legal actors, should instead focus on the [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] universe, the whole of the means of social control. As with Berger, Cover rooted the nomos in "narrative", or what a post-structuralist would call [[meta-narrative]]. Cover argued that no set of legal institutions exists apart from the narratives that locate it and give it meaning.

He says this because he argues that our moral sense is composed of the narratives from which we draw conclusions, and by which we locate ourselves in relation to other people. He argues that because narrative is morality, the normative universe must rest on narrative. Since we also construct our view of the universe physically from narrative, he argues that the normative universe is as much a part of our existence as the physical universe.

Cover then makes an argument of incorporation: he states that just as we develop increasingly complex responses to the physical world, so too is our development of responses to "[[Other (philosophy)|otherness]]" conditioned over time by interaction. From this he argues that societies that have great legal systems rest on more than formal and technical virtuosity, but in the richness of their understanding of the normative universe.

Cover argues that the explicit relationship between formal apparatus of a society, in this case a legal society, and the normative range of behavior is the fulcrum to understanding whether the society is functional or not.

Cover's use of the term is rooted in Berger's argument that nomos requires mythology and narrative, as pillars for the understanding of the meaning of each act within a particular nomos.

'''Non-formal learning''' includes various structured [[learning]] situations which do not either have the level of [[curriculum]], [[syllabus]], [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] and [[certification]] associated with '[[formal learning]]', but have more structure than that associated with '[[informal learning]]', which typically take place naturally and spontaneously as part of other activities. These form the three styles of learning recognised and supported by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/recognitionofnon-formalandinformallearning-home.htm|title=Recognition of Non-formal and Informal Learning - Home|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of non-formal learning include swimming sessions for toddlers, community-based sports programs, and programs developed by organisations such as the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], the [[Girl Guides]], community or non-credit [[adult education]] courses, sports or fitness programs, professional conference style [[seminar]]s, and continuing professional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Eaton, Sarah Elaine|title=Formal, Non-Formal and Informal Learning|url=http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/eaton_formal_nonformal_informal_learning.htm |date =22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learner’s objectives may be to increase skills and knowledge, as well as to experience the emotional rewards associated with increased love for a subject or increased passion for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality guide to non-formal and informal learning processes|url=http://www.menon.org/publications/TQM%20Guide%20for%20informal%20learning.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wT2umMVj|date =2004|archive-date=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The debate over the relative value of formal and informal learning has existed for a number of years. Traditionally formal learning takes place in a [[school]] or [[university]] and has a greater value placed upon it than informal learning, such as learning within the workplace. This concept of formal learning being the socio-cultural accepted norm for learning was first challenged by Scribner and Cole&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Scribner, S. and Cole, M.|year=1973|title=Cognitive Consequences of Formal and Informal Education, Science|pages=182, 553–559}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973, who claimed most things in life are better learnt through informal processes, citing [[language learning]] as an example. Moreover, anthropologists noted that complex learning still takes place within indigenous communities that had no formal educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lave, J. and Wenger, E.|year=1991|title=Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It’s the acquisition of this knowledge or learning which occurs in everyday life that has not been fully valued or understood. This led to the declaration by the OECD educational ministers of the "[[life-long learning]] for all"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=OCED|title=Lifelong Learning for All|url=http://www.oecdbookshop.org/browse.asp?pid=title-detail&amp;lang=en&amp;ds=&amp;k=5LMQCR2K9XLP|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategy in 1996. This includes 23 countries from five continents, who have sought to clarify and validate all forms of learning including formal, non-formal and informal. This has been in conjunction with the [[European Union]] which has also developed policies for life-long learning which focus strongly on the need to identify, assess and certify non-formal and informal learning, particularly in the workplace.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Formal and informal learning==

Although all definitions can be contested (see below) this article shall refer to the [[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training]] (Cedefop) 2001 communication on 'lifelong learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning' as the guideline for the differing definitions.

'''Formal learning''': learning typically provided by an education or training institution, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support) and leading to certification. Formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspective. (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of key terms|url=http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/about-cedefop/projects/validation-of-non-formal-and-informal-learning/european-inventory-glossary.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Informal learning''': learning resulting from daily life activities related to work, family or leisure. It is not structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support) and typically does not lead to certification. Informal learning may be intentional but in most cases it is not-intentional (or "incidental"/random). (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

'''Non-formal learning''': see definition above.

==Contested definitions==
If there is no clear distinction between formal and in-formal learning where is the room for non-formal learning. It is a contested issue with numerous definitions given. The following are some the competing theories.

'''''"It is difficult to make a clear distinction between formal and informal learning as there is often a crossover between the two."''''' (McGivney, 1999, p1).&lt;ref&gt;[McGivney, V. (1999) Informal learning in the community: a trigger for change and development (Leicester: NIACE). Cited in ‘Helen Colley, Phil Hodkinson &amp; Janice Malcolm (2002) Non-formal learning: mapping the conceptual terrain. A Consultation Report, Leeds: University of Leeds Lifelong Learning Institute. Also available in the informal education archives: http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/colley_informal_learning.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Hodkinson et al. (2003), conclude after a significant literature analysis on the topics of formal, informal, and non-formal learning, that "the terms informal and non-formal appeared interchangeable, each being primarily defined in opposition to the dominant formal education system, and the largely individualist and acquisitional conceptualisations of learning developed in relation to such educational contexts." (Hodkinson et al., 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;314)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodkinson|first=Phil |author2=Colley, Hellen |author3=Janice Malcolm|title=The Interrelationships Between Informal and Formal Learning|journal=Journal of Workplace Learning|year=2003|volume=15|pages=313–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he states that "It is important not to see informal and formal attributes as somehow separate, waiting to be integrated. This is the dominant view in the literature, and it is mistaken. Thus, the challenge is not to, somehow, combine informal and formal learning, for informal and formal attributes are present and inter-related, whether we will it so or not. The challenge is to recognise and identify them, and understand the implications. For this reason, '''the concept of non-formal learning, at least when seen as a middle state between formal and informal, is redundant'''." (p.&amp;nbsp;314)

''Eraut's&lt;ref&gt;[Eraut, M. (2000) Non-formal learning, implicit learning and tacit knowledge, in F. Coffield (Ed) The Necessity of Informal Learning, Bristol: Policy Press (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; classification of learning into formal and non-formal'':

This removes informal learning from the equation and states all learning outside of formal learning is non-formal. Eraut equates informal with connotations of dress, language or behaviour that have no relation to learning. Eraut defines formal learning as taking place within a learning framework; within a classroom or learning institution, with a designated teacher or trainer; the award of a qualification or credit; the external specification of outcomes. Any learning that occurs outside of these parameters is non-formal. (Ined 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"&gt;[Ined:Non-Formal Learning http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/colley_informal_learning.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The EC (2001) Communication on Lifelong Learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning'':

The EU places non-formal learning in between formal and informal learning (see above). This has learning both in a formal setting with a learning framework and as an organised event but within a qualification. "Non-formal learning: learning that is not provided by an education or training institution and typically does not lead to certification. It is, however, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support). Non-formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspective." (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

''Livingstone's&lt;ref&gt;[Livingstone, D.W. (2001) Adults’ Informal Learning: Definitions, Findings, Gaps and Future Research, Toronto: OISE/UT (NALL Working Paper No.21) at http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/depts/sese/csew/nall/res/21adultsifnormallearning.htm,(2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; adults formal and informal education, non-formal and informal learning'':

This focuses on the idea of adult non-formal education. This new mode, ‘informal education’ is when teachers or mentors guide learners without reference to structured learning outcomes. This informal education learning is gaining knowledge without an imposed framework, such as learning new job skills. (Infed, 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"/&gt;

''Billett&lt;ref&gt;[Billett, S. (2001a) Participation and continuity at work: A critique of current workplace learning discourses, paper given at the conference Context, Power and Perspective: Confronting the Challenges to Improving Attainment in Learning at Work, Sunley Management Centre, University College Northampton, 8 –10 November]&lt;/ref&gt; (2001): there is no such thing as informal learning'':

Billet's definition states there is no such thing as non-formal and informal learning. He states all human activity is learning, and that everything people do involves a process of learning. "all learning takes place within social organisations or communities that have formalised structures." Moreover, he states most learning in life takes place outside of formal education.(Ined 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"/&gt;

==Validation==

Recently, many [[international organization]]s and [[UNESCO]] Member States have emphasized the importance of learning that takes place outside of formal learning settings. This emphasis has led UNESCO, through its [[UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning|Institute of Lifelong Learning]] (UIL), to adopt international guidelines for the Recognition, Validation and Accreditation of the Outcomes of Non-formal and Informal Learning in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;UIL. 2012. ''Guidelines for the Recognition, Validation and Accreditation of the Outcomes of Non-formal and Informal Learning''. Hamburg, Germany, UIL.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis has also led to an increasing number of policies and programmes in many Member States, and a gradual shift from pilots to large-scale systems such as those in Portugal, France, Australia, Mauritius and South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training|Cedefop]] has created European guidelines to provide validation to a broad range of learning experiences, thereby aiding transparency and comparability across its national borders. The broad framework for achieving this certification across both non-formal and informal learning is outlined in the Cedefop European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning; Routes from learning to certification.&lt;ref&gt;[European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning; Routes from learning to certification. figure 2 p.18. http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/Files/4054_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different countries' approaches==

There are different approaches to validation between OCED and EU countries, with countries adopting different measures. The EU, as noted above, through the Cedefop-released European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning in 2009 to standardise validation throughout the EU. Within the OCED countries, the picture is more mixed.

== Flexible schooling or participatory schooling ==

Non-formal education (NFE) is popular on a worldwide scale in both 'western' and 'developing countries'. Non-formal education can form a matrix with formal and non-formal education, as non-formal education can mean any form of systematic learning conducted outside the formal setting. Many courses in relation to non-formal education have been introduced in several universities in western and developing countries.

The UNESCO institute of education conducted a seminar on non-formal [[education in Morocco]]. The association for development of education in Africa (ADEA) launched many programmes in non-formal education in at least 15 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2001 World Bank conducted an international seminar on basic education in non-formal programmes. In addition to this the World Bank was advised to extend its services to adult and non-formal education.

A report on vocational education, Making Learning Visible: the identification, assessment and recognition of non-formal learning in Europe, defines non-formal learning as semi structured, consisting of planned and explicit approaches to learning introduced into work organisations and elsewhere, not recognised within the formal education and training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alan Rogers|title=Non-Formal Education: Flexible Schooling or Participatory Education?|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pQQcOj3Iu1QC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP8&amp;dq=non+formal+education&amp;ots=JpjgCLrr9p&amp;sig=jGiHsF0HZOG3EcyTtcrE5FDewnc#v=onepage&amp;q=non%20formal%20education&amp;f=false|ref=book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Community work, which is particularly widespread in Scotland, fosters people's  commitment to their neighbours and encourages participation in and development of local democratic forms of organisation.

Youth work which focuses on making people more active in the society.

Social work which helps young people in homes to develop ways to deal with complex situations like fostering fruitful relationships between parents and children, bringing different groups of career together, etc...

In France and Italy animation in a particular form is a kind of non-formal education. It uses theatre and acting as means of self-expression with different community groups for children and people with special needs. This type of non-formal education helps in ensuring active participation and teaches people to manage the community in which they live.

Youth and community organisations young people have the opportunity  to discover, analyse and understand values and their implications and build a set of values to guide their lives. They run work camps and meetings, recruit volunteers, administer bank acoounts, give counselling etc. to work toward social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mr Cristian Dumitrescu|title=Non formal education|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=8807&amp;lang=en|work=Report|agency=Committee on Culture and Education|date=15 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==

Education plays an important role in  development. Out of school programmes are important to provide adaptable learning opportunities and new skills and knowledge to a large percentage of people who are beyond the reach of formal education. Non-formal education began to gain popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Today, non-formal education is seen as a concept of recurrent and lifelong learning.

Non-formal education is popular among the adults specially the women as it increases women's participation in both private and public activities, i.e. in house hold decision making and as active citizens in the community affairs and national development. These literacy programmes have a dramatic impact on women's self-esteem because they unleash their potential in economic, social, cultural and political spheres.

According to UNESCO (2010), non-formal education helps to ensures equal access to education, eradicate illiteracy among women and improve women's access to vocational training, science, technology and continuing education. It also encourages the development of non-discriminatory education and training. The effectiveness of such literacy and non-formal education programmes are bolstered  by family, community and parental involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Department of Educational Foundations and Management|title=A Critical Assessment of the Role/Importance of Non-Formal Education to Human and National Development in Nigeria: Future Trends|url=http://www.ijsre.com/Vol.,%205_2_-Ololube%20&amp;%20Egbezor.pdf|ref=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Non-formal education is beneficial in a number of ways. There are activities that encourage young people to choose their own programme and projects that are important because they offer the youth the flexibility and freedom to explore their emerging interests. When the youth can choose the activities in which they can participate, they have opportunities to develop several skills like decision making skills.

Non-formal learning has experiential learning activities that foster the development of skills and knowledge. This helps in building the confidence and abilities among the youth of today. It also helps in development of personal relationships not only among the youth but also among the adults. It helps in developing interpersonal skills among the young people as they learn to interact with peers outside the class and with adults in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen T. Russell|title=The Developmental Benefits of Nonformal Education and Youth Development|issue=The University of California, Davis|url=http://www.ca4h.org/files/1231.pdf|ref=journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

There are drawbacks to non-formal education which include that non-formal learning is not based on curriculum but based on experience. There is low efficiency in non-formal education.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Necessity ==

Formal education system are inadequate to effectively meet the needs of the individual and the society. The need to offer more and better education at all levels, to a growing number of people, particularly in developing countries, the scant success of current formal education systems to meet all such demands, has shown the need to develop alternatives to learning.

The rigid structure of formal schools, mainly because of rules and regulations than concentrating on the real need of the students, offering curriculum that leans away from the individual and from society, far more concerned with performing programmes than reaching useful objectives. This called for non-formal education which starting from the basic need of the students, is concerned with the establishment of strategies that are compatible with reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claudio Zaki Dib|title=FORMAL, NON-FORMAL AND INFORMAL EDUCATION: CONCEPTS/APPLICABILITY|url=http://www.techne-dib.com.br/downloads/6.pdf|publisher=stitute of Physics University of São Paulo, Brazil|ref=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The oldest profession in the world''' (or '''the world's oldest profession''') is a phrase that, unless another meaning is specified, refers to [[prostitution]].  However, it did not acquire that meaning universally until after World War I. Formerly, various professions vied for the reputation of being the oldest.

==Earlier sense==
The claim to be the oldest profession was made on behalf of farmers,&lt;ref&gt;"The farmer, therefore, can boast of being a member of the oldest profession" (Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, Michigan, 1878).&lt;/ref&gt; [[droving|cattle drovers]],&lt;ref&gt;"He reminded his audience that theirs was the very oldest profession in the world" (Bury and Norwich Post, Suffolk, 19 June 1883, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[horticulture|horticulturalists]],&lt;ref&gt;"… certainly we are representatives of the oldest profession of which we have any knowledge" (Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Ohio State Horticultural Society, 1890, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; engineers,&lt;ref&gt;"… we belong to the oldest profession in the world" (The Stevens indicator, vol. 9, 1892, p.167).&lt;/ref&gt; [[landscape gardener]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"I need hardly speak of its antiquity, the oldest profession in the world" (Preston Chronicle, Lancashire, 9 November 1889, p.2.)&lt;/ref&gt; the military,&lt;ref&gt;Speech by Lord Wolseley, Morning Post, 21 December 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; doctors,&lt;ref&gt;''The Clinic: A Weekly Journal of Practical Medicine'', 1875, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; [[nurses]],&lt;ref&gt;''Nursing World'', vols 21–22, 1898, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt; teachers,&lt;ref&gt;''The Ohio Educational Monthly'', vol 57, 1908, p.294.&lt;/ref&gt; [[priests]],&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; and even lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;"A lawyer, then, is a member of the oldest profession extant; for as he lives upon the rottenness of human nature, the first human crime made room for a lawyer"  (Alfred Butler, ''Elphinstone'', vol 1, 1841, p.189).&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the earliest recorded claim to be the world's oldest profession was made on behalf of [[tailors]].  The ''Song in Praise of the Merchant-Taylors'', attested from 1680, which was routinely performed at [[procession|pageants]] at the [[Lord Mayor's Show]], [[London]], if the current mayor happened to belong to the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|
tailors' guild]],&lt;ref&gt;Percy Society, ''Early English Poetry, Ballads and Popular Literature of the Middle Ages'', vol. XIX (London, 1846), p.74.&lt;/ref&gt; began:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;Of all the professions that ever were nam'd,
The taylor's, though slighted, is much to be fam'd':
For various invention, and antiquity,
No trade with the tayler's comparèd may be:
&lt;/poem&gt;
After pointing out that [[Adam and Eve]] made garments for themselves, and were therefore tailors, it continued:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;Then judge if a tayler was not the first trade.
The oldest profession, and they are but raylers,&lt;ref&gt;Bitter deriders or scoffers.&lt;/ref&gt;
Who scoff and deride men that be merchant-taylers.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Acquisition of opprobrious sense==
The phrase began to acquire its opprobrious sense in the last decade of the nineteenth century following [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s short story about an Indian prostitute, ''On the City Wall'' (January 1889).  Kipling, after citing a biblical reference,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua ii. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; began:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world. [[Lilith]] was her very-great-grandmamma, and that was before the days of Eve as every one knows.  In the West, people say rude things about Lalun's profession, and write lectures about it, and distribute the lectures to young persons in order that Morality may be preserved.  In the East where the profession is hereditary, descending from mother to daughter, nobody writes lectures or takes any notice; and that is a distinct proof of the inability of the East to manage its own affairs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a scathing article on the morals of the aristocracy in the mass circulation ''Reynold's Newspaper'', 22 July 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; the reference was repeated:&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ancient Rome, under the empire, ladies used to go to baths to meet a certain class of men, while men resorted thither to meet a certain class of ladies.  The ladies belonged to what has been called “the oldest profession in the world", a profession which is carried on in Piccadilly, Regent street, and other parts of London with great energy every night …&lt;/blockquote&gt;  In the same year the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;12 November 1894, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; reported a speech in which "Mrs. Ormiston Chant … implored us to stand shoulder to shoulder and destroy what Kipling has called 'the oldest profession in the world'".

The phrase was frequently used as a [[euphemism]] when delicacy forbade direct reference to prostitution.

Kipling was not the first to employ the phrase "the most ancient profession" in an opprobrious sense.  The Irish poet [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] (1701–1783) wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''The Works of English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper'', vol 17, p.428.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
Of all trades and arts in repute or possession,
[[Humbug]]ging is held the most ancient profession.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The phrase had also been applied to murderers.  In  ''The Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries'' (1875),&lt;ref&gt;(London, Richard Bentley and Son), vol 2, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles William Heckethorn, describing the [[Thuggee|Thugs]] of India, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[hierophant]], on initiating the candidate, says to him: "Thou hast chosen, my son, the most ancient profession, the most acceptable to the deity.  Thou hast sworn to put to death every human being fate throws into thy hand..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Residual usage of the phrase in its reputable sense==
There is some evidence that unworldly speakers (e.g. of the older generation) or unsophisticated audiences (e.g. in small towns or rural areas) were not at first aware of the phrase's newly acquired meaning.  Thus for some time the following could be said in English newspaper reports without apparent embarrassment: “A certain proportion of the cadets were now leaving to enter the oldest profession in the world” (1895).&lt;ref&gt;(The profession of arms.)  Speech of Lord Wolseley to the Royal Military Academy, ''Morning Post'', 21 December 1895, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; “This gentleman's name often figures high in local prize lists, and he is considered an enthusiast in 'the oldest profession in the world'" (1902).&lt;ref&gt;(Gardener.)  ''Folkestone, Hythe, Sandgate &amp; Cheriton Herald'', 17 May 1902, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  “Mr Petrie heard the voice of God and observed the working of His hand in ways that are denied to most of us.  His speech, and especially his prayers, exhibited a rare consciousness of the beauty of holiness, and were fragrant with phrases of singular charm.  As you all know, Mr Petrie followed the oldest profession in the world” (1915).&lt;ref&gt;(Gardener).  ''Stirling Observer'', 12 November 1915, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, those 'innocent' uses of the phrase tended to die out as awareness of the newly acquired meaning increased; as did the appreciation that antiquity, of itself, did not make a profession respectable.

[[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 12.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Hanged Man (tarot card)|The Hanged Man]] from [[Tarot]] decks is thought to be typical of ''pittura infamante'' frescoes, although none are extant]]

[[File:schandbild.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Germany|German]] ''[[:de:schandbild|schandbild]]'' (circa 1490)]]

'''''Pittura infamante''''' ({{IPA-it|pitˈtuːra imfaˈmante|pron}}; [[Italian language|Italian]] for "defaming portrait"; plural ''pitture infamanti'') is a [[genre]] of [[defamation|defamatory]] [[painting]] and [[relief]], common in [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] in [[city-state]]s in the north and center of the [[Italian Peninsula]] during the [[Trecento]], [[Quattrocento]], and [[Cinquecento]].&lt;ref name="edgerton"/&gt; Popular subjects of ''pittura infamante'' include [[treason|traitors]], [[theft|thieves]], and those guilty of [[bankruptcy]] or public [[fraud]], often in cases where no legal remedy was available. Commissioned by governments of [[city-state]]s and displayed in public centers, ''pittura infamante'' were both a form of "municipal justice" (or "forensic art"&lt;ref name="ed31"&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a medium for internal political struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Wieruszowski, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Samuel Edgerton, the genre began to decline precisely when it came to be regarded as a [[form of art]] rather than [[effigy]]; the power of the genre derived from a feudal-based [[code of honor]], where [[shame]] was one of the most significant [[social punishment]]s.&lt;ref name="edgerton"&gt;Edgerton, 1985. Chapters 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''pittura infamante'' has its roots in the doctrines of ''[[pheme|fama]]'' and ''[[infamia]]'' in ancient [[Roman law]].&lt;ref name="mills38"&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
''Pitture infamanti'' could appear in any public place, but some places were more frequently adorned with them; for example, the first floor exterior of the [[Bargello]] periodically contained numerous, life-size, ''pittura infamante'' [[fresco]]es. Florentine law required the ''[[Podestà]]]'' have such caricatures painted, and accompanied by verbal identification those held in [[contempt of court]] for financial offenses (bad debt, bankruptcy, fraud, forgery, etc.).&lt;ref name="ed2"/&gt; ''Pitture infamanti'' were far more common in [[Republic of Florence|Republican Florence]] than in [[Italian city-states|autocratic city states]], whose rulers often deemed them to be sources of "disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Common themes of ''pittura infamante''&amp;mdash;which were meant to be humiliating&amp;mdash;include depicting the subject as wearing a mitre or hanging upside down, being in the presence of unclean animals such as pigs or donkeys or those deemed evil like snakes; ''pittura infamante'' would also contain captions listing the offenses of the subject.&lt;ref name="dean7"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pittura infamante'' could originate as more favorable depictions, only to be transformed after the subject had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imagery==
''Pittura infamante'' always depicted men and never women, and generally depicted upper class men (who would have the most to lose from [[character assassination]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The act of hanging itself was also significant, as affluent criminals would generally be afforded the privilege of beheading rather than hanging; hanging was also shameful in religious contexts (e.g. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The [[Literary topos|topos]] of ''mundus inversus'' ("world upside down") is often associated with comedy and humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous artists who painted ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes include [[Andrea del Castagno]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Andrea del Sarto]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no surviving examples of ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes, but contemporary sources suggest that they were brightly colored.&lt;ref name="ed31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dean7"/&gt; Detailed descriptions of ''pitture infamanti'' in primary sources are rare.&lt;ref name="dean45"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; A very few preparatory drawings, however, are extant, and [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|The Hanged Man]] from [[Tarot]] cards is thought to resemble the archetypal ''pittura infamante'' theme, as Tarot decks were first produced in northern Italy in the 1440s.&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt;

==Records==
Documentary evidence for ''pittura infamante'' outside Italy is rarer but existent. For example, records support the use of "very unpleasant pictures" painted on cloths during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the reign of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in [[France]], and&amp;mdash;later&amp;mdash;in [[England]] and north [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pitture infamanti'' were the counterpoint of another contemporary form of secular, full-length portrait: ''uomini famosi'' ("famous men") or ''uomini illustri'' ("illustrious men"), which depicted figures from the [[Old Testament]] or [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] in a positive context, generally on the interior of private or civic buildings as moral exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects of ''pittura infamante''==

The '''QEM''' (Models and Methods of Quantitative Economics), also known as ''Erasmus Mundus QEM'', is an [[Erasmus Mundus]] post-graduate [[Master of Economics|Master's degree in Economics]]. The program combines "core economic theory with related quantitative disciplines such as Probability, Statistics, Econometrics, Finance, Actuarial Science, Mathematical Modelling, Computation and Simulation, Experimental Design, and Political Science."

It is offered by a [[consortium]] of four universities: [[Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne]] (co-ordinating institution), [[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona]], [[Universität Bielefeld]], and the [[Università Ca' Foscari Venezia]] with a network of Associated Partners consisting of international academic institutions as well as public and private companies, as aside.

Related degrees include the [[EMLE]]-European Master in Law &amp; Economics and the [http://www.upcomillas.es/emin/ EMIN] - Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Economics and Management of Network Industries.

==Structure==
QEM students are required to study at two of the four participating universities of the Consortium. This [[academic mobility]] enables students to benefit from the diversity in strengths of each university on a wide range of issues, and to meet and work with professionals from various backgrounds. In particular, it provides the students the opportunity to learn and integrate with different European cultures.

Upon successfully completing the programme, students are awarded a QEM Joint Degree from the partners of the consortium. The QEM consortium provides  career assistance to the students, including help with internships and job placement for graduates. The language of instruction is English and the partner universities also provide European language courses for graduates.

==History and Governance==
The Erasmus Mundus QEM was the first [[European Joint Master degree in Economics]]; it was approved by the European Union in 2006.  The QEM is organised and managed by an executive committee, joint graduate committee, and an advisory board. The executive committee meets regularly to define QEM activities and improve on the intra-consortium mobility conditions suggested by [[EACEA]]. These QEM activities are then managed by the joint graduate committee. The advisory board is made up of  professional experts in the field of economics, including [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[Edward C. Prescott]], [[James Mirrlees]] and [[Reinhard Selten]].

'''Runde Environmental Centre''' ({{lang-no|Runde Miljøsenter}}) is a research station at the Norwegian [[island]] of [[Runde]].  The centre has four main activities: a marine station, a house and hub for small spin-off businesses, an information centre, and a conference/overnight centre with 34 hotel-standard rooms in 8 apartment suites. The island of Runde is located in the municipality of [[Herøy, Møre og Romsdal|Herøy]] in [[Møre og Romsdal]] county, [[Norway]].  It is about {{convert|15|km}} north of [[Fosnavåg]]. 

[[File:RundeIslandFixedHorizon.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Runde island]]
==Research Activity==
The marine station is the dominant activity at the Centre. The research activity will be funded by independent project funding, governmental grants, and by contributions from visiting scientists and institutes. The scientific plan (long term monitoring) calls for work to be done in the fields of [[meteorology]], [[oceanography]], [[marine pollution]], [[seabird]] monitoring, [[marine biology]], rocky shore monitoring, and [[renewable energy]], as well as for a survey of [[plankton]], fish, [[sea mammals]], and terrestrial [[flora]].

==Tourist Information==
The tourist information centre for the island is located in the Environmental Centre.

: ''Not to be confused with [[Combined sewer#Combined sewer overflows (CSOs)|combined sewer overflow (CSO)]]''
[[File:Sewer overflow RI EPA.jpg|thumb|right|A [[manhole]] cover unable to contain a sanitary sewer overflow]]
'''Sanitary sewer overflow''' ('''SSO''') is a condition in which untreated [[sewage]] is discharged from a [[sanitary sewer]] into the environment prior to reaching [[sewage treatment]] facilities. When caused by rainfall it is also known as '''wet weather overflow'''. It is primarily meaningful in [[developed countries]], which have extensive treatment facilities. Frequent causes of SSO spills include:

* Blockage of sewer lines
* [[Infiltration/Inflow]] of excessive [[stormwater]] into sewer lines during heavy [[rainfall]]
* Malfunction of [[pumping station]] lifts or electrical [[power failure]]
* Broken sewer lines.

SSOs can cause [[gastrointestinal illness]]es, beach closures and restrictions on fish and shellfish consumption.

==Magnitude of the problem==
Developed countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], most [[Western Europe]]an nations (e.g. [[Italy]] and [[France]]), [[Australia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] are struggling with public health problems of SSO prevention. However, the magnitude of the problem is much greater in most developing countries.

===United States===
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) estimates that at least 23,000 to 75,000 SSO events occur in the United States each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/sanitary-sewer-overflows-ssos |title=Sanitary Sewer Overflows |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-16 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA estimated that upgrading every municipal treatment and collection system to reduce the frequency of overflow events to no more than once every five years would cost about $88 billion as of 2004.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2004 |title=Report to Congress: Impacts and Control of CSOs and SSOs |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2004-npdes-cso-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-833-R-04-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cost would be in addition to approximately $10 billion already invested. Although the volume of untreated sewage discharged to the environment is less than 0.01 percent of all treated sewage in the United States, the total volume amounts to several billion gallons per annum and accounts for thousands of cases of gastrointestinal illness each year.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 6}}

===Worldwide perspective===
Developed European countries and Japan have similar or somewhat larger percentages of SSO events compared to the U.S.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In [[developing countries]], most wastewater is still not treated when discharged into the environment. The [[People's Republic of China]] discharged about 55 percent of all sewage without treatment of any type, as of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"[[World Bank]] Supports China's Wastewater Treatment", ''The People’s Daily'', November 30, 2001, Beijing&lt;/ref&gt; In a relatively developed [[Middle East]]ern country such as [[Iran]], the majority of [[Tehran]]'s population has totally untreated sewage injected to the city’s groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;Massoud Tajrishy and Ahmad Abrishamchi, "Integrated Approach to Water and Wastewater Management for [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]", [[Water Conservation]], Reuse, and Recycling: Proceedings of the Iranian-American Workshop, National Academies Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Venezuela]], a below-average country in [[South America]] with respect to wastewater treatment, 97 percent of the country’s sewage is discharged untreated into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Appropriate Technology for Sewage Pollution Control in the Wider [[Caribbean]] Region, Caribbean Environment Programme Technical Report #40 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries there are obligations to measure and report SSO occurrence using real-time [[telemetry]] to warn the public, bathers and shellfishery operators.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Causes ==
===Engineering aspects===
[[Image:Aparissewer.jpg|thumb|230px|Sanitary sewer line in [[Paris]] more than two meters in diameter.]]
Sewers that were built in the early stages of urbanization were usually built before [[sewage treatment]] was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [[History of water supply and sanitation]].&lt;/ref&gt; Early sewers were simple drainage systems to remove [[surface runoff]] with any waste material it might contain. These drainage systems became [[combined sewers]] when sewage from kitchens, baths, and toilets was added; and the discharge became offensive.  Early sewage treatment plants were built to treat the sewage during dry weather; but it was infeasible to treat the larger volume of mixed sewage and precipitation runoff from combined sewers during wet weather. Sanitary sewers were built to keep sewage from being mixed with surface runoff so the sewage could be efficiently treated during both wet and dry weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Okun |first=Daniel A. |authorlink = |title =Sewage Treatment Plant Design |publisher =[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and Water Pollution Control Federation |volume = |edition = |date =1959 |location = |page =6 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blockages===
Decentralized failures in dry weather mainly occur from collection sewer line blockages, which can arise from a [[debris]] clog or tree root intrusion into the line itself. Approximately half of SSOs in the United States are caused by blockage.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"/&gt;{{rp|p. 4–26}} [[Brown grease|Grease]] is the blocking agent in approximately half of U.S. SSOs attributed to blockage, and solid debris is the blocking agent for another 25 percent. [[Root]]s are a contributing factor in approximately one-quarter of United States SSOs attributed to blockage.  Grease deposits are caused by cooking fats liquified with hot water for discharge to sanitary sewers. These fats congeal as solid deposits in the cooler sewer. Solid debris includes soiled clothing, [[diaper]]s, and [[sanitary napkin]]s flushed down the toilet rather than being put in a waste bin.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"/&gt;{{rp|p. 4–28}}

One of the main problems of a decentralized line failure is the difficulty of defining the location of overflow, since a typical urban system contains thousands of miles of collection pipes, and the central treatment plant has no way of communicating with all the lines, unless expensive monitoring equipment has been installed. Companies in the UK have widely deployed bulk dielectric [[transducer]]s suspended in the sewers to detect high levels and to report the events back over fixed wireless data networks. In certain locations this practice has permitted the reduction of pollution events by up to 60 percent.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Dry weather blockage is less likely within combined sewers; because combined sewers designed for the additional volume of surface runoff are much larger than sanitary sewers. Combined sewer storm water regulators may be vulnerable to blockage by debris, but overflow from such blockage typically enters the diversion [[outfall]] to avoid flooding private or public property.

===Infiltration/inflow===
Approximately one-quarter of United States SSOs occur during heavy [[rainfall]] events, which can cause inflow of [[stormwater]] into sanitary sewers through damage, improper connections, or flooding buildings and [[lift station]]s in low-lying areas of the collection system. The combined flow of sewage and stormwater exceeds the capacity of the sanitary sewer system and sewage is released into homes, businesses and streets.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"/&gt;{{rp|p. 4–26}} This circumstance is most prevalent in older cities whose subsurface infrastructure is quite old; [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Stockholm]],&lt;ref&gt;Monica Spendilow, ''Impeller Magazine'', ITT Flygt AB, SE-174 87 Sundbyberg, Sweden (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City]], [[Washington, DC]], and [[Oakland, California]]&lt;ref&gt;''Environmental Impact Statement for the [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]] Wet Weather Overflow Project'', Earth Metrics Incorporated, prepared for the U.S. EPA and East Bay Municipal Utility District, Oakland, Ca. (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; are typical examples of such locations. Inflow into the sanitary lines can be caused by tree root rupture of subsurface lines or by mechanical fracture due to age and overpressure from trucks and buildings.

===Malfunctions===
Another mode of system failure can include [[power outage]]s, which may disable [[lift station]] pumps and cause sewage overflow from the lift station wet well. Lift station mechanical or power failure causes approximately ten percent of United States SSOs. This type of discharge is uncommon from combined sewers, because the combined volume of sewage and storm water discourages use of lift stations. Broken sewer lines are responsible for approximately ten percent of U.S. SSOs.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"/&gt;{{rp|p. 4–27}}

Power failure, [[human error]], or mechanical failure may cause similar discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage from a sewage treatment plant; but this is typically regarded as a sewage treatment plant malfunction rather than a sanitary sewer overflow. Sewage treatment plants may be designed to capture overflow from malfunctioning units and discharge it to alternative treatment facilities.  Flooding of private or public property is typically avoided by discharging the overflow to an outfall designed for discharge of treated sewage.&lt;ref name="EPA-RTC"/&gt;{{rp|p. ES–3}}

==Human health and ecological consequences==
[[Image:Overflowepa.gif|thumb|230px|Decentralized wet weather overflow event]]

Human health impacts include significant numbers of [[gastrointestinal illness]] each year, although death from one overflow event is uncommon. Additional human impacts include [[beach]] closures, [[human swimming|swimming]] restrictions and prohibition of the consumption of certain aquatic animals (particularly certain [[mollusc]]s) after overflow events. Ecological consequences include [[fish kill]]s, harm to [[plankton]] and other aquatic microflora and microfauna. Turbidity increase and dissolved oxygen decrease in receiving waters can lead to accentuated effects beyond the obvious [[pathogen]]ic induced damage to aquatic [[ecosystem]]s. It is possible that higher life forms such as [[marine mammal]]s can be affected since certain seals and [[sea lion]]s are known to experience peaks in pathogenic harm.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S. P., Jang, S., Gulland, F.M.D., Miller, M., Casper, D., Lawrence, J., Herrera, J., [http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/reprint/39/1/136.pdf "Characterization and clinical manifestations of Arcanobacterium phocae infections in marine mammals stranded along the central California coast"], ''Journal of Wildlife Diseases'', 39:136-144 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation techniques==
The concept of SSO containment valves has been pioneered in the UK and they are installed to mitigate dry spills, by correlating rainfall data with SSO spill activity.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==History==
[[Image:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sewage treatment plant]] used to create the Wonga Wetlands, [[Australia]]]]
Since medieval times rulers have been aware of the impact of raw sewage improperly discharged to the environment. Before treatment systems existed in 16th century [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] decreed that sewage troughs should be kept flowing so that they would not stagnate in [[London]] prior to reaching the [[River Thames]] ([[London sewer system]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In the 19th century, sewage treatment plants were first developed and installed in the U.S. and parts of Europe, and the concept of SSO was identified. However, SSOs were not recognized as a widespread environmental problem until the rise of environmental awareness in the 1960s. Around that time government agencies in the U.S. began identifying locations and frequencies of SSOs in a systematic way. Local governments heard complaints of citizens, and beach closure protocols were systematised to reduce risks to public health.

After passage of the [[Clean Water Act]] in 1972, the U.S. spent billions of dollars on upgrades to sewage treatment plants, with some associated repairs and improvements to the associated collection systems, where the overflows occur. EPA continues to provide funding for low-interest loans to communities for addressing SSO problems, through the [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/sanitary-sewer-overflow-sso-frequent-questions |title=Sanitary Sewer Overflow (SSO) Frequent Questions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s [[Japan]], the [[UK]] and a number of other European countries began earnest investigation of some of their countries’ overflow issues.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The '''Scarborough criterion''' is used for satisfying convergence of a solution while solving [[linear equations]] using an [[iterative method]].

==Introduction==
Analytical solutions for certain systems of equations can be difficult or impossible to obtain. A well known example are the Navier-Stokes equations describing the flow of Newtonian fluids. Solutions of such equations can be obtained [[numerically]], at discrete points of the solution domain (e.g. at discrete time points and points in space). Numerical solutions based on the integration of the equations at discrete control volumes of the solution domain (for example the [[Finite volume method|Finite Volume Method]]) result in a system of algebraic equations, one for each ''nodal point'' (corresponding to a particular control volume). These algebraic equations are usually referred to as ''discretised equations''. The '''Scarborough criterion''' formulated by Scarborough (1958), can be expressed in terms of the values of the coefficients of the discretised equations:&lt;ref name="Scarborough1955"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Blaine Scarborough|title=Numerical Mathematical Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpaVLfzPgfIC|year=1955|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson Education Limited"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henk Kaarle Versteeg|author2=Weeratunge Malalasekera|title=An Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Finite Volume Method|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvBZ-UMpGzIC|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|isbn=978-0-13-127498-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\sum |a_{nb}|}{|a'_{p}|} \begin{cases}
    \leq 1, &amp; \text{at all nodes}\\
    &lt;1, &amp; \text{at one node at least}
  \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
Here {{math|&lt;var&gt;a'&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} is the net coefficient of a random central node ''P'' and the summation in the numerator is taken over all the neighbouring nodes. For a one, two and three-dimensional problem there will be two (east &amp; west), four (east, west, south &amp; north), and six (east, west, south north, top &amp; bottom) neighbours for each node, respectively.

==Comments==
* This is a sufficient condition, not a necessary one. This means that we can get convergence, even if, at times, we violate the criterion.&lt;ref name="Patankar1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suhas Patankar|title=Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5JMYZMX3OVcC&amp;pg=PA64|date=1 January 1980|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-89116-522-4|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The satisfaction of this criterion ensures that the equations will be converged by at least one iterative method.&lt;ref name="Patankar1980"/&gt;

==Gauss–Seidel method==
If Scarborough criterion is not satisfied then [[Gauss–Seidel method|Gauss–Seidel method iterative procedure]] is not guaranteed to converge a solution. This criterion is a sufficient condition,&lt;ref name="Patankar1980"/&gt; not a necessary one. If this criterion is satisfied then it means equation will be converged by at least one [[iterative method]]. The Scarborough criterion is used as a sufficient condition for convergent iterative method.  The [[finite volume method]] uses this criterion for obtaining a convergent solution and implementing [[boundary condition]]s.

==Diagonal dominance==
If the differencing scheme produces coefficients that satisfy the above criterion the resulting matrix of coefficients is [[diagonally dominant]].&lt;ref name="Minkowycz1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. J. Minkowycz|title=Handbook of Numerical Heat Transfer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AUHXswbSbYC|date=28 March 1988|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-83093-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve diagonal dominance we need large values of net coefficient so the linearisation practice of source terms should ensure that ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; is always negative. If this is the case –''S''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; is always positive and adds to ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;. Diagonal dominance is a desirable feature for satisfying the [[bounded poset|boundedness]] criterion. This states that in the absence of sources the internal nodal values of the property ''ф'' should be bounded by its boundary values. Hence in a steady state conduction problem without sources and with boundary temperatures of 500&amp;nbsp;°C and 200&amp;nbsp;°C all interior values of ''T'' should be less than 500&amp;nbsp;°C and greater than 200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Pearson Education Limited"/&gt;

Social work developed in the 19th century, with roots in voluntary philanthropy and [[grassroots organizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/civil-war-reconstruction/charity-organization-societies-1877-1893/|title=Charity Organization Societies: 1877-1893 - Social Welfare History Project|date=February 4, 2013|work=Social Welfare History Project|access-date=December 29, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the act of responding to social needs have existed long before then, primarily from private charities, and religious organizations.

== Definition ==
Social work is a broad profession that intersects with several disciplines. Social work organizations offer the following definitions: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Social work is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility and respect for diversities are central to social work.  Underpinned by theories of social work, social sciences, humanities and indigenous knowledge, social work'' ''engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance wellbeing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ifsw.org/policies/definition-of-social-work/|title=Global Definition of Social Work {{!}} International Federation of Social Workers|website=ifsw.org|language=en-US|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Federation of Social Workers]] &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Social work is a profession concerned with helping individuals, families, groups and communities to enhance their individual and collective well-being. It aims to help people develop their skills and their ability to use their own resources and those of the community to resolve problems. Social work is concerned with individual and personal problems but also with broader social issues such as poverty, unemployment, and domestic violence."  -&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casw-acts.ca/en/what-social-work|title=What is Social Work? {{!}} Canadian Association of Social Workers|website=www.casw-acts.ca|language=en|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Association of Social Workers]]                                                                                                                                  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Social work practice consists of the professional application of social work values, principles, and techniques to one or more of the following ends: helping people obtain tangible services; counseling and psychotherapy with individuals, families, and groups; helping communities or groups provide or improve social and health services; and participating in legislative processes.

==History==
{{Main article|History of social work}}
[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the 19th century.]]
The practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,&lt;ref name="BoiseStateI"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I. Scientific Philanthropy (1860–1900) |work =The Social Work History Station |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/1-1.htm|accessdate = February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the [[Charity Organization Society]] in the mid-19th century, which was founded by [[Helen Bosanquet]] and [[Octavia Hill]] in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155|title=1800s|work=Family Action: About Us|accessdate=November 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718211919/http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians identify COS as the pioneering organization of the [[social theory]] that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation.&lt;ref name="Lymbery" /&gt; COS had its main focus on individual casework. The second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief – 'relief of paupers'. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organization Society. The third consisted of social action – rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby [[poverty reduction|alleviate poverty]]. This approach was developed originally by the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]].&lt;ref name="Lymbery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/9812_039472ch02.pdf|author=Lymbery|title=The History and Development of Social Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and laid the foundation basis for modern social work, both in theory and in practice.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011"&gt;Popple, Philip R. and Leighninger, Leslie. Social Work, Social Welfare, American Society. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional social work originated in [[History of England#Modern England, 18th–19th centuries|19th century England]], and had its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the [[Industrial Revolution]], in particular the societal struggle to deal with the resultant mass urban-based [[poverty]] and its related problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of [[charity (practice)|charity]] work.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011" /&gt;

Other important historical figures that shaped the growth of the social work profession are [[Jane Addams]], who founded the [[Hull House]] in Chicago and won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1931; [[Mary Richmond|Mary Ellen Richmond]], who wrote Social Diagnosis, one of the first social work books to incorporate law, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, and history; and [[William Beveridge]], who created the social welfare state, framing the debate on social work within the context of social welfare prevision.

==Transtheoretical models==
Social work is an interdisciplinary profession, meaning it draws from a number of areas, such as (but not limited to) [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[politics]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[ecology]], [[education]], [[health]], [[law]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[Counseling psychology|counseling]], including [[psychotherapy]]. Field work is a distinctive attribution to social work [[pedagogy]]. This equips the trainee in understanding the theories and models within the field of work. Professional practitioners from multicultural aspects have their roots in this social work [[Immersion journalism|immersion]] engagements from the early 19th century in the western countries. As an example, here are some of the models and theories used within social work practice:{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Profession==
[[Abraham Flexner]] in a 1915 lecture, "Is Social Work a Profession?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924014006617|title=Is social work a profession?|first=Abraham|last=Flexner|date=June 19, 2018|publisher=New York, The New York school of philanthropy|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; delivered at the National Conference on Charities and Corrections, examined the characteristics of a profession with reference to social work. It is not a 'single model', such as that of health, followed by medical professions such as nurses and doctors, but an integrated profession, and the likeness with medical profession is that social work requires a continued study for professional development to retain knowledge and skills that are [[evidence-based practice|evidence-based by practice standards]]. A social work professional's services lead toward the aim of providing beneficial services to individuals, dyads, families, groups, organizations and communities to achieve optimum psychosocial functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers: The Centre for Education &amp; Training | date=2011 | accessdate=November 8, 2016 | url=http://www.tcet.com/assets/pdf/nrc/employment/1-12-11/OCSWSSW.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its seven core functions are described by Popple and Leighninger as:
# Engagement — the social worker must first engage the client in early meetings to promote a collaborative relationship
# Assessment — data must be gathered that will guide and direct a plan of action to help the client
# Planning — negotiate and formulate an action plan
# Implementation — promote resource acquisition and enhance role performance
# Monitoring/Evaluation — on-going documentation through short-term goal attainment of extent to which client is following through

# Graduated Disengagement — seeking to replace the social worker with a naturally occurring resource&lt;ref&gt;Popple &amp; Leighninger, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Six other core values identified by the National Association of Social Workers' (NASW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606100446/http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-06-06|title=Code of Ethics (English and Spanish) – National Association of Social Workers|work=socialworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code of Ethics are:

A historic and defining feature of social work is the profession's focus on individual well-being in a social context and the well-being of society.&lt;ref name="Crisp"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Crisp, B.R.|author2=Beddoe, L.|date=December 2012|title=Promoting Health and Well-being in Social Work Education|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social workers promote [[social justice]] and [[social change]] with and on behalf of clients.&lt;ref name="Stefaroi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefaroi, Petru|date=December 2014|title=Humane &amp; Spiritual Qualities of the Professional in Humanistic Social Work: Humanistic Social Work – The Third Way in Theory and Practice|location=Charleston|publisher=Createspace|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "client" can be an individual, family, group, organization, or community.&lt;ref&gt;NASW, Code of Ethics&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadening scope of the modern social worker's role, some practitioners have in recent years traveled to war-torn countries to provide psychosocial assistance to families and survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Kosovo Family Support Project:Offering Psychosocial Support for Families with Missing Persons |author1=Keough, Mary Ellen  |author2=Samuels, Margaret F. | journal=Social Work |date=October 2004 | volume=49 | issue=4 | pages=587–594 | doi=10.1093/sw/49.4.587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S.|year=2004|title=Banking the poor: Policies to bring low-income Americans into the financial mainstream|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area that social workers are focusing is risk management, risk in social work is taken as Knight in 1921 defined "If you don't even know for sure what will happen, but you know the odds, that is risk and If you don't even know the odds, that is uncertainty." Risk management in social work means minimising the risks while increasing potential benefits for clients by analysing the risks and benefits in duty of care or in decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllida Parsole. Risk assessment in social care and social work. 2001. Jessica Kingsley Publishers.pg. 17+&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, according to the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), a branch of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], professional social workers are the largest group of mental health services providers. There are more clinically trained social workers—over 200,000—than psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses combined. Federal law and the National Institutes of Health recognize social work as one of five core mental health professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Association of Social Workers |url=http://www.socialworkers.org/ |work=NASW |accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of fields a social worker may be employed in are [[poverty relief]], [[life skills|life skills education]], [[community development]], [[rural development]], [[forensics]] and [[corrections]], [[legislation]], [[industrial relations]], [[project management]], [[child protection]], [[elder abuse|elder protection]], [[women's rights]], [[human rights]], [[systems theory|systems optimization]], [[Financial social work|finance]], [[drug rehabilitation|addictions rehabilitation]], [[child development]], [[Cross-cultural psychology|cross-cultural mediation]], [[occupational safety and health]], [[disaster management]], [[mental health]], [[psychosocial|psychosocial therapy]], [[disabilities]], etc.

==Qualifications==
[[File:Czythumbur.jpg|thumbnail|252x252px|right|Social Work training begins in a structured manner at higher educational institutions (universities and colleges), coupled with or followed by practical internships and externships.]]
The education of social workers begins with a bachelor's degree (BA, BSc, BSSW, BSW, etc.) or diploma in social work or a [[Bachelor of Social Services]]. Some countries offer postgraduate degrees in social work, such as a master's degree (MSW, MSSW, MSS, MSSA, MA, MSc, MRes, MPhil.) or doctoral studies (PhD and DSW (Doctor of Social Work)). Increasingly, graduates of social work programs pursue post-masters and post-doctoral study, including training in psychotherapy.

In the United States, social work undergraduate and master's programs are accredited by the [[Council on Social Work Education]]. A CSWE-accredited degree is required for one to become a state-licensed social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/careers/how-to-become-a-licensed-clinical-social-worker.html|title=How to Become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW)|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-dsw/|title=Online Doctorate of Social Work (DSW) Programs|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSWE even accredits online master's in social work programs in traditional and advanced standing options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-schools.html|title=Online MSW Programs: 2018's Full List of CSWE Accredited Schools|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, the New York [[Charity Organization Society]], which was the [[Columbia University School of Social Work]]'s earliest entity, began offering formal "social philanthropy" courses, marking both the beginning date for social work education in the United States, as well as the launching of professional social work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2vnns1wL8wC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=history+of+columbia+university+school+of+social+work+first&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OKcgdIAK4S&amp;sig=ELBKCq_wU25ep2y0EYXYBo92vsg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigxZC1obDYAhVDRN8KHTjhC74Q6AEIXjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20columbia%20university%20school%20of%20social%20work%20first&amp;f=false|title=The Columbia University School of Social Work: A Centennial Celebration|last=Feldman|first=Ronald A.|last2=Kamerman|first2=Sheila B.|date=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231122825|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of countries and jurisdictions require [[Licensure|registration]] or [[licensure]] of people working as social workers, and there are mandated [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[National Association of Social Workers]] (NASW, 2005). NASW Fact Sheet. Retrieved November 15, 2006 from http://www.socialworkers.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, a professional association sets academic requirements for admission to the profession. The success of these professional bodies' efforts is demonstrated in that these same requirements are recognized by employers as necessary for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cswna.org|title=Catholic Social Workers National Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional associations===
Social workers have a number of professional associations that provide ethical guidance and other forms of support for their members and for social work in general. These associations may be international, continental, semi-continental, national, or regional. The main international associations are the [[International Federation of Social Workers]] (IFSW) and the [[International Association of Schools of Social Work]] (IASSW).

The largest professional social work association in the United States is the [[National Association of Social Workers]]. There also exist organizations that represent clinical social workers such as The American Association of Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work. AAPCSW is a national organization representing social workers who practice psychoanalytic social work and psychonalysis. There are also a number of states with Clinical Social Work Societies which represent all social workers who conduct psychotherapy from a variety of theoretical frameworks with families, groups and individuals.  The Association for Community Organization and Social Administration (ACOSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Association for Community Organization and Social Administration|url = http://www.acosa.org/joomla/|website = www.acosa.org|accessdate = October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a professional organization for social workers who practice within the community organizing, policy, and political spheres.

In the UK, the professional association is the [[British Association of Social Workers]] (BASW) with just over 18,000 members (as of August 2015).

The Code of Ethics of the US-based [[National Association of Social Workers]] provides a code for daily conduct and a set of principles rooted in 6 core values:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NASW Delegate Assembly|first=|date=1996|title=Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=ms_ArtLqzeI%3d&amp;portalid=0|journal=National Association of Social Workers|volume=2017 revision|pages=|via=socialworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siedlecki|first=Karen L.|last2=Salthouse|first2=Timothy A.|last3=Oishi|first3=Shigehiro|last4=Jeswani|first4=Sheena|date=2014-06-01|title=The Relationship Between Social Support and Subjective Well-Being Across Age |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=117|issue=2|pages=561–576|doi=10.1007/s11205-013-0361-4 |pmc=4102493|pmid=25045200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade unions representing social workers===
In the United Kingdom, just over half of social workers are employed by local authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Contemporary_History_of_Social_Work.html?id=MCyGoAEACAAJ|title=A contemporary history of social work: Learning from the past|last=Terry|first=Bamford|date=February 25, 2015|publisher=Policy Press: University of Bristol|year=2015|isbn=9781447322184|location=Bristol, United Kingdom|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of these are represented by [[UNISON]], the public sector employee union. Smaller numbers are members of the [[Unite the Union]] and the [[GMB (trade union)]]. The [[British Union of Social Work Employees]] (BUSWE) has been a section of the [[Community (trade union)]] since 2008.

While at that stage not a union, the [[British Association of Social Workers]] operated a professional advice and representation service from the early 1990s. Social Work qualified staff who are also experienced in employment law and industrial relations provide the kind of representation you would expect from a trade union in the event of grievance, discipline or conduct matters specifically in respect of professional conduct or practice. However, this service depended on the good will of employers to allow the representatives to be present at these meetings, as only trade unions have the legal right and entitlement of representation in the workplace.

By 2011 several councils had realized that they did not have to permit BASW access, and those that were challenged by skilled professional representation of their staff were withdrawing permission. For this reason BASW once again took up trade union status by forming its arms length trade union section, SWU (Social Workers Union). This gives legal right to represent its members whether the employer or [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) recognizes SWU or not.  At 2015 the TUC was still resisting SWU application for admission to congress membership and while most employers are not making formal statements of recognition until such a time as the TUC may change its policy, they are all legally required to permit SWU (BASW) representation at internal discipline hearings etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4402">{{about|the approach to teaching law}}

'''Street Law''' (also known as ''StreetLaw'') is a global program of legal and civics education geared at secondary school students.  Street Law is an approach to teaching practical law to grassroots populations using interactive teaching methodologies.  Elements of practical law taught include awareness of human rights/civil rights, democratic principles, conflict resolution, the advocacy process, criminal and civil law, employment law, family law, and consumer rights.

==History==

The Street Law approach began in 1972 when [[Georgetown University Law Center]] developed a program that sent law students into high schools in Washington, DC to teach practical law lessons to high school students. Street Law, Inc., an outgrowth of the Georgetown program, develops and implements practical law education programs around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.georgetown.edu/news/street-law-clinic-celebrates-40-years-in-operation.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Street Law, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Its main offices are located in Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.

==Organizational structure==

Although Street Law traces its founding to Georgetown Law, it has spread to many law schools globally.  Neither Georgetown Law nor Street Law, Inc. exercise vertical or indirect control over local Street Law programs.  Within U.S. law schools, Street Law is typically run as a [[legal clinic]] or experiential learning module, where law students receive law school academic credit for participation.  At other law schools, Street Law is run as a [[student organization]] or as an extracurricular activity, typically under direct faculty supervision.

==Pedagogical methodology==

One core Street Law module is a teaching program wherein law students are sent into community schools to teach high school students age appropriate lessons in the law.  Within the U.S., this means that second and third year law students are paired with secondary school classes where they regularly teach courses on law and legal subjects.  There is significant autonomy and differentiation in the way that Street Law is taught nationally in the U.S. and globally, and Street Law expressly encourages law schools and law students to experiment with different teaching methodologies to account for different learning styles depending on age, culture, regional and state differences, and so on.

Other Street Law approaches include: teaching Legal Life Skills to underserved populations; Teacher Professional Development courses; partnerships with the legal community (both law firm and corporate) to teach about the law and legal careers to secondary students; teaching about rule of law, democracy and civil rights to populations in countries outside of the US; and publishing teaching resources.

==Teaching resources==

Among other publications, [[McGraw-Hill]] has published a high school social studies textbook using this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Street Law: A Course in Practical Law|last1=Arbetman|first1=Lee|last2=O'Brien|first2=Edward L.|publisher=Glencoe/McGraw-Hill|year=2016|isbn=9780021429257|edition=9th|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McGraw-Hill]] has also published a high school government textbook co-authored by Street Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Remy, Ph.D.|first1=Richard C.|last2=Ritchie, Ph.D.|first2=Donald A.|last3=Arbetman, M.Ed., J.D.|first3=Lee|last4=Hanson, M.S.|first4=Hanson|last5=Morreale Scott, Ed.M.|first5=Lena|title=United States Government: Our Democracy|date=2018|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780076681136|edition=1st|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McGraw-Hill]] also publishes ''Street Law: Understanding Law and Legal Issues'', an informative law-based, civic learning text for use in the community college program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arbetman|first1=Lee|last2=O'Brien,|first2=Edward|title=Street Law: Understanding Law and Legal Issues|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780076624058|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of their best known products is the [[Feeldoe]] dildo, which is a harness-less [[strap-on dildo]]. At ANME 2000 Tantus was the first company to introduce silicone toys to mainstream adult store buyers.

Kris Victor and Metis Black co-founded Tantus in 1998. Metis Black became sole owner in 2008, at which time they broadened their offerings to include some of the first Silicone products for men, including the first silicone cockrings and slings.

Metis Black has gone on to write several articles on sexual health and plastics, the chemistry of lubricants and has been featured on articles about green sex toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2007/11/08/violetblue.DTL|title=As concerns grow about toxic sex toys, Violet Blue explores potential consumer health risks|publisher=sfgate.com|accessdate=2008-03-16|last=|first=|date=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19333870/page/2/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3943">A '''toxicophore''' is a [[chemical]] structure or a portion of a structure (e.g., a [[functional group]]) that is related to the toxic properties of a chemical. Toxicophores can act directly (e.g., [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]]) or can require [[Drug metabolism|metabolic]] activation (e.g., [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines]]).

Most toxic substances exert their [[toxicity]] through some interaction (e.g., [[covalent bond]]ing, [[oxidation]]) with cellular [[macromolecule]]s like [[protein]]s or [[DNA]]. This interaction leads to changes in the normal cellular [[biochemistry]] and [[physiology]] and downstream toxic effects.
Occasionally, the toxicophore requires [[Biological activity|bioactivation]], mediated by [[enzyme]]s, to produce a more reactive metabolite that is more toxic. For example, [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines]] are activated by [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes to form a more reactive substance that can covalently bind to DNA, causing mutations that, if not [[DNA repair|repaired]], can lead to cancer. Generally, different chemical compounds that contain the same toxicophore elicit similar toxic effects at the same site of toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[medicinal chemistry|Medicinal chemists]] and [[structural biology|structural biologists]] study toxicophores in order to predict (and hopefully avoid) potentially toxic compounds early in the drug development process.

'''Typesetting''' is the composition of [[Written language|text]] by means of arranging physical [[Sort (typesetting)|types]]&lt;ref name="typesetting random house dictionary definition"&gt;Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 23 December 2009. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/typeset Dictionary.reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called [[sort (typesetting)|sorts]] in mechanical systems and [[glyphs]] in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered according to a language's [[orthography]] for visual display. Typesetting requires one or more [[font]]s (which are widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for [[typeface]]s). One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily, making it difficult for copiers who have not gained permission.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A., ''The Library: An Illustrated History'', ALA edition, Skyhorse, 2009, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-digital era==

===Manual typesetting===
{{Main|Movable type}}
During much of the [[Letterpress printing|letterpress era]], movable type was composed by hand for each [[page (paper)|page]]. Cast metal ''[[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]]'' were composed into words, then lines, then paragraphs, then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a ''form'', with all letter faces exactly the same "height to paper", creating an even surface of type. The form was placed in a press, inked, and an impression made on paper.

During typesetting, individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand, and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right, and as viewed by the setter upside down. As seen in the photo of the composing stick, a lower case 'q' looks like a 'd', a lower case 'b' looks like a 'p', a lower case 'p' looks like a 'b' and a lower case 'd' looks like a 'q'. This is reputed to be the origin of the expression "mind your p's and q's". It might just as easily have been "mind your b's and d's".

The diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort: '''a''' face, '''b''' body or shank, '''c''' point size, '''1''' shoulder, '''2''' nick, '''3''' groove, '''4''' foot. Wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type. Not shown, and more the concern of the casterman, is the “set”, or width of each sort. Set width, like body size, is measured in points.

In order to extend the working life of type, and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type, copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text, freeing the costly type for other work. This was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press. In this process, called [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotyping]], the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as [[plaster of Paris]] or [[papier mâché]] called a [[flong]] to create a positive, from which the stereotype form was electrotyped, cast of [[type metal]].

Advances such as the [[typewriter]] and [[computer]] would push the state of the art even farther ahead. Still, hand composition and [[letterpress]] printing have not fallen completely out of use, and since the introduction of digital typesetting, it has seen a revival as an [[artisanal]] pursuit. However, it is a very small niche within the larger typesetting market.

===Hot metal typesetting===
{{main|Hot metal typesetting}}
The time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the 19th century to produce mechanical typesetting. While some, such as the [[Paige compositor]], met with limited success, by the end of the 19th century, several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text. Most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used, hence are termed "hot metal" typesetting. The [[Linotype machine]], invented in 1884, used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices, and cast an entire line of type at a time (hence its name). In the [[Monotype System]], a keyboard was used to [[Punched tape|punch a paper tape]], which was then fed to control a casting machine. The [[Ludlow Typograph]] involved hand-set matrices, but otherwise used hot metal. By the early 20th century, the various systems were nearly universal in large newspapers and publishing houses.

===Phototypesetting===
{{Main|Phototypesetting}}
[[Image:Linotype CRTronic 360.jpg|thumb|200px|Linotype CRTronic 360 phototypesetting terminal]]
[[Phototypesetting|Phototypesetting or "cold type"]] systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines. These devices consisted of glass or film disks or strips (one per font) that spun in front of a light source to selectively expose characters onto light-sensitive paper. Originally they were driven by pre-punched paper tapes. Later they were connected to computer front ends.

One of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display. To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time. If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a [[punched tape|punched paper tape]] corresponding to the text. With the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative [[film]]. Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film, resulting in a column of black type on white paper, or a [[Galley proof|galley]].  The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or [[paste up]] of a whole page.  A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make [[Printing plate|plate]]s for [[offset printing]].

==Digital era==
[[File:Door toename automatisering in krantenbedrijf verdwijnt het oude zettersvak Weeknummer, 77-14 - Open Beelden - 13160.ogv|thumb|Dutch newsreel from 1977 about the transition to computer typesetting]]
The next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a [[cathode ray tube]]. Typical of the type were the Alphanumeric APS2 (1963),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6a2tSuOoq8C&amp;pg=PA351 Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology], 1976&lt;/ref&gt; IBM 2680 (1967), [[Information International, Inc.|I.I.I.]] VideoComp (1973?), Autologic APS5 (1975),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6a2tSuOoq8C&amp;pg=PA352 Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; and Linotron 202 (1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linotype.com/en/49-14026/19731989.html Linotype History]&lt;/ref&gt; These machines were the mainstay of phototypesetting for much of the 1970s and 1980s. Such machines could be "driven online" by a computer front-end system or took their data from magnetic tape. Type fonts were stored digitally on conventional magnetic disk drives.

&lt;/ref&gt; Character-by-character, computer-aided [[phototypesetting]] was, in turn, rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a [[raster image processor]] to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] an entire page to a single high-resolution [[digital image]], now known as imagesetting.

The first commercially successful laser imagesetter, able to make use of a raster image processor was the Monotype Lasercomp. ECRM, [[Compugraphic]] (later purchased by [[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa]]) and others rapidly followed suit with machines of their own.

Early [[minicomputer]]-based typesetting software introduced in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as [[Datalogics]] Pager, Penta, [[Atex (software)|Atex]], Miles 33, Xyvision, troff from [[Bell Labs]], and IBM's [[IBM SCRIPT|Script]] product with CRT terminals, were better able to drive these electromechanical devices, and used text [[markup language]]s to describe [[typeface|type]] and other page formatting information. The descendants of these text markup languages include [[SGML]], [[XML]] and [[HTML]].

The minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste-up and eventually produced entire pages and [[signature]]s of 4, 8, 16 or more pages using [[imposition]] software on devices such as the Israeli-made [[Scitex]] Dolev. The data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters, often proprietary or specific to a manufacturer or device, drove development of generalized printer control languages, such as [[Adobe Systems]]' [[PostScript]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[Printer Command Language|PCL]].

[[Image:Oscar wilde english renaissance of art 2.png|thumb|right|200px|Text sample (an extract of the essay ''The Renaissance of English Art'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]) typeset in [[Iowan Old Style]] roman, italics and small caps, adjusted to approximately 10 [[Line length|words per line]], with the typeface sized at 14 [[point (typography)|points]] on 1.4 x [[leading]], with 0.2 points extra [[tracking (typography)|tracking]].]]

Computerized typesetting was so rare that ''[[BYTE]]'' (comparing itself to "the proverbial shoemaker's children who went barefoot") did not use any computers in production until its August 1979 issue used a Compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout. The magazine did not yet accept articles on floppy disks, but hoped to do so "as matters progress".&lt;ref name="helmers197908"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Helmers |first=Carl |date=August 1979 |title=Notes on the Appearance of BYTE... |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1979-08/1979_08_BYTE_04-08_LISP#page/n157/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1980s, practically all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was performed by specialist typesetting companies. These companies performed keyboarding, editing and production of paper or film output, and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry. In the United States, these companies were located in rural Pennsylvania, New England or the Midwest, where labor was cheap and paper was produced nearby, but still within a few hours' travel time of the major publishing centers.

In 1985, [[desktop publishing]] became available, starting with the [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] (and later [[QuarkXPress]]) and [[PostScript]]. Improvements in software and hardware, and rapidly lowering costs, popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results much less expensively than the minicomputer dedicated systems. At the same time, word processing systems, such as [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] and [[WordPerfect]], revolutionized office documents. They did not, however, have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complicated book layout, graphics, mathematics, or advanced hyphenation and justification rules (''H and J'').

By the year 2000, this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in-house computers. Many found the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to outsource to freelancers and graphic design specialists.

The availability of cheap or free [[font]]s made the conversion to do-it-yourself easier, but also opened up a gap between skilled designers and amateurs. The advent of [[PostScript]], supplemented by the [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file format, provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts, readable on major computers and operating systems.

===SCRIPT variants===
{{Main|SCRIPT (markup)}}
[[Image:John A Prior Health Sciences Library Mural Typesetter.jpg|thumb|Mural mosaic "Typesetter" at John A. Prior Health Sciences Library in Ohio]]
IBM created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word "SCRIPT". Later versions of SCRIPT included advanced features, such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index, [[Column (typography)|multicolumn]] page layout, footnotes, boxes, automatic hyphenation and spelling verification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.utk.edu/~mnewman/ibmguide07.html U01-0547, "Introduction to SCRIPT,"] is available through PRTDOC.&lt;/ref&gt;

NSCRIPT was a port of SCRIPT to OS and TSO from CP-67/CMS SCRIPT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/sdtp/watscr.html SCRIPT 90.1 Implementation Guide], June 6, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterloo Script was created at the University of Waterloo later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/sdtp/watscr.html CSG.uwaterloo.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; One version of SCRIPT was created at MIT and the AA/CS at UW took over project development in 1974. The program was first used at UW in 1975. In the 1970s, SCRIPT was the only practical way to word process and format documents using a computer. By the late 1980s, the SCRIPT system had been extended to incorporate various upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/40th/Chronology/1974.shtml A Chronology of Computing at The University of Waterloo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial implementation of SCRIPT at UW was documented in the May 1975 issue of the Computing Centre Newsletter, which noted some the advantages of using SCRIPT:

a) It easily handles footnotes.

b) Page numbers can be in Arabic or Roman numerals, and can appear at the top or bottom of the page, in the centre, on the left or on the right, or on the left for even-numbered pages and on the right for odd-numbered pages.

c) Underscoring or overstriking can be made a function of SCRIPT, thus uncomplicating editor functions.

d) SCRIPT files are regular OS datasets or CMS files.

e) Output can be obtained on the printer, or at the terminal…" 
The article also pointed out SCRIPT had over 100 commands to assist in formatting documents, though 8 to 10 of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs.  Thus, SCRIPT had many of the capabilities computer users generally associate with contemporary word processors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/40th/Chronology/ChronologyGlossary.pdf Glossary of University of Waterloo Computing Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SCRIPT/VS]] was a SCRIPT variant developed at IBM in the 1980s.

DWScript is a version of SCRIPT for MS-DOS, called after its author, D. D. Williams,&lt;ref&gt;DWScript – Document Composition Facility for the IBM Personal Computer Version 4.6 Updates, DW-04167, Nov 8th, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; but was never released to the public and only used internally by IBM.

Script is still available from IBM as part of the [[Document Composition Facility]] for the [[z/OS]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/printsoftware/dcfhome_z_ww.html IBM Document Composition Facility (DCF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===SGML and XML systems===
The standard generalized markup language ([[SGML]]) was based upon IBM [[Generalized Markup Language]] (GML). GML was a set of macros on top of IBM Script. [[Document Style Semantics and Specification Language|DSSSL]] is an international standard developed to provide a stylesheets for SGML documents.

[[XML]] is a successor of SGML. [[XSL Formatting Objects|XSL-FO]] is most often used to generate PDF files from XML files.

The arrival of [[SGML]]/[[XML]] as the document model made other typesetting engines popular.

Such engines include Datalogics Pager, Penta, Miles 33's OASYS, Xyvision's [[XML Professional Publisher (XPP)]], [[FrameMaker]], [[Arbortext]]. XSL-FO compatible engines include [[Apache FOP]], [[Antenna House Formatter]], [[RenderX]]'s [[XEP (software)|XEP]].
These products allow users to program their SGML/XML typesetting process with the help of scripting languages.

YesLogic's [[Prince XML|Prince]] is another one, which is based on CSS Paged Media.

===Troff and successors===
{{Main|Troff}}
During the mid-1970s, [[Joseph Ossanna]], working at [[Bell Laboratories]], wrote the troff typesetting program to drive a Wang C/A/T [[phototypesetter]] owned by the Labs; it was later enhanced by [[Brian Kernighan]] to support output to different equipment, such as [[laser printer]]s. While its use has fallen off, it is still included with a number of [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and has been used to typeset a number of high-profile technical and computer books. Some versions, as well as a [[GNU]] work-alike called [[groff (software)|groff]], are now [[open source]].

===TeX and LaTeX===
[[Image:AMS Euler sample.png|right|200px|thumb|Mathematical text typeset using TeX and the AMS [[Euler font]].]]
{{Main|TeX}}
The [[TeX]] system, developed by [[Donald E. Knuth]] at the end of the 1970s, is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system that has set high standards, especially for typesetting mathematics. [[LuaTeX]] and LuaLaTeX are variants of [[TeX]] and of [[LaTeX]] scriptable in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].  TeX is considered fairly difficult to learn on its own, and deals more with appearance than structure. The [[LaTeX]] macro package written by [[Leslie Lamport]] at the beginning of the 1980s offered a simpler interface, and an easier way to systematically encode the structure of a document. LaTeX markup is very widely used in academic circles for published papers and even books. Although standard TeX does not provide an interface of any sort, there are programs that do. These programs include [[Scientific Workplace]], [[Texmacs|TeXmacs]], [[MiKTeX]] and [[LyX]], which are graphical/interactive editors.

==Other text formatters==
Several other text formatting software exist, but are not widely used. Notably  [[Lout (software)|Lout]], [http://patoline.org/ Patoline], [http://sile-typesetter.org Sile], [https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/ Pollen], [http://mirror.hmc.edu/ctan/systems/ant/ Ant]

The '''University of Georgia Marine Institute''' ('''UGAMI''') is a nearshore [[ecological]] and [[geological]] research station located on [[Sapelo Island]] off the coast of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the [[United States]].  This island lies between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and a pristine salt marsh.  A ferry takes passengers from [[Meridian, Georgia|Meridian]] (between [[Darien, Georgia|Darien]] and [[Crescent, Georgia|Crescent]]) to Sapelo Island. The Island has fewer than 100 full-time residents. The Institute was created in 1953 and is currently a unit of the University of Georgia's Office of Research. The Institute is 280 miles southeast of the [[University of Georgia]]'s main campus in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]].  UGAMI is world-renowned for its research on coastal marine and estuarine ecosystems.

== Education ==
UGAMI offers life-changing experiences for undergraduate and graduate students. Approximately 600-700 university students train at UGAMI each year. The essence of the UGAMI student experience is characterized by: Immersion, Mentorship, and Engagement. Students experience complete immersion in field-based academic studies,close mentorship by faculty who are experts in their fields of study, and engagement in a supportive community of scholars.

UGAMI does not have any stand-alone degree programs. However, it provides many training and research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. UGAMI offers undergraduate classes, provides research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students, and is a field trip destination for university classes from all over the country. Classes visiting UGAMI on field trips usually stay 2-5 days, but some stay longer.  UGA offers full-credit courses that take place entirely at the Marine Institute. As many of these classes take place during the summer, they attract students from many colleges and universities.  Undergraduates in UGAMI's residential courses live and work alongside the Institute's faculty and graduate student researchers, while taking courses in topics such as marine sciences, ecology, and coastal geography. In addition, graduate students from many different institutions conduct thesis research at UGAMI for periods ranging from a few days to a few years.

== Research ==
[[File:Research Aboard the RV Spartina.jpg|thumb|Students and faculty making physical and biological measurements aboard the University of Georgia Marine Institute's research vessel, Spartina.]]
The field of saltmarsh ecology, and many of the foundational concepts in ecosystem ecology, were created at UGAMI by scientists such as [[Eugene Odum]] and John Teal. Today, UGAMI is still at the forefront of coastal and estuarine research. The flagship research project at UGAMI is the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems-Long-Term Ecological Research Program (GCE LTER). The GCE LTER is part of the [[National Science Foundation's]] Long Term Ecological Research Network, which consists of 28 research sites around North America and Antarctica. The GCE LTER was established by the National Science Foundation in 2000 and it is the largest ecological research project on the Southeast Coast.  The Georgia coast will experience many changes in the coming decades because of sea level rise, climate change, and human modification. GCE LTER is studying the estuary ecosystem to learn how it responds to these perturbations, and to better predict future changes to the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER|url = https://gce-lter.marsci.uga.edu/|website = gce-lter.marsci.uga.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UGAMI is used for both long-term and short-term research projects, conducted by scientists from many institutions. The field research conducted at UGAMI results in the publication of approximately 50 peer-reviewed scientific papers each year.

Long-term researchers generally maintain semi-permanent housing, offices, and laboratories and have students and technicians stationed at the Marine Institute for months at a time. Short-term researchers generally stay in the Marine Institute's apartments and dormitory, and use the visitor labs. Although most of the visiting scientists come from the U.S., UGAMI also hosts international researchers.

The greatest assets that UGAMI offers visiting scientists are:
-Access – UGAMI offers access to protected barrier island habitats, including some of the most expansive and relatively undisturbed salt marshes along the U.S. eastern seaboard;
-Data – Researchers can build on long-term monitoring data, together with the results from numerous directed studies; and
-Community – UGAMI serves as a focal point that fosters connections among scholars from multiple institutions and fields of study.

The '''World Forestry Center''' is a nonprofit educational institution in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].  Located near the [[Oregon Zoo]] in [[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]], the organization was established in 1964{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} as the '''Western Forestry Center''', with the actual building opening in 1971.&lt;ref name="center opens"&gt;"New forestry center opens" (June 6, 1971).

The day after the fire, a group of civic and industry leaders conceived The Western Forestry Center.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} A new, more fire-resistant forestry building designed by Oregon architect [[John Storrs (architect)|John Storrs]] was built in Washington Park.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} It opened to the public on June 5, 1971.&lt;ref name="center opens"/&gt;  The name was changed to "World Forestry Center" in 1986 to reflect the center's revised focus on forestry on a global scale.&lt;ref name="wfchist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="new name"&gt;Hill, Alma (January 4, 1986).

==Programs==
The World Forestry Center's mission is to "educate and inform people about the world's forests and trees, and their importance to all life, in order to promote a balanced and [[sustainability|sustainable]] future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The center achieves its mission with three programs: the Discovery Museum, two donated working forests—the Magness Memorial Tree Farm and the Johnson-Swanson Tree Farm—and the World Forest Institute which was established in 1989. The primary program is the International Fellowship Program.

In 1989, the World Forestry Center established the World Forest Institute to meet a growing demand for forestry information.  As the forestry sector becomes increasingly complex, there is a greater need for international collaboration and exchange of information on forest trade, regulation, management, and forest resources. The World Forest Institute was created through the vision and support of [[Harry Merlo|Harry A. Merlo]], a pioneer of the forest products industry, and an early visionary of the globalization of the forestry sector.

[[File:World Forestry Center.jpg|thumb|left|The forestry center in 2016]]
The fellowship program brings young forestry and forest products professionals from around the world to work at the World Forest Institute for 6 to 12 months.  Fellows are commonly sponsored by their employer, government institutions, the forest industry, or an NGO, and carry out applied research projects of interest to their sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2009/03/world_forestry_program_sends_a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to completing a practical research project, the program works to get Fellows a broad exposure to natural resource management in the U.S. so that when they return to their home countries they have a basic understanding of the owners and managers of land and natural resources throughout the country.

The institute won the 2012 Portland Mayor's International Business Award from the Oregon Consular Corps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFAaHSSvLro&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://portland4biz.com/portland-international-business-awards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/05/in_downtown_portland_awards_an.html&lt;/ref&gt; This award recognizes businesses that contribute to a global environment in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portlandonline.com/mayor/?c=51108&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Forestry Center campus also accommodates three other buildings: Julian N. Cheatham Hall, Harold A. Miller Hall and Harry A. Merlo Hall, which houses the administrative offices and the World Forest Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Zofia Potocka''' née ''Clavone'' ({{lang-uk|Софія Костянтинівна Потоцька}}; 11 January 1760 – 24 November 1822) was a Greek slave courtesan and a Russian agent, later a Polish noble. She was famous in contemporary Europe for her beauty and adventurous life. During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)]], she was the lover of the Russian commander prince [[Grigory Potemkin]] and acted as an agent in Russian service.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore (2006). Potemkin och Katarina den stora – en kejserliga förbindelse (Potemkin: Catherine the Great's Imperial Partner) (in Swedish). prisma. {{ISBN|9789151844978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Compatriots of her time wrote: "She was beautiful as a dream, a child of southern countries. All those who have seen her admire her beauty, igniting a fire in the hearts of men and envy in the eyes of women."

==Life==
===Early life===
Potocka was born in 1760 January 1 (January 11, New Style) in the Turkish city of [[Bursa]] to Constantine Clavone, a poor Greek cattle merchant, and Maria Clavone. In 1772, when Zofia was 12 years old, she moved to the Greek district of [[Phanar]] in [[Constantinople]] with her parents and sisters. 

Around 1775, when Zofia was 15 years old, her father Constantine died under mysterious circumstances. Her mother married an Armenian, who also died. During the great fire in Constantinople, their house burned down. In this difficult time for them, her mother Maria sought support from foreign embassies. 

In May 1777, when Zofia was not yet 17 years old, Maria sold her two daughters to the Polish Ambassador, [[Boskamp Lyasopolskomu]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The ambassador was known to procure girls for the Polish king.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Learning about their supposed noble origin and seeing the beauty of the girls, the Ambassador agreed to help. The sister were claimed to descent from the noble aristocratic family Pantalisa Mavrokordato, who stemmed from the royal family of Greece and was related by blood to the rulers of Byzantium. 

Zofia and her sister settled in his palace and was given lessons in French. Reportedly, the ambassador kept her as his mistress for a time, and then prostituted her.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Boskamp-Lyasopolsky arranged for her sister to be sold as a wife to a Turkish Pasha,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; but he promised her mother to arrange marriage for Zofia in Europe. 

The Polish Count Major [[Józef Witt]] learned the purpose of the trip and her ancient lineage. He made an offer, bought her from Boskamp-Lyasopolsky and married her in 1779.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 
Józef Witt was the son of the commandant of the fortress Kamianetska, and the couple lived a year in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], before departing for Europe in 1781.

===Europe===
Zofia reportedly made a sensational success when being introduced to the aristocracy by her spouse in the drawing room receptions of Europe in the palaces of Berlin and Hamburg, Vienna, Rome, Venice and, most famously, in Paris. She was celebrated as "The most beautiful woman in Europe" and known for her expression: "My eyes aches".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
Her beauty and admired ability to improvise herself out of difficult situations resulted in an admiration and love affairs with several of the most powerful personalities of Europe at the time, which attracted a lot of attention. She was regarded as fashionable decoration at every party in high society in the cities they visited and was courted by monarchs and ministers. 
  
At the beginning of their European tour, the couple visited Warsaw. In early March 1781, she was called to court to be introduced to King Stanislas Augustus. After Warsaw, they visited Berlin, where Zofia was introduced to the King of Prussia Frederick II. In the resort town of Spa, Zofia was introduced to the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, who was reportedly so fascinated and impressed by her that he ordered [[Mozart]] to compose music on the Turkish harem theme. 
In one of his letters to his sister, the French queen Marie Antoinette, Joseph II recommended the Witte couple to her. 

Zofia saw [[Marie Antoinette]] at [[Petit Trianon]], which at that time was being rebuilt in a landscaped park. This was possibly what Zofia was inspired to create a similar park. Reportedly, Marie Antoinette was charmed by her and spoke of her as her adopted daughter. During her stay in Paris, Zofia became the lover of both of the French king's brothers; the Count of Provence, later King Louis XVIII, and the Comte d'Artois, the future French king Charles X respectively.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  

On November 17, 1781 Zofia gave birth in Paris to a son. When this news reached the Polish king, she personally visited Kamianets and congratulated her father-in-law Josef Witt with the birth of a grandson, promoted him to the rank of Lieutenant General and volunteered to be the godfather of the newborn. 

===Russia===
In 1782, the couple returned to Kamianets visiting Vienna, Moravia, Slovakia and Galicia on the way. In 1785, her spouse Joseph Witte succeeded his father as commandant of Kamianets-Podilskyi, making Zofia first lady of Podolia. 

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)]], she entered a relationship with the Russian Prince Potemkin, the commander of Catherine the Great, which lasted until his death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; At least during the [[Battle of Khotyn (1788)|Siege of Khotyn]], her spouse managed Potemkin's net of agents in Southern Poland and his spy contacts within Chotin: in practice, however, these contacts were likely managed by, or at least with the assistance of Zofia, whose elder sister was married to the Turkish pasha of Chotin.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Potemkin appointed her spouse governor of [[Kherson|Cherson]], and gave Zofia the informal task of managing the Turkish-Polish relations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 1791, she accompanied Potemkin to Saint Petersburg, where she was introduced to the nobility as his official mistress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Later life===
In February 1796, Zofia arrived in Uman and announced her divorce from Jozef De Witte. In April 17, 1798, in Tulchin, she remarried [[Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki]], who had divorced his wife in order to marry her. The wedding ceremony was conducted with the participation of the Orthodox priest and Catholic priest in an Orthodox Church. 

During her second marriage, Zofia had three sons; Alexander (born in 1798), Mieczyslaw (born in 1800) and Boleslaw (born in 1805), and two daughters; Sophia, and [[Olga Potocka|Olga]] (1802-1861). During the marriage, she also had an affair with her stepson, [[Szczęsny Jerzy Potocki]], who may have been the biological father of her son Boleslaw.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; She also had an affair with the Russian governor, [[Nikolai Novosiltsov]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki indulged in mysticism and came under the influence of Polish "Illuminati" and died in March 15, 1805, without having time to say goodbye to her. 
As a widow, she was by law only entitled to her [[dowry]] and a small portion of the fortune of her late spouse, which would have had a bad effect on her economy as she had brought no dowry to the marriage; however, she managed to inherit almost all of the fortune of her late spouse with the assistance of her stepson and the Russian governor, both of whom were her lovers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

As a widow, Zofia reportedly occupied herself with the upbringing of her children and charitable activities. Looking back on her time in Russia, she described Potemkin as a brother.

===Death===
In the early 1820s, she experienced a deteriorated health. Reportedly, the mysticism of the Polish Illuminati was suspected to have affected her health. She left for [[Berlin]] to consult German doctors, where she died. 

She left instructions to be buried Uman. Zofia's embalmed body was clothed in a beautiful dress and placed in a carriage, in one hand a bouquet and in the other a fan. Her body was transported in such a way across the border. In Uman, an elaborate funeral ceremony was conducted out of respect pfor the charity of her last years. When the Zofia's coffin was carried 10 miles along the road, barrels of resin were placed for lighting torches, lighting the way as the procession passed the night before a huge crowd. 

Zofia was buried in the crypt under the Basilian church. In 1877, the body was disturbed as the church was badly damaged by an earthquake. Zofia's remains were reburied in [[Talne]] with those of her youngest daughter Olga, where they still rest in the crypt of the church.

Zofia Potocka died in on 24 November 1822, aged 62.
