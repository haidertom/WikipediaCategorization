[[File:The Peacock Room - The Princess from the Land of Porcelain.png|thumb|250px|''[[The Peacock Room]]'', originally designed by [[Thomas Jeckyll]] (1873-76), then repainted and with added murals by [[James McNeill Whistler]] (1876–77), [[Freer Gallery]], Washington, D.C.]]
The '''Anglo-Japanese ''' style developed in the period from approximately 1851 to 1900, when a new appreciation for [[Japan]]ese design and [[Culture of Japan|culture]] affected the [[English art|art]], especially the [[Decorative arts|decorative art]], and [[Architecture of England|architecture]] of [[England]]. The first use of the term "Anglo-Japanese" occurs in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Widar Halen. ''Christopher Dresser''1990, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The wider interest in Eastern or Oriental design and culture is regarded as a characteristic of the [[Aesthetic Movement]] during the same period.

==History==
The Museum of Ornamental Art, later the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], bought Japanese lacquer and porcelain in 1852, and again in 1854 with the purchase of 37 items from the exhibition at the Old Water-Colour Society, London. Japanese art was exhibited at London in 1851, Dublin in 1853; Edinburgh 1856 and 1857; Manchester in 1857, and Bristol in 1861. The 1862 International Exhibition in London had a Japanese display which has been considered 'one of the most influential events in the history of Japanese art in the West.'&lt;ref&gt;Widar Halen. ''Christopher Dresser.'' 1990, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] introduced the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter and poet [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] to Japanese art, thus establishing a veritable cult of Japan within this Bohemian circle. By the 1880s, the style had become a major influence on the art and decoration of the time, leaving its mark on Whistler's paintings and designs (principally ''[[The Peacock Room]]'').  The style developed in advance of the British [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] (the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society was formed as late as 1887), but both are best regarded as branches from the mainstream [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic Movement]].

===Interior design===
In the design of furniture, the most common and characteristic features are simple rectilinear structure, minimal decoration, often limited to incised and gilt lines or motifs such as 'mons', and most particularly an [[ebonized]] finish (or even ebony) echoing the well known 'japanned' finish. Halen (p.&amp;nbsp;69) proposes an ebonized chair exhibited at the 1862 International Exhibition by A.F. Bornemann &amp; Co of Bath, and described (and possibly designed) by Dresser as the ''quaint and unique Japanese character'', to be the first documented piece of furniture in the Anglo-Japanese style. The types of furniture required in England such as wardrobes, [[sideboard]]s and even dining-tables and easy-chairs did not have a Japanese precedent therefore Japanese principles and motifs had to be adapted to existing types in order to meet English requirements.

In much the same way as with Anglo-Japanese furniture, early examples of Japanese influence and inspiration in ceramics were noted by Dresser in his reviews of the International Exhibition, London 1862, where he remarked on Minton's 'vases enriched with Chinese or Japanese ornament'.&lt;ref&gt;Halen. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1870s, the Watcombe [[pottery]] in Devon produced unglazed [[terracotta]] wares, some of which rely entirely on Japanese forms and the natural colour of the clay for their ornamental effect. Japanese inspired porcelains by the Worcester factory at a similar date were much admired by the Japanese themselves. The pottery produced at the Linthorpe factory founded in 1879 closely followed Japanese examples in simple forms and especially in rich glaze effects quite revolutionary in the English market. In commercial mass-produced table wares, the style was most represented by transfer prints depicting Japanese botanical or animal motifs such as bamboos, and birds; scenes of Japan or Japanese objects such as fans. Often these were placed in a novel asymmetrical fashion in defiance of Western tradition.
Glass ware was also influenced by Japanese art and the 'Frog decanter' exhibited by Thomas Webb at the International Exhibition in Paris 1867 is in its subject, simplicity and asymmetry the earliest example of Japanese influence on English glass identified to date.

The style anticipated the minimalism of 20th-century Modernism. British designers working in  this style include [[Christopher Dresser]]; [[Edward William Godwin]]; [[James Lamb (furniture manufacturer)|James Lamb]]; and perhaps [[Philip Webb]]; and the decorative arts wall painting of James Abbott McNeill Whistler. In the United States some of the glass and silverwork by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], textiles and wallpaper by [[Candace Wheeler]], and the furniture of [[Kimbel and Cabus]], [[Daniel Pabst]], [[Nimura and Sato]], and the [[Herter Brothers]] (particularly that produced after 1870) shows influence of the Anglo-Japanese style.

[[Oscar Wilde]] reported and commented upon the progress of the style, referring to "the influence which Eastern art is having on us in Europe, and the fascination of all Japanese work" in a lecture he gave in the United States in 1882 (''The English Renaissance of Art'').

{{Norwegian-people}}
The '''architecture of Norway''' has evolved in response to changing economic conditions, technological advances, demographic fluctuations and cultural shifts. While outside architectural influences are apparent in much of Norwegian architecture, they have often been adapted to meet Norwegian climatic conditions, including: harsh winters, high winds and, in coastal areas, salt spray.

Norway's architectural trends are also seen to parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the [[Viking Age]], wooden structures developed into a sophisticated craft evident in the elegant and effective construction of the Viking [[longship]]s. Following that, the ascent of Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed [[arch]]es, [[barrel vault]]s, [[cruciform]] [[pier (architecture)|piers]] supporting [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], and [[groin vault]]s; in large part as a result of religious influence from [[England]].

During the Middle Ages, the geography dictated a [[Economy of Norway|dispersed economy]] and [[Demographics of Norway|population]]. As a result, the traditional [[Norwegian farm culture]] remained strong, and Norway differed from most European countries in never adopting [[feudalism]]. This, combined with the ready availability of wood as a building material, ensured that relatively few examples of the [[Baroque]], [[Renaissance]], and [[Rococo]] architecture styles so often built by the ruling classes elsewhere in Europe, were constructed in Norway.

Instead, these factors resulted in distinctive traditions in Norwegian [[vernacular architecture]], which have been preserved in existing farms in the many Norwegian open-air museums that showcase buildings from the [[Middle Ages]] through to the 19th century; prominent examples include the [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Norsk Folkemuseum]] in [[Oslo]] and [[Maihaugen]] in [[Lillehammer]], as well as extant buildings still in service on farms such as those in the [[Heidal]] valley.

In the 20th century, Norwegian architecture has been characterized by its connection with Norwegian social policy on the one hand, and innovation on the other. Norwegian architects have been recognized for their work, both within Norway—where architecture has been considered an expression of social policy—and outside Norway, in several innovative projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.norway.org.uk/history/royalvisit/news2610/riba.htm |title=The Queen promotes Norwegian architecture at the Royal Institute of British Architects |accessdate=2008-03-14 |last= |first= |date= 2005-10-27 |work= |publisher= Royal Norwegian embassy in London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.norway-egypt.org/culture/architecture/alexandria/alexandria.htm |title=Library in Alexandria |accessdate=2008-03-14 |last= |first= |work= |publisher= Royal Norwegian embassy in Cairo |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222005240/http://www.norway-egypt.org/culture/architecture/alexandria/alexandria.htm |archivedate = December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==History==
Construction in Norway has always been characterized by the need to shelter people, animals, and property from harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, heavy precipitation in certain areas, wind and storms; and to make the most of scarce building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely had to rely on locally available materials.

===Pre-historic times===
The earliest traces of human habitation in Norway are dated to about 9000 BC, in mountainous regions near [[Store Myrvatn]] in contemporary [[Rogaland]], where excavations have found portable dwellings most likely kept by nomadic reindeer hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.museum.no/fagomraader/Forsk-oppgaver06/SBA-1.htm |title=Sveinung Bang-Andersen: The main project: The Myrvatn/Fløyrlivatn Group: Early Mesolithic pioneers in the interior of southwest Norway |publisher=Museum of Archeology in Stavanger |author=Sveinung Bang-Andersen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221213553/http://www.ark.museum.no/fagomraader/Forsk-oppgaver06/SBA-1.htm |archivedate=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of such tents have also been found other places along the western coast; at Fosenstraumen near [[Radøy]] in [[Hordaland]] archeological evidence indicates that tents in use at about 6500 BC were of similar design to those still in use by the [[Sami people|Sami]] nomads&lt;ref name="arkhistorie"&gt;Brekke, Nordhagen, and Lexau: Norsk arkitekturhistorie. Frå steinalder og bronsealder til det 21. århundret. {{ISBN|82-521-5748-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, such tents became semi-permanent through the introduction of a simple foundation. Traces of these can be found at the [[Vega, Norway|Vega]] archipelago, an area that is now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.verdensarvvega.no/english.htm |title= Vega Islands as World Heritage|accessdate= 2008-03-14 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= Vega Archipelago Foundation |pages= |doi= |archivedate= 2007-11-28|archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20071128154025/http://www.verdensarvvega.no/english.htm|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first permanent dwellings were probably built between 3000 and 2000 BC, with the introduction of agriculture to Norway. Available evidence indicates that wood was the most used building material for these structures. [[Iron Age]] dwellings typically combined shelter for animals and humans in [[long house]]s in order to preserve heat. Remains of structures from the [[Stone Age]] through the [[Nordic Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] and the Iron Age have been excavated at [[Forsand]] in [[Ryfylke]], near [[Stavanger]] and several other locations. Most prehistoric long houses had pairs of roof-bearing posts dividing the interior into three naves, and walls of palisades, wattle and daub or turf. Similar buildings have been excavated all over Northwestern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortidslandsbyen.no/ |title=Fortidslandsbyen Landa |accessdate=2008-03-14 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |doi= |quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403192141/http://www.fortidslandsbyen.no/ |archivedate=3 April 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viking and medieval eras===
Two distinctive timber building traditions found their confluence in Norwegian architecture. One was the practice of [[log cabin|log building]] with horizontal logs notched at the corners, a technique thought to have been imported from the peoples to the east of Scandinavia. The other was the [[stave building]] tradition (typically found in [[stave church]]es), possibly based on improvements on the prehistoric long houses that had roof-bearing posts dug into the ground. Although there is scant archaeological evidence of actual buildings from the earliest permanent structures, finds of Viking ships (e.g., the [[Oseberg ship]]) suggest significant mastery of woodworking and engineering. In the [[Lofoten]] archipelago in [[Northern Norway]], a Viking chieftain's holding has been reconstructed at the [[Lofotr Viking Museum]].&lt;ref name="Seip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odin.dep.no/odin/engelsk/norway/history/032005-990451/index-dok000-b-n-a.html|title=Elisabeth Seip: Architecture in Norway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khm.uio.no/utstillinger/oseberg/indexE.html |title=Oseberg find site |publisher=[[University of Oslo]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615063416/http://www.khm.uio.no/utstillinger/oseberg/indexE.html |archivedate=2006-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lofotr.no/engelsk/index.htm|title=Lofotr museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not counting the 28 remaining stave churches, at least 250 wooden houses predating the [[Black Death]] in 1350 are preserved more or less intact in Norway. Most of these are log houses, some with added stave-built galleries or porches.&lt;ref name="Seip"/&gt;

As the political power in Norway was consolidated and had to contend with external threats, larger structures were built in accordance with military technology at the time. Fortresses, bridges, and ultimately churches and manors were built with stone and masonry. These structures followed the European styles of their time.

====Stave churches====
{{Main|Stave church}}
[[File:Stave church Urnes, exterior view 1.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Urnes stave church]] in [[Luster, Norway]], listed as a [[world Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]]]
Possibly more than 1000 stave churches were built in Norway during the Middle Ages, most of them during the 12th and 13th centuries. Until the beginning of the 19th century, as many as 150 stave churches still existed. Many were destroyed as part of a religious movement that favored simple, puritan lines, and today only 28 remain, though a large number were documented and recorded by measured drawings before they were demolished.

The stave churches owe their longevity to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most important was the introduction of massive ''sills'' underneath the ''staves'' (posts) to prevent them from rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.

====Romanesque architecture====
[[File:Bergen mariakirken2 edit.jpg|alt=Stone  Romanesque church with two  towers and a  lower, pitched roof entrance hall between them. The towers have slightly curved  bronze roofs.| thumb|upright|left|[[St Mary's Church, Bergen|St Mary's Church]] in Bergen, an example of Romanesque architecture in Norway.]]
The first stone churches in Norway were Romanesque, built under the influence of [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]aries, particularly bishop [[Pope Adrian IV|Nicholas Breakspear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katolsk.no/www/about_en.htm|title=Catholic Church of Norway: The History of the Catholic Church in Norway|publisher=Catholic Church of Norway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later churches were influenced by Continental architecture. Examples include the churches at [[Ringsaker]], [[Kviteseid]], and elsewhere. Many of these churches have either been lost or rebuilt in the Gothic style, but numerous examples still exist, notably the Trondenes Churchat Trondenesin [[Troms]].

====Gothic architecture====
Several churches that were originally built as Romanesque structures were modified or extended during the Gothic period. Among these are the cathedral of [[Hamar]], now in ruins, the [[Stavanger Cathedral]], and the renowned [[Nidaros Cathedral]], one of the most important pilgrim destinations in medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nidarosdomen.no/english/nidaroscathedral/ |title=About the Nidaros Cathedral |publisher=Nidaros Cathedral |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707214217/http://www.nidarosdomen.no/english/nidaroscathedral/ |archivedate=2006-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NidarosdomenPanorama.jpg|alt=A Romanesque church with Gothic pointed arches. Two rectangular towers separated by a pitched roof entrance hall.

===Under Danish rule===
{{See also|Denmark-Norway}}
In the late Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was severely weakened. In 1389 Norway entered into a personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the [[Kalmar Union]]. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] most of its separate institutions were abolished. The Danish government in [[Copenhagen]] regarded Norway as a backward province to be exploited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/history/upto1814/unionden/unionden.htm|title=Norway in the United States|author=|date=|website=Norgesportalen|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not worthy of investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious [[Renaissance architecture]] is unusual in Norway compared to other European countries.

Fortresses, such as [[Akershus Fortress|Akershus]] in [[Oslo]], [[Vardøhus Fortress|Vardøhus]] in [[Vardø]], [[Tønsberg Fortress|Tønsberghus]] in [[Tønsberg]], the [[Kongsgården]] in [[Trondheim]] and [[Bergenhus Fortress|Bergenhus]] with the [[Bergenhus Fortress|Rosenkrantz Tower]] in [[Bergen]] were built in stone in accordance with standards for defensive fortifications of their time. Many of these were modernized and rebuilt through the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statsbygg.no/aapentrom/arkiv/nr3_2005/11.html |title=Rosenkrantztårnet: To tårn for prisen av ett |author=Morten Ryen |work=Åpent rom |year=2005 |publisher=[[Statsbygg]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714093018/http://www.statsbygg.no/aapentrom/arkiv/nr3_2005/11.html |archivedate=2006-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Guthorm Kavli]]: Norges festninger : fra Fredriksten til Vardøhus, 1987. Oslo, Universitetsforlaget, {{ISBN|82-00-18430-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hanseatic League]] also built unique commercial buildings at [[Bryggen]] in Bergen, starting in the 16th century. They were log buildings combining native and [[Architecture of Germany|German]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturskolesekken.no/institusjonsside.asp?ID=41|title=Overview of Schøtstuene on the Hansa wharf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019105215/http://www.kulturskolesekken.no/institusjonsside.asp?ID=41|archivedate=2006-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First floor are small shops.|center|thumb|800px|Panoramic view of [[Bryggen]]. The eleven houses to the right were rebuilt after a fire in 1702. The six houses to the left were rebuilt after a fire in 1955.]]

====Renaissance architecture====
After the [[Black Death]], monumental construction in Norway came to a standstill, except for vernacular building, only to be resumed in the 16th and 17th centuries under Danish administration.&lt;ref name=Seip/&gt; There are few examples of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Norway, the most prominent being the [[Bergenhus Fortress|Rosenkrantz Tower]] in Bergen, [[Barony Rosendal]] in [[Hardanger]], and the contemporary [[Austrått|Austråt]] manor near [[Trondheim]], and parts of Akershus Fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Kristel Christensen: ''Baroniet Rosendal'' major thesis at [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Håkon A. Andersen: ''Austrått'', 1996 {{ISBN|82-90502-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] undertook a number of projects in Norway that were largely based on [[Renaissance architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;Joakim A. Skovgaard: A king's architecture : Christian IV and his buildings, London, 1973 {{ISBN|0-238-78979-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He established mining operations in [[Kongsberg]] and [[Røros]], now a [[World Heritage Site]]. After a devastating fire in 1624, the town of Oslo was moved to a new location and rebuilt as a fortified city with an orthogonal layout surrounded by ramparts, and renamed [[Oslo|Christiania]]. King Christian also founded the trading city of [[Kristiansand]], naming it after himself.

====Baroque architecture====
[[Image:Fredriksten fortress Norway seen from Halden harbor.jpg|alt=Modest buildings  along the water's edge are guarded by a fortress on the hill above.|left|thumb|[[Halden|Fredrikshald]] / [[Fredriksten]], a border town built to protect the Dano-Norwegian realm]]
As Norway became a strategic part of the Danish-Norwegian kingdom, Danish kings built fortifications along borders and the seacoast. Over time, many of the fortifications at border areas and ports were modernized in line with Baroque military practice.

Although most residences were built according to local vernacular traditions, some manors (such as Austråt and Rosendal) exhibit the influence of [[Baroque architecture]]. Only the city of Christiania ([[Oslo]]) had a building code that prohibited wooden houses, and a number of large town houses modeled after Continental building types were constructed. Some large churches were constructed with brick walls, notably in Bergen, Christiania, Røros&lt;ref&gt;Sverre Ødegaard: Bergstaden Røros, 1997 {{ISBN|82-91399-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kongsberg.&lt;ref&gt;Gunvor Thingstad Bøen, Hølje Bøen: Kongsberg kirke : bergstadens juvel, 2003, {{ISBN|82-91399-23-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most famous Baroque structure in Norway is [[Stiftsgården]], the Royal residence in [[Trondheim]], a residential building that is one of the largest wooden structure in Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statsbygg.no/aapentrom/arkiv/nr1_2002/artikler/trondheim1.html |title=Statsbygg article on Stiftsgården |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714100532/http://www.statsbygg.no/aapentrom/arkiv/nr1_2002/artikler/trondheim1.html |archivedate=2006-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rococo architecture====

[[Rococo]] provided a brief but significant interlude in Norway, appearing primarily in the decorative arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft of decorative painting, ''[[rosemaling]]'', and related [[wood carving]] style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, [[Damsgård Manor]] in Bergen being the most significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bymuseet.no/?vis=82|title=Bergen City Museum site on Damsgård}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In towns and central country districts during the 18th century, log walls were increasingly covered by weatherboards, a fashion made possible by [[sawmill]] technology. These buildings were better insulated and better protected against the harsh climate. But the main reason for the rapid adoption of this custom was the more fashionable appearance of boarded walls, which were more suitable than bare log walls as a background to details and ornaments borrowed from classical architecture.

===19th century===
The [[Napoleonic Wars]] led to the separation of Norway and Denmark. Norway was restored in 1814 as an autonomous kingdom in a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union with Sweden]]. The two states had separate institutions, except for the king and the foreign service. Regained statehood required new public buildings, mainly in the capital of Christiania. During the following century, the country experienced an impressive growth in wealth and population, resulting in a need for new infrastructure and buildings.

====Neo-classicism====
[[File:Det kongelige slott 2 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|The Royal Palace at Oslo, an example of neo-Classical architecture in Norway]]
At the dawn of the 19th century, less than a handful of academically trained architects were active in Norway, most of them military officers having studied civil engineering. The market for architects was limited in a sparsely inhabited country with no capital city, no court and no important government institutions. Architecture was of interest mainly to a limited group of wealthy merchants and landowners. However, toward the close of the previous century, this group saw a remarkable increase in prosperity. Large fortunes were made by a few, who then sought to surround themselves with buildings and gardens appropriate to their social position. Well connected internationally, these people were acquainted with the latest trends in architecture. [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] structures were much in demand.

Architect [[Carl Frederik Stanley]] (1769–1805), educated in [[Copenhagen]], spent some years in Norway around the turn of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major achievement was the renovation of the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the [[Oslo Cathedral School|Oslo Katedralskole]], completed in 1800. He added a classical [[portico]] to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Norsk Folkemuseum]] as a national monument.

[[Christian Collett]] (1771–1833), a graduate of the Mining Academy at [[Kongsberg]], designed the splendid [[Ulefoss]] manor, built between 1802 and 1807 by sawmill owner [[Niels Aall]]. This is one of the few brick houses in Norway, boasting a [[Palladian architecture|palladian]] layout, a central [[cupola]], and a classical [[colonnade]]. Collett designed several other manors and town houses.

The same period saw the erection of a large number of splendid neo-classisist houses in and around all towns along the coast, notably in [[Halden]], [[Oslo]], [[Drammen]], [[Arendal]], [[Bergen]] and [[Trondheim]], mainly wooden buildings dressed up as stone architecture. By far the largest private house in Norway is the [[Jarlsberg manor]], renovated 1812-1814 by the Danish architect Løser for count [[Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg|Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg]].

Christiania, promoted to the status of a capital city in 1814, had practically no buildings suitable for the many new government institutions. An ambitious building program was initiated, but realised very slowly because of a strained economy. The first major undertaking was the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]], designed by [[Hans Linstow]] and built between 1824 and 1848. Linstow also planned [[Karl Johans gate]], the avenue connecting the Palace and the city, with a monumental square halfway to be surrounded by buildings for the University, the Parliament (''[[Parliament of Norway|Storting]]'') and other institutions. But only the University buildings were realised according to this plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tux1.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/d147382.htm Det nye Slottet] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719045637/http://tux1.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/d147382.htm |date=2012-07-19 }} by [[Thomas Thiis-Evensen]], in [[Aftenposten]], June 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian Heinrich Grosch]], one of the first fully educated architects in Norway, designed the original building for the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] (1826–1828), the local branch of [[Norges Bank|the Bank of Norway]] (1828), [[Christiania Theatre]] (1836–1837), and the first campus for the [[University of Oslo]] (1841–1856).&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Seip (ed.) ; Jens Christian Eldal, [[Anne-Lise Seip]], Åse Moe Torvanger: ''Chr. H. Grosch : arkitekten som ga form til det nye Norge'' {{ISBN|82-92238-01-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the University buildings, he sought the assistance of the renowned German architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].&lt;ref name="Aslaksby"&gt;Aslaksby, Truls and Ulf Hamran: ''Arkitektene Christian Heinrich Grosch og Karl Friedrich Schinkel og byggingen av Det kongelige Frederiks Universitet i Christiania'' 1986, {{ISBN|82-90359-32-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German architectural influence persisted in Norway, and many wooden buildings followed the principles of Neoclassicism.

====Romanticism and historicism====
[[File:Trefoldighetskirken.JPG|alt=Large, fanciful building with towers, pointed arches, and a large dome in the center, topped by a spire.|thumb|left|[[Trefoldighetskirken (Oslo)|Trefoldighetskirken]] in Oslo]]
[[Norwegian romantic nationalism]] also had an influence on Norwegian architecture from around 1840. Following the German lead, many classicist architects designed red-brick buildings in a revival of medieval styles. Romanesque and Gothic examples were considered eminently suitable for churches, public institutions and factories. Linstow was the first Norwegian architect to be inspired by the Middle Ages in his proposal of 1837 for a square to be surrounded by public building, bisected by an avenue between Christiania and the new Royal Palace. On the north side, planned buildings for the University were to be "composed in some Medieval or Florentine style", with exposed brick-work.&lt;ref name="Aslaksby"/&gt; His classicist colleague Grosch was the first to convert to historicism and realize a number of red-brick buildings, after his 1838 visit to [[Berlin]], where he met the famous architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. The first major historicist work by Grosch was the neo-romanesque ''Bazaars'' and the adjacent firestation near the [[Oslo Cathedral]], begun in 1840 and extended in several stages until 1859. Other architects followed, notably [[Heinrich Ernst Schirmer]] with the ''Botsfengselet'' (penitentiary) (1844–1851), the [[Gaustad Hospital]] (1844–1855) and the [[Train station|Railway Station]] (1854) (with ''von Hanno''). Also in Oslo, the German architect [[Alexis de Chateauneuf]] (1799-1853) designed [[Trinity Church (Oslo)|Trefoldighetskirken]], the first neo-gothic church, completed by ''von Hanno'' in 1858.

Most urban apartment buildings and villas continued to be built in the classical tradition, with plastered brick walls. The repertoire of historic styles was expanded in [[Homansbyen]], Oslo's first residential development of detached villas, planned by [[Georg Andreas Bull]]. He designed most of the early villas built from 1858 until 1862 in a variety of styles, ranging from medieval to classicist and exotic.

[[File:Dalen Hotel-2011.jpg|alt=Large half-timbered building with sprawling wings, and an oriental-looking structure on the roof.|thumb|[[Dalen Hotel]], a good example of the so-called "dragon style"]]
From around 1840, architects started to design wooden buildings in a new style, the so-called [[Swiss chalet style]]&lt;!--(''sveitserstil'')--&gt;.&lt;ref name=Eldal&gt;Jens Christian Eldal: ''Historisme i tre: "sveitserstil", byggeskikks-romantikk og nasjonal egenart i europeisk og norsk trearkitektur på 1800-tallet'' 1998. Scandinavian University Press. {{ISBN|82-00-12982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the style may more correctly be termed ''historicism in wood'', a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings were built in this style, characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this style popular and to keep it alive in the vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects.

The Swiss chalet style evolved into a Scandinavian variation, known in Norway as the "[[Dragestil|dragon style]]”, which combined motifs from Viking and medieval art with vernacular elements from the more recent past. The most renowned practitioner of this style was the architect [[Holm Hansen Munthe]], who designed a number of tourist resorts, exhibition pavilions and churches in the 1880s and 1890s. These caught the eye of the German emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who visited Norway annually. He commissioned Munthe to design his "Matrosenstation" near [[Potsdam]] and a hunting lodge with at "stave church" in [[Krasnolesye|Rominten]] in [[East Prussia]]. These last buildings were destroyed during World War II.

Architects abandoned both the "Swiss" and the "dragon" styles shortly after 1900, but elements of the "Swiss style" survived in vernacular buildings for some decades. In the recent past, producers of pre-fabricated family homes have increasingly reintroduced motifs from the "Swiss" style in their repertoire.

===Vernacular Architecture===
{{Main|Vernacular architecture in Norway}}

[[Image:Tronderlaane in Oppdal Norway.jpg|thumb|Trønderlåne - example of vernacular architecture typically found in Trøndelag]]
Until the 20th century, most Norwegians lived and worked in buildings that were designed and built according to [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] building traditions, what in Norwegian is known as ''byggeskikk''. These practices varied somewhat by region and climatic conditions and evolved over time, but were largely based on use of wood and other locally available resources.&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Anker: Norsk folkekunst : kunsthåndverk og byggeskikk i det gamle bondesamfunnet . 2004. Oslo. Cappelen. {{ISBN|82-02-23839-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Middle Ages, most dwellings were log houses with notched corners, carefully crafted to ensure protection against the elements. Centrally placed open-hearth fires with smoke vents in the roofs gave way to stone stoves and chimneys in early modern times. Specialized buildings became commonplace, organized around farmyards or ''gårdstun''. The introduction of exterior boarding (weatherboarding) in the 18th century improved housing standards considerably and gave rise to larger houses.

Building practices along the coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people were typically built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (''våningshus''), hay barn (''låve''), livestock barn (''fjøs''), one or more food storage houses (''stabbur''), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (''eldhus'') and [[Forge|smithies]] were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.

In [[Eastern Norway|Eastern inland Norway]] and [[Trøndelag]], the houses around a tun were typically organized in a square (''firkanttun''); in [[Gudbrandsdal]], there was a distinction between ''inntun'' (inner tun) and ''uttun'' (outer tun). The configuration of houses also depended on whether the farm was situated on a hill or in flatter terrain.

Depending upon the size and economic well-being of the farm, there might also be a feast hall (''oppstue''), a house for the retired farmers (''føderådstue''), farm hands' dormitory (drengstue), carriage house (''vognskjul''), and even distillery (''brenneskur''). Smaller, poorer farms might combine barns and dwelling houses, have simpler storage areas, and use the facilities of other farms for activities they could not afford to build houses for.

Building traditions varied by region and type of structure. Food storage houses - stabbur - were usually built on stilts in ways that made it difficult for mice and rats, but not cats, to get in. Exterior cladding varied by region, often to take into account local climate conditions. Roofs were often covered with [[birch]] bark and [[sod]].

Many places in Norway farms also maintained mountain farms (''[[Transhumance|seter]]/støl''), where cows, goats, and sheep would put out to pasture during the summer months. These would typically include a small dwelling house and a dairy for making and storing cheese, sour cream, etc.

Modern Norwegian farms often maintain many building traditions but no longer need the many and varied buildings of the past. However, many of the traditions have been carried on in more recently built vacation cabins in the mountains and along the coast.

===20th-century architecture===
The German influence brought into Norway by [[Nordic Classicism|neo-classicism]] abated when Norway [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|gained full independence]] in 1905. A new generation of Norwegian architects educated in Sweden took the lead in developing a distinctly national architecture, endeavouring to break the German historicist tradition. However, German modernism and town planning continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in [[Trondheim]], there also emerged a distinctly [[List of Norwegian architects|Norwegian collegium of architects]] that has contributed to a Norwegian regional architecture, discussed by the art historian [[Sigfried Giedeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meamnet.polimi.it/archive/037/037&amp;nbsp;m1.html|title=MEAM Net article on Christian Norberg-Schulz}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Art nouveau architecture====
[[File:Jugendstilsenteret.jpg|alt=Ornate stone three-storied building encompassing a street corner, with a windowed turret and topped by a spiral.|thumb|right|upright|Jugendstilsenteret - The Jugendstil Centre in Ålesund]]
The ''[[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]]'', a variant of [[Art Nouveau]], had a certain influence on much of the new construction in Norway around the turn of the 20th century. The city of [[Ålesund]], after [[Ålesund Fire|burning]] to the ground in 1904, was rebuilt almost entirely in this style and continues to be a prominent example, along with [[Riga]] and [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;Harald Grytten et al.: ''Fugl Føniks: Ålesund opp av asken'' 2004. {{ISBN|82-91024-08-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trondheim]] also has numerous art nouveau buildings. In the capital Oslo, few art nouveau buildings were erected, due to a local economic crisis and a stagnant building trade during the first decade of the century. However, some public buildings were constructed in this style, such as the [[Historisk Museum|Historical Museum]] and the [[Regjeringsbygningen|Government office building]]. In Bergen, the main theatre [[Den Nationale Scene]] is a monumental example.

====Mass residential architecture====
Changing demographics and a growing social awareness led to increased political and architectural interest in providing cost-effective, sanitary, and comfortable residential space to the growing urban population in general and the working class in particular. This was known as ''boligsaken'' ("the housing cause") in Norwegian popular culture and continues to play a role to this day.&lt;ref name=nasjonsbygging&gt;Ulf Grønvold: Hundre års nasjonsbygging: arkitektur og samfunn 1905 - 2005. Pax forlag. 2005. {{ISBN|82-530-2758-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not unlike other countries during the evolution of their economies, Architecture became a tool for and manifestation of social policy, with architects and politicians determining just what features were adequate for the intended residents of housing projects. As late as in 1922, there were many who felt that working-class families had no need for their own bath; apartments and small houses only included a small kitchen and one or two rooms.

Before World War II, a number of cooperative investment projects known as "egne hjem" (roughly "our own homes") resulted in a handful of developments, but after the war these gave way to cooperative organizations that were formed to finance and build large-scale residential complexes. The largest-- [[Oslo Bolig og Sparelag]], known as ''OBOS''—built its first complex [[Etterstad]] in Oslo, but there were similar initiatives throughout the country. These co-ops set standards for housing, hired architects to design solutions, and contracted to have them built. Entire sections, known as ''drabantbyer'' - or "satellite cities" - were built in the outskirts of major cities. The first of these - [[Lambertseter]] - introduced an entirely new phenomenon in the eastern areas of Oslo such as in [[Grorud Valley|Groruddalen]], but similar areas also emerged in Bergen, Trondheim, and other cities. The apex of this trend was reached in 1966 with the massive buildings in [[Ammerudlia]].&lt;ref name=OBOS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obos.no/default.aspx?did=283241|title=OBOS: Historikk og arkitektur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This era—which had spent most of its force by the mid-1970s—led to an increased awareness of the physical and emotional needs of city dwellers. Some of the issues under debate were.&lt;ref name=nasjonsbygging/&gt;
* '''Kitchen''' - traditional Norwegian homes combined the family room and kitchen, but in early apartment buildings, small, so-called "laboratory kitchens" were popular. Over time, eat-in-kitchens took their place.
* '''Natural light'''--large apartment buildings were oriented to provide sunlight to the residents, ideally orienting the kitchen toward the east to get the morning light and the living room to the west for evening light.
* '''Privacy'''--providing separate sleeping quarters for parents and children, and among children led to larger apartments over time. Similarly, most buildings had a limited number of apartments adjoining each staircase.
* '''Alienation''' - monolithic, homogenous apartment complexes reinforced what some{{Who|date=July 2010}} characterized as "social democracy's hell."

The perceived shortcomings of the mass housing movement led to efforts to create cost-effective housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural surroundings, and above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the [[Parliament of Norway]] recommended a shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The [[Norwegian State Housing Bank]] (''Husbanken'') provided citizens with the ability to fund construction of their homes, and an entire construction industry formed to build these needs.

As a result of the pioneering efforts by [[Olav Selvaag]] and others, archaic and otherwise unnecessary restrictions were relaxed, improving opportunities for more Norwegians to build housing to suit their individual needs and preferences. Norwegians often undertake home improvement projects on their own, and many have built most of their own homes.

====Functionalism====
[[File:GriegLouEide02.JPG|alt=A small, flat-roofed, stucco house designed with simple, rectangular shapes, and built into a hillside. The casement, paned, and plate glass windows are wood framed.|thumb|Villa Eide in Bergen, example of "funkis" architecture]]

In the late 1920s, [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] (or the [[International style (architecture)|International style]]) was taken up by Scandinavian architects. In Scandinavia this architectural trend was called [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] (or colloquially in Sweden and Norway "funkis"). Modernism found many adherents among young architects, especially in Norway. Its definite breakthrough was the [[Stockholm Exhibition (1930)|Stockholm Exhibition]] in 1930, after which the majority of architects all over Scandinavia converted to the modern movement. Nowhere else did Modernism become so firmly established as the mainstream trend in architecture. It maintained its dominant position until about 1940.

A number of landmark structures, particularly in Oslo, were built in the functionalist style, the first one being the ''Skansen'' restaurant (1925–1927) by [[Lars Backer]], demolished in 1970. Backer also designed the restaurant at ''Ekeberg'', opened in 1929. The art gallery [[Kunstnernes Hus]] by [[Gudolf Blakstad]] and [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]] (1930) still shows influence from the preceding classicist trend of the 1920s. [[Hvalstrand]] bath (1934)&lt;ref&gt;Bernt Bucher-Johannessen, Eira Kjernlie and Peter Lawrance: ''Hvalstrand bad : maten, arkitekturen, historien''. Schibsted, {{ISBN|82-516-1965-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of several public seaside bath facilities in Norway, by [[André Peters]]. A year before, [[Ingierstrand Bad]] was designed by [[Ole Lind Schistad]] (1891-1979) and [[Eivind Moestue]](1893 -1977). Other great names of Norwegian functionalist architecture are [[Ove Bang]], [[Fridtjof Reppen]], [[Nicolai Beer]] (1885-1950) and [[Per Grieg]] (1897-1962).

====Reconstruction architecture====
Following the [[scorched earth]] tactics of retreating [[Wehrmacht]] troops, large areas in [[Northern Norway]] needed to be rebuilt. In 1945, there was an overwhelming need for housing. An architectural competition produced several designs for simple, cost-effective, and rapidly assembled housing. The resulting houses were Spartan and broke with building standards, but met an immediate need for shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Ingebjørg Hage: ''Som fugl føniks av asken? : gjenreisingshus i Nord-Troms og Finnmark''. Gyldendal. Oslo. 1999. {{ISBN|82-417-1045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblioteknett.no/alias/HJEMMESIDE/gjenreisningsmuseet/gjenr_ford3.htm |title=Kulturnett article on Reconstruction architecture |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928195945/http://biblioteknett.no/alias/HJEMMESIDE/gjenreisningsmuseet/gjenr_ford3.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museum of Reconstruction]] in [[Hammerfest]] is dedicated to the reconstruction.

====Government-sponsored architecture====
[[File:Oslo Nationaltheatret.JPG|alt=Building with stone columns at the base, and marble columns on the top portion.|thumb|left|National Theatre in Oslo.]]
As Norway gained full independence in 1905, the national government determined to establish institutions consistent with the newly formed state's ambitions as a modern society. The first prime minister made it a priority to modernize the Royal Palace in Oslo, building among other things, some of the country's first water toilets, providing hot and cold water, and granting the Royal Family's wish of providing a common apartment for the king, queen, and their son.

In the early years, such public works were limited to structures needed for the national government's own administrative needs, but an increasing number of large-scale projects were conceived, designed, and completed since 1905 to meet various needs, such as:
* '''Public health and welfare''', including:
** ''Hospital complexes and polyclinical facilities'', e.g., [[Rikshospitalet]], [[Haukeland University Hospital]], [[Gaustad Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;John Arne Balto, (ed.): ''Norsk sykehusarkitektur'', special edition of annual journal of [[Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments|Fortidsminneforeningen]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
** ''Orphanages'', later vacated in favor of other solutions that in turn required their own architecture.
** ''[[Sanatorium|Sanatoria]]'', also vacated as the public health problem of [[tuberculosis]] was solved&lt;ref&gt;[[Dag Skogheim]]: ''Frisk luft og diett: norske tuberkulosesanatorier'', article in annual journal for [[Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments|Fortidsminneforeningen]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Temporary and provisional housing'' for the indigent, asylum seekers, and homeless.
* '''Sports and recreation facilities'''. Social policy in Norway both at the national and local level has emphasized the connection between athletics at the mass and elite levels, and athletic centers have typically been built both to accommodate spectators, participants, and training. As an example, the [[Holmenkollen ski jump]] has been rebuilt several times, the [[Bislett Stadion]] was rebuilt in 2004-2005, and virtually every [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipality]] has built year-round facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Johan-Ditlef Martens: ''Idrettsanlegg og estetikk'', 2001. Oslo. {{ISBN|82-05-28524-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Centers for cultural expression'''. Some of the most ambitious and controversial structures have been those dedicated to performing arts, art museums, and any combination of such activities. Since many of these have been built in cities with an architectural legacy, their designs have sought—more or less successfully—to complement the urban landscape by giving it a modern element. Examples include the [[Henie-Onstad Art Centre]] (by [[Jon Eikvar]] and [[Sven Erik Engebretsen]]), [[Chateau Neuf]] by Lund &amp; Slaatto, the "barn" at [[Hedmark museum|Hedmarkmuseet]] by [[Sverre Fehn]], and the [[Grieg Hall]] (by [[Knud Munk]]).
* '''Churches'''. The Norwegian State Church, holding the legacy of nearly one thousand years of Norwegian church architecture, commissioned new churches that covered a wide range of architectural styles, including entirely new designs (e.g. the [[Arctic Cathedral]] by [[Jan Inge Hovig]]) to new casts of traditional designs (e.g., [[Veldre church]], by [[Roar Jacobsen]] and [[Ulf Zettersten]].)&lt;ref&gt;Arne E. Sæther: ''Kirken som bygg og bilde : rom og liturgi ved et tusenårsskifte : en bok om kirkebygging før, nå og i fremtiden''. Asker, 2001 {{ISBN|82-992135-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reidun Mellem: ''Tromsdalskjerka fyller førti''. 2005. {{ISBN|82-992267-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Transportation infrastructure''', including bridges, tunnels, and most notably transit centers for rail, sea, and air transportation. [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo airport]] (by the [[Aviaplan]] consortium at Gardermoen) was Norway's largest construction project ever.&lt;ref&gt;Trond Bergh, Helge Ryggvik, Jon Gulowsen: ''Jernbanen i Norge 1854-2004'', 2004. {{ISBN|82-419-0333-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lars Elnan: ''Luftslottet: materiell og arkitektur ved Oslo Lufthavn - Gardermoen'', major thesis in sociology at the [[University of Oslo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural designs of these projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found the opportunity to develop their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.

Many of the projects have been controversial, and the resulting creative tension has probably served to advance the state of architectural arts in Norway. National and local governments and governmental institutions will continue to be among the largest customers of architects in coming years.

==Contemporary themes==
[[File:Molde im Februar 2005.jpg|alt=Multi-storied glass building in the shape of a gaff-rigged sail.|thumb|left|[[Rica Seilet Hotel]] in [[Molde]]]]
A number of trends influence contemporary architecture in Norway, among them:&lt;ref name=arkhistorie/&gt;
* '''Growing public and private affluence'''. Buildings have a wider range of purpose, and are expected to meet increasingly complex demands. For example, the [[Oslo Opera House|new opera building]] (designed by [[Snøhetta (company)|Snøhetta]]) in Oslo reflects an ambition not just to build a vibrant cultural center, but also to create a new architectural icon in the [[Oslofjord]].
* '''Aesthetics as a factor of well-being'''. From the early austere principle that form should strictly follow function, there is a growing sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.
* '''Environmental concerns'''. In addition to concerns about air and water pollution, Norwegian architectural design has also emphasized integration with the [[natural landscape]]. More recently, architects have also worked with engineers to make the most out of scarce resources, e.g., energy, water, etc.
* '''Demographic diversity'''. [[Demographics of Norway|Norwegian demographics]] have undergone significant changes the last few decades, resulting in new religious buildings
* '''Norwegian building traditions'''. While it may be too much to speak of a renaissance in traditional Norwegian architecture, more and more urban planning is affected by the need to preserve or restore these traditions. Examples include plans to renew the center of [[Oppdal]] and recent work at the Oslo neighborhood of [[Grünerløkka]].

A number of architectural prizes are awarded in Norway, including ''Houens fonds diplom'', ''Treprisen'', ''Statens byggeskikkpris'', ''Sundts premie'', ''Betongelementprisen'', ''[[Betongtavlen]]'', ''Glassprisen'', ''Murverksprisen'', ''Stenprisen'', and ''Stålkonstruksjonsprisen''.

An '''artist-run initiative''' is any project run by artists, including [[Sound art|sound]] or [[visual artist]]s, to present their and others' projects. They might approximate a traditional [[art gallery]] space in appearance or function, or they may take a markedly different approach, limited only by the artist's understanding of the term. "Artist-run initiatives" is an umbrella name for many types of artist generated activity. 

One such group, the Belfast-based [[Catalyst Arts]], wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Artist-run means initiating exchange; emphasizing cross and inter-disciplinary approaches to making art; developing networks; through curation, putting creative ideas and
arguments into action" &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author =Catalyst Arts| title = Life/Live| place = Paris | publisher = Musée d’Art Moderne| year = 1996|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Artist-run initiatives also play a role in hosting international artists: they may also include guest studios or even international [[Artist in residence]] programs.

An '''art centre''' or '''arts center''' is distinct from an [[art gallery]] or [[art museum]]. An arts centre is a functional [[community centre]] with a specific remit to encourage arts practice and to provide facilities such as [[theatre]] space, gallery space, venues for [[music]]al performance, workshop areas, educational facilities, technical equipment, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, G. (2001) 'Amenity planning and the arts centre', Chapter 4 of Cultural Planning: an urban renaissance? London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], "art centers" are generally either establishments geared toward exposing, generating, and making accessible art making to arts-interested individuals, or buildings that rent primarily to artists, galleries, or companies involved in art making.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], art centres began after [[World War II]] and gradually changed from mainly [[middle-class]] places to 1960s and 1970s [[Fads and trends|trendy]], [[Alternative lifestyle|alternative]] centres and eventually in the 1980s to serving the ''whole'' community with a programme of enabling access to wheelchair users and [[disabled]] individuals and groups.

In the rest of Europe it is common among most art centres that they are partly government funded, since they are considered to have a positive influence on society and economics according to the [[Rhineland model]] philosophy. A lot of those organisations originally started in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as [[Squatting|squatted]] spaces and were later legalized.

The '''arts of China''' (Chinese: 中國藝術/中国艺术) have varied throughout its [[History of China|ancient history]], divided into periods by the ruling [[dynasties of China]] and changing technology, but still containing a high degree of continuity.  Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders. The arrival of [[Buddhism]] and modern Western influence produced especially large changes. Chinese art encompasses [[fine art]]s, [[folk art]]s and [[performance art]]s.

{{Main|History of Chinese art}}

Early forms of art in China were made from pottery and jade in the Neolithic period, to which was added bronze in the [[Shang Dynasty]]. The Shang are most remembered for their blue casting, noted for its clarity of detail. Early Chinese music and poetry was influenced by the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Songs]]'', [[Confucius]] and the Chinese poet and statesman [[Qu Yuan]].

In early imperial China, [[Chinese porcelain|porcelain]] was introduced and was refined to the point that in English the word ''china'' has become synonymous with high-quality porcelain. Around the 1st century AD, Buddhism arrived in China, though it did not become popular until the 4th century. At this point, Chinese Buddhist art began to flourish, a process which continued through the 20th century. It was during the period of Imperial China that [[calligraphy]] and painting became highly appreciated arts in court circles, with a great deal of work done on silk until well after the invention of paper.

Buddhist architecture and sculpture thrived in the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty]].  Of which, the Tang Dynasty was particularly open to foreign influence. Buddhist sculpture returned to a classical form, inspired by [[Indian art]] of the [[Gupta period]]. Towards the late Tang dynasty, all foreign religions were outlawed to support [[Taoism]].

==Chinese Blue and White Porcelain==
Chinese Blue and White has been a major auction type in Western fine arts auction events. Sotheby's and Christie's act as major platforms for art collectors to trade collections.

===Early Chinese poetry===

In addition to the ''Book of Songs'' ([[Shi Jing]]), a second early and influential poetic anthology was the [[Chu Ci|Songs of Chu]] ({{zh|s=楚辞|t=楚辭|p=Chǔ Cí}}), made up primarily of poems ascribed to the semilegendary [[Qu Yuan]] (c. 340–278 BC) and his follower [[Song Yu]] (fourth century BC). The songs in this collection are more lyrical and romantic and represent a different tradition from the earlier ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' (Shi Jing).  Many of the works in the text are associated with [[Shamanism]]. There are also descriptions of fantastic landscapes, examples of China's first nature poetry. The longest poem, "Encountering Sorrow," is reputed to have been written by the tragic {{Qu Yuan}} as a political allegory.

=== Han and Northern dynasties poetry ===
During, the Han Dynasty, Chu lyrics evolved into the ''[[fu (poetry)|fu]]'' (賦), a poem usually in rhymed verse except for introductory and concluding passages that are in prose, often in the form of questions and answers.  From the Han Dynasty onwards, a process similar to the origins of the [[Shi Jing]] produced the ''[[yuefu]]'' poems.

In the [[Northern Dynasties]] historical records indicate [[Cao Cao]] was a brilliant ruler and poet.  Cao Cao was also the father of the well-known poets [[Cao Pi]] and [[Cao Zhi]].  Cao Pi is known for writing the first [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poem]] using seven syllables per line (七言詩), the poem ''燕歌行''.

Cao Zhi demonstrated his spontaneous wit at an early age and was a front-running candidate for the throne; however, such ability was devoted to Chinese literature and poetry, which was encouraged by his father's subordinate officials. Later he surrounded himself with a group of poets and officials with literary interests, including some who continually showed off their smartness at the expense of Cao Cao and Cao Pi's subordinates and even Cao Cao himself.

[[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]]'s poetry influenced the work of many subsequent poets. Approximately 120 of his poems survive, which depict an idyllic [[pastoral]] life of farming and drinking.

=== Golden age of Chinese poetry ===
''[[Yuefu]]'' are [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poems]] composed in a [[folk song]] style.   The  term literally means "[[Music Bureau]]", a reference to the government organization originally charged with collecting or writing the [[lyrics]].

The lines are of uneven length, though five [[Chinese character|character]]s is the most common. Each poem follows one of a series of patterns defined by the song title. The term covers original folk songs, [[Noble court|court]] imitations and versions by known poets.

From the 2nd century AD, the ''yuefu'' began to develop into ''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]''—the form which was to dominate [[Chinese poetry]] until the modern era. The writers of these poems took the five-[[Chinese character|character]] line of the ''yuefu'' and used it to express more complex ideas. The ''shi'' poem was generally an expression of the poet's own persona rather than the adopted characters of the ''yuefu''; many were romantic nature poems heavily influenced by [[Taoism]].

The term ''[[Gushi (poetry)|gushi]]'' ("old poems") can refer either to the first, mostly anonymous ''shi'' poems, or more generally to the poems written in the same form by later poets. ''Gushi'' in this latter sense are defined essentially by what they are not; that is, they are not ''jintishi'' (regulated verse). The writer of ''gushi'' was under no formal constraints other than line length and [[rhyme]] (in every second line).

''Jintishi'', or [[regulated verse]], developed from the 5th century onwards.   By the Tang dynasty, a series of set [[Tonal language|tonal]] patterns had been developed, which were intended to ensure a balance between the four tones of classical [[Chinese spoken language|Chinese]] in each [[couplet]]: the level tone, and the three deflected tones (rising, falling and entering).  The Tang dynasty was the high point of the ''jintishi''.

Notable poets from this era include [[Bai Juyi]], [[Du Mu]], [[Han Yu]], [[Jia Dao]], [[Li Qiao]], [[Liu Zongyuan]], [[Luo Binwang]], [[Meng Haoran]], [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]], and [[Zhang Jiuling]].

===Li Bai and Du Fu===
[[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]] both lived during the Tang Dynasty.  They are regarded by many as the greatest of the Chinese poets.

[[File:Buddha Leshan01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], 71 meters tall, construction began in 713 AD, completed ninety years later.]]
Over a thousand poems are attributed to Li Bai, but the authenticity of many of these is uncertain. He is best known for his ''[[yuefu]]'' poems, which are intense and often [[fantastic]].  He is often associated with [[Taoism]]: there is a strong element of this in his works, both in the sentiments they express and in their spontaneous tone.  Nevertheless, his ''gufeng'' ("ancient airs") often adopt the perspective of the Confucian moralist, and many of his [[occasional verse]]s are fairly conventional.

Much like [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], many legends exist on how Li Bai effortlessly composed his poetry, even (or some say, especially) when drunk; his favorite form is the ''[[jueju]]'' (five- or seven-character quatrain), of which he composed some 160 pieces.  Using striking, unconventional imagery, Li Bai is able to create exquisite pieces to utilize fully the elements of the language.  His use of language is not as erudite as Du Fu's but equally effective, impressing through an extravagance of imagination and a direct connection of a free-spirited persona with the reader.  Li Bai's interactions with nature, friendship, and his acute observations of life inform his best poems.  Some of the rest, like ''Changgan xing'' (translated by [[Ezra Pound]] as ''A River Merchant's Wife: A Letter''), records the hardships or emotions of common people.  Like the best Chinese poets, Li Bai often evades translation.

Since the [[Song dynasty]], critics have called Du Fu the "poet historian".  The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on [[military tactic]]s or the successes and failures of the government, or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor.

One of the Du Fu's earliest surviving works, ''The Song of the Wagons'' (c. 750), gives voice to the sufferings of a [[conscription|conscript]] soldier in the imperial army, even before the beginning of the rebellion; this poem brings out the tension between the need of acceptance and fulfillment of one's [[duty|duties]], and a clear-sighted consciousness of the suffering which this can involve.

&lt;!-- Who is "Chou" in this graf? And which work is being cited? --&gt;
Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. He mastered all the forms of [[Chinese poetry]]: Chou says that in every form he "either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples" (p.&amp;nbsp;56). Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s, from the direct and [[colloquial]] to the [[allusion|allusive]] and self-consciously literary. The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings ("[[chameleon]]like" according to Watson): his earliest works are in a relatively derivative, courtly style, but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion.  Owen comments on the "grim simplicity" of the Qinzhou poems, which mirrors the [[desert]] landscape (p.&amp;nbsp;425); the works from his Chengdu period are "light, often finely observed" (p.&amp;nbsp;427); while the poems from the late [[Kuizhou]] period have a "density and power of vision" (p.&amp;nbsp;433).

=== Late Tang and Five Dynasties poetry ===
[[Li Shangyin]] was a Chinese poet of the late Tang dynasty. He was a typical Late Tang poet: his works are sensuous, dense and allusive. The latter quality makes adequate translation extremely difficult. Many of his poems have political, romantic or philosophical implications, but it is often unclear which of these should be read into each work.

[[Li Houzhu|Li Yu]] was a Chinese poet and the last ruler of the Southern Tang Kingdom. His best-known poems were composed during the years after the Song formally ended his reign in 975 and brought him back as a captive to the Song capital, Bianjing (now [[Kaifeng]]). Li's works from this period dwell on his regret for the lost kingdom and the pleasures it had brought him. He was finally poisoned by the Song emperor in 978.

Li Yu developed the ''ci'' by broadening its scope from love to history and philosophy, particularly in his later works.  He also introduced the two-[[stanza]] form, and made great use of contrasts between longer lines of nine [[Chinese character|character]]s and shorter ones of three and five.

=== Song poetry ===
''[[ci (poetry)|Ci]]'' is a kind of [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] [[Chinese poetry]]. Beginning in the [[Liang Dynasty]], the ''ci'' followed the tradition of the [[Shi Jing]] and the ''[[yuefu]]'': they were lyrics which developed from anonymous popular songs (some of Central Asian origin) into a sophisticated literary genre.   The form was further developed in the [[Tang Dynasty]], and was most popular in the [[Song Dynasty]].  ''Ci'' most often expressed feelings of desire, often in an adopted [[persona]], but the greatest exponents of the form (such as [[Li Houzhu]] and [[Su Shi]]) used it to address a wide range of topics.  Well-known poets of the Song Dynasty include [[Zeng Gong]], [[Li Qingzhao]], [[Lu You]], [[Mei Yaochen]], [[Ouyang Xiu]], [[Su Dongpo]], [[Wang Anshi]], and [[Xin Qiji]].

===Ming literature===
The [[Ming Dynasty]] author [[Gao Qi]] is acknowledged as a great practitioner of [[Ming poetry|poetry during the Ming Dynasty]].  His poems are departure of those of earlier dynasties and formed a new style of poetry in the Ming dynasty.  [[Zhang Dai]] is acknowledged as the greatest essayist of the Ming dynasty. [[Wen Zhenheng]], the great grandson of [[Wen Zhengming]], wrote a classic on garden architecture and interior design, Zhang Wu Zhi (On Superfluous Things).

===Qing literature===
[[Yuan Mei]] was a well-known poet who lived during the [[Qing Dynasty]].  In the decades before his death, Yuan Mei produced a large body of poetry, essays and paintings. His works reflected his interest in [[Chan Buddhism]] and the supernatural, at the expense of [[Daoism]] and institutional Buddhism—both of which he rejected. Yuan is most famous for his poetry, which has been described as "unusually clear and elegant language". His views on poetry as expressed in the ''Suiyuan shihua'' (隨園詩話) stressed the importance of personal feeling and technical perfection.

Many great works of art and literature originated during the period, and the Qianlong emperor in particular undertook huge projects to preserve important cultural texts. The novel form became widely read and perhaps China's most famous novel, ''Dream of the Red Chamber'', was written in the mid-eighteenth century.

[[Cao Xueqin]] is the author of the famous Chinese work ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.  Extant handwritten copies of this work—some 80 chapters—had been in circulation in Beijing shortly after Cao's death, before [[Gao Ê]], who claimed to have access to the former's working papers, published a complete 120-chapter version in 1792.  [[Pu Songling]] was a famous writer of [[Liaozhai Zhiyi]] 《聊齋志異》during the [[Qing dynasty]].  He opened a [[tea house]] and invited his guests to tell stories, and then he would compile the tales into collections such as [[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]].

===Western influence: the Big Three===
In the early 20th century Shanghai became the birthplace and entertainment hub of the three new major art forms, [[Cinema of China|Chinese cinema]], [[Chinese animation]] and [[Chinese popular music]].  These entertainment were heavily inspired by western technology.  For the first time, local citizens adopted and molded western culture to fit into Chinese culture in a positive way without any imperial court intervention.

The most popular form of comics [[Lianhuanhua]] which circulated as palm sized books in Shanghai, [[Guangzhou]], [[Wuhan]] and [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]].  It became one of the most affordable form of entertainment art.  The famous [[Sanmao (comic book character)|Sanmao]] character would also be born at this time.

Chinese popular music musicians like [[Zhou Xuan]] and [[Li Jinhui]] were immediately endangered under the new regime as it labeled the genre [[Yellow Music|yellow music]] (pornography).  On the contrary, [[Guoyue|revolutionary music]] was promoted and brought to new heights like never before.  The [[Cinema of China|film]] and [[Chinese animation|animation]] industry would make their last run until the Cultural revolution, which would hinder any progress with serious restrictions and unreasonable censorship.  A large number of Shanghai citizens, including artists, immigrated to Hong Kong.  It would fuel the birth of modern Chinese art in the [[British colony]] that has until now, been largely dominated by British entertainment.  The pop music industry would rebound in [[Taiwan]] and Hong Kong.  The animation race would be lost to Japan.

=== Modern poetry ===
Modern Chinese poems (新詩 vers libre) usually do not follow any prescribed pattern.  [[Bei Dao]] is the most notable representative of the [[Misty Poets]], a group of Chinese poets who reacted against the restrictions of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The work of the Misty Poets and Bei Dao in particular were an inspiration to pro-democracy movements in China. Most notable was his poem ''"Huida"'' ("The Answer"), which was written during the [[Tiananmen Incident|1976 Tiananmen demonstrations]] in which he participated. The poem was taken up as a defiant anthem of the pro-democracy movement and appeared on posters during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Presidential Lecture text"&gt;{{cite web|last=Saussy|first=Haun|title=Bei Dao and his Audiences|url=http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/dao/daoaudience.html|work=Lecture|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xu Zhimo]] is a [[Romanticism|romantic]] poet who loved the poetry of the English Romantics like [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. He was one of the first Chinese writers to successfully naturalize Western romantic forms into modern Chinese poetry.

==Music==
[[File:Concert China.jpg|thumb|right|[[List of traditional Chinese musical instruments|Traditional]] style Chinese concert performance in China]]
{{main|Music of China}}

=== Early Chinese music ===
The origins of [[Chinese music]] and poetry can be found in the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Book of Songs]]'', containing poems composed between 1000 BC and 600 BC. The text, preserved among the canon of early [[Chinese literature]], contains folk songs, hymns and stately songs. Originally intended to be sung, the accompanying music unfortunately has since been lost. They had a wide range of purposes, including for courtship, ceremonial greetings, warfare, feasting and lamentation. The love poems are among the most appealing in the freshness and innocence of their language.

Early Chinese music was based on percussion instruments such as the bronze bell. Chinese bells were sounded by being struck from the outside, usually with a piece of wood. Sets of bells were suspended on wooden racks. Inside excavated bells are groves and marks of scraping and scratching made as they were tuned to the right pitch. Percussion instruments gradually gave way to string and reed instruments toward the Warring States period.

Significantly, the character for writing the word ''music'' (''yue'') was the same as that for ''joy'' (''le''). For [[Confucius]] and his disciples, music was important because it had the power to make people harmonious and well balanced, or, conversely, caused them to be quarrelsome and depraved. According to [[Xun Zi]], music was as important as the ''li'' ("rites"; "etiquette") stressed in [[Confucianism]]. [[Mozi]], philosophically opposed to Confucianism, disagreed. He dismissed music as having only aesthetic uses, and thus useless and wasteful.

==Performing art==

=== Yuan drama ===
[[Chinese opera]] is a popular form of drama in China. In general, it dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] with Emperor [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang China|Xuanzong]] (712–755), who founded the "[[Pear Garden]]" (梨园), the first known opera troupe in China. The troupe mostly performed for the emperors' personal pleasure. To this day operatic professionals are still referred to as "Disciples of the Pear Garden" (梨园子弟). In the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279–1368), forms like the ''[[Zaju]]'' ([[:zh:杂剧|杂剧]], variety plays), which acts based on rhyming schemes plus the innovation of having specialized roles like "[[Dan (Chinese opera)|Dan]]" (旦, female), "[[Sheng of Chinese opera|Sheng]]" (生, male) and "[[Chou (Chinese Opera)|Chou]]" (丑, Clown), were introduced into the opera. 
[[File:HongKong003.jpg|thumb|Modern performers of [[Cantonese opera]] in Hong Kong]]
[[Cantonese opera]], which originated from the north and developed over time since, contains many well-known programs such as ''The Purple Hairpin'' and ''Rejuvenation of the Red Plum Flower'', originated from the [[Yuan Dynasty]].

=== Peking opera ===
[[File:Beijing opera02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beijing opera]] scene.]]
The best-known form of [[Chinese opera]] is Beijing or [[Peking opera]], which assumed its present form in the mid-19th century and was extremely popular in the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911).  In Beijing Opera, traditional Chinese string and percussion instruments provide a strong rhythmic accompaniment to the acting. The acting is based on allusion: gestures, footwork, and other body movements express such actions as riding a horse, rowing a boat, or opening a door.

Although it is called Beijing opera, its origins are not in Beijing but in the Chinese provinces of [[Anhui]] and [[Hubei]]. Beijing opera got its two main [[Four Great Characteristic Melodies|melodies]], ''[[Xipi]]'' and ''[[Erhuang]]'', from Anhui and Hubei operas. Much dialogue is also carried out in an archaic dialect originating partially from those regions. It also absorbed music and arias from other operas and musical arts such as the historic [[Qinqiang]]. It is regarded that Beijing Opera was born when the [[Four Great Anhui Troupes]] came to Beijing in 1790. Beijing opera was originally staged for the court and came into the public later. In 1828, some famous Hubei troupes came to Beijing. They often jointly performed in the stage with Anhui troupes. The combination gradually formed Beijing opera's main melodies.
[[File:Chinese women in pink, dancing (2007-07-05).jpg|thumb|Chinese dance]]

===Dance===
{{main|Dance of China}}
In ancient China. Chinese dance was divided into two types, civilian and military.  In the Shang and Zhou period, civilian dance, dancers held feather banners in their hands, symbolizing the distribution of the fruits of the day's hunting or fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.houstoncul.org/eng_culexg/c004.htm |title=The Art of Chinese Dance |work=Cultural Division, Taipei Economic &amp; Cultural Office in Houston }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Military dance involved brandishing of weapons, for example it was recorded that the Han founding Emperor [[Liu Bang]] was fond of the war dance of the [[Ba (state)|Ba people]], and large scale performances of the dance involved the brandishing of various weapons to the accompaniment of drums and songs in the Ba language.&lt;ref name="ta cheng"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ta Chʻeng, Great Perfection - Religion and Ethnicity in a Chinese Millennial Kingdom |author=Terry F.

The best known Chinese dances are the [[Dragon dance]] and the [[Lion Dance]].

===Contemporary art===
New forms of Chinese art were heavily influenced by the [[New Culture Movement]], which adopted Western techniques and employed [[socialist realism]]. The [[Cultural Revolution]] would shape Chinese art in the 20th century like no other event in history with the [[Four Olds]] destruction campaign. Contemporary Chinese artists continue to produce a wide range of experimental works, multimedia installations, and performance "happenings" which have become very popular in the international art market.

=== Han Paper art ===
The most notable invention of the Han period was paper which spawned two new types of arts. [[Chinese Paper Cutting]] became a new concept. The idea of expressing symbols and Chinese characters already a part of calligraphy was now extended to Han paper cut outs. Another art form was the [[Chinese paper folding]]. While it has its roots in the Han dynasty, later renditions would transform the art into [[origami]], after Buddhist monks took paper to Japan.&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;Lang, Robert James.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2757">An '''aside''' is a [[Glossary of theater terms|dramatic device]] in which a [[Character (arts)|character]] speaks to the [[audience]]. By convention the audience is to realize that the character's speech is unheard by the other characters on stage. It may be addressed to the audience expressly (in character or out) or represent an unspoken thought. An aside is usually a brief comment, rather than a speech, such as a [[monologue]] or [[soliloquy]]. Unlike a public announcement, it occurs within the context of the play. An aside is, by convention, a true statement of a character's thought; a character may be mistaken in an aside, but may not be dishonest.

==Examples==
This technique is used by many playwrights, including [[William Shakespeare]]. For instance, in the play ''[[Macbeth]]'', Macbeth has the following aside:
{{cquote|Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits.}}

Here is another example in the [[Shakespeare]] play ''[[Hamlet]]'':

{{cquote|A little more than kin, and less than kind.}}

This technique has frequently been used in film comedy, for example in the [[Bob Hope]] "Road" comedies, [[Woody Allen]] comedies and in ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''. The Jean-Luc Godard film ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' contains an early use of character aside.

More recently, it is used by [[Ian Richardson]]'s character [[Francis Urquhart]] in the 1990 [[BBC]] mini-series ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'', as well as [[Kevin Spacey]]'s character Frank Underwood in the 2013 [[Netflix]] [[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|original series of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zach Seward|work=medium.com|url=https://medium.com/house-of-cards/b54a60143519|title=House of Cards' fourth wall|date=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to explain the often complex politics on the show, describe what the character's plans/emotions are or simply for humorous effect.

==Uses==
Aside is used to gossip about characters or other characters without their consciousness, give audiences better understanding of matters, as well as make audiences laugh; this humour that may be generated is because the character or characters being talked about is or are not conscious of the fact they are being spoken of.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5868">[[File:Emily Dickinson daguerreotype.jpg|thumb|[[Emily Dickinson]] in a [[daguerreotype]], circa December 1846 or early 1847]]

"'''Because I could not stop for Death'''" is a [[lyrical poem]] by [[Emily Dickinson]] first published posthumously in ''Poems: Series 1'' in 1890. The persona of Dickinson's poem meets [[Death (personification)|personified Death]]. Death is a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the speaker to her grave. According to [[Thomas H. Johnson (scholar)|Thomas H. Johnson]]'s [[variorum edition]] of 1955 the number of this poem is 712.

== Summary ==
The poem was published posthumously in 1890 in ''Poems: Series 1'', a collection of Dickinson's poems assembled and edited by her friends [[Mabel Loomis Todd]] and [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]]. The poem was published under the title "The Chariot". It is composed in six [[quatrains]] with the meter alternating between [[iambic tetrameter]] and [[iambic trimeter]]. Stanzas 1, 2, 4, and 6 employ [[end rhyme]] in their second and fourth lines, but some of these are only close rhyme or [[eye rhyme]]. In the third stanza, there is no end rhyme, but "ring" in line 2 rhymes with "gazing" and "setting" in lines 3 and 4 respectively. Internal rhyme is scattered throughout. [[Figures of speech]] include [[alliteration]], [[anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]], [[paradox]], and [[personification]]. The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave. She also personifies immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Guides2/Dickinson.html |title="Because I could not stop for Death": Study Guide |accessdate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volta (turn) happens in the fourth quatrain. Structurally, the syllables shift from its constant 8-6-8-6 scheme to 6-8-8-6. This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain. The personification of death changes from one of pleasantry to one of ambiguity and morbidity: "Or rather--He passed Us-- / The Dews drew quivering and chill--" (13–14). The imagery changes from its original nostalgic form of children playing and setting suns to Death's real concern of taking the speaker to the afterlife.

&lt;poem&gt;


Because I could not stop for Death —
He kindly stopped for me —
The Carriage held but just Ourselves —
And Immortality.

We slowly drove — He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility —

We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess — in the Ring —
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain —
We passed the Setting Sun —

Or rather — He passed Us —
The Dews drew quivering and Chill —
For only Gossamer, my Gown —
My Tippet — only Tulle —

We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground —
The Roof was scarcely visible —
The Cornice — in the Ground —

Since then — 'tis Centuries — and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses' Heads
Were toward Eternity —
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
THE CHARIOT

Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.

We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility.

We passed the school where children played,
Their lessons scarcely done;
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.






We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground;
The roof was scarcely visible,
The cornice but a mound.

Since then 'tis centuries; but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Critique==
In 1936 [[Allen Tate]] wrote,
{{quote|[The poem] exemplifies better than anything else [Dickinson] wrote the special quality of her mind ... If the word great means anything in poetry, this poem is one of the greatest in the English language; it is flawless to the last detail. The rhythm charges with movement the pattern of suspended action back of the poem. Every image is precise and, moreover, not merely beautiful, but inextricably fused with the central idea. Every image extends and intensifies every other ... No poet could have invented the elements of [this poem]; only a great poet could have used them so perfectly. Miss Dickinson was a deep mind writing from a deep culture, and when she came to poetry, she came infallibly.&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1936, pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}}}

==Musical settings==
The poem has been set to music by [[Aaron Copland]] as the twelfth song of his [[song cycle]] ''[[Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson]]''. And again, by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] as the second movement of his [[choral symphony]] ''[[Harmonium (John Adams)|Harmonium]]'', and also set to music by [[Nicholas J. White]] as a single movement piece for chorus and chamber orchestra. Natalie Merchant and Susan McKeown have created a song of the same name while preserving Dickinson's exact poem in its lyrics.

'''Belgrade Design Week''' is an international festival established in 2005, and held once a year in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. The week-long conference is organized every spring and is the largest design initiative in South Eastern Europe. It covers architecture, design, fashion, publishing, and new media, as well as related fields like communications, marketing, advertising, and arts management.  The event includes design labs, competitions, and presentations from international speakers like [[Karim Rashid]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]].

During the rest of the year, there are related projects such as promoting local designers, holding a branding competition for the Serbian Center for the Promotion of Science, and participating in the Partners of the Human Cities/ Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/projects/|title=Projects|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancities.eu/story/belgrade-design-week-welcomes-the-city-of-kragujevac-to-the-human-cities-family/|title=Belgrade Design Week welcomes the City of Kragujevac to the Human Cities/ family!|website=humancities.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="belgradedesignweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/interview-with-jovan-jelovac-narativ/|title=INTERVIEW WITH JOVAN JELOVAC – NARATIV|date=1 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also spearheaded the Belgrade 2020 project, promoting the city as a candidate for the [[European Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref name="belgradedesignweek.com"/&gt;

== History ==
First held in 2005, Belgrade Design Week festival was founded by brand consultant [[Jovan Jelovac]], a formally trained architect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.disegnodaily.com/article/belgrade-design-week|title=Belgrade Design Week|website=DisegnoDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The conference costs about half a million euros to produce and is supported mostly through commercial and media sponsorships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Jelovac, education was the primary reason for launching the summit, as well as inspiring the country's citizens through design. In 2014, the president of Serbia, [[Tomislav Nikolić]], presided over the event, mentioning how design can contribute to the country's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/the-ninth-belgrade-design-week-launched/|title=THE NINTH BELGRADE DESIGN WEEK LAUNCHED-DIZAJN PARK MAGAZINE|date=29 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, designer [[Karim Rashid]] was the ambassador for the second Belgrade Design Week and spoke at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-king-of-kool-is-so-over-new-york/article667234/|title=The King of Kool is so over New York|last=|first=|date=2008-02-02|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he later headed several design projects in Serbia's capital city.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/on-the-verge-belgrade-europes-latest-urban-success-story/|title=On the Verge {{!}} Belgrade, Europe's Latest Urban Success Story|last=Beaumanis|first=Viia|date=2013-10-11|website=T Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashid stated that he is fascinated by Belgrade and Eastern Europe in general, seeing it "as the next upcoming place - everyone is psyched and enthusiastic about the rebuilding of these poetic, romantic, artistic and very intellectual places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sajkaca.blogspot.ca/2008/05/karim-rashid-goes-belgrade_18.html|title=Karim Rashid goes Belgrade|website=sajkaca.blogspot.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/five-emerging-fashion-capitals-worth-knowing.html|title=Five Emerging Fashion Capitals Worth Knowing|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/design/moma-yugoslavia-new-exhibition-architecture-concrete-brutalism-celebrate-new-york-photography-a8178471.html|title=New MoMA exhibition celebrates the concrete world of Yugoslavia|date=2018-01-25|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending the design festival in 2008, architect [[Daniel Libeskind]] left with a billion dollar, albeit controversial, commission to redevelop the Belgrade waterfront.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/10/belgrade-waterfront-gulf-petrodollars-exclusive-waterside-development|title=Belgrade Waterfront: an unlikely place for Gulf petrodollars to settle|first=Herbert|last=Wright|date=10 December 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lukabeograd.com/en/city-on-wather/master-plan/strategy.html|title=Luka Beograd :: Strategy|website=www.lukabeograd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major projects like this one are contributing to the renewal of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viaggi.corriere.it/viaggi/weekend/belgrado-hotel-ristoranti/?refresh_ce-cp|title=La nuova Belgrado: cosa vedere, gli hotel e i ristoranti|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other skyscrapers and shopping malls are in the planning stages, and architectural masterpieces, like the Art Nouveau "Geozavod" building, are being restored.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Belgrade is being compared to 1990's Berlin, seen as a decaying but alive metropolis: "Recently, the gritty city has emerged as an outpost of creative activity and urban cool on the cheap, against the lingering backdrop of socialism."

== About ==
The principal site of the festival changes annually with various run-down or abandoned buildings being renovated for the event. Past locations have included a palace, the bombed out hotel Jugoslavija, an abandoned department store,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/design/belgrade-design-week-09-the-location/|title=belgrade design week 09  the location|date=31 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the closed contemporary art museum, and an old factory.&lt;ref name="designboom.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/design/belgrade-design-week-2014-conferences-brand-new-world-10-05-2014/|title=belgrade design week 2014 conferences open up a brand new world|date=5 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, the conference also focuses on a common thread, for example, in 2013 the unifying theme was the square shape.&lt;ref name="glassrpske"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glassrpske.com/plus/intervju/Jovan-Jelovac-Dizajn-nije-umetnost-nego-biznis/lat/110507.html|website=glassrpske.com|title=Jovan Jelovac: Dizajn nije umetnost nego biznis|accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately thirty international speakers present each year and cover a wide range of subjects, helping to promote cultural exchanges between Serbia and the rest of the world. Notable designers and artists who have spoken at the event include [[Konstantin Grcic]], [[Aylin Langreuter]], [[Christophe de la Fontaine]], [[Hella Jongerius]], [[Daan Roosegaarde]], [[Ross Lovegrove]]. [[Christophe Pillet]], [[Sacha Lakic]] and [[Patricia Urquiola]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the presentations, there are numerous workshops and design competitions, as well as exhibits from designers such as Israeli Eilon Armon and Swiss architect duo Lang/Baumann.&lt;ref name="designboom.com"/&gt;

'''Broodwork''' is a "[[Social Practice|social practice]] based in Los Angeles", founded in 2009 by visual artist Rebecca Niederlander and architect Iris Anna Regn that exploring the intersection between creativity and family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loveless|first=Natalie|title=Book Review: The M Word: Real Mothers in Contemporary Art by Myrel Chernick and Jennie Klein|journal=Studies in the Maternal|year=2013|volume=5|issue=1|url=http://www.mamsie.bbk.ac.uk/documents/Loveless_SiM_5(1)2013.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030225/http://www.mamsie.bbk.ac.uk/documents/Loveless_SiM_5%281%292013.pdf|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arieff|first=Allison|title=Beyond the Cubicle|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/beyond-the-cubicle/|accessdate=21 March 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Notable participants include individuals from various creative fields, including poet [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)|Elizabeth Alexander]], writer and documentarian [[Alain de Botton]], author and Families and Work Institute founder Ellen Galinsky, sculptor [[Tim Hawkinson]], and architect [[Greg Lynn]].

== Overview ==

Broodwork names the previously undefined community of creative practitioners who are parents. For example, the sculptor [[Ruth Asawa|Ruth Asawa's]] practice, which took place "in community with her family" was recently referred to "Broodwork".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watts|first=Patricia|title=APPRECIATION: Ruth Asawa (1926-2013)|url=http://www.artltdmag.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1394827096&amp;archive&amp;start_from&amp;ucat=39&amp;page=reports|publisher=Art Ltd.|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broodwork's projects are often experiments in [[Interdisciplinarity]] that investigate using one methodology to explore another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cochran|first=Jessica|title=Motherhood and the Exhibitionary Platform: Considering the Implications of Maternity Through the Curatorial Lens|url=http://feministartproject.rutgers.edu/media/uploads/Abstract_Chair_-_Cochran.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a social practice entity, outside of curatorial installation, the creative output of Broodwork consists mostly of events, actions, and conversations. While adults are their primary audience, Broodwork's projects, particularly workshops and installations, are often designed for the two distinct audiences of adults and children, which is atypical for a contemporary art entity whose nature is not wholly pedagogic.  Some of Broodwork's events involve parent-child interaction.

== Exhibition History ==

Broodwork has presented several major exhibitions since 2009, at venues including the [[Ben Maltz Gallery]] at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]], [[Santa Monica Museum of Art]], Trajector Art Fair (Brussels), and the Center for the Arts, Eagle Rock. These exhibitions range from large group exhibitions featuring many artists, to smaller, thematic projects featuring 3-4 artists. In exhibitions, Broodwork acts in diverse roles as curator, artist organizer, and artist. Typical for a social practice entity, some of Broodwork's projects have also been realized in non-gallery/museum spaces and via radio, or do not involve any object-making practice at all.

== Non-Exhibition Activities ==

Broodwork has acted as an advisor and collaborator to other entities and projects including the [[A+D Museum|Architecture and Design Museum]], the [[Los Angeles Forum for Architecture and Urban Design]], and the Social Practices Art Network (SPAN). The group's articles for the [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Herman Miller Company's]] LifeWork Blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herman Miller LifeWork|url=http://www.hermanmiller.com/lifework/?s=Broodwork#|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are demonstrative of the group's ongoing participation in a public dialog of [[work-life balance]] issues.

Founders Niederlander and Regn have represented the practice and the practice's themes at academic conferences, such as [[Feminist art movement in the United States#The Feminist Art Project|Feminist Art Project's]] 2014 sister conference to the [[College Art Association]] annual conference and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] Colloquy Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TFAP@CAA: The Feminist Art Project Day of Panels at the College Art Association Annual Conference 2014|url=https://feministartproject.rutgers.edu/calendar/view/3347/|publisher=Rutgers University|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abstract: Motherhood and the Exhibitionary Platform: Considering the Implications of Maternity Through the Curatorial Lens|url=https://feministartproject.rutgers.edu/media/uploads/Abstract_Chair_-_Cochran.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ubas|first=Ace|title=Listen to Colloquy: Parenthood in the Art World|url=http://sites.moca.org/thecurve/2013/03/20/listen-colloquy-parenthood-in-the-art-world/|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participants ==
Broodwork's organizational structure includes four advisors: artist and Museum Director Tibbie Dunbar, Families and Work Institute founder Ellen Galinsky, artist-educator Asuka Hisa, and Visual Understanding in Education (VUE) founder Phillip Yenawine.

Within Broodwork's own projects, collaborating artists and creatives vary from project to project, with many artists participating in multiple projects.  Due to Broodwork's emphasis on family, several collaborators have participated alongside their partners or spouses.  Below is a complete listing of the collaborators who have participated in Broodwork projects since its inception.

The '''Canadian Guild of Potters''' was a non-profit organization of Canadian ceramic artists that was active from 1936 to 1978.

==Foundation==

The founding members of the Canadian Guild of Potters were Nunzia D'Angelo, Robert Montgomery and [[Bobs Cogill Haworth]]. 
Howarth was the first honorary president, Montgomery was chairman and Molly Satterly was secretary. 
Although representing itself as a national organization, most of the early members were based in Toronto.{{sfn|Crawford|1998|p=44}}
The Guild held its first meeting on 20 March 1936. [[Mary Dignam]]'s representative invited them to become an affiliate of the [[Women's Art Association of Canada]] (WAAC) and to hold their meetings in the WAAC building at 23 Prince Arthur Avenue in Toronto.{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=163}}
Shortly after being founded, in 1936 the Canadian Guild of Potters decided to join the [[Canadian Handicrafts Guild]], based in Montreal.{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=270}}{{sfn|XV - Handicrafts 1951|p=235}}

==Activities==
[[File:Bailey Leslie at the Wheel - First Demonstration by the Canadian Guild of Potters at Eaton’s College Street Store, Toronto 1940.jpg|thumb|Bailey Leslie at the Wheel - First Demonstration by the Canadian Guild of Potters at Eaton's College Street Store, Toronto 1940]]
In the early years most of the members were amateurs and quality was a concern.  In 1943 Pearl McCarthy wrote in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', "If this art craft is to advance in quality and number of workers it will need the kind of new member who is willing to take both chemistry and art seriously."
Outside Quebec, this amateur image was an ongoing problem, although professionalism grew steadily over the years. Nunzia D'Angelo made great efforts to ensure that members could exhibit on the Ceramic National exhibitions organized by the New York State College of Ceramics.{{sfn|Morrison|2013}}

The Canadian sculptor [[Elizabeth Wyn Wood]] gave a speech on "Handicrafts in Relation to Community Art Centres in Canada". at the National Arts Club in New York City on 21 March 1945 that was reproduced in part in the summer issue of ''Canadian Art''.{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=271}}
She noted the important role of the Canadian Guild of Potters, and of ceramic educators such as [[Peter Haworth]] and [[Bobs Cogill Haworth]] at the [[Central Technical School]] in Toronto.{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=272}}

An exhibition was held in the [[Art Gallery of Toronto]] in March–April 1950 for the 50th anniversary of the gallery. All the visual art schools, styles and media were represented. The Canadian Guild of Potters was among the eight art societies that contributed to the show.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=53}}
The guild held exhibitions of ''Canadian Ceramics / Céramiques canadiennes'' in Montreal and Toronto every two years from 1955 to 1971.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=276}}
Ceramics selected from the second national Canadian Guild of Potters exhibition in 1957 were selected by jury for the ''Canadian Fine Crafts'' show that year, the first national juried crafts show in Canada.{{sfn|Alfoldy|2005|p=77}}
The Guild sent three representatives to the First World Congress of Craftsmen, held on 8–19 June 1964 at [[Columbia University]].{{sfn|Alfoldy|2005|p=29}}

The Guild eventually lost momentum, and was replaced around 1975 by an organization named Ceramic Masters Canada, later renamed Ceramists Canada.{{sfn|Hopper|2007|p=58}}{{sfn|Gotlieb|2006}}

==Members==

Noted members of the Guild included [[Florence Wyle]] (1881-1968), [[Bobs Cogill Haworth]] (1900-1988) and [[Eileen Hazell]] (1903-1984).{{sfn|List artists ... Concordia}}

In painting, a '''capriccio''' ({{IPA-it|kaˈprittʃo}}, &lt;small&gt;plural:&lt;/small&gt; ''capricci'' {{IPA-it|kaˈprittʃi|}};  in older English works often anglicized as "caprice") means an architectural fantasy, placing together buildings, archaeological ruins and other architectural elements in fictional and often fantastical combinations, and may include [[staffage]] (figures). It falls under the more general term of [[landscape painting]]. The term is also used for other artworks with an element of fantasy.

==History==
The predecessor of this type of decorative architectural paintings can be found in 16th-century Italian painting, and in particular in the architectural settings that were painted as the framework of large-scale frescoes and ceiling decorations known as [[Illusionistic ceiling painting|'quadratture']]. These architectural elements gained prominence in 17th-century painting to become stand-alone subjects of easel paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/alessandro-salucci-and-jan-miel-an-4794182-details.aspx?pos=1&amp;intObjectID=4794182&amp;sid=&amp;page=5&amp;lid=1 Alessandro Salucci (Florence 1590–1655/60 Rome) and Jan Miel (Beveren-Waes 1599–1664 Turin), ''An architectural capriccio with an ionic portico, a fountain, a two story loggia, a Gothic palace and figures on a quay''] at Christie's&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alessandro Salucci (Attr.) - Capriccio.jpg|thumb|left|Capriccio, by [[Alessandro Salucci]]]]

Early practitioners of the genre who made the genre popular in mid-17th century Rome included [[Alessandro Salucci]] and [[Viviano Codazzi]]. The artists represent two different approaches to the genre: Codazzi's capricci were more realistic than those of Salucci who showed more creativity and liberty in his approach by rearranging Roman monuments to fit his compositional objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquares.it/acquista-online/importante-architettura-di-alessandro-salucci-firenze-1590-roma-dopo-il-1650/ Importante architettura di Alessandro Salucci (Firenze 1590-Roma dopo il 1650)] at Antiquares {{link language|it|Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 'quadratture' frescoes of [[Agostino Tassi]] and the urban views of [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Herman van Swanevelt]], which he saw in Rome, may have stimulated Viviano Codazzi to start painting capricci.&lt;ref&gt;Ludovica Trezzani. "Codazzi, Viviano." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 24 Apr. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

This genre was perfected {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} by [[Marco Ricci]] (1676–1730) but its best-known proponent was the artist [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]] (1691–1765). This style was extended in the 1740s by [[Canaletto]] in his etched ''[[vedute]] ideali'', and works by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] and his imitators.

Later examples include [[Charles Robert Cockerell]]'s ''A Tribute to Sir Christopher Wren'' and ''A Professor's Dream'', and [[Joseph Gandy]]'s ''1818 Public and Private Buildings Executed by Sir John Soane''. The artist Carl Laubin has painted a number of modern capriccios in homage to these works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAL/is_/ai_n26798437 A classical fantasia: Carl Laubin has resurrected all C.R. Cockerell's major works in one ambitious, extraordinary painting], David Watkin, ''Apollo'',  March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marco Ricci - A Classical Landscape with Ruins.jpg|thumb|Classical landscape with ruins, c. 1725, by [[Marco Ricci]]]]

The term can be used more broadly for other works with a strong element of fantasy. The ''Capricci'', an influential series of [[etching]]s by [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]] (1730s?, published in 1743), reduced the architectural elements to chunks of classical statuary and ruins, among which small groups made up of a cast of exotic and elegant figures of soldiers, philosophers and beautiful young people go about their enigmatic business. No individual titles help to explain these works; mood and style are everything. A later series was called ''Scherzi di fantasia''&amp;nbsp;– "Fantastic Sketches". His son [[Domenico Tiepolo]] was among those who imitated these prints, often using the term in titles.

[[Goya]]'s series of eighty [[old master print|prints]] ''[[Los Caprichos]]'', and the last group of prints in his series ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', which he called "caprichos enfáticos" ("emphatic caprices"), are far from the spirit of light-hearted fantasy the term usually suggests. They take Tiepolo's format of a group of figures, now drawn from contemporary Spanish life, and are a series of savage satires and comments on its absurdity, only partly explicated by short titles.

'''The Chelsea Arts Club''' is a private members club at '''143 Old Church Street''' in [[Chelsea, London]] with a membership of over 3,800, including artists, sculptors, architects, writers, designers, actors, musicians, photographers, and [[filmmaker]]s. The club was established on 21 March 1891 (in Chelsea), as a rival to the older [[The Arts Club|Arts Club]] in [[Mayfair, London|Mayfair]], on the instigation of the artist [[James McNeill Whistler|James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], who had been a (sometimes controversial) member of the older club.

During its primary season from September–June the Chelsea Arts Club serves as a host for many functions, from instrumental and choral performances to visual arts exhibitions, literary talks, and weekend artist lunches.

Applicants for membership need to be sponsored by two current Members.

The club is located in the former '''Bolton Lodge''', a [[Listed building#England and Wales|Grade II listed]] building on the [[National Heritage List for England]].&lt;ref name=NHLE&gt;{{NHLE|num=1225774|desc=Bolton Lodge|access-date=8 January 2017|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chelsea Arts Club was originally located in rooms at no. 181 [[King's Road]]. In 1902, the club moved to larger premises at no. 143 [[Old Church Street]]. In 1933 the club's premises, which had an acre of garden, were remodeled.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clubhouse includes a snooker room, bedrooms, dining room, former 'ladies bar' turned private party room, and a garden.

From 1908 to 1958 the club held a series of public [[Fancy dress party|fancy dress balls]] at the [[Albert Hall]], latterly on [[New Year's Eve]], which raised funds for artists' charities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1958 balls were banned from the Albert Hall owing their notoriety for rowdiness, nudity and public homosexuality ([[Sexual Offences Act 1967|illegal before 1967]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, private functions were held at the club instead, with similarly lavish decorations and themes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1966 the club was redecorated, a new bar was opened, and membership was opened to women artists.

Although normally a plain white building, the club exterior is occasionally painted to coincide with a themed event. It has been painted by set designer Tony Common. In 2010 it was painted bright colours with images of circus performers, and in 2011 was painted to appear as if it had been bombed in order to coincide with celebrations marking 70 years since the end of [[The Blitz]].

'''''Crazy in Alabama''''' is a 1999 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Antonio Banderas]], written by [[Mark Childress]] (based on his own 1993 novel of the same name), and starring [[Melanie Griffith]], [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]], [[Lucas Black]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]], and [[Rod Steiger]]. The plot follows an abused housewife in 1965 Alabama who heads to [[California]] to become a movie star while her nephew has to deal with a racially motivated murder involving a corrupt sheriff. 

It  was filmed primarily in and around [[Houma, Louisiana]] with locations in [[Schriever, Louisiana|Schriever]], [[Chackbay, Louisiana|Chackbay]], and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] as well as [[Las Vegas]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Los Angeles]].

==Plot==
Peter Joseph "Peejoe" Bullis lives in a small town in [[Alabama]] in 1965, at the height of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Peejoe's eccentric Aunt Lucille Vinson poisons her husband Chester to death after suffering years of abuse. She decapitates him and brings his severed head with her en route to [[Hollywood]], where she is convinced that television stardom awaits her. In [[New Orleans]], Lucille purchases a black hat box to store Chester's head. When a bartender on [[Bourbon Street]] insults her, she threatens him with a [[revolver]] and robs the cash register before stealing his car. Back in Alabama, Peejoe's uncle (Lucille's brother), Dove, a local funeral director, is notified of the incident. During her travels, Lucille becomes increasingly paranoid, convinced that Chester's ghost is haunting her.

Meanwhile, Peejoe becomes involved with a group of black students protesting the town's [[Jim Crow laws|racially segregated municipal swimming pool]], leading to a protest that explodes into deadly violence. A young black boy, Taylor Jackson, is killed by the town sheriff, John Doggett. Peejoe, the only witness, is pressured by the sheriff to keep it quiet. While mowing his lawn, Peejoe is struck in the eye with a rock; the townspeople circulate a false story that he was shot in retaliation for Taylor's death. The black townspeople stage a protest honoring Taylor in which they enter the town swimming pool. Peejoe and his brother, Wiley, join them in support, but the protest is interrupted by police and white pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederates]].

Lucille wins $32,000 in [[Las Vegas]] while playing [[roulette]] at a casino, and subsequently pays for a personal driver, Norman, to bring her to Los Angeles. She arrives in Hollywood, taking the stage name Carolyn Clay, and manages to land a minor role on ''[[Bewitched]]''. Back in Alabama, and Peejoe and Wiley attend a speech by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and Peejoe's racist aunt Earline grows infuriated over the publicity involving the family. While watching television one night, they are all surprised to see Lucille on television.

At an industry party in the [[Hollywood Hills]], hostess Joan Blake discovers Chester's severed head in Lucille's hat box. Lucille flees with Norman to [[San Francisco]], and tries to get rid of the head by throwing it off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Two policemen, thinking she is about to commit suicide, stop her and discover the head. She is arrested and escorted back to Alabama for her trial, where she is met by a [[media circus]]. In the local jail, Lucille is incarcerated in a cell next to Nehemiah Jackson, Taylor's father who has been jailed over the protest.

After being convicted of [[first-degree murder]], Lucille is sentenced to twenty years in prison. However, the sentence is suspended when she earns the judge's sympathies after testifying to the abuse she received, and she is put on a five-year probation with the condition that she seek psychiatric help. Lucille, her children, and all her friends joyfully exit the courtroom while the sheriff (through Peejoe's testimony) is put under arrest for Taylor's murder.

==Reception==
''Crazy in Alabama'' received mixed though primarily poor reviews from critics, scoring a 30% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 56 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crazy in Alabama (1999)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crazy_in_alabama|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a score of 46 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 27 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crazy in Alabama|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/crazy-in-alabama|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called the film "an ungainly fit of three stories that have no business being shoehorned into the same movie," awarding it two out of four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Chicago Sun-Times|title=Crazy in Alabama Review|author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]]|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/crazy-in-alabama-1999|date=October 22, 1999|accessdate=March 9, 2018}} {{rating|2|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of that the film "takes an antic tone.

[[Lucas Black]] was nominated for the [[Young Artist Award]] for Best Performance in a Feature Film - Leading Young Actor and YoungStar Award for Best Young Actor/Performance in a Motion Picture Drama.

'''Croquis''' drawing is quick and [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]y [[drawing]] of a live [[Model (art)|model]]. Croquis drawings are usually made in a few minutes, after which the model changes pose or leaves and another croquis is drawn.

The short duration of the pose benefits models because they do not need to keep still for a long time; this also benefits the artists because it helps them concentrate on the essential elements of the pose, or the most important parts of the drawing. An artist does not have time to draw all the details, so they learn to concentrate on the important elements. Croquis is also a good method of drawing subjects that generally do not stand still and pose, such as insects, [[animal]]s, and [[child]]ren.

After the initial sketch, croquis drawing can be used as a foundation for another work of art such as a [[painting]] or may be used as a work of art itself.

The word ''croquis'' comes from [[French language|French]] and means simply "sketch".

In [[fashion]], the term refers to a quick sketch of a figure (typically nine heads tall as this is the accepted proportions for [[fashion illustration]]) with a loose drawing of the clothes that are being designed. Often a large number of croquis drawings will be created for one finished look, which is fully drawn and finished.

==Overview==
The site is fully in French, [[German language|German]], and English, with Spanish translations pending as of March 2009.&lt;ref name="pieronymus"/&gt; Its purpose is to serve as an artist's initiative and a free online social network for the international arts community.&lt;ref name="pieronymus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artslantny"/&gt; The site is designed for emerging and mid-career artists, buyers, collectors, galleries, curators, museums, and art schools to interact as a community.&lt;ref name="lulinked"/&gt; Members of the public interested in art are encouraged to join as well.&lt;ref name="pieronymus"/&gt; Different artist e-spaces can be linked together to create friends and group networks.&lt;ref name="lulinked"/&gt;

===Operations===

Gila and Dominique Paris are based in [[Luxembourg]], as is site's main office, which is at Rue Basse, 77 L-7307 Steinsel. In 2008 they began working with close friend and curator [[Frank Shifreen]] to open an office in New York City at 290 Elizabeth Street, #1R.&lt;ref name="pieronymus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lulinked"/&gt;&lt;ref name="contactus"/&gt;

In 2010 PRO Services, a professional service for the website's artists that works in connection with an art eCommerce complement, was fully integrated into the platform.&lt;ref name="contactus"/&gt; The service supports an "Art Market Place" where artists can sell original artwork and take orders for "Fine Art Prints" upon demand on museum quality paper.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt; Both the PRO Services and the eCommerce aspects&lt;ref name="contactus"/&gt; are operated by the privately owned company GATE C Sàrl in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt;

The site's stated goal is to focus on the Grand Region of the [[European Union]], focusing on supporting and integrating cultural efforts in the EU Member States.&lt;ref name="pieronymus"/&gt; Dominique and Gila Paris, founding members, have served as CultureInside board members since November 2007.&lt;ref name="lulinked"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stateofcreation"/&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Since its inception, CultureInside has used its social platform to organize and curate several exhibits and competitions, with winners premiering their work in high-class galleries and museums through the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt;

;''ROOTED'' (June 2009)

'''''Emigre''''' ({{ISSN|1045-3717}}) was a graphic design magazine published by [[Emigre (type foundry)|Emigre Graphics]] between 1984 and 2005; it was first published in 1984 in [[San Francisco, California]], United States. Art-directed by [[Rudy VanderLans]] using fonts designed by his wife, [[Zuzana Licko]], ''Emigre'' was one of the first publications to use [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers and had a large influence on graphic designers moving into [[desktop publishing]] (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications.

The focus of ''Emigre'' was both redundant and wandering — both positive qualities as a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers with Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-editors also appeared ([[Gail Swanlund]], Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the work/writing of Zuzana Licko and [[Jeffery Keedy]] reappeared throughout the magazine's history.

The magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the [[émigré]]. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and alienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led to the next stage in the magazine's evolution.

Beginning with Issue 9 — devoted to the art of [[Vaughan Oliver]] at [[4AD]] — the magazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook]], the [[Macintosh]], type design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993, the magazine chronicled the work of [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] and [[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]].

Increasingly, ''Emigre'' became a platform for essays and writings on design. This aspect of ''Emigre'' came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine changed its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue 59 in 2001.

Emigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002 that included one DVD ("Catfish," an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls) and three compact discs (featuring the music of [[Honey Barbara]], [[The Grassy Knoll (band)|The Grassy Knoll]] and Scenic.

In its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of ''Emigre'' were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]] as small softcover books. The last issue, The End, was published in 2005.

==Formats==
The magazine changed formats several times: it was originally published quarterly in a large format where each page measures 285&amp;nbsp;mm x 425&amp;nbsp;mm (slightly shorter than 11" x 17" or US ledger/tabloid size); starting with issue 33, each page was about 8.5" x 11" (US letter size); it changed into a multimedia format (a booklet where each page was 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm, plus a [[CD]] or [[DVD]]) starting with issue 60; and finally, starting with issue 64, the magazine became a book format, published semi-annually, where each page measured 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm. The issues in the book format were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]].

[[File:Entrance to the Mall Galleries.JPG|thumb|The Mall Galleries building]]
The '''Federation of British Artists''' (FBA) consists of nine art societies, and is based at '''Mall Galleries''' in [[London]] where the societies' Annual Exhibitions are held. The societies represent living artists working in the [[United Kingdom]] who create contemporary [[figurative art]]. Mall Galleries aim to ‘promote, inspire and educate audiences about the [[visual arts]].’

==Description==

The FBA has over 500 artist-members, who regularly exhibit their work and also accept open submissions from the public. In addition to the member societies, other societies and individual artists also stage shows at Mall Galleries. Over 100 prizes and awards are administered each year by the societies.

The gallery also has a commissions department and Friends organisation. The galleries' education department runs a Schools Programme, which includes gallery based workshops for Primary and Secondary school students.

Gallery projects include a drawing school and summer courses run by the [[New English Art Club]], as well as The [[Hesketh Hubbard Art Society]], the largest life drawing society in London, who meet to draw from life models.

The FBA is a registered charity, number 200048, and was established in 1961.

In February 2011 the Mall Galleries mounted an exhibition, "Pure Gold: 50 Years of the Federation of British Artists", curated by Anthony J Lester, Hon.RMS, FRBA, FRSA. An illustrated, 100 page catalogue ({{ISBN|978-0-9560219-3-9}}) was published to accompany the show.

The '''film industry''' or '''motion picture industry''', comprises the technological and commercial institutions of [[filmmaking]], i.e., film [[production company|production companies]], [[film studio]]s, [[cinematography]], [[animation]], [[film production]], [[screenwriting]], [[pre-production]], [[post production]], [[film festival]]s, [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[actor]]s, [[film director]]s and other [[film crew]] personnel.

Though the expense involved in making [[film]]s almost immediately led film production to concentrate under the auspices of standing production companies, advances in affordable film making equipment, and expansion of opportunities to acquire investment capital from outside the film industry itself, have allowed [[independent film]] production to evolve. [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] is the oldest film industry of the world, and the largest in terms of box office gross revenue. [[Indian cinema]] (including [[Bollywood]]) is the largest film industry in terms of the number of films produced and the number of tickets sold, with 3.5 billion tickets sold worldwide annually (compared to Hollywood's 2.6 billion tickets sold annually)&lt;ref&gt;Matusitz, J., &amp; Payano, P.

Distinct from the centers are the locations where movies are filmed. Because of labor and infrastructure costs, many films are produced in countries other than the one in which the company which pays for the film is located. For example, many U.S. movies are filmed in Canada, many Nigerian movies are filmed in [[Ghana]], while many Indian movies are filmed in the Americas, Europe, [[Singapore]] etc.

[[File:Hollywood Sign (Zuschnitt).jpg|thumb|The [[Hollywood Sign]]|226x226px]]
The [[cinema of the United States]], often generally referred to as '''Hollywood''', has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century. The United States cinema (Hollywood) is the oldest film industry in the world which originated more than 121 years ago and also the largest film industry in terms of revenue. [[Hollywood]] is the primary nexus of the U.S. film industry with established film study facilities such as the [[American Film Institute]], [[LA Film School]] and NYFA being established in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyfa.edu/los-angeles/ Los Angeles Film Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; However, four of the [[Major film studio#Today's Big Six|six major film studios]] are owned by [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] companies. The [[major film studios]] of Hollywood including [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] are the primary source of the [[List of highest-grossing films|most commercially successful movies in the world]], such as  ''[[Star Wars]]'' (1977), and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).

American film studios today collectively generate several hundred movies every year, making the United States one of the most prolific producers of films in the world. Only [[The Walt Disney Company]] — which owns [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the Walt Disney Studios]] — is fully based in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donckels|first=William|title=Disney Raises SoCal Annual Pass Prices 30% - to Keep Locals "Out"|url=http://technorati.com/business/article/disney-raises-socal-annual-pass-prices/|publisher=Technorati.com|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] is headquartered in Culver City, California, its parent company, the [[Sony Corporation]], is headquartered in [[Tokyo]], Japan. Most shooting now takes place in [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Louisiana]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[North Carolina]]. Hollywood is the most popular film industry with the highest number of screens, and is the highest-grossing film industry in the world. Between 2009-2015, Hollywood consistently grossed $10 billion (or more) annually.&lt;ref&gt;Number of total movies in 2014 are taken from http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood's award ceremony, the [[Academy Awards]], officially known as The Oscars, is held by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) every year and a total of 2,947 Oscars have been awarded since the inception of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oscar Statuette|url = http://www.oscars.org/oscars/statuette|website = Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in [[Richmond, Indiana]] by [[Charles Francis Jenkins]] which makes [[Cinema of the United States|United States cinema]] the earliest cinema in the whole world. Jenkins used his Phantoscope to project his film before an audience of family, friends and reporters. The film featured a vaudeville dancer performing a Butterfly Dance. Jenkins and his new partner [[Thomas Armat]] modified the Phantoscope for exhibitions in temporary theaters at the Cotton States Exposition in the fall of 1895. The Phantoscope was later sold to [[Thomas Edison]], who changed the name of the projector to Edison's Vitascope.
[[File:Nestor studio 1911.jpg|thumb|223x223px|Nestor studio, 1911]]
[[Nestor Studios]] was Hollywood's first movie studio, founded on 27 October 1911. It was built by [[David Horsley]] for Nestor Motion Picture Company. It was then owned and operated by [[David Horsley]] and his brother, William Horsley. The first [[Sound stage|motion picture stage]] in Hollywood was built behind the tavern. Other [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move
west. The California weather allowed for year-round filming and the ambitious studio operated three principal divisions under its Canadian-born general manager, [[Al Christie]]. Other [[Filmmaking|filmmakers]] began opening studios in the [[Hollywood]] area. The Horsleys operated the [[Nestor Studios]] at the Sunset and Gower location until 20 May 1912, when the [[Universal Studios]] was formed, headed by [[Carl Laemmle]]. Nestor, along with several other motion picture companies, including Laemmle's [[Independent Moving Pictures]] (IMP), was merged with Universal.

The '''Cinema of China''' is one of three distinct historical threads of [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] [[film|cinema]] together with the [[cinema of Hong Kong]] and the [[cinema of Taiwan]]. Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]'', was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on [[Shanghai]] in the first decades. China is the home of the largest film studio in the world, the [[Hengdian World Studios]], and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving [[Entrepôt|entrepot]] and the largest city in the [[Far East]]. In 1913, the first independent Chinese [[screenplay]], ''[[The Difficult Couple]]'', was filmed in [[Shanghai]] by [[Zheng Zhengqiu]] and [[Zhang Shichuan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = East Asian Cinema|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Nydlzbe2LhEC|publisher = Oldcastle Books, Limited|date = 4 November 2010|isbn = 9781842433805|first = David|last = Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget.

''Still Life'' was a surprise addition and [[Golden Lion]] winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. ''Still Life'', which concerns provincial workers around the [[Three Gorges]] region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth [[Generation]] Chinese directors like [[Zhang Yimou]] and [[Chen Kaige]] who were at the time producing ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004) and ''The Promise'' (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts. In 2014, the gross box office in China was [[Renminbi|¥]]29.6 billion ([[United States dollar|US$]]4.82 billion), with domestic films having a share of 55%.

The 1940s, 1950s and the 1960s are generally considered the [[golden age]] of Egyptian cinema. As in the West, films responded to the popular imagination, with most falling into predictable [[Film genre|genres]] (happy endings being the norm), and many actors making careers out of playing strongly typed parts. In the words of one critic, "If an Egyptian film intended for popular audiences lacked any of these prerequisites, it constituted a betrayal of the unwritten contract with the spectator, the results of which would manifest themselves in the box office."&lt;ref name="retrospection"&gt;Farid, Samir, [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/462/cinema.htm "Lights, camera...retrospection"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511112523/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/462/cinema.htm |date=11 May 2013 }}, ''[[Al-Ahram]] Weekly'', 30 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, Egypt's cinema has gone in separate directions.

The term "'''cinema of Korea'''" (or "'''Korean cinema'''") encompasses the motion picture industries of [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late [[Joseon dynasty]] to [[Korean War|the Korean War]] to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim.

{{see also|Cinema of Hong Kong|Cinema of China|East Asian cinema}}
[[Hong Kong]] is a filmmaking hub for the Chinese-speaking world (including the worldwide [[diaspora]]) and East Asia in general.  For decades it was the third largest motion picture industry in the world (after Bollywood and Hollywood) and the second largest exporter of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Patrick J.|title=Hong Kong to Hollywood:  A "ridiculous amount of interest" in Hong Kong cinema is redefining Tinseltown|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/hong_kong_to_hollywood_3279/|publisher=Moviemaker.com|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an industry crisis starting in the mid-1990s and Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 Hong Kong film has retained much of its distinctive identity and continues to play a prominent part on the world cinema stage.
Unlike many film industries, Hong Kong has enjoyed little to no direct government support, through either subsidies or import quotas.  It has always been a thoroughly commercial cinema, concentrating on crowd-pleasing [[film genre|genres]], like comedy and action, and heavily reliant on formulas, sequels and remakes.  Typically of commercial cinemas, its heart is a highly developed [[star system (film)|star system]], which in this case also features substantial overlap with the [[Cantopop|pop music industry]].

=== Pakistan ===
{{see also|Cinema of Pakistan|Lollywood}}
The '''cinema of Pakistan''', or simply, '''Pakistani cinema''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|پاکستانی سنیما}}}}) refers to [[Pakistan]]'s film industry. Most of the feature films shot in Pakistan are in [[Urdu]], the national language, but may also include films in English, the official language, and regional languages such as [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], and [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]. [[Lahore]] has been described as the epicentre of Pakistani cinema, giving rise to the term "[[Lollywood]]."

Before the separation of Bangladesh, Pakistan had three main film production centres: [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Dhaka]]. The regime of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], [[Video cassette recorder|VCR]]s, [[film piracy]], the introduction of entertainment taxes, strict laws based upon ultra-conservative jurisprudence, was an obstacle to the industry's growth.&lt;ref name="dawn.com"&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1045365&lt;/ref&gt; Once thriving, the cinema in Pakistan had a sudden collapse in the 1980s and by the 2000s "an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out more than two films a year.".&lt;ref&gt;an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out more than two films a year.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bollywhat.com/beyond/pakistani.html The Beginner's Guide to Pakistani Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the industry has recently made a dramatic and remarkable comeback, evident from the fact that 18 of the 21 highest grossing Pakistani movies were released from 2013 through to the present, with Pakistani films frequently outcompeting Bollywood movies for the Pakistani audience, the industry is supported by Pakistani channels such as ARY and Geo whose entertainment divisions have invested significantly in Pakistani cinema when expanding from providing news and entertainment on TV channels, the lifting of strict regulations on production of films and reduction of taxes on cinemas helped to fuel an expansion across the industry from which the film industry has seen a revival.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Bangladesh ===
{{see also|Cinema of Bangladesh|Dhallywood}}
The '''cinema of Bangladesh''' is the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language film industry based in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]. The industry often has been a significant film industry since the early 1970s. The word "Dhallywood" is a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and [[Hollywood]]. The dominant style of Bangladeshi cinema is [[Melodrama|Melodramatic cinema]], which developed from 1947 to 1990 and characterizes most films to this day. Cinema was introduced in Bangladesh in 1898 by Bradford Bioscope Company, credited to have arranged the first film release in Bangladesh. Between 1913 and 1914, the first production company named Picture House was opened. A short silent film titled ''Sukumari'' (''The Good Girl'') was the first produced film in the region during 1928. The first full-length film ''The Last Kiss'', was released in 1931. From the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, Dhaka is the center of Bangladeshi film industry, and generated the majority share of revenue, production and audiences. The 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and the first half of the 1990s were the golden years for Bangladeshi films as the industry produced many successful films. ''[[Mukh O Mukhosh|The Face and the Mask]]'', the first Bengali language Bangladeshi full-length feature film was produced in 1956.&lt;ref name=cholochitro&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Bangladeshi Film|url=http://www.cholochitro.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=49|website=cholochitro.com|publisher=Cholochitro|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukh O Mukhosh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mukh O Mukhosh |url=http://www.bfa.gov.bd/movie/details.html?id=100 |publisher=bfa.gov.bd |accessdate=14 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129021323/http://www.bfa.gov.bd/movie/details.html?id=100 |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign films include major box offices from the west, and other major film producers of the world. This has caused a massive ripple effect on the country's economy. It is assumed that this increases the purchase of unlicensed DVDs. However, even copyright violating DVDs took longer to obtain. The minimum cost to view a foreign film not screened locally, was 1 million Rupiah.

Movies such as “Ivan the Terrible” (2004), “[[SistaGod]]” (2006), “I’m Santana: The Movie” (2012) and “God Loves the Fighter” (2013) were released both locally and internationally. “SistaGod” had its world premiere at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pires|first1=BC|title=SistaGod Put a Hand|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2014-01-27/sistagod-put-hand|work=Trinidad and Tobago Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trinidad and Tobago Film Company]] is the national agency that was established in 2006 to further development of the film industry. Trinidad and Tobago puts on a number of film festivals which are organized by different committees and organizations. These include the Secondary Schools Short Film Festival and Smartphone Film Festival organized by Trinidad and Tobago Film Company. There is also an annual [[Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival]] which runs for two weeks in the latter half of September.

=== Nepal ===
{{main|Kallywood}}
Nepali film does not have a very long movie history, but the industry has its own place in the cultural heritage of the country. It is often referred to as 'Nepali Chalchitra' (which translates to "Nepali movies" in English). The terms Kollywood and Kallywood are also used, as a portmanteau of "Kathmandu" and "Hollywood"; "Kollywood" however is more frequently used to refer to Tamil cinema.[1] [[Chhakka Panja]] has been considered the highest-grossing movie of all time in Nepali Movie Industry and Kohinoor the second highest. Nepali movies has recently begun receiving international acclaim with films such as [[The Black Hen]] (2015), [[Kagbeni (film)|Kagbeni]] (2006) and others. Nepali feature film [[White Sun]] (Seto Surya) has bagged the Best Film award at [http://sgiff.com/ the 27th Singapore International Film Festival] (SGIFF)(2016).

The Film Development Board (FDB) was established by the Government of Nepal for the development and promotion of the Nepali film industry. The Board is a liaison to facilitate the conceptualization, making, distribution and exhibition of Nepali films nationally. The Board attempts to bridge the gap between film entrepreneurship and government bureaucracy. The Board is a balance between the people at large, the government, and the process of film making. It is intended to act as the safeguard of the interests of the people, the watchdog of the government, and the advocate of filmmakers.

The first [[feature film]] to be made was the 1906 Australian silent ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', an account of the notorious gang led by [[Ned Kelly]] that was directed and produced by the [[Melbourne|Melburnians]] Dan Barry and [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]]. It ran, continuously, for eighty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Story of the Kelly Gang |url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang/notes/ |publisher=Australian Screen, National Film and Sound Archive |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1910s, the film industry had fully emerged with D.W. Griffith's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.

=== Hollywood ===
The earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in [[Richmond, Indiana]] by [[Charles Francis Jenkins]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The first [[movie studio]] in the Hollywood area, [[Nestor Studios]], was founded in 1911 by [[Al Christie]] for [[David Horsley]] in an old building on the northwest corner of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and Gower Street.  In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood.  Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word "Hollywood" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.

In 1913 [[Cecil B. DeMille]], in association with [[Jesse Lasky]], leased a barn with studio facilities on the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets from the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory, which had been established there.  DeMille then began production of ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914). It became known as the [[Lasky-DeMille Barn]] and is currently the location of the [[Hollywood Heritage Museum]].

The [[Charlie Chaplin]] Studios, on the northeast corner of La Brea and De Longpre Avenues just south of Sunset Boulevard, was built in 1917.  It has had many owners after 1953, including Kling Studios, which housed production for the [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|''Superman'' TV series]] with [[George Reeves]]; [[Red Skelton]], who used the [[sound stage]]s for his [[CBS]] TV [[variety show]]; and CBS, who filmed the TV series ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' with [[Raymond Burr]] there.  It has also been owned by [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&amp;M Records]] and Tijuana Brass Enterprises.  It is currently The [[Jim Henson]] Company, home of the [[Muppets]]. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named the studio a historical cultural monument.

The famous [[Hollywood Sign]] originally read "Hollywoodland." It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. For several years the sign was left to deteriorate. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and offered to remove the last four letters and repair the rest.

The sign, located at the top of Mount Lee, is now a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which also manages the venerable [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Walk of Fame]].

The first [[Academy Awards]] presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929, during a banquet held in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Tickets were [[United States dollar|USD]] $10.00 {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and there were 250 people in attendance.

From about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[RKO]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Warner Bros.]], owned large, grand [[Movie theater|theaters]] throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies.  The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the "Hollywood studio system", or, in a more common term, the ''[[History of cinema#The Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age of Hollywood]]''.  In a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|landmark 1948 court decision]], the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and [[movie star]]s, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended.  By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.

''The Wrestlers'' (1899) and ''The Man and His Monkeys'' (1899), directed and produced by Harischandra Sakharam Bhatawdekar ([[H. S. Bhatavdekar]]), were the first two films made by Indian filmmakers, which were both short films. He was also the first Indian filmmaker to direct and produce the first documentary and news related film, titled ''The Landing of Sir M.M. Bhownuggree''.

''Pundalik'' (''[[Shree Pundalik]]'') (1912), by [[Dadasaheb Torne]] alias Rama Chandra Gopal, and ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913), by [[Dadasaheb Phalke]], were the first and second silent feature films respectively made in India.&lt;ref name="Guinness Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=Patrick|title=The Guinness Book of Movie Facts &amp; Feats|date=1988|publisher=Guinness Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-85112-899-8|page=8|edition=1988}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dainik Asam Assamese daily"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deka|first1=Arnab Jan|title=Fathers of Indian Cinema Bhatawdekar and Torney|publisher=Dainik Asam (Assamese daily)|date=27 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narwekar|first1=Sanjit|title=Marathi Cinema : In Retrospect|date=January 1995|publisher=Maharashtra Film, Stage &amp; Cultural Development Corporation Ltd|location=Bombay, India|pages=9–12|edition=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firoze Rangoonwalla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangoonwalla|first1=Firoze|title=A Pictorial History of Indian Cinema|date=1979|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=London, New York, Sydney, Toronto|isbn=0-600-34909-8|page=12|edition=1979}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s the industry was producing more than 200 films per annum.&lt;ref name="britannica2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gulzar |author2=Nihalani, Govind |author3=Chatterji, Saibal |title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema|year=2003|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica (India) Pvt Ltd.|isbn=81-7991-066-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC|pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Indian sound film, [[Ardeshir Irani]]'s ''[[Alam Ara]]'' (1931), was a major commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060326/spectrum/main1.htm Talking Images, 75 Years of Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; There was clearly a huge market for talkies and musicals; Bollywood and all the regional film industries quickly switched to sound filming. ''[[Joymoti (1935 film)]]'' by [[Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla]] was the first Indian dubbed film, released in Calcutta on 10 March 1935. Till then, all dialogues of all talkies were had to be recorded at locations during the shooting of the film. Through ''[[Joymoti (1935 film)]]'', dubbing technology was successfully introduced to Indian cinema by Assamese filmmaker [[Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla]].&lt;ref name="Dainik Asam Assamese daily"/&gt;

The 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times: India was buffeted by the [[Great Depression]], World War II, the [[Indian independence movement]], and the violence of the [[Partition of India|Partition]]. Most Bollywood films were unabashedly [[escapism|escapist]], but there were also a number of filmmakers who tackled tough social issues, or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their plots.&lt;ref name="britannica2"/&gt;

In 1937 [[Ardeshir Irani]], of ''[[Alam Ara]]'' fame, made the first colour film in Hindi, ''[[Kisan Kanya (1937 film)|Kisan Kanya]]''. The next year, he made another colour film, a version of ''Mother India''. However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.

Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]], the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is regarded by film historians as the "Golden Age" of Hindi cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=K.

== Economics ==
{{main|Economics of the arts and literature}}

Profitability of a [[film studio]] is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to [[film promotion]], control over receipts through technologies such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), [[Hollywood accounting|sophisticated accounting practices]], and management of [[tie-in|ancillary revenue streams]]; in the extreme, for a major [[media franchise]] centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.

Substantial revenues might also derive from [[license|licensing]] efforts and other activities centered around the management of [[intellectual property]]; for this reason, various national film industries are [[lobbying|heavily invested]] in the politics and legal specifics of multilateral [[trade agreement]]s. Hollywood is a large enough industry to impact America's net [[balance of trade]], offsetting some of the decline of employment in the manufacturing sector of the American economy since the early 1980s; typical of recent economic trends in [[first world]] economies, a large number of manufacturing jobs paying moderate wages are offset by a smaller number of creating jobs paying high wages. As an intellectual property industry, the film industry (along with the [[software industry]]) are central to modern [[globalization]].

The film industry differs from software, however, in functioning primarily as a cultural export. English-language culture is the most globalized of all cultures, despite China and India having internal populations to rival the global English footprint. For this reason, Hollywood is the dominant film industry in globalism and trade. India has both a large film industry and a large, internal English-language culture, though Bollywood has not yet become a center for English-language film exports on a major scale. Films designed for global export tend to be films centered on action rather than dialogue, especially nuanced dialogue which is not fully available to people speaking [[English as a second language]] (ESL). Unusually, Japanese [[Anime]] has a global audience, though these are sometimes dubbed into English by star-power Hollywood voice actors.&lt;!-- several recent Ghibli productions --&gt;

On the creative side, picking the right projects has traditionally been regarded as high risk. Increasingly the risk is being mitigated with approaches drawn from advanced [[data analytics]], such as using models derived from [[machine learning]] (sometimes glorified as [[artificial intelligence|AI]]) to estimate the future revenue of a proposed project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-box-office-predictions/|title=Could Artificial Intelligence Predict the Next Avengers: Infinity War?|last1=Bay |first1=Scott |date=30 April 2018 |website=wired.com |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Girl with Ball''''' is a 1961 painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. It is an oil on canvas [[Pop art]] work that is now in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], after being owned for several decades by [[Philip Johnson]]. It is one of Lichtenstein's earliest Pop art works and is known for its source, which is a newspaper ad that ran for several decades and which was among Lichtenstein's earliest works sourced from pop culture.

''Girl with Ball'' was exhibited at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and was displayed in ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'s}} review of the show. This work significantly alters the original source and is considered exemplary of Lichtenstein's works that exaggerate the mechanically produced appearance although the result of his painterly work. It is an enduring depiction of the contemporary beauty figure.

==Background==
[[File:Girl with Ball source.jpg|thumb|left|The source of ''Girl with Ball'' was a common advertisement image.]]
''Girl with Ball'' was inspired by a 1961 advertisement for the [[Mount Airy Lodge]] in the [[Pocono Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Art and Popular Culture: Readings in High &amp; Low|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]] and [[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]]|editor=[[Kirk Varnedoe|Varnedoe, Kirk]] and Adam Gopink|year=1990|isbn=0-8109-2466-8|chapter=Illustrations (numbers 220 &amp; 221)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad, which started running in 1955, was widely published in the [[New York metropolitan area]] and elsewhere, including several prominent newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Waldman|page=55|chapter=Comic Strips and Advertising Images}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement was still running in newspapers more than twenty years after Lichtenstein produced the work.&lt;ref name=RLLA&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|last=Alloway |first=Lawrence |author-link=Lawrence Alloway|isbn=0-89659-331-2|publisher=[[Abbeville Press]]|year=1983|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, in autumn 1961, a fellow teacher at [[Rutgers University]] named [[Allan Kaprow]] made introductions between Lichtenstein and [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery director [[Ivan Karp]]. Lichtenstein showed Karp several paintings including ''Girl with Ball'', which was the one that intrigued Karp. Karp agreed to represent Lichtenstein weeks later. After showing the painting to [[Andy Warhol]], he sold it to architect [[Philip Johnson]] that November. The painting appeared in ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'s}} 1962 review of Lichtenstein's Castelli Gallery show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/frames.htm|title=Chronology|accessdate=May 9, 2012|publisher=Roy Lichtenstein Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507132503/http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/frames.htm|archivedate=May 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work appeared in the April 3, 1963 "Pop! Goes the Easel" show at the [[Contemporary Arts Museum Houston]] along with his ''Brattata'' (1962) and ''Head-Red and Yellow'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: An International Perspective|editor=Livingstone, Marco|year=1991|isbn=0-8478-1475-0|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications, Inc.|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Girl with Ball'' depicts a woman wearing a bathing suit holding a beach ball with red stripes in the same color as her lips and tongue.&lt;ref name=RLLA/&gt; Lichtenstein used a painter's version of [[comic strip]] artist techniques to create his own rendition of the subject of a nostalgic photograph, resulting in a simplified work of art with its own appeal. He produced the work using [[Ben-Day dots]] of [[primary color]]s. The process is described as exaggerating the "limitations of mechanical reproduction" to strip the photograph of its polish in a startling and intense form. In 1961, this painting was groundbreaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Museum of Modern Art, MoMA Highlights|location=New York|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|origyear=1999|year=2004|page=238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facial features such as nose and mouth are depicted using "commercial shorthand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Classic of the New|editor=Schneider, Eckhard|publisher=[[Kunsthaus Bregenz]]|year=2005|isbn=3-88375-965-1|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His process of reworking original artwork is described as "abstraction by subtraction", in which all features of the original are reduced to simple graphic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Coplans, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein alters the planar position of the subject of the picture to position her "nearer to the picture plane". He drew the picture more distorted than might be expected of a cartoonist by augmenting and focusing on her two-dimensionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Waldman, Diane|pages=49–55|publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]|year=1993|isbn=0-89207-108-7|chapter=Comic Strips and Advertising Images}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The image and technique were regarded as unartistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Continuing History|author=Livingstone, Marco|publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]]|isbn=0-500-28240-4|year=2000|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the painting presented an allusion to printing technology, with its Ben-Day dots, and to art history, with its "[[Art Nouveau]] forms". Though "crude and simplistic" the work demonstrates artistic intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Meanings of Modern Art|last=Russell |first=John |author-link=John Russell (art critic) |publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row, Publishers]]|isbn=0-06-013701-0|page=346|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Girl with Ball'' is described by Diane Waldman as "striking" in the simple and bold way it presents a vacation atmosphere. She notes it is "reminiscent of [[Picasso]]'s frolicking bather in one of his paintings on the subject, ''Bather with Beach Ball'' (fig. 48), 1932," especially in the way Lichtenstein has scaled down the representation and the way he depicts movement.&lt;ref name="RLDW55"/&gt;

The newspaper ad source provided Lichtenstein with "one of the most common tropes of the day for the image of a woman." The updated [[Betty Grable]]-type subject, was a fashionable glamor figure that Lichtenstein used for a symbolic value that ranks her with "iconoclastic female figures, including [[Manet]]'s ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', 1863, [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', 1907 and [[Willem de Kooning|de Kooning]]'s three series of ''[[Woman III|Women]]''".&lt;ref name=RLDW55&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Waldman, Diane|page=55|publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]|year=1993|isbn=0-89207-108-7|chapter=Comic Strips and Advertising Images}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hand of God''', or '''Manus Dei''' in Latin, also known as '''Dextera domini/dei''', the "[[right hand of God]]", is a motif in [[Jew]]ish and [[Christian art]], especially of the [[Late Antique]] and [[Early Medieval]] periods, when depiction of [[Jehovah]] or [[God the Father]] as a full human figure was considered unacceptable. The hand, sometimes including a portion of an arm, or ending about the wrist, is used to indicate the intervention in or approval of affairs on Earth by God, and sometimes as a subject in itself. It is an artistic metaphor that is generally not intended to indicate that a hand was physically present or seen at any subject depicted. The Hand is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a [[blessing]] gesture (in Christian examples), but sometimes performing an action. In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a [[God the Father in Western art|fully realized figure of God the Father]], whose depiction had become acceptable in [[Western Christianity]], although not in [[Eastern Orthodox]] or Jewish art.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01141.html "Anthropomorphism"], Jewish Virtual Library, especially the section on Jewish art near the end.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the hand of God has traditionally been understood as a symbol for God's intervention or approval of human affairs, it is also possible that the hand of God reflects the anthropomorphic conceptions of the deity that may have persisted in late antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Bar Ilan, 321–35; Roth, 191; C. W. Griffith and David Paulsen, 97–118; Jensen, 120–21; Paulsen, 105–16; Jill Joshowitz, ''The Hand of God:The Anthropomorphic God of Late Antique Judaism: Archaeological and Textual Perspectives'', (B.A. thesis, Yeshiva University, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The largest group of Jewish imagery from the ancient world, the 3rd century [[Dura-Europos synagogue|synagogue at Dura-Europas]], has the hand of God in five different scenes, including the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'',&lt;ref&gt;Hachili, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; and no doubt this was one of the many iconographic features taken over by Christian art from what seems to have been a vigorous tradition of Jewish narrative art. Here and elsewhere it often represents the ''[[bath Kol]]'' (literally "daughter of a voice") or voice of God,&lt;ref&gt;A matter disputed by some scholars&lt;/ref&gt; a use also taken over into Christian art.

The hand may also relate to older traditions in various other religions in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Summarized by Hachili, 145&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Amarna art|art of the Amarna period]] in Egypt under [[Akhenaten]], the rays of the [[Aten]] sun-disk end in small hands to suggest the bounty of the supreme deity. Like the [[hamsa]] [[amulet]], the hand is sometimes shown alone on buildings, although it does not seem to have existed as a portable [[amulet]]-type object in Christian use. It is found from the 4th century on in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], including paintings of ''Moses receiving the Law'' and the ''Sacrifice of Isaac''.&lt;ref&gt;Hachili, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous references to the hand, or arm, of God in the [[Hebrew Bible]], most clearly metaphorical in the way that remains current in modern English, but some capable of a literal interpretation.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism" /&gt; They are usually distinguished from references to a placement at the [[right hand of God]]. Later [[rabbinic literature]] also contains a number of references. There are three occasions in the gospels when the voice of God is heard, and the hand often represents this in visual art.&lt;ref&gt;"in Ravenna and in Western art from the ninth until the eleventh centuries" according to Schiller I, 149, although Western examples of the hand in depictions of these occasions extend well before and after these dates.&lt;/ref&gt; Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II 674 (Index headings)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sacred texts and commentary==
[[File:Abraham und Isaak.JPG|thumb|left|The Hand of God intervenes at the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'', [[Culture of Armenia|Armenian]], [[Akdamar Island|Akdamar]], 10th century]]

===Hebrew Bible===
The hand of God, which encompasses God's arm and fingers as well, is one of the most frequently employed anthropomorphisms of the Hebrew Bible. References to the hand of God occur numerous times in the Pentateuch alone, particularly in regards to the unfolding narrative of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (cf. Exodus 3:19–20, Exodus 14: 3, 8, 31).&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of scholarship on anthropomorphism in biblical and rabbinic Judaism see Meir Bar Ilan, "The Hand of God: A Chapter in Rabbinic Anthropomorphism", in Rashi 1040–1990 ''Hommage a Ephraim'' E. Urbach ed. Gabrielle Sed Rajna. (1993): 321–35; Edmond Cherbonnier, "The Logic of Biblical Anthropomorphism", ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'' 55.3 (1962): 187–206; Alon Goshen Gottstein, "The Body as Image of God In Rabbinic Literature", ''Harvard Theological Review'' 87.2 (1994): 171–95; Jacob Neusner, ''The Incarnation of God'' (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1988); Morton Smith, "On the Shape of God and Humanity of Gentiles", in ''Religion in Antiquity'' ed. Jacob Neusner (Leiden: Brill, 1968), 315–26; David Stern, "Imitatio Hominis: Anthropomorphism and the Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature", ''[[Prooftexts (journal)|Prooftexts]]'' 12.2 (1992): 151– 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
There are no references to the hand of God as an active agent or witness in the New Testament, though there are several to Jesus standing or sitting by the [[right hand of God]] in God's heavenly court,&lt;ref&gt;Mark 16:19, Luke 22:69, Matthew 22:44 and 26:64, Acts 2:34 and 7:55, 1 Peter 3:22&lt;/ref&gt; a conventional term for the place of honour beside a host or senior family member. For example, when Stephen is filled with the "holy spirit" he looks to heaven and sees Jesus standing by the right hand of God (Acts 7:55). There are three occasions in the [[Gospels]] when the voice of God is heard, and the hand of God often represents this in visual art.&lt;ref&gt;"in Ravenna and in Western art from the ninth until the eleventh centuries" according to Schiller I, 149, although Western examples of the hand in depictions of these occasions extend well before and after these dates.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbinic literature===
[[Anthropomorphic]] [[aggadot]] regarding the hand of God appear frequently in the corpus of rabbinic literature and expand upon anthropomorphic biblical narratives.

==Christian art==
[[File:Apsis mosaic San Clemente n2.jpg|thumb|right|Clothed hand clutching wreath, [[San Clemente, Rome]], 1140–43.]]
In Christian art, the hand of God has traditionally been understood as an artistic metaphor that is not intended to indicate that the deity was physically present or seen in any subject depicted. In the late antique and early medieval periods, the representation of the full-bodied figure of God the Father would have been considered a grave violation of the Second Commandment.&lt;ref&gt;Linda and Peter Murray, "Trinity", in ''The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), 544.&lt;/ref&gt; According to conventional art historical interpretation, the representation of the hand of God in early Christian art thus developed as a necessary and symbolic compromise to the highly anti-anthropomorphic tenor of the Second Commandment, though anthropomorphic interpretations are certainly plausible.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Griffith and David Paulsen, "Augustine and the Corporeality of God", ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'' 95.1 (2002): 97–118; Robin Jensen, Face to Face: Portraits of the Divine in Early Christianity (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2005), 120–21; David Paulsen, "Early Christian Belief in a Corporeal Deity: Origen and Augustine as Reluctant Witnesses", Harvard Theological Review, 83.2 (1990): 105–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In early Christian and Byzantine art, the hand of God is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a [[blessing]] gesture, but sometimes performing an action. Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II 674 (Index headings)&lt;/ref&gt; In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a [[God the Father in Western art|fully realized figure of God the Father]], whose depiction had become acceptable in [[Western Christianity]], although not in [[Eastern Orthodox]] or Jewish art.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism" /&gt;

===Iconography===
The motif of the hand, with no body attached, provides a problem for the artist in how to terminate it. In Christian narrative images the hand most often emerges from a small cloud, at or near the top of the image, but in iconic contexts it may appear cut off in the picture space, or spring from a border, or a victor's [[wreath]] (left). A cloud is mentioned as the source of the voice of God in the gospel accounts of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] (see below). Several of the examples in the [[Dura Europos synagogue]] (see below) show a good part of the forearm as well as the hand, which is not found in surviving Christian examples, and most show an open palm, sometimes with the fingers spread out. Later examples in Jewish art are closer in form to Christian styles.

In Christian art, the hand of God usually occupies the form of a blessing gesture, if they are not performing an action, though some just show an open hand. The normal blessing gesture is to point with the index and next finger, with the other fingers curled back and thumb relaxed. There is also a more complicated Byzantine gesture that attempts to represent the Greek letter ''[[Chi (letter)|chi]]'', [[Christ]]'s initial, which looks like a Latin letter "X". This is formed by crossing the thumb and little finger inside the palm, with only the forefinger and next one extended,&lt;ref&gt;Didron, I, 201–3&lt;/ref&gt; or a variant of this.

Especially in Roman mosaics, but also in some German imperial commissions, for example on the [[Lothair Cross]], the hand is clenched around a wreath that goes upwards, and behind which the arm then disappears, forming a tidy circular motif. Especially in these examples, the hand may show the sleeve of a garment, sometimes of two layers, as at [[San Clemente, Rome]]. In blessing forms the hand often has a [[Halo (art)|halo]], which also may provide a convenient termination point. This may or may not be a cruciform halo, indicating the divinity, and specifically the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], or [[Pre-existing Christ]] (see below).
[[File:San Pedro de la Nave capitel.JPG|thumb|left|[[Visigoth]]ic capital with the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]''.]]

The hand is regularly seen in depictions of certain scenes, though it may occur on occasion in a much wider range.&lt;ref&gt;See index of Schiller II under "Hand of God"&lt;/ref&gt; In many scenes one or more angels, acting as the messengers of God, may appear instead of the hand. A virtually unique mosaic depiction of the ''[[Ark of the Covenant]]'' (806) at [[Germigny-des-Prés]], also features the hand of God.

In Christian art the hand will often actually represent the hand of [[God the Son]], or the Logos; this is demonstrated when later depictions start to substitute for the Hand a small half-length portrait of Christ as Logos in a similar circular frame. It is nearly always Christ in the East, but in the West God the Father will sometimes be shown in this way. However, in many contexts the person of the Trinity intended cannot be confirmed from the image alone, except in those images, like the ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]'', where Jesus the [[Incarnate Christ]] is also present, where the hand is clearly that of God the Father. Later [[Eastern Orthodox]] images often identify Hands as the Logos with the usual monogram used in [[icon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example [[:File:St George - Pskov school.jpg|in this icon]], as compared to [[:File:Borisgleb riding.jpg|this one]], which shows the Hand replaced with a Christ/Logos.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Old Testament imagery====
*In the [[Vienna Genesis]] the hand appears above the ''Expulsion of [[Adam and Eve]] from [[Paradise]]''. More often, God was shown in this story using the conventional [[depiction of Jesus]] representing the pre-existent Christ or ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', who was seen as the Creator by Early Christian writers,&lt;ref&gt;The account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] naturally credits the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father. However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the [[Logos]].&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Adam and Eve was the Old Testament subject most frequently seen in Christian art that needed a pictorial representation of God. A well known modern variant of the traditional hand motif is a sculpture of 1898 by [[Auguste Rodin]] called the ''Hand of God'', which shows a gigantic hand creating Adam and Eve.
*The [[Sacrifice of Isaac]] first appears in Christian art in 4th century depictions from the Roman catacombs and sarcophagi, as well as pieces like a fragment from a marble table from [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Weitzmann|Weitzmann, Kurt]], ed., ''[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/156533 Age of spirituality : late antique and early Christian art, third to seventh century]'', no. 380, 1979, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, {{ISBN|978-0-87099-179-0}}; full text available online from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham]] is restrained by the hand, which in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] grasped his knife hand, as the angel often does in other depictions.&lt;ref&gt;Though both hand and knife are now missing, with only a wrist stump now remaining.&lt;/ref&gt; However the angel mentioned in the biblical text is more usual, and often included as well. The use of the hand in this scene, at least in Christian art, indicates God's acceptance of the sacrifice, as well as his intervention to change it.

*Some depictions have the hand passing [[Moses]] the [[Tablets of the Law]], found in the Roman catacombs, various Bibles (see gallery), the [[Paris Psalter]], and in mosaic in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Noga-Banai, Galit. ''The Trophies of the Martyrs: An Art Historical Study of Early Christian Silver Reliquaries'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-19-921774-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-921774-8}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BUyGDWSsi4sC&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=Dura-Europos+Moses+receiving+the+law#v=onepage&amp;q=Dura-Europos%20Moses%20receiving%20the%20law&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The prophet [[Ezekiel]] (2:9–10) received his prophecy by hand: "Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+2&amp;version=NIV Ezekiel Ch. 2], NIV&lt;/ref&gt; and this and other moments from Ezekiel sometimes include the hand. In the [[Paris Psalter]], Moses, [[Jonah]] and [[Isaiah]] are all shown blessed by hands, from which rays of light come. Other prophets are sometimes also shown with the hand.
*In the [[Klosterneuburg]] Altar, [[Drogo Sacramentary]] (shown below) and San Vitale, Ravenna, [[Melchizedek]] is shown blessed by it, in the last combined with [[Abel]]. This relates to the approval of his sacrifice mentioned in the biblical text, and possibly also to the hand's association with divinely ordained monarchy (see below), as Melchizedek was both priest and king according to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18–20, and his appearance in art is often to evoke this as well as his function as a [[typology (theology)|type]] for Christ.
*The hand can appear in other contexts; the Carolingian [[Utrecht Psalter]] atypically illustrates nearly all the [[Psalms]], probably following an Antique model, and shows the hand in at least 27 of these images, despite also using a figure of Christ-as-God in the heavens even more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psalter.library.uu.nl/default.asp Utrecht Psalter online] – for hands see Psalms 2,5,14,21–23,26,29,40,42,48,53–55,63,77,83,86,105,111,118,123–125,132,136–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A mosaic in the [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] in Ravenna shows the battle of [[Beth-horon]] with the [[Amorites]] ([[Joshua]], 10:11), where: "As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites" – with a large hand representing God.
*The story in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 5:1–31 of [[the writing on the wall]] is rarely depicted until the 17th century, when [[Belshazzar's Feast (Rembrandt)|Rembrandt's well known version]] and others were produced.

====New Testament imagery====

*In depictions of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', the hand often appears at the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] representing the voice of God, above the [[dove]] representing the [[Holy Spirit]], which is much more common, thus showing the whole [[Trinity]] as present and active.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, 115 &amp; Schiller, I pp. 134 &amp; 137–9&lt;/ref&gt; The hand never seems to appear without the dove, as the Holy Spirit as a dove is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark: "As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."&lt;ref&gt;Mark 3:16–17 NIV; all three [[Synoptic Gospels]] have the voice.&lt;/ref&gt; Both dove and hand are normally located centrally, pointing straight down at Jesus. The hand is mostly found in ''Baptism''s between the 6th (e.g. [[Rabbula Gospels]]) and 11th centuries.
*The hand is found in some Western and later Armenian scenes of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I pp. 148–151. See also [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=riNIXZzr_NcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22hand+of+God%22+iconography&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hand%20of%20God%22%20iconography&amp;f=false Mathews, p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt; where again the [[Synoptic Gospels]] have the voice of God speaking, this time from a cloud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/matthew/3-17.htm Bible texts and commentaries]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The hand is sometimes seen in the [[Agony in the Garden]], though an angel is more common. This is the third and final occasion when the voice of God is mentioned in the gospels, this time only in the [[Gospel of John]] (12:28). The earliest known example is in the [[St Augustine Gospels]] of c.600.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 49&lt;/ref&gt;
*From [[Carolingian art]] until the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]], the hand may appear above the top of the cross in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], pointing straight down. Sometimes it holds a wreath over Christ's head, as on the rear of the [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] [[Lothair Cross]] at [[Aachen Cathedral]]. The hand represents divine approval, and specifically acceptance of his sacrifice,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 107–108 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly also the storm mentioned in the gospels.
*The hand may be seen in the [[Ascension of Christ]], sometimes, as in the [[Drogo Sacramentary]], reaching down and clasping that of Christ, as though to pull him up into the clouds. The ivory plaque now in [[Munich]] (left) with such a depiction is possibly the earliest [[Ascension of Jesus in Christian art|representation of the Ascension]] to survive. 
*In [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s of the [[Last Judgement]], the hand often holds the scales in which souls are weighed (in the West [[Saint Michael]] typically does this). The hand may emerge from the [[Hetoimasia]] usually present, and is typically huge in size compared to the full figures nearby in the composition.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Divine approval of rulers imagery====
[[File:Main Justice Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|The recreated "Hand of Justice" used in [[Napoleon]]'s coronation, [[Musée du Louvre]].]]
The hand often blesses rulers from above, especially in Carolingian and Ottonian works, and coins. The hand may hold a wreath or crown over the ruler's head, or place it on the head. A posthumous coin of [[Constantine the Great]] (the "deification issue") had shown the hand reaching down to pull up a veiled figure of Constantine in a [[quadriga]], in a famously mixed message that combined pagan conventions, where an [[eagle]] drew deified emperors up to the heavens, with Christian iconography. From the late 4th century coins of Late Antique rulers such as [[Arcadius]] (and his empress), [[Galla Placidia]] and others show them being crowned by it – it was in fact mostly used for empresses, and often only appears on issues from the Eastern Empire.&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue of late Roman coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection: from Arcadius and Honorius to the accession of Anastasius'', Philip Grierson, Melinda Mays, Dumbarton Oaks, 1992, {{ISBN|0-88402-193-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88402-193-3}}
[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sdCjnwoQLR0C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=coin+crowned+by+%22hand+of+god%22&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books] gives a full account of Late Antique usage. See also [http://www.davidrsear.com/academy/roman_glossary.html#Manus David Sear] coin glossary&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is not then seen in [[Byzantine art]] until the late 10th century, when it appears in coins of [[John I Tzimisces]] (969–976), long after it was common in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Zach Margulies, [http://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=christian%20themes%20in%20byzantine%20coinage "Christian Themes in Byzantine Coinage, 307 - 1204"]&lt;/ref&gt; In later Byzantine miniatures figures the hand is often replaced by a full figure of Christ (in these examples much smaller than the Emperor) placing a crown on the head.&lt;ref&gt;Examples [[:File:Basilios II.jpg|here]] and [[:File:Nicephorus III and Maria of Alania BnF Coislin79 fol2bis.jpg|here]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar symbolism was represented by the "Main de Justice" ("Hand of Justice"), part of the traditional [[French Crown Jewels#Sceptre of Charles V and Main de Justice|French Coronation Regalia]], which was a [[sceptre]] in the form of a short gold rod surmounted by an [[ivory]] hand in the blessing gesture. The object now in the [[Louvre]] is a recreation, made for Napoleon or a restored Bourbon king, of the original, which was destroyed in the [[French Revolution]], although the original ivory hand has survived (now displayed separately). [[Engraved gem]]s are used for an authentic medieval feel. Here the hand represents the justice-dispensing power of God as being literally in the hands of the king.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Saints imagery====
[[File:BambergGregoryUnkFolDedicationMin.jpg|thumb|[[Presentation miniature]] in a copy of [[St Gregory]]'s ''[[Moralia in Job]]'', 11th century.]]
The hand can also be shown with images of saints, either actioning a [[miracle]] associated with a saint – in Catholic theology it is God who performs all miracles – or above an iconic scene. In the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] the hand appears over [[Westminster Abbey]] in the scene showing the funeral of [[Edward the Confessor]]. The hand sometimes appears (see gallery) in scenes of the murder of [[martyr]]s like St [[Thomas Becket]], clearly indicating neither involvement nor approval of the deed, but approval of the saint. In the [[dedication miniature]] shown, the blessing hand seems pointed neither at [[Emperor Henry III]], nor [[St Gregory]] or the abbot, but at the copy of Gregory's book – the same copy that contains this miniature. This looser usage of the motif reaches its peak in Romanesque art, where it occasionally appears in all sorts of contexts – indicating the "right" speaker in a miniature of a [[disputation]], or as the only decoration at the top of a monastic [[charter]]. A number of Anglo-Saxon coins of [[Edward the Elder]] and [[Æthelred the Unready]] has a large hand dominating their reverse sides, although religious symbols were rarely so prominent on Anglo-Saxon coins.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 274 &amp; illustration on 269&lt;/ref&gt;

====Icons====
In [[Eastern Orthodox]] icons the hand remained in use far longer than in the Western church, and is still found in modern icons, normally emerging from circular bands. Apart from the narrative scenes mentioned above it is especially often found in icons of [[military saint]]s, and in some Russian icons is identified by the usual inscription as belonging to Jesus Christ. In other versions of the same composition a small figure of Christ of about the same size as the hand takes its place, which is also seen in many Western works from about 1000 onwards.
 
The earliest surviving [[icon]] of the [[Virgin Mary]], of about 600 from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], has an often overlooked hand, suggesting to Robin Cormack that the emphasis of the subject is on the [[Incarnation]] rather than a simple [[Virgin and Child]].&lt;ref&gt;See also the apse mosaic of the [[Euphrasian Basilica]], from about the 550s, which has a very similar composition.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the very few major Eastern works showing the Virgin from before the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], an apse mosaic (lost in 1922) from [[İznik|Nicaea]], also shows the hand above a standing Virgin. Few similar uses of the hand are seen in later Virgins, though the iconographically adventurous Byzantine [[Chludov Psalter]] (9th century) has a small miniature showing the hand and dove above a Virgin &amp; Child.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, p. 7 &amp; fig. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The hand occasionally appears in Western ''[[Annunciation]]s'', even as late as [[Simone Martini]] in the 14th century, by which time the dove, sometimes accompanied by a small image of God the Father, has become more common.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I pp. 43,44,45,47, figs 82, 97, 108&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BMprintAN00343789 001 l.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Anonymous print on the situation of the Netherlands in the 1570s, with three hands]]

====Ravenna mosaics====
The hand appears at the top of a number of Late Antique [[apse]] mosaics in Rome and Ravenna, above a variety of compositions that feature either Christ or the cross,&lt;ref&gt;One previously at [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]] (for example, see Dodwell, p. 5), seems now to have been restored away. Others are in [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], [[Santa Prassede]], and others illustrated here or on Commons.&lt;/ref&gt; some covered by the regular contexts mentioned above, but others not. The motif is then repeated in much later mosaics from the 12th century.

====Late Medieval and early Renaissance art====
From the 14th century, and earlier in some contexts, [[God the Father in Western art|full figures of God the Father]] became increasingly common in Western art, though still controversial and rare in the Orthodox world. Naturally such figures all have hands, which use the blessing and other gestures in a variety of ways. It may be noted that the most famous of all such uses, [[Michelangelo]]'s creating hand of God in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], breaks clear of God's encircling robe above the wrist, and is shown against a plain background in a way reminiscent of many examples of the earlier motif.

The motif did not disappear in later iconography, and enjoyed a revival in the 15th century as the range of religious subjects greatly expanded and depiction of God the Father became controversial again among Protestants. The prints of [[Daniel Hopfer]] and others make frequent use of the hand in a variety of contexts, and the personal [[emblem]] of [[John Calvin]] was a heart held in the Hand. Very free use of the motif is made in prints relating to the religious and political fall-out of the Reformation over the next two centuries, in prints on the [[Dutch Revolt]] for example. In a high [[Rococo]] setting at the [[Windberg Abbey]], [[Lower Bavaria]], the Hand of God holds scales in which a lily stem indicating Saint Catherine's purity outweighs the crown and sceptre of worldly pomp.

The similar but essentially unrelated arm-reliquary was a popular form during the medieval period when the hand was most used. Typically these are in precious metal, showing the hand and most of the forearm, pointing up erect from a flat base where the arm stopped. They contained [[relic]]s, usually from that part of the body of the saint, and it was the saint's hand that was represented.

==Examples in late antique and medieval Jewish art==
[[File:Ezekiel 3.jpeg|thumb|Ezekiel in the Valley of Dry Bones cycle [[Dura Europos synagogue]]]]
The hand of God appears in several examples from the small surviving body of figurative Jewish religious art. It is especially prominent in the wall paintings of the third-century [[Dura Europos synagogue]], and also seen in the nave mosaic of the sixth century [[Beth Alpha]] synagogue, and on a sixth-seventh century [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] screen found at the fourth-fifth century [[Susiya]] synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Roth, "Anthropomorphism, Jewish Art", in ''Encyclopedia Judaica'', ed. Fred Skolnik and Michael Berenbaum (Thomson Gale; Detroit : Macmillan Reference USA, 2007), 191 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Dura Europos synagogue===
In the Dura Europos synagogue, the hand of God appears ten times, in five out of the twenty-nine biblically themed wall paintings including the ''Binding of Isaac'', ''Moses and the Burning Bush'', ''Exodus and Crossing of the Red Sea'', ''Elijah Reviving the Child of the Widow of Zarepheth'', and ''Ezekiel in the Valley of Dry Bones''.&lt;ref&gt;Kraeling, 57&lt;/ref&gt;  In several examples the hand includes the forearm as well.

===Beth Alpha synagogue===
[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumbnail|right|Binding of Isaac mosaic, [[Beth Alpha]]]]
In the [[Beth Alpha]] synagogue, the hand of God appears on the ''Binding of Isaac'' panel on the northern entryway of the synagogue's nave mosaic floor.&lt;ref&gt;Eleazar Sukenik, ''The Synagogue at Beth Alpha'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The hand of God appearing in the Beth Alpha ''Binding of Isaac'' mosaic panel is depicted as a disembodied hand emerging from a fiery ball of smoke, "directing the drama and its outcome" according to [[Meyer Schapiro]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, 30&lt;/ref&gt; The hand of God is positioned strategically in the upper center of the composition, directly above the ram that the angel of God instructs Abraham to sacrifice in place of Isaac.

===Susiya synagogue===

In the [[Susiya]] synagogue, the hand of God appears on the defaced remains of a marble bimah screen that perhaps once illustrated a biblical scene such as ''Moses Receiving the Law'' or the ''Binding of Isaac''.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Werlin, "Khirbet Susiya" in ''The Late Ancient Synagogues of Southern Palestine'', (Ph.D. diss., University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, 2012): 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the hand was subjected to intense [[iconoclastic]] hacking, the iconoclasts left some vestiges of the thumb and the receding fingers intact.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Fine, "Iconoclasm: Who Defeated this Jewish Art", ''Bible Review'' (2000): 32-43; Robert Shick, "Iconoclasm", in ''The Christian Communities of Palestine from Byzantine to Islamic Rule: A Historical and Archaeological Study'' (Darwin Press Inc.: Princeton, N.J.), 213.&lt;/ref&gt; A thumbnail has been carved into the thumb. Foerster asserts that the hand of God originally held a Torah scroll, identifying the small piece of raised marble located between the thumb and fingers as a Torah scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Foerster, ''Decorated Marble Chancel Screens'', 1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birdhea5.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Birds' Head Haggadah]]]]

===Birds' Head Haggadah===
{{main|Birds' Head Haggadah}}
The hand of God appears in the early 14th-century [[Haggadah]], the [[Birds' Head Haggadah]], produced in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;"Bird's Head Haggadah", Israel Museum Digital Catalogue, Israel Museum, Jerusalem http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/popup?c0=13475.&lt;/ref&gt; Two hands of God appear underneath the text of the ''[[Dayenu]]'' song, dispensing the [[manna]] from heaven. The Birds' Head Haggadah is a particularly important visual source from the medieval period, as it is the earliest surviving example of a medieval illuminated Hebrew Haggadah.

'''Indeterminacy''' in literature is a situation in which components of a text require the reader to make their own decisions about the text’s meaning. (Baldick 2008) This can occur if the text’s ending does not provide full closure and there are still questions to be answered, or when "the language is such that the author’s original intention is not known". Baldick further describes the concept as "a principle of uncertainty invoked to deny the existence of any final or determinate meaning that could bring to an end the play of meaning between the elements of a text". Therefore, indeterminacy is the belief that it is not possible to decide entirely what a word means when used in a certain circumstance, so the meaning of the whole text must remain open to interpretation.

==Indeterminacy is not ambiguity==
In literature, indeterminacy is sometimes confused with the idea of ambiguity, as the two are very alike. However, as opposed to ambiguity, indeterminacy is "applied by its practitioners not only to literature but also to the interpretation of texts". (Encyclopædia Britannica 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;1 of 1) Nevertheless, the presence of indeterminacy does not mean that decisions about meaning cannot be made at all, but only that there will be no final official judgement or approval on any individual interpretation. (Baldick 2008) Furthermore, the presence of indeterminacy does not result in all interpretations being of equal legitimacy; instead it indicates that all meanings drawn from an indeterminate text are "partial and provisional, and that what we write about it itself as a text, is open to further interpretation".

==Indeterminacy and the reader's imagination==
A slightly different approach to indeterminacy is the idea that the reader’s "concretization is left to a large extent to... imagination". (Stanzel 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;116) This becomes clear when comparing narrative fiction; which is commonly indeterminate, to film; the very nature of which often precludes indeterminacy. Stanzel quotes [[John Fowles]] in regards to the indeterminacy of narrative as an advantage. "There are hundreds of things a novel can do that a cinema can never do. The cinema can’t digress, above all it can’t exclude... you’ve got to have a certain chair, certain clothes, certain decor.  In a novel... you don’t have to “set up” the whole screen. The delight of writing novels is what you can leave out on each page, in each sentence".&lt;!-- I'm assuming this is the quote, as it sounds colloquial --&gt;

Furthermore, McHale (1992, p.&amp;nbsp;36) highlights the "partial indeterminacy, the 'gappiness' of fictional objects, including fictional characters", by pointing out that no depiction of a fictional character or object could ever be as absolute as what actual human beings consider themselves and their objects to be. "It is always as if a beam of light were illuminating a part of a region, the remainder of which disappears in an indeterminate cloud". (McHale 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;36)

==Deconstruction theory==
This literary meaning of indeterminacy is often associated with [[deconstruction]], the [[post-structuralist]] theory propounded by [[Jacques Derrida]], and is best described as "a philosophically sceptical approach to the possibility of coherent meaning in language". (Baldick 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;1 of 1) However, Royle (1995, p.&amp;nbsp;46) quotes Derrida as saying "I do not believe I have ever spoken of 'indeterminacy', whether in regard to 'meaning' or anything else... deconstruction should never lead either to [[relativism]] or to any sort of indeterminism".

==Indeterminacy theory==
According to indeterminacy theory, all texts can have the "multiplicity of possible interpretations of given textual elements, because the author’s meaning or intent may be unclear, or distorted by pop culture".{{cite quote|date=April 2016}}  So, indeterminacy is not always purposeful. However, while some indeterminacy in literary fiction is permanent; the gap will never be filled or closed; other areas of indeterminacy are temporary, and deliberately planted by the author with the intention of leaving a gap that the reader themself can fill, by the "process of realizing or concretising the text". (McHale 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;36)

'''Kathleen McArthur''' (1915–2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McArthur, Kathleen (1915 - 2000)|url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/mcarthur-kathleen.html|website=Australian National Herbarium|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was an [[Australia]]n [[natural history|naturalist]], [[writer]], [[botanical illustrator]] and [[Conservation movement|conservationist]].  She was born in [[Brisbane, Queensland]] to Catherine and Daniel Evans.  Her mother was a daughter of the Durack pastoral family, her father a co-founder of an engineering firm.  She married Malcolm McArthur in 1938 and had three children before divorcing in 1947.  From 1942 she lived at [[Caloundra]] on the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] of Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Judith. (1997). ''Brilliant Careers: Women collectors and illustrators in Queensland'', p. 60. Queensland Museum. {{ISBN|0-7242-7693-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The environmental activist==
McArthur was a strong environmentalist and a co-founder, with [[Judith Wright]], [[David Fleay]] and Brian Clouston, of the [[Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland]] in 1962, and served as vice-president from then until 1965.  In 1963 she founded the [[Caloundra]] branch of the society.

She was involved in several campaigns during the 1960s and 1970s to preserve landscapes threatened by economic development, including the [[Pumicestone Passage]], the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and [[Great Sandy National Park|Cooloola]].  Much campaign work was funded through her growing and selling native plants as well as through exhibitions of her wildflower paintings.  She was especially concerned for the [[Wallum]] country of south-eastern Queensland, a habitat characterised by floristically-rich coastal heath and swamps on deep sandy soils.

The spider, ''Ozicrypta mcarthurae'', was named after her for her outstanding contribution to conservation. In 1996 she was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[doctorate]] by [[James Cook University]] of North Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Judith. (1997). ''Brilliant Careers: Women collectors and illustrators in Queensland'', p. 61. Queensland Museum. {{ISBN|0-7242-7693-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
McArthur wrote a weekly column, ''Wildlife and Landscape'', for her local paper.  She also started the Lunch Hour Theatre in Caloundra, a monthly event for which she wrote scripts based on environmental, biographical and historical subjects.  Books authored (and illustrated) by McArthur include:
* 1959 – ''Queensland Wildflowers – A Selection''. Jacaranda Press: Brisbane.
* 1978 – ''Pumicestone Passage: A Living Waterway''. Bacchus Printing: Brisbane.
* 1981 – ''Bread and Dripping Days: An Australian Growing Up in the 20s''. Kangaroo Press: Kenthurst.

The '''''Kneeling Bull With Vessel''''' is a small 6 3/8 inches (16.3&amp;nbsp;cm) tall statue made of silver with an animal upper part of a bull holding a vessel with pebbles inside and a lower part shaped in the body of a kneeling human wearing a patterned article of clothing. The artist is unknown and it is also not known if it has any spiritual connotations. Art such as this show vigorously developing cultural environments, including the building of cities and development of writing, around the Southern [[Mesopotamia]] region in South West [[Iran]] and border regions of [[Iraq]] around the [[4th millennium BC]]. The statue is on display at The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/329074 The Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Ancient Near Eastern Art section.

[[File:Antique lilihan persian carpet 433671.jpg|thumb|]]
[[Armenians]] wove '''Lilihans''' in [[Minudasht, Markazi|Lilihan]] village in what used to be called [[Kamareh District|Kamareh]] (now [[Khomeyn]]) district in [[Iran]]. &lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt; The term Lilihan is better known in the [[US]], in [[Europe]] it is not as widely used.&lt;small&gt;2 &lt;/small&gt;

==Structure==
Although a wide range of [[carpet]] and [[mat]] sizes are produced, the most common sizes found are 4 x 6 to 8 x 10 feet.&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt; The use of a longer [[Pile (textile)|pile]] traditionally appealed to [[United States|Americans]].&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt; The Lilihan rugs are executed using the [[Hamadan]] ([[single-wefted]]) weave, typically this means that they have one heavy [[cotton]] [[weft]] and are made with thick, first quality [[wool]]. The Lilihan rugs are the only [[fabrics]] in the Sultanabad region to be single-wefted. Lilihan carpets and rugs are coarsely, but tightly flat woven, making them extremely durable.

==Design==
Lilihan carpets and rugs are similar to [[Sarouk|Sarouk rug]] carpets in colour, style and thickness.&lt;small&gt;6&lt;/small&gt; According to Leslie Stroh of Rug News, there are about 3000 different designs for [[Hamadan]] rugs. This is attributed to 1500 villages in the Hamadan region that each produced two styles of designs.  While some [[geometric]] [[patterns]] can be found amongst Lilihan carpets, the more prevalent [[designs]] are [[traditional]] floral motifs.&lt;small&gt;7&lt;/small&gt;

==Colour==
The pink colour of the weft, distinguishes the Lilihan carpets from all others.   Khaki and brown also accentuate the primarily salmon field colour.&lt;small&gt;8&lt;/small&gt;

The '''Lioness of Gobedra''' is a [[Rock art|rock sculpture]] located in Gobo Dura (Gobedra), [[Ethiopia]]. It is a representation of a crouching [[lion]]ess around three metres long, which was carved into a relief on a large rock outcropping situated two kilometers west of [[Axum]]. It was first described by German archeologists in 1913.

The reason for this isolated stone carving is unknown, but the subject of much speculation. A local story, according to Philip Briggs, is that [[Archangel Michael]] was attacked by a lion here, and "he repelled the lion with such force it left an outline in the rock." Not far away is a quarry, where the stelae that adorn Axum are thought to have been carved, and there is a partially-carved example of one.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Briggs, ''Guide to Ethiopia'', fifth edition (Old Saybrook: Globe Pequot Press, 2009), p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Martinengo Altarpiece''' is a painting by the Italian [[High Renaissance]] painter [[Lorenzo Lotto]], finished in 1516. It is housed in the church of [[Santi Bartolomeo e Stefano (Bergamo)|Santi Bartolomeo e Stefano]] in [[Bergamo]] in northern Italy.

==History==
On 15 May 1516, Lotto was in Bergamo to sign a contract for a large altarpiece for the high altar of the church of San Bartolomeo, funded by Alessandro Martinengo Colleoni, who had chosen the church as the family's new burial place (the outstanding [[Colleoni Chapel]] is located nearby). It was finished three years later, as testified by the signature, and was paid 500 [[ducat (Italian coin)|ducats]].

The painting, the largest ever painted by Lotto, was once accompanied by a series of minor panels, which were dispersed in the following centuries and have been only partially identified - one is ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Lotto)|The Entombment of Christ]]'' (now in Bergamo).

==Description==
[[File:Lotto, pala martinengo 01.jpg|left|240px|thumb|Detail with an angel and the lion.]]
The subject of the painting is a [[Holy Conversation]], with the Virgin and the Child sitting on a throne surrounded by saints. The scene is set in a majestic architecture perhaps inspired by [[Bramante]] style. In the center, where the dome should be, is the [[tholobate]], whose pendentives decorated with Mark and John the Evangelists. Two angels are watching from a balaustrade, perhaps inspired by [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s [[Camera degli Sposi]]. Two other angels fly over Mary holding her crown.

The interpretation of the numerous symbols of the picture is disputed. Some of the objects could be taken from Francesco Colonna's ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', alluding to the rule of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] in Bergamo, of which Martinengo was a supporter. The inscription in the upper part, saying ''Divina Suave'', would be a reference to Venice.

In the lower part, the Virgin sits on a throne having a zoomorphic base, whose lion paws are a reference to [[St. Mark's Lion]], symbol of Venice. The lion is also peeping from behind the throne, on the left. There is a total of ten saints, including St. Alexander, eponymous of the donor, portrayed with a scintillating armor and, perhaps, with the face of Martinengo himself. His wife Barbara is also portrayed next to him, as the saint with the same name.

The two child angels in the low foreground are a typical element in Lotto's works.

The work is signed and dated "Laurentius / Lotus / M.D.XVI".

'''''Open Water 2: Adrift''''' (called '''''Adrift''''' in the UK, Australia, and various other countries, and called '''''Open Water 2''''' in Germany) is a 2006 [[psychological]] [[horror film|horror]] film filmed entirely in [[Malta]], starring [[Eric Dane]], [[Susan May Pratt]], [[Richard Speight, Jr.]], Niklaus Lange, [[Ali Hillis]], and [[Cameron Richardson]].  Promotional posters claim the film is based on actual events.

The script was written before ''[[Open Water (film)|Open Water]]'' (2003) was theatrically released. After ''Open Water'' became a success, ''Adrift'' was produced and the name was changed to ''Open Water 2: Adrift'' in some countries to capitalize on the success of the earlier film.

==Plot==
A group of friends, Amy ([[Susan May Pratt]]), James ([[Richard Speight, Jr.]]), Zach (Niklaus Lange), Lauren ([[Ali Hillis]]), Dan ([[Eric Dane]]), and Dan's new girlfriend Michelle ([[Cameron Richardson]]) go for a weekend cruise on Dan's new yacht. Amy and James also bring their infant daughter, Sarah.

Most of the friends decide to jump into the water for a swim. Amy, who is hydrophobic after a childhood incident, refuses but Dan picks her up and dives in with her. However, nobody thought to lower the ladder to re-board the ship, and so everyone (except the baby) is trapped in the water with only two masks, a dive knife, and a toy dolphin float. Despite their efforts, the side of the yacht is too smooth to climb and the deck is too high to reach. They see a boat of teenagers heading towards them. The group try to grab their attention, but the teenagers think that they are just greeting them, and sail off. During the struggle, the group try using a phone to call for help, only to hear the voices of some well wishers, unable to get the caller's attention. The phone accidentally gets knocked in the water.

They are left to tread water disconsolately. The group resorts to removing and using their bathing suits to make a rope. After a couple of attempts they manage to get one end of the rope wrapped around a railing. Instead of having the lightest person climb up, Zach attempts to climb. He pulls himself up and his fingers brush the [[gunwale]] but the makeshift rope rips apart as he is too heavy. The group are now mostly naked and have only a partial rope.

Meanwhile, James goes underwater, and is fooling around with the prop, in an attempt to remove it and use it as a grappling hook, but he drops the knife. He swims down after it and manages to catch it, and desperately tries to swim for the surface. As he swims back up he crashes into the bottom of the boat, and is knocked unconscious. He resurfaces motionlessly and slightly bloodied with an apparent [[skull fracture]]. Zach gets the knife from James and starts stabbing the boat to climb back up. Dan tries to stop Zach, but accidentally stabs him, causing Zach to drop the knife.

In a fit of hysteria and fearing that sharks will be attracted by the blood, Michelle begins to swim away, but sinks underwater. Dan swims after her and sees her lifeless body drifting underwater. He dives after her, but he can't reach her, and her body disappears into the depths. After some time, Zach dies from blood loss in Lauren's arms. She reluctantly lets go of his body which floats away, face down. After much waiting, Lauren says she refuses to die treading water and attempts to swim back to shore to find help. Her fate after this is unknown.

Later that night, during a rainstorm, James dies from his head injury. Dan unsuccessfully searches underwater for the knife. He slams his mask on the hull in frustration and the [[Lens (optics)|lens]] pops out. Remembering Zach's attempt with the knife, Dan uses it to wedge in the crevice of the side door for the ladder, giving him a handhold. Amy climbs over his shoulders, finally stepping onto his hand wrapped around the lens,causing him to yell as his hand bleeds more and manages to grab the gunwale and pull herself back on board. Once on board, she lowers the ladder for Dan and tends to her baby, Sarah. Amy notices Dan swimming away to drown out of guilt. She jumps back in to save him, reminding her of when she attempted to save her father in the same manner, at a young age.

The next morning, a fishing boat approaches the yacht, and notices the lowered ladder and life ring still floating in the water - no one had pulled them in. The yacht appears empty except for the sound of Sarah crying on the lower deck.

The film cuts to Amy standing on the boat in the sun, looking around appearing heartbroken. Dan is shown lying face down on the boat with a towel covering his lower half, seemingly sleeping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4892">&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Pathfindermural.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pathfinder Mural (1988) depicts revolutionary heroes from Europe, the United States, Cuba, Nicaragua, Grenada and South Africa.]] --&gt;
The '''Pathfinder Mural''' is a work of art formerly located at 410 West Street in the [[New York City]] neighborhood known as the [[West Village]].  It was conceived of by [[artist]] [[Mike Alewitz]] in 1988 and painted as a collaboration among eighty artists from twenty nations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themilitant.com/1996/6027/6027_4.html The Militant - 7/22/96 - 'Pathfinder Mural Stood As A Beacon Of Hope'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; who painted it on the side of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) building housing the [[Pathfinder Press]], the publishing arm of the [[Pathfinder tendency]], a [[left-wing]] organization.

==Subject==
The mural consisted of a red-colored [[printing press]] in the center, out of which seemed to flow posters of revolutionary heroes, with crowds of people depicted above and below the press.  Well-known activists and political figures included [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Stephen Biko]], and [[Harriet Tubman]].  The press itself is printing Fidel Castro's words, "The truth must not be only the truth--it must also be told."

==History==

The SWP commissioned the mural at the suggestion of Alewitz, a long-time member of the party.  

Participants in the project included artists such as [[Armand Vaillancourt]], [[Dumile Feni]], [[Arnoldo Guillien]] and [[Carlos Montenegro]].  There were also other, anonymous contributors with revolutionary and/or working-class backgrounds.  

In an interview with the [[New York Times]] dated September 7, 1997, Alewitz said of the mural "I wanted to do this one because Pathfinder represents the tradition of publishing important revolutionary ideas.  I'm critical of the New York art scene.  I find that much of the art taught in the schools and produced through the gallery system reflects the values of the cynical and confused middle class.  Basically, a stronger art is produced in those societies--like Cuba and Nicaragua--where there's a pulling together, an optimism about going forward."

Political conflicts, however, beset the project. From the right, [[Patrick Buchanan]] attacked it in the [[Washington Times]] as "a six-story shrine to communism, a Marxist Mount Rushmore in Greenwich Village." More disruptive to the project were criticisms from the SWP itself who criticized Alewitz' vision of a work that would depict revolutionary heroes as human beings and insisted on an homage to the party's heroes and attempted to micromanage the project by issuing directives on matters such as how large Leon Trotsky's head should be. 

A quotation from [[Eugene Debs]]' famous anti-war speech made in [[Canton, Ohio]] were replaced with words from Fidel Castro. Also removed were personal touches by Alewitz such as depictions of two students [[Kent State shootings|killed by the National Guard at Kent State University]] in 1970, one of whom had been a close friend of Alewitz’s.

Alewitz was expelled from the SWP prior to the project's conclusion and was excluded from its opening ceremony.

In 1996, the mural was permanently removed in order to repair cracks in the exterior wall of the Pathfinder building.

A '''Persian miniature'''  ([[Persian language|Persian]]:نگارگری ایرانی) is a small painting on paper, whether a book illustration or a separate work of art intended to be kept in an album of such works called a ''[[muraqqa]]''.  The techniques are broadly comparable to the Western and Byzantine traditions of [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  Although there is an equally well-established Persian tradition of wall-painting, the survival rate and state of preservation of miniatures is better, and miniatures are much the best-known form of Persian painting in the West, and many of the most important examples are in Western, or Turkish, museums.  Miniature painting became a significant [[genre]] in [[Persian art]] in the 13th century, receiving Chinese influence after the [[Mongol conquests]], and the highest point in the tradition was reached in the 15th and 16th centuries. The tradition continued, under some Western influence, after this, and has many modern exponents.  The Persian miniature was the dominant influence on other Islamic miniature traditions, principally the [[Ottoman miniature]] in Turkey, and the [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniature]] in the Indian sub-continent.

Persian art under Islam had never completely forbidden the human figure, and in the miniature tradition the depiction of figures, often in large numbers, is central.  This was partly because the miniature is a private form, kept in a book or album and only shown to those the owner chooses. It was therefore possible to be more free than in wall paintings or other works seen by a wider audience. The [[Qur'an]] and other purely religious works are not known to have been illustrated in this way, though histories and other works of literature may include religiously related scenes, including those [[Depictions of Muhammad|depicting the Prophet Muhammed]], after 1500 usually without showing his face.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, throughout; see Welch, 95-97 for one of the most famous examples, illustrated below&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the figurative scenes in miniatures, which this article concentrates on, there was a parallel style of non-figurative ornamental decoration which was found in borders and panels in miniature pages, and spaces at the start or end of a work or section, and often in whole pages acting as frontispieces.  In Islamic art this is referred to as "illumination", and manuscripts of the Qur'an and other religious books often included considerable number of illuminated pages.&lt;ref&gt;In the terminology of Western [[illuminated manuscript]]s, "illumination" usually covers both narrative scenes and decorative elements.&lt;/ref&gt;  The designs reflected contemporary work in other media, in later periods being especially close to book-covers and [[Persian carpet]]s, and it is thought that many carpet designs were created by court artists and sent to the workshops in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (2009), 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In later periods miniatures were increasingly created as single works to be included in albums called [[muraqqa]], rather than illustrated books.  This allowed non-royal collectors to afford a representative sample of works from different styles and periods.

==Style==
[[File:Хафт ауранг Джами 1556-65 Фрир.jpg|thumb|left|Camp scene from late in the classic period, with no frame.  [[Layla and Majnun|Majnun]] (at top wearing orange) spies on his beloved Layla (standing in tent doorway)]]
The bright and pure colouring of the Persian miniature is one of its most striking features.  Normally all the [[pigment]]s used are mineral-based ones which keep their bright colours very well if kept in proper conditions, the main exception being silver, mostly used to depict water, which will oxidize to a rough-edged black over time.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;  The conventions of Persian miniatures changed slowly; faces are normally youthful and seen in three-quarters view, with a plump rounded lower face better suited to portraying typical Central Asian or Chinese features than those of most Persians. Lighting is even, without shadows or [[chiaroscuro]].  Walls and other surfaces are shown either frontally, or as at (to modern eyes) an angle of about 45 degrees, often giving the modern viewer the unintended impression that a building is (say) hexagonal in plan.  Buildings are often shown in complex views, mixing interior views through windows or "cutaways" with exterior views of other parts of a facade.  Costumes and architecture are always those of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-28; Welch, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Many figures are often depicted, with those in the main scene normally rendered at the same size, and recession (depth in the picture space) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space.  More important figures may be somewhat larger than those around them, and battle scenes can be very crowded indeed. Great attention is paid to the background, whether of a landscape or buildings, and the detail and freshness with which plants and animals, the fabrics of tents, hangings or carpets, or tile patterns are shown is one of the great attractions of the form.  The dress of figures is equally shown with great care, although artists understandably often avoid depicting the patterned cloth that many would have worn.  Animals, especially the horses that very often appear, are mostly shown sideways on; even the love-stories that constitute much of the classic material illustrated are conducted largely in the saddle, as far as the prince-protagonist is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 25-26, 44-50&lt;/ref&gt;  Landscapes are very often mountainous (the plains that make up much of Persia are rarely attempted), this being indicated by a high undulating horizon, and outcrops of bare rock which, like the clouds in the normally small area of sky left above the landscape, are depicted in conventions derived from Chinese art.  Even when a scene in a palace is shown, the viewpoint often appears to be from a point some metres in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 25-26, 48-49, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest miniatures appeared unframed horizontally across the page in the middle of text, following Byzantine and Arabic precedents, but in the 14th century the vertical format was introduced, perhaps influenced by Chinese scroll-paintings.  This is used in all the luxury manuscripts for the court that constitute the most famous Persian manuscripts, and the vertical format dictates many characteristics of the style.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Saki - Reza Abbasi - Moraqqa’-e Golshan 1609 Golestan Palace.jpg|thumb|''Saki'', album miniature by [[Reza Abbasi]], 1609]]

The miniatures normally occupy a full page, later sometimes spreading across two pages to regain a square or horizontal "landscape" format. There are often panels of text or captions inside the picture area, which is enclosed in a frame, eventually  of several ruled lines with a broader band of gold or colour.  The rest of the page is often decorated with dense designs of plants and animals in a muted ''[[grisaille]]'', often gold and brown; text pages without miniatures often also have such borders.  In later manuscripts, elements of the miniature begin to expand beyond the frame, which may disappear on one side of the image, or be omitted completely.&lt;ref&gt;OAO (3, ii and elsewhere)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another later development was the album miniature, conceived as a single picture rather than a book illustration, though such images may be accompanied by short lyric poems. The withdrawal of Shah [[Tahmasp I]] from commissioning illustrated books in the 1540s probably encouraged artists to transfer to these cheaper works for a wider circle of patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;  Albums or ''[[muraqqa]]s'' were assembled by collectors with album miniatures, specimen pages of calligraphy, and miniatures taken from older books, to which border paintings were often added when they were remounted.  Album miniatures usually showed a few figures on a larger scale, with less attention to the background, and tended to become drawings with some tints of coloured wash, rather than fully painted.

In the example at right the clothes are fully painted, and the background uses the gold grisaille style earlier reserved for marginal decoration, as in the miniature at the head of the article.  Many were individual portraits, either of notable figures (but initially rarely portraits of rulers), or of idealized beautiful youths. Others were scenes of lovers in a garden or picnics.  From about the middle of the 16th century these types of images became dominant, but they gradually declined in quality and originality and tended towards conventional prettiness and sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;OAO, Sims; Gray (1930), 74-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Books were sometimes refurbished and added to after an interval of many years, adding or partly repainting miniatures, changing the border decoration, and making other changes, not all improvements.&lt;ref&gt;OAO&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Conference of the Birds'' miniature in the gallery below is an addition of 1600 to a manuscript of over a century earlier, and elements of the style appear to represent an effort to match the earlier miniatures in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/63.210.11 Metropolitan Museum of Art] "The Conference of the Birds": Page from a manuscript of the Mantiq al-Tayr (The Language of the Birds) of Farid al-Din cAttar, [[Isfahan]] (63.210.11). In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2000–.&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous painting ''Princes of the House of Timur'' was first painted in 1550-55 in Persia for the exiled Mughal prince [[Humayun]], who largely began the Mughal miniature tradition by taking back Persian miniaturists when he gained the throne.  It was then twice updated in India (c.1605 and 1628) to show later generations of the royal house.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jarilwala, 50-51; [http://www.artfund.org/artwork/4691/princes-of-the-house-of-timur Art Fund] with image.  The painting uses miniature techniques on cotton, and is much larger than most miniatures.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dimensions of the manuscripts covered a range not dissimilar to typical modern books, though with a more vertical ratio; many were as small as a modern paperback, others larger.  Shah Tamasp's ''Shahnameh'' stood 47&amp;nbsp;cm high, and one exceptional ''Shahnameh'' from [[Tabriz]] of c. 1585 stood 53&amp;nbsp;cm high.&lt;ref&gt;Uluc, 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists and technique==
[[File:Mir Sayyid Ali 2.jpg|thumb|left|Complex palace scene, 1539–1543, [[Mir Sayyid Ali]]]] 
In the classic period artists were exclusively male, and normally grouped in workshops, of which the royal workshop (not necessarily in a single building) was much the most prestigious, recruiting talented artists from the [[bazaar]] workshops in the major cities. However the nature of the royal workshop remains unclear, as some manuscripts are recorded as being worked on in different cities, rulers often took artists with them on their travels, and at least some artists were able to work on private commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Roxburgh (2000), 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;  As in Europe, sons very often followed their father into the workshop, but boys showing talent from any background might be recruited; at least one notable painter was born a slave. There were some highly placed amateur artists, including [[Shah Tahmasp I]] (reigned 1524–1576), who was also one of the greatest patrons of miniatures.  Persian artists were highly sought after by other Islamic courts, especially those of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mughal Empire]]s, whose own traditions of miniature were based on Persian painting but developed rather different styles.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was often divided between the main painter, who drew the outlines, and less senior painters who coloured in the drawing.  In [[Mughal miniature]]s at least, a third artist might do just the faces.  Then there might be the border paintings; in most books using them these are by far the largest area of painted material as they occur on text pages as well.  The miniatures in a book were often divided up between different artists, so that the best manuscripts represent an overview of the finest work of the period.  The scribes or [[Calligraphy|calligraphers]] were normally different people, on the whole regarded as having a rather higher status than the artists - their names are more likely to be noted in the manuscript.

Royal librarians probably played a significant role in managing the commissions; the extent of direct involvement by the ruler himself is normally unclear.  The scribes wrote the main text first, leaving spaces for the miniatures, presumably having made a plan for these with the artist and the librarian.  The book covers were also richly decorated for luxury manuscripts, and when they too have figurative scenes these presumably used drawings by the same artists who created the miniatures.  Paper was the normal material for the pages, unlike the [[vellum]] normally used in Europe for as long as the illuminated manuscript tradition lasted.  The paper was highly polished, and when not given painted borders might be flecked with gold leaf.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 22-26; Welch, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique survival from the Timurid period, found "pasted inconspicuously" in a muraqqa in the [[Topkapi Palace]] is thought to be a report to Baysunghur from his librarian. After a brief and high-flown introduction, "Petition from the most humble servants of the royal library, whose eyes are as expectant of the dust from the hooves of the regal steed as the ears of those who fast are for the cry of ''[[Allahu akbar]]'' ..." it continues with very businesslike and detailed notes on what each of some twenty-five named artists, scribes and craftsmen has been up to over a period of perhaps a week: "Amir Khalil has finished the waves in two sea-scenes of the ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' and will begin to apply colour. ... All the painters are working on painting and tinting seventy-five tent-poles .... Mawlana Ali is designing a frontispiece illumination for the ''Shahnama''. His eyes were sore for a few days."&lt;ref&gt;Thackston, 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from book arts, designs for tent-makers, tile-makers, woodwork and a saddle are mentioned, as is the progress of the "[[begum|begim]]'s little chest".&lt;ref&gt;Thackston, 43-44; a good number of those named are mentioned in other sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Muhammad during the Mi'raj - from Jami al-Tawarikh.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mi'raj]] (also called the "Night Ride") of Muhammed on [[Buraq]], Tabriz, 1307; Ilkhanid, with both Christian and Chinese influences, and horizontal format.]]

The ancient Persian religion of [[Manichaeism]] made considerable use of images; not only was the founding prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (c.216–276) a professional artist, at least according to later Islamic tradition, but one of the sacred books of the religion, the [[Arzhang]], was illustrated by the prophet himself, whose illustrations (probably essentially cosmological diagrams rather than images with figures) were regarded as part of the sacred material and always copied with the text.  Unfortunately, the Islamic suppression of the religion was so thorough that only tiny fragments of Manichean art survive.  These no doubt influenced the continuing Persian tradition, but little can be said about how.  It is also known that [[Sassanid]] palaces had wall-paintings, but only fragments of these have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

There are narrative scenes in pottery, though it is hard to judge how these relate to lost contemporary book painting.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was also a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts (such as literature, science, and history); as early as the 9th century, such art flourished during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749-1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom  |author2=S. Blair |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great period of the Persian miniature began when Persia was ruled by a succession of foreign dynasties, who came from the east and north. The traumatic [[Mongol conquests|Mongol invasion]] of [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|1219]] onwards established the [[Ilkhanate]] as a branch of the [[Mongol Empire]], and despite the huge destruction of life and property, the new court had a galvanising effect on book painting, importing many Chinese works and probably artists, with their long-established tradition of narrative painting. The Ilkhanids continued to migrate between summer and winter quarters, which together with other travels for war, hunting and administration, made the portable form of the illustrated book the most suitable vehicle for painting, as it also was for mobile European medieval rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Great Mongol Shahnameh]], now dispersed, is the outstanding manuscript of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1335 the Ilkhanate split into several warring dynasties, all swept aside by the new invasion of [[Timur]] from 1381. He established the [[Timurid dynasty]], bringing a fresh wave of Chinese influence, who were replaced by the [[Black Sheep Turkmen]] in 1452, followed by the [[White Sheep Turkmen]] from 1468, who were in turn replaced by the [[Safavid dynasty]] by 1501; they ruled until 1722.  After a chaotic period [[Nader Shah]] took control, but there was no long-lived dynasty until the [[Qajar dynasty]], who ruled from 1794 to 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1976), 309-315, OAO; Rawson, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baysunghur's Shahname 001.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Baysonghor Shahnameh]], 1430. He was a key patron of the [[Herat]] school]]

It was only in the 14th century that the practice began of commissioning illustrated copies of classic works of [[Persian poetry]], above all the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of [[Ferdowsi]] (940-1020) and the ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'', which were to contain many of the finest miniatures.  Previously book illustration, of works in both Arabic and Persian, had been concentrated in practical and scientific treatises, often following at several removes the Byzantine miniatures copied when ancient Greek books were translated.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1976), 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;  However a 14th-century flowering of Arabic illustrated literary manuscripts in Syria and Egypt collapsed at the end of the century, leaving Persia the undisputed leader in Islamic book illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Sims&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the best miniatures from early manuscripts were removed from their books in later centuries and transferred to albums, several of which are now in [[Istanbul]]; this complicates tracing the art history of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Simms&lt;/ref&gt;

Miniatures from the Safavid and later periods are far more common than earlier ones, but although some prefer the simpler elegance of the early 15th and 16th centuries, most art historians agree in seeing a rise in quality up to the mid-16th century, culminating in a series of superb royal commissions by the Safavid court, such as the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]] (or Houghton Shahnameh). There was a crisis in the 1540s when Shah [[Tahmasp I]], previously a patron on a large scale, ceased to commission works, apparently losing interest in painting.  Some of his artists went to the court of his nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]], governor of [[Mashad]] from 1556, where there was a brief flowering of painting until the Shah fell out with his nephew in 1565, including a ''[[Haft Awrang]]'', the "Freer Jami".  Other artists went to the Mughal court.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 103; Welch (mostly on Freer Jami after p. 24), 23-27, 31, 98-127; [http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/loveYearning/base.html Freer Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;  After this the number of illustrated book manuscript commissions falls off, and the tradition falls into over-sophistication and decline.&lt;ref&gt;OAO; Gray (1930), 74-89; Welch, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tabriz]] in the north-west of Iran is the longest established centre of production, and [[Baghdad]] (then under Persian rule) was often important. [[Shiraz]] in the south, sometimes the capital of a sub-ruler, was a centre from the late 14th century, and [[Herat]], now in [[Afghanistan]], was important in the periods when it was controlled from Persia, especially when the Timurid prince [[Baysonqor]] was governor in the 1420s; he was then the leading patron in Persia, commissioning the [[Baysonghor Shahnameh]] and other works.  Each centre developed its own style, which were largely reconciled and combined under the Safavids.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 37-55; Welch, 14-18; OAO&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools of Herat, where the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] royal workshops usually were, had developed a style of classical restraint and elegance, and the painters of Tabriz, a more expressive and imaginative style.  Tabriz was the former capital of the Turkmen rulers, and in the early [[Safavid]] period the styles were gradually harmonized in works like the [[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp]].&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 80; Walther &amp; Wolf, 420-424&lt;/ref&gt;  But a famous unfinished miniature showing [[Rustam]] asleep, while his horse [[Rakhsh]] fights off a lion, was probably made for this manuscript, but was never finished and bound in, perhaps because its vigorous Tabriz style did not please Tahmasp. It appears to be by Sultan Mohammad, whose later works in the manuscript show a style adapted to the court style of [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Bizhad]].  It is now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1993), 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese influences==
[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|[[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]] of the Prophet by Sultan Muhammad, showing  Chinese-influenced clouds and angels, 1539-43.&lt;ref&gt;see Welch, 95-97&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Before Chinese influence was introduced, figures were tied to the ground line and included "backgrounds of solid color", or in "clear accordance with indigenous artistic traditions". However, once influenced by the Chinese, Persian painters gained much more freedom through the Chinese traditions of "unrestricted space and infinite planes". Much of the Chinese influence in Persian art is probably indirect, transmitted through Central Asia. There appear to be no Persian miniatures that are clearly the work of a Chinese artist or one trained in China itself. The most prestigious Chinese painting tradition, of ''literati'' [[landscape painting]] on scrolls, has little influence; instead the closest parallels are with wall-paintings and motifs such as clouds and dragons found in Chinese pottery, textiles, and other decorative arts.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The format and composition of the Persian miniature received strong influence from Chinese paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz and Desai, 172; Meri, 585&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ilkhanid rulers did not convert to Islam for several decades, meanwhile remaining [[Tantric Buddhist]]s or Christians (usually [[Nestorian Christian|Nestorian]]s).  While very few traces now remain, Buddhist and Christian images were probably easily available to Persian artists at this period.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially in Ilkhanid and Timurid [[Mongol]]-[[Persian people|Persian]] mythological miniatures,  mythical beasts were portrayed in a style close to the Chinese [[qilin]], [[fenghuang]] ([[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]), [[bixie]] and [[Chinese dragon]], though they have a much more aggressive character in Islamic art, and are often seen fighting each other or natural beasts.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 169-173&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent Persian miniaturists ==
The workshop tradition and division of labour within both an individual miniature and a book, as described above, complicates the attribution of paintings.  Some are inscribed with the name of the artist, sometimes as part of the picture itself, for example as if painted on tiles in a building, but more often as a note added on the page or elsewhere; where and when being often uncertain.  Because of the nature of the works, literary and historical references to artists, even if they are relied upon, usually do not enable specific paintings to be identified, though there are exceptions.  The reputation of [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād Herawī]], or Behzād, the leading miniaturist of the late Timurid era, and founder of the Safavid school, remained supreme in the [[Persianate]] world, and at least some of his work, and style, can be identified with a degree of confidence, despite a good deal of continuing scholarly debate.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1930), 57-66; OAO&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sultan Mohammed]], [[Mir Sayyid Ali]], and [[Aqa Mirak]], were leading painters of the next generation, the Safavid culmination of the classic style, whose attributed works are found together in several manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 17-27, and many individual pictures shown&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Abd al-Samad]] was one of the most successful Persian painters recruited by the [[Mughal Emperor]]s to work in India.

'''Portrait painting''' is a [[Hierarchy of genres|genre]] in [[painting]], where the intent is to depict a human subject.  The term 'portrait painting' can also describe the actual painted portrait. Portraitists may create their work by commission, for public and private persons, or they may be inspired by admiration or affection for the subject. Portraits are often important state and family records, as well as remembrances.

Historically, portrait paintings have primarily memorialized the rich and powerful. Over time, however, it became more common for middle-class patrons to commission portraits of their families and colleagues. Today, portrait paintings are still commissioned by governments, corporations, groups, clubs, and individuals. In addition to painting, portraits can also be made in other media such as [[etching]], [[lithography]], [[photography]], video and [[digital media]].

==Technique and practice==
[[File:Sir Anthony Van Dyck - Charles I (1600-49) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anthony van Dyck]], ''[[Charles I in Three Positions]]'', 1635-1636, shows profile, full face and three-quarter views, to send to [[Bernini]] in Rome, who was to sculpt a bust from this model.]]
A well-executed [[portrait]] is expected to show the inner essence of the subject (from the artist's point of view) or a flattering representation, not just a literal likeness.  As [[Aristotle]] stated, "The aim of Art is to present not the outward appearance of things, but their inner significance; for this, not the external manner and detail, constitutes true reality."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon C. Aymar, ''The Art of Portrait Painting'', [[Chilton Book Co.]], Philadelphia, 1967, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Artists may strive for photographic realism or an impressionistic similarity in depicting their subject, but this differs from a [[caricature]] which attempts to reveal character through exaggeration of physical features. The artist generally attempts a representative portrayal, as [[Edward Burne-Jones]] stated, "The only expression allowable in great portraiture is the expression of character and moral quality, not anything temporary, fleeting, or accidental."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, this results in a serious, closed lip stare, with anything beyond a slight smile being rather rare historically.  Or as [[Charles Dickens]] put it, "there are only two styles of portrait painting: the serious and the smirk."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Even given these limitations, a full range of subtle emotions is possible from quiet menace to gentle contentment. However, with the mouth relatively neutral, much of the facial expression needs to be created through the eyes and eyebrows. As author and artist Gordon C. Aymar states, "the eyes are the place one looks for the most complete, reliable, and pertinent information" about the subject. And the eyebrows can register, "almost single-handedly, wonder, pity, fright, pain, cynicism, concentration, wistfulness, displeasure, and expectation, in infinite variations and combinations."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Portrait painting can depict the subject "{{vanchor|full-length}}" (the whole body), "{{vanchor|half-length}}" (from head to [[waist]] or [[hip]]s), "{{vanchor|head and shoulders}}" ([[portrait bust|bust]]), or just the head. The subject's head may turn from "{{vanchor|full face}}" (front view) to profile (side view); a "{{vanchor|three-quarter view}}" ("two-thirds view") is somewhere in between, ranging from almost frontal to almost profile (the fraction is the sum of the profile [one-half of the face] plus the other side's "quarter-face";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Betty|title=Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofXvl2eDsnwC&amp;pg=PT292|date= 2012|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-56180-5|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, each side is considered a third). Occasionally, artists have created composites with views from multiple directions, as with [[Anthony van Dyck]]'s triple portrait of ''[[Charles I in Three Positions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; There are even a few portraits where the front of the subject is not visible at all.  [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s ''[[Christina's World]]'' (1948) is a famous example, where the pose of the disabled girl – with her back turned to the viewer – integrates with the setting in which she is placed to convey the artist's interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Renoir - Madame Georges Charpentier et ses enfants.jpg|thumb|left|''Mme. Charpentier and her children'', 1878, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]
[[File:Gilbert Stuart Williamstown Portrait of George Washington.jpg|upright|right|thumb|[[Gilbert Stuart]], ''Portrait of [[George Washington]]'', c.1796]] 
Among the other possible variables, the subject can be clothed or nude; indoors or out; standing, seated, reclining; even horse-mounted. Portrait paintings can be of individuals, couples, parents and children, families, or collegial groups.  They can be created in various media including [[oil painting|oils]], [[watercolor]], [[pen and ink]], [[pencil]], [[charcoal]], [[pastel]], and [[mixed media]].  Artists may employ a wide-ranging palette of colors, as with [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]'s ''Mme. Charpentier and her children'', 1878 or restrict themselves to mostly white or black, as with [[Gilbert Stuart]]'s ''Portrait of George Washington'' (1796).

Sometimes, the overall size of the portrait is an important consideration.  [[Chuck Close]]'s enormous portraits created for museum display differ greatly from most portraits designed to fit in the home or to travel easily with the client. Frequently, an artist takes into account where the final portrait will hang and the colors and style of the surrounding décor.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

Creating a portrait can take considerable time, usually requiring several sittings.  Cézanne, on one extreme, insisted on over 100 sittings from his subject.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Goya on the other hand, preferred one long day's sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The average is about four.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Simon, ''The Portrait in Britain and America'', G. K. Hall &amp; Co., Boston, 1987, p. 131, {{ISBN|0-8161-8795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portraitists sometimes present their sitters with a portfolio of drawings or photos from which a sitter would select a preferred pose,  as did [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]]. Some, such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] make a drawing of the face, then complete the rest of the painting without the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, it would typically take about one year to deliver a completed portrait to a client.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing the sitter's expectations and mood is a serious concern for the portrait artist.  As to the faithfulness of the portrait to the sitter's appearance, portraitists are generally consistent in their approach.  Clients who sought out [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] knew that they would receive a flattering result, while sitters of [[Thomas Eakins]] knew to expect a realistic, unsparing portrait. Some subjects voice strong preferences, others let the artist decide entirely. [[Oliver Cromwell]] famously demanded that his portrait show "all these roughnesses, pimples, warts, and everything as you see me, otherwise I will never pay a farthing for it."&lt;ref name="Aymar, p. 262"&gt;Aymar, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

After putting the sitter at ease and encouraging a natural pose, the artist studies his subject, looking for the one facial expression, out of many possibilities, that satisfies his concept of the sitter's essence. The posture of the subject is also carefully considered to reveal the emotional and physical state of the sitter, as is the costume. To keep the sitter engaged and motivated, the skillful artist will often maintain a pleasant demeanor and conversation. [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] advised fellow artists to flatter women and compliment their appearance to gain their cooperation at the sitting.&lt;ref name="Aymar, p. 262"/&gt;

Central to the successful execution of the portrait is a mastery of [[human anatomy]].  Human faces are asymmetrical and skillful portrait artists reproduce this with subtle left-right differences.  Artists need to be knowledgeable about the underlying bone and tissue structure to make a convincing portrait.
[[File:Margaret in Skating Costume.jpg|thumb|right|upright| ''Margaret in Skating Costume'' by [[Thomas Eakins]]]]
For complex compositions, the artist may first do a complete pencil, ink, charcoal, or oil sketch which is particularly useful if the sitter's available time is limited. Otherwise, the general form then a rough likeness is sketched out on the canvas in pencil, charcoal, or thin oil.  In many cases, the face is completed first, and the rest afterwards. In the studios of many of the great portrait artists, the master would do only the head and hands, while the clothing and background would be completed by the principal apprentices. There were even outside specialists who handled specific items such as drapery and clothing, such as [[Joseph van Aken]]&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists in past times used [[lay-figure]]s or dolls to help establish and execute the pose and the clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The use of symbolic elements placed around the sitter (including signs, household objects, animals, and plants) was often used to encode the painting with the moral or religious character of the subject, or with symbols representing the sitter's occupation, interests, or social status.  The background can be totally black and without content or a full scene which places the sitter in their social or recreational milieu.

Self-portraits are usually produced with the help of a mirror, and the finished result is a mirror-image portrait, a reversal of what occurs in a normal portrait when sitter and artist are opposite each other. In a self-portrait, a righted handed artist would appear to be holding a brush in the left hand, unless the artist deliberately corrects the image or uses a second reversing mirror while painting.
[[File:Madame Récamier by Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|[[Jacques-Louis David]], portrait of ''[[Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier|Madame Récamier]]'' (1800), [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris]]
Occasionally, the client or the client's family is unhappy with the resulting portrait and the artist is obliged to re-touch it or do it over or withdraw from the commission without being paid, suffering the humiliation of failure. [[Jacques-Louis David]] celebrated [[portrait of Madame Récamier]], wildly popular in exhibitions, was rejected by the sitter, as was [[John Singer Sargent]]'s notorious ''[[Portrait of Madame X]]''. [[John Trumbull]]'s full-length portrait, ''[[General George Washington at Trenton]]'', was rejected by the committee that commissioned it.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 268, 271, 278&lt;/ref&gt; The famously prickly [[Gilbert Stuart]] once replied to a client's dissatisfaction with his wife's portrait by retorting, "You brought me a potato, and you expect a peach!"&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful portrait, however, can gain the lifelong gratitude of a client. Count Balthazar was so pleased with the portrait [[Raphael]] had created of his wife that he told the artist, "Your image…alone can lighten my cares.  That image is my delight; I direct my smiles to it, it is my joy."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient world===
[[File:Fayum-02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Roman-Egyptian funeral portrait of a woman]]
Portraiture's roots are likely found in prehistoric times, although few of these works survive today. In the art of the ancient civilizations of the [[Fertile Crescent]], especially in Egypt, depictions of rulers and gods abound.  However, most of these were done in a highly stylized fashion, and most in profile, usually on stone, metal, clay, plaster, or crystal.  Egyptian portraiture placed relatively little emphasis on likeness, at least until the period of [[Akhenaten]] in the 14th century BC.  Portrait painting of notables in China probably goes back to over 1000 BC, though none survive from that age. Existing Chinese portraits go back to about 1000 AD&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

From literary evidence we know that [[ancient Greek painting]] included portraiture, often highly accurate if the praises of writers are to be believed, but no painted examples remain. Sculpted heads of rulers and famous personalities like [[Socrates]] survive in some quantity, and like the individualized busts of [[Hellenistic portraiture|Hellenistic]] rulers on coins, show that Greek portraiture could achieve a good likeness, and subjects were depicted with relatively little flattery - Socrates' portraits show why he had a reputation for being ugly.  The successors of [[Alexander the Great]] began the practice of adding his head (as a [[Greek hero cult|deified]] figure) to their coins, and were soon using their own.

[[Roman portraiture]] adopted traditions of portraiture from both the [[Etruscan art|Etruscans]] and Greeks, and developed a very strong tradition, linked to their religious use of ancestor portraits, as well as Roman politics.  Again, the few painted survivals, in the [[Fayum portrait]]s, [[Tomb of Aline]] and the [[Severan Tondo]], all from Egypt under Roman rule, are clearly provincial productions that reflect Greek rather than Roman styles, but we have a wealth of sculpted heads, including many individualized portraits from middle-class tombs, and thousands of types of coin portraits.

Much the largest group of painted portraits are the funeral paintings that survived in the dry climate of Egypt's [[Fayum]] district (see illustration, below), dating from the 2nd to 4th century AD.  These are almost the only paintings of the Roman period that have survived, aside from [[fresco]]s, though it is known from the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]] that portrait painting was well established in Greek times, and practiced by both men and women artists.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Faxon, and Russo, ''Self-Portraits by Women Painters'', Ashgate Publishing, Hants (England), 2000, p. 7, {{ISBN|1-85928-424-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his times, Pliny complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, "The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out…Indolence has destroyed the arts." &lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, ''The Portrait in the Renaissance'', Bollingen Foundation, New York, 1966, pp. 71-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' XXXV:2 trans H. Rackham 1952.  Loeb Classical Library&lt;/ref&gt; These full-face portraits from Roman Egypt are fortunate exceptions. They present a somewhat realistic sense of proportion and individual detail (though the eyes are generally oversized and the artistic skill varies considerably from artist to artist). The Fayum portraits were painted on wood or ivory in wax and resin colors (encaustic) or with [[tempera]], and inserted into the mummy wrapping, to remain with the body through eternity.
       
While free-standing portrait painting diminished in Rome, the art of the portrait flourished in Roman sculptures, where sitters demanded realism, even if unflattering. During the 4th century, the sculpted portrait dominated, with a retreat in favor of an idealized symbol of what that person looked like. (Compare the portraits of Roman Emperors [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] and [[Theodosius I]]) In the [[Late Antique]] period the interest in an individual likeness declined considerably, and most portraits in late Roman coins and [[consular diptych]]s are hardly individualized at all, although at the same time [[Early Christian art]] was evolving fairly standardized images for the [[depiction of Jesus]] and the other major figures in Christian art, such as [[John the Baptist]], and [[Saint Peter]].

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Wilton diptych.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The small private [[Wilton Diptych]] for [[Richard II of England]], c. 1400, with stamped gold backgrounds and much [[ultramarine]].]]  
Most early medieval portraits were [[donor portrait]]s, initially mostly of popes in Roman [[mosaic]]s, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s, an example being a self-portrait by the writer, mystic, scientist, illuminator, and musician [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1152).&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Faxon, and Russo, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  As with contemporary coins, there was little attempt at a likeness.  Stone [[tomb monument]]s spread in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period.   Between 1350-1400, secular figures began to reappear in frescos and [[panel painting]]s, such as in [[Master Theodoric]]'s ''Charles IV receiving fealty'',&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, ''The Illustrated Library of Art'', Portland House, New York, 1986, p. 297, {{ISBN|0-517-62336-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portraits once again became clear likenesses.  Around the end of the century, the first oil portraits of contemporary individuals, painted on small wood panels, emerged in Burgundy and France, first as profiles, then in other views.  The [[Wilton Diptych]] of ca. 1400 is one of two surviving panel portraits of [[Richard II of England]], the earliest English King for whom we have contemporary examples. Leading [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] masters of the portrait included [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Robert Campin]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]].  Portraits of donors began to be shown as present, or participate in the main sacred scenes shown, and in more private court images subjects even appeared as significant figures such as the [[Virgin Mary]].

===Renaissance===
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - 1500 self-portrait (High resolution and detail).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Albrecht Dürer]], ''[[Self-Portrait (Dürer)|Self-Portrait]]'', 1500]]

The [[Renaissance]] marked a turning point in the history of portraiture. Partly out of interest in the natural world and partly out of interest in the classical cultures of ancient Greece and Rome, portraits—both painted and sculpted—were given an important role in Renaissance society and valued as objects, and as depictions of earthly success and status.  Painting in general reached a new level of balance, harmony, and insight, and the greatest artists (Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael) were considered "geniuses", rising far above the tradesman status to valued servants of the court and the church.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Many innovations in the various forms of portraiture evolved during this fertile period. The tradition of the [[portrait miniature]] began, which remained popular until the age of photography, developing out of the skills of painters of [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|the miniatures in illuminated manuscripts]]. Profile portraits, inspired by ancient medallions, were particularly popular in Italy between 1450 and 1500. Medals, with their two–sided images, also inspired a short-lived vogue for two-sided paintings early in the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Classical sculpture, such as the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'', also influenced the choice of poses utilized by Renaissance portraitists, poses that have continued in usage through the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern European artists led the way in realistic portraits of secular subjects.  The greater realism and detail of the Northern artists during the 15th century was due in part to the finer brush strokes and effects possible with [[oil painting|oil colors]], while the Italian and Spanish painters were still using [[tempera]].  Among the earliest painters to develop oil technique was [[Jan van Eyck]]. Oil colors can produce more texture and grades of thickness, and can be layered more effectively, with the addition of increasingly thick layers one over another (known by painters as ‘fat over lean’).  Also, oil colors dry more slowly, allowing the artist to make changes readily, such as altering facial details. [[Antonello da Messina]] was one of the first Italians to take advantage of oil. Trained in Belgium, he settled in Venice around 1475, and was a major influence on [[Giovanni Bellini]] and the Northern Italian school.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 54, 63&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century, oil as a medium spread in popularity throughout Europe, allowing for more sumptuous renderings of clothing and jewelry.  Also affecting the quality of the images, was the switch from [[panel painting|wood]] to [[canvas#For painting|canvas]], starting in Italy in the early part of the 16th century and spreading to Northern Europe over the next century. Canvas resists cracking better than wood, holds pigments better, and needs less preparation―but it was initially much scarcer than wood.

Early on, the Northern Europeans abandoned the profile, and started producing portraits of realistic volume and perspective. In the Netherlands, [[Jan van Eyck]] was a leading portraitist. ''[[The Arnolfini Portrait|The Arnolfini Marriage]]'' (1434, [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], London) is a landmark of Western art, an early example of a full-length couple portrait, superbly painted in rich colors and exquisite detail. But equally important, it showcases the newly developed technique of oil painting pioneered by van Eyck, which revolutionized art, and spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''[[Portrait of Sir Thomas More (Holbein)|Portrait of Sir Thomas More]]'', 1527]]

Leading German portrait artists including [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] who all mastered oil painting technique. Cranach was one of the first artists to paint life-sized full-length commissions, a tradition popular from then on.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, England had no portrait painters of the first rank, and artists like Holbein were in demand by English patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; His painting of [[Sir Thomas More]] (1527), his first important patron in England, has nearly the realism of a photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein made his great success painting the royal family, including [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  Dürer was an outstanding draftsman and one of the first major artists to make a sequence of self-portraits, including a full-face painting. He also placed his self-portrait figure (as an onlooker) in several of his religious paintings.&lt;ref name="Bonafoux, p. 35"&gt;Bonafoux, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer began making self-portraits at the age of thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, pp. 124-126&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Rembrandt would amplify that tradition.

In Italy, [[Masaccio]] led the way in modernizing the fresco by adopting more realistic perspective. [[Filippo Lippi]] paved the way in developing sharper contours and sinuous lines&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; and his pupil [[Raphael]] extended realism in Italy to a much higher level in the following decades with his monumental wall paintings.&lt;ref name="John Hope-Hennessy, p. 20"&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the betrothal portrait became popular, a particular specialty of [[Lorenzo Lotto]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early Renaissance, portrait paintings were generally small and sometimes covered with protective lids, hinged or sliding.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Renaissance, the Florentine and Milanese nobility, in particular, wanted more realistic representations of themselves.  The challenge of creating convincing full and three-quarter views stimulated experimentation and innovation.  [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Lorenzo di Credi]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and other artists expanded their technique accordingly, adding portraiture to traditional religious and classical subjects. Leonardo and [[Pisanello]] were among the first Italian artists to add allegorical symbols to their secular portraits.&lt;ref name="John Hope-Hennessy, p. 20"/&gt;

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' or ''La Gioconda'', 1503–1505/1507]]

One of best-known portraits in the Western world is [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting titled ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', named for [[Lisa del Giocondo]],&lt;ref name="subject"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mona Lisa – Heidelberger Fund klärt Identität (English: Mona Lisa – Heidelberger find clarifies identity)|language=German|url=http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/news/monalisa.html|publisher=[[University of Heidelberg]]|accessdate=2008-08-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206113230/http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/news/monalisa.html|archivedate=2008-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German experts crack the ID of ‘Mona Lisa’ |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22652514/?GT1=10755 |publisher=[[MSN]] |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2008-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116210319/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22652514/?GT1=10755 |archivedate=2008-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Researchers Identify Model for Mona Lisa |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/arts/AP-Art-Mona-Who.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-08-29 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the Gherardini family of [[Florence]] and [[Tuscany]] and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo.  The famous "Mona Lisa smile" is an excellent example of applying subtle asymmetry to a face.  In his notebooks, Leonardo advises on the qualities of light in portrait painting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A very high degree of grace in the light and shadow is added to the faces of those who sit in the doorways of rooms that are dark, where the eyes of the observer see the shadowed part of the face obscured by the shadows of the room, and see the lighted part of the face with the greater brilliance which the air gives it. Through this increase in the shadows and the lights, the face is given greater relief.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, pp. 103-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leonardo was a student of [[Verrocchio]].  After becoming a member of the Guild of Painters, he began to accept independent commissions. Owing to his wide-ranging interests and in accordance with his scientific mind, his output of drawings and preliminary studies is immense though his finished artistic output is relatively small. His other memorable portraits included those of noblewomen ''Ginevra de’ Benci'' and ''Cecilia Gallerani''.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

Raphael's surviving commission portraits are far more numerous than those of Leonardo, and they display a greater variety of poses, lighting, and technique. Rather than producing revolutionary innovations, Raphael's great accomplishment was strengthening and refining the evolving currents of Renaissance art.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly expert in the group portrait. His masterpiece ''[[the School of Athens]]'' is one of the foremost group frescoes, containing likenesses of Leonardo, Michelangelo, Bramante, and Raphael himself, in the guise of ancient philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pascal Bonafoux]], ''Portraits of the Artist: The Self-Portrait in Painting'', Skira/Rizzoli, New York, 1985, p. 31, {{ISBN|0-8478-0586-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the first group portrait of artists. Decades earlier, [[Paolo Uccello]] had painted a group portrait including [[Giotto]], [[Donatello]], [[Antonio Manetti]], and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]].&lt;ref name="Bonafoux, p. 35"/&gt; As he rose in prominence, Raphael became a favorite portraitist of the popes. While many Renaissance artists eagerly accepted portrait commissions, a few artists refused them, most notably Raphael's rival [[Michelangelo]], who instead undertook the huge commissions of the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref name="John Hope-Hennessy, p. 20"/&gt;

In Venice around 1500, [[Gentile Bellini]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]] dominated portrait painting. They received the highest commissions from the leading officials of the state.  Bellini's portrait of Doge Loredan is considered to be one of the finest portraits of the Renaissance and ably demonstrates the artist's mastery of the newly arrived techniques of oil painting.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Bellini is also one of the first artists in Europe to sign their work, though he rarely dated them.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 16th century, [[Titian]] assumed much the same role, particularly by expanding the variety of poses and sittings of his royal subjects. Titian was perhaps the first great child portraitist.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; After Titian succumbed to the plague, [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] became leading Venetian artists, helping the transition to Italian [[Mannerism]].  The Mannerists contributed many exceptional portraits that emphasized material richness and elegantly complex poses, as in the works of [[Agnolo Bronzino]] and [[Jacopo da Pontormo]]. Bronzino made his fame portraying the [[Medici]] family. His daring portrait of [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], shows the austere ruler in armor with a wary eye gazed to his extreme right, in sharp contrast to most royal paintings which show their sitters as benign sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; [[El Greco]], who trained in Venice for twelve years, went in a more extreme direction after his arrival in Spain, emphasizing his "inner vision" of the sitter to the point of diminishing the reality of physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the best portraitists of 16th-century Italy was [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] from Cremona, who infused her individual and group portraits with new levels of complexity.
   
Court portraiture in France began when Flemish artist [[Jean Clouet]] painted his opulent likeness of [[Francis I of France]] around 1525.&lt;ref name="John Hope-Hennessy, p. 187"&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; King Francis was a great patron of artists and an avaricious art collector who invited Leonardo da Vinci to live in France during his later years. The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' stayed in France after Leonardo died there.&lt;ref name="John Hope-Hennessy, p. 187"/&gt;

===Baroque and Rococo===
[[File:Rembrandt - De Staalmeesters- het college van staalmeesters (waardijns) van het Amsterdamse lakenbereidersgilde - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|[[Rembrandt]] group portrait, ''The Syndics of the Clothmaker's Guild'', 1662.]]
During the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] periods (17th and 18th centuries, respectively), portraits became even more important records of status and position. In a society dominated increasingly by secular leaders in powerful courts, images of opulently attired figures were a means to affirm the authority of important individuals. Flemish painters [[Sir Anthony van Dyck]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens]] excelled at this type of portraiture, while [[Jan Vermeer]] produced portraits mostly of the middle class, at work and play indoors. Rubens’ portrait of himself and his first wife (1609) in their wedding attire is a virtuoso example of the couple portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Bonafoux, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Rubens fame extended beyond his art—he was a courtier, diplomat, art collector, and successful businessman.  His studio was one of the most extensive of that time, employing specialists in still-life, landscape, animal and genre scenes, in addition to portraiture. Van Dyck trained there for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, pp. 408-410&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles I of England]] first employed Rubens, then imported van Dyck as his court painter, knighting him and bestowing on him courtly status. Van Dyck not only adapted Rubens’ production methods and business skills, but also his elegant manners and appearance. As was recorded, "He always went magnificently dress’d, had a numerous and gallant equipage, and kept so noble a table in his apartment, that few princes were not more visited, or better serv’d."&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]] dominated in much the same way, as a remarkable chronicler of royalty, painting the portraits of five French kings.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the innovations of Renaissance art was the improved rendering of facial expressions to accompany different emotions. In particular, Dutch painter [[Rembrandt]] explored the many expressions of the human face, especially as one of the premier self-portraitists (of which he painted over 60 in his lifetime).&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; This interest in the human face also fostered the creation of the first caricatures, credited to the Carracci Academy, run by painters of the Carracci family in the late 16th century in Bologna, Italy (see [[Annibale Carracci]]).

[[File:Retrato del Papa Inocencio X. Roma, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumb|right|[[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], ''[[Pope Innocent X]]'', c. 1650, [[Doria Pamphilj Gallery]], Rome.]]
    
Group portraits were produced in great numbers during the Baroque period, particularly in the Netherlands. Unlike in the rest of Europe, Dutch artists received no commissions from the Calvinist Church which had forbidden such images or from the aristocracy which was virtually non-existent. Instead, commissions came from civic and businesses associations. Dutch painter [[Frans Hals]] used fluid brush strokes of vivid color to enliven his group portraits, including those of the civil guards to which he belonged. [[Rembrandt]] benefitted greatly from such commissions and from the general appreciation of art by bourgeois clients, who supported portraiture as well as still-life and landscapes painting. In addition, the first significant art and dealer markets flourished in Holland at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;

With plenty of demand, Rembrandt was able to experiment with unconventional composition and technique, such as [[chiaroscuro]]. He demonstrated these innovations, pioneered by Italian masters such as [[Caravaggio]], most notably in his famous ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' (1642).&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp|''The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp'' (1632)]] is another fine example of Rembrandt's mastery of the group painting, in which he bathes the corpse in bright light to draw attention to the center of the painting while the clothing and background merge into black, making the faces of the surgeon and the students standout.  It is also the first painting that Rembrandt signed with his full name.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;
    
In Spain, [[Diego Velázquez]] painted ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (1656), one of the most famous and enigmatic group portraits of all time.  It memorializes the artist and the children of the Spanish royal family, and apparently the sitters are the royal couple who are seen only as reflections in a mirror.&lt;ref&gt;Bonafoux, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Starting out as primarily a genre painter, Velázquez quickly rose to prominence as the court painter of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], excelling in the art of portraiture, particularly in extending the complexity of group portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

Rococo artists, who were particularly interested in rich and intricate ornamentation, were masters of the refined portrait. Their attention to the details of dress and texture increased the efficacy of portraits as testaments to worldly wealth, as evidenced by [[François Boucher]]'s famous portraits of Madame de Pompadour attired in billowing silk gowns.

[[File:The Blue Boy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Gainsborough]], ''[[The Blue Boy]]'', c.1770, [[Huntington Library]], [[San Marino, California]]]]

The first major native portrait painters of the British school were English painters [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], who also specialized in clothing their subjects in an eye-catching manner.  Gainsborough's ''[[The Blue Boy|Blue Boy]]'' is one of the most famous and recognized portraits of all time, painted with very long brushes and thin oil color to achieve the shimmering effect of the blue costume.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; Gainsborough was also noted for his elaborate background settings for his subjects.

The two British artists had opposite opinions on using assistants.  Reynolds employing them regularly (sometimes doing only 20 percent of the painting himself) while Gainsborough rarely did.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 13, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a client would extract a pledge from the artist, as did Sir Richard Newdegate from portraitist [[Peter Lely]] (van Dyck's successor in England), who promised that the portrait  would be "from the Beginning to ye end drawne with my owne hands."&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the exactitude employed by the Flemish masters, Reynolds summed up his approach to portraiture by stating that, "the grace, and, we may add, the likeness, consists more in taking the general air, than in observing the exact similitude of every feature."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Also prominent in England was [[William Hogarth]], who dared to buck conventional methods by introducing touches of humor in his portraits.  His "Self-portrait with Pug" is clearly more a humorous take on his pet than a self-indulgent painting.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, female painters gained new importance, particularly in the field of portraiture. Notable female artists include French painter [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]], Italian pastel artist [[Rosalba Carriera]], and Swiss artist [[Angelica Kauffman]].  Also during that century, before the invention of photography, miniature portraits―painted with incredible precision and often encased in gold or enameled lockets―were highly valued.

In the United States, [[John Singleton Copley]], schooled in the refined British manner, became the leading painter of full-size and miniature portraits, with his hyper-realistic pictures of [[Samuel Adams]] and [[Paul Revere]] especially well-regarded.  Copley is also notable for his efforts to merge portraiture with the academically more revered art of history painting, which he attempted with his group portraits of famous military men.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Equally famous was [[Gilbert Stuart]] who painted over 1,000 portraits and was especially known for his presidential portraiture. Stuart painted over 100 replicas of [[George Washington]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart worked quickly and employed softer, less detailed brush strokes than Copley to capture the essence of his subjects. Sometimes he would make several versions for a client, allowing the sitter to pick their favorite.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for his rosy cheek tones, Stuart wrote, "flesh is like no other substance under heaven.  It has all the gaiety of the silk-mercer's shop without its gaudiness of gloss, and all the softness of old mahogany, without its sadness." &lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent American portraitists of the colonial era were [[John Smibert]], [[Thomas Sully]], [[Ralph Earl]], [[John Trumbull]], [[Benjamin West]], [[Robert Feke]], [[James Peale]], [[Charles Willson Peale]], and [[Rembrandt Peale]].

===19th century===
[[File:Michałowski Artist's daughter on horseback.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Piotr Michałowski]], ''Artist's daughter on horseback'', ca 1853, [[National Museum in Warsaw]]]]
In the late 18th century and early 19th century, [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] artists continued the tradition of depicting subjects in the latest fashions, which for women by then, meant diaphanous gowns derived from ancient Greek and Roman clothing styles. The artists used directed light to define texture and the simple roundness of faces and limbs. French painters [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] demonstrated virtuosity in this draftsman-like technique as well as a keen eye for character.  Ingres, a student of David, is notable for his portraits in which a mirror is painted behind the subject to simulate a rear view of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Bonafoux, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; His portrait of Napoleon on his imperial throne is a tour de force of regal portraiture. (see Gallery below)

[[Romanticism|Romantic]] artists who worked during the first half of the 19th century painted portraits of inspiring leaders, beautiful women, and agitated subjects, using lively brush strokes and dramatic, sometimes moody, lighting. French artists [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[Théodore Géricault]] painted particularly fine portraits of this type, especially dashing horsemen.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of artist of romantic period in [[Poland]], who practised a horserider portrait was [[Piotr Michałowski]] (1800-1855). Also noteworthy is Géricault's series of portraits of mental patients (1822–1824).  Spanish painter [[Francisco de Goya]] painted some of the most searching and provocative images of the period, including ''[[La maja desnuda]] ''(c. 1797-1800), as well as famous court portraits of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]].

[[File:EakinsTheGrossClinic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Thomas Eakins]], ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'', 1875]]
The [[Realism (arts)|realist]] artists of the 19th century, such as [[Gustave Courbet]], created objective portraits depicting lower and middle-class people.  Demonstrating his romanticism, Courbet painted several self-portraits showing himself in varying moods and expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Bonafoux, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Other French realists include [[Honoré Daumier]] who produced many caricatures of his contemporaries.  [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] chronicled some of the famous performers of the theater, including Jane Avril, capturing them in motion.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 585&lt;/ref&gt; French painter [[Édouard Manet]], was an important transitional artist whose work hovers between realism and [[impressionism]]. He was a portraitist of outstanding insight and technique, with his painting of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] being a good example of his transitional style.  His contemporary [[Edgar Degas]] was primarily a realist and his painting ''[[Portrait of the Bellelli Family]]'' is an insightful rendering of an unhappy family and one of his finest portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 568&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, [[Thomas Eakins]] reigned as the premier portrait painter, taking realism to a new level of frankness, especially with his two portraits of surgeons at work, as well as those of athletes and musicians in action.  In many portraits, such as "Portrait of Mrs. Edith Mahon", Eakins boldly conveys the unflattering emotions of sorrow and melancholy.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  
    
[[File:VanGogh 1887 Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'', 1887]]   
   
The Realists mostly gave way to the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] by the 1870s.  Partly due to their meager incomes, many of the Impressionists relied on family and friends to model for them, and they painted intimate groups and single figures in either outdoors or in light-filled interiors. Noted for their shimmering surfaces and rich dabs of paint, Impressionist portraits are often disarmingly intimate and appealing. French painters [[Claude Monet]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] created some of the most popular images of individual sitters and groups. American artist [[Mary Cassatt]], who trained and worked in France, is popular even today for her engaging paintings of mothers and children, as is Renoir.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 589"&gt;Piper, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]], both [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]], painted revealing portraits of people they knew, swirling in color but not necessarily flattering.  They are equally, if not more so, celebrated for their powerful self-portraits.

[[John Singer Sargent]] also spanned the change of century, but he rejected overt Impressionism and Post-Impressionism.  He was the most successful portrait painter of his era, using a mostly realistic technique often effused with the brilliant use of color. He was equally apt at individual and group portraits, particularly of upper-class families. Sargent was born in Florence, Italy to American parents. He studied in Italy and Germany, and in Paris. Sargent is considered to be the last major exponent of the British portrait tradition beginning with van Dyck.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 589"/&gt; Another prominent American portraitist who trained abroad was [[William Merritt Chase]].  American society painter [[Cecilia Beaux]], called the "female Sargent", was born of a French father, studied abroad and gained success back home, sticking with traditional methods. Another portraitist compared to Sargent for his lush technique was Italian-born Parisian artist [[Giovanni Boldini]], a friend of Degas and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]].

American-born Internationalist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was well-connected with European artists and also painted some exceptional portraits, most famously his ''Arrangement in Grey and Black, The Artist's Mother'' (1871), also known as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; Even with his portraits, as with his tonal landscapes, Whistler wanted his viewers to focus on the harmonic arrangement of form and color in his paintings. Whistler used a subdued palette to create his intended effects, stressing color balance and soft tones.  As he stated, "as music is the poetry of sound, so is painting the poetry of sight, and the subject-matter has nothing to do with the harmony of sound or of color."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Form and color were also central to [[Cézanne]]'s portraits, while even more extreme color and brush stroke technique dominate the portraits by [[André Derain]], and [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 576&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of photography in the 19th century had a significant effect on portraiture, supplanting the earlier [[camera obscura]] which had also been previously used as an aid in painting. Many modernists flocked to the photography studios to have their portraits made, including [[Baudelaire]] who, though he proclaimed photography an "enemy of art", found himself attracted to photography's frankness and power.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 552&lt;/ref&gt; By providing a cheap alternative, photography supplanted much of the lowest level of portrait painting.  Some realist artists, such as [[Thomas Eakins]] and [[Edgar Degas]], were enthusiastic about camera photography and found it to be a useful aid to composition.  From the Impressionists forward, portrait painters found a myriad number of ways to reinterpret the portrait to compete effectively with photography.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Sargent and Whistler were among those stimulated to expand their technique to create effects that the camera could not capture.

Other early 20th-century artists also expanded the repertoire of portraiture in new directions. [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] artist [[Henri Matisse]] produced powerful portraits using non-naturalistic, even garish, colors for skin tones. [[Cézanne]]'s relied on highly simplified forms in his portraits, avoiding detail while emphasizing color juxtapositions.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 582&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian [[Gustav Klimt]]'s unique style applied Byzantine motifs and gold paint to his memorable portraits.  His pupil [[Oskar Kokoschka]] was an important portraitist of the Viennese upper class.  Prolific Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]] painted many portraits, including several [[Cubism|cubist]] renderings of his mistresses, in which the likeness of the subject is grossly distorted to achieve an emotional statement well beyond the bounds of normal caricature.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  
An outstanding female portrait painter of the turn of the 20th century, associated with the [[French impressionism]],  was [[Olga Boznańska]] (1865-1940).
[[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painters provided some of the most haunting and compelling psychological studies ever produced. German artists such as [[Otto Dix]] and [[Max Beckmann]] produced notable examples of expressionist portraiture. Beckmann was a prolific self-portraitist, producing at least twenty-seven.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amedeo Modigliani]] painted many portraits in his elongated style which depreciated the "inner person" in favor of strict studies of form and color. To help achieve this, he de-emphasized the normally expressive eyes and eyebrows to the point of blackened slits and simple arches.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 646&lt;/ref&gt;

British art was represented by the [[Vorticists]], who painted some notable portraits in the early part of the 20th century. The [[Dada]] painter [[Francis Picabia]] executed numerous portraits in his unique fashion.  Additionally, [[Tamara de Lempicka]]'s portraits successfully captured the [[Art Deco]] era with her streamlined curves, rich colors and sharp angles. In America, [[Robert Henri]] and [[George Bellows]] were fine portraitists of the 1920s and 1930s of the American realist school.  [[Max Ernst]] produced an example of a modern collegial portrait with his 1922 painting ''All Friends Together''.&lt;ref&gt;Bonafoux, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant contribution to the development of portrait painting of 1930-2000 was made by Russian artists, mainly working in the traditions of realist and figurative painting. Among them should be called [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Nikolai Fechin]], [[Abram Arkhipov]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sergei Ivanov (Art historian)|Sergei V. Ivanov]]. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' - Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – 448 p. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Portrait production in Europe (excluding Russia)  and the Americas generally declined in the 1940s and 1950s, a result of the increasing interest in abstraction and nonfigurative art.  One exception, however, was [[Andrew Wyeth]] who developed into the leading American realist portrait painter.  With Wyeth, realism, though overt, is secondary to the tonal qualities and mood of his paintings. This is aptly demonstrated with his landmark series of paintings known as the "Helga" pictures, the largest group of portraits of a single person by any major artist (247 studies of his neighbor Helga Testorf, clothed and nude, in varying surroundings, painted during the period 1971–1985).&lt;ref&gt;’’An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art, Boston, 1987, Little Brown &amp; Company, p. 123, {{ISBN|0-8212-1652-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s and 1970s, there was a revival of portraiture. English artists such as [[Lucian Freud]] (grandson of [[Sigmund Freud]]) and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] have produced powerful paintings. Bacon's portraits are notable for their nightmarish quality. In May 2008, Freud's 1995 portrait ''[[Benefits Supervisor Sleeping]]'' was sold by auction by [[Christie's]] in New York City for $33.6 million, setting a world record for sale value of a painting by a living artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Freud work sets new world record | date = 14 May 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7398949.stm | publisher = BBC News Online | accessdate = 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many contemporary American artists, such as [[Andy Warhol]], [[Alex Katz]] and [[Chuck Close]], have made the human face a focal point of their work. 

Warhol was one of the most prolific portrait painters in the 20th-century. Warhol's painting ''[[Shot Marilyns|Orange Shot Marilyn]]'' of [[Marilyn Monroe]] is an iconic early example off his work from the 1960s, and [[Prince (painting)|Orange Prince (1984)]] of the pop singer [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] is later example, both exhibiting Warhol's unique graphic style of portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.widewalls.ch/10-faces-by-andy-warhol-february-2015/mao-tse-tung-8/|title=Andy Warhol Portraits That Changed The World Forever|last=|first=|date=|work=Widewalls|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/61240|title=Andy Warhol.

Close's specialty was huge, hyper-realistic wall-sized "head" portraits based on photographic images. [[Jamie Wyeth]] continues in the realist tradition of his father Andrew, producing famous portraits whose subjects range from Presidents to pigs.

The '''RSUA Silver Medal''' is awarded annually by the [[Royal Society of Ulster Architects]] to the final-year student of architecture at University of Ulster Belfast or [[Queen's University Belfast]] who, in the eyes of the assessors has produced the most successful major project.

In the sense that it is awarded to a student on completion of a project, the medal is analogous to the RIBA President's Medal, but is not as prestigious. Indeed, although the winner of the RSUA Silver Medal is generally also nominated for the RIBA equivalent, no student has ever won both prizes.

[[File:Godzilla Raids Again (1955) Godzilla vs Anguirus.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The ''[[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]]'' film franchise, which began in 1954, was rebooted four times (in [[The Return of Godzilla|1984]], [[Godzilla 2000|1999]], [[Godzilla (2014 film)|2014]] and [[Shin Godzilla|2016]]). Pictured here is a promotional image from ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'' (1955).]]

In [[Serial (literature)|serial fiction]], a '''reboot''' is a new start in an established [[fictional universe]], work, or series that [[retcon|discards]] all [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in order to recreate its characters, [[plotline]]s and backstory from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Willits"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Willits|first1=Thomas R.|title=To Reboot Or Not To Reboot: What is the Solution?|url=http://www.bewilderingstories.com/issue344/reboot1.html|website=Bewildering Stories|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parfitt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parfitt|first1=Orlando|title=Top 12 Forthcoming Franchise Reboots|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/08/25/top-12-forthcoming-franchise-reboots|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a way to "rebrand"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alexander |first1=Julia |title=The Matrix reboot isn’t a remake: Here’s the difference between the two |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/15/14935390/the-matrix-reboot-remake |website=[[Polygon.com|Polygon]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "restart an entertainment universe that has already been established".&lt;ref name="Willits"/&gt; Another definition is a [[remake]] which is part of an established [[film series]] or other [[media franchise]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The term has been criticised for being a vague and "confusing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hollywood's 10 Best Reboots |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/22/hollywoods-10-best-reboots |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |date=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[buzzword]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Peters |first1=Ian |author2=''et al'' |title=Reboots, Remakes, and Adaptations |url=http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/imr/2012/08/06/reboots-remakes-and-adaptations |website=[[MediaCommons|In media res]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |language=en |date=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[neologism]] for remake,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Child |first1=Ben |title=Don't call it a reboot: how 'remake' became a dirty word in Hollywood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/24/film-industry-remakes-hollywood-movies |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |language=en |date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Patches |first1=Matt |title=The Reboot Glossary: Which Hollywood Buzzword Fits the Bill? |url=http://www.hollywood.com/movies/the-reboot-glossary-which-hollywood-buzzword-fits-the-bill-57239239/ |website=[[Hollywood.com]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept which has been losing popularity in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Faughnder |first1=Ryan |title=Hollywood's summer problem?

==Origin==
The term is thought to originate from the computing term ''[[reboot]]'', meaning to restart a computer system.&lt;ref name="Willits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parfitt"/&gt;

==Types==
Reboots cut out non-essential elements associated with a pre-established franchise and start it anew, distilling it down to the core elements that made the source material popular.&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norris|first1=Erik|title=Why Franchise Reboots Can Be A Good Thing|url=http://www.mandatory.com/fun/456007-why-franchise-reboots-can-be-a-good-thing|website=Mandatory|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|accessdate=June 6, 2018|date=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For audiences, reboots allow easier entry for newcomers unfamiliar with earlier titles in a series.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

===Comic books===
In comic books, a long-running title may have its continuity erased in order to start over from the beginning, enabling writers to redefine characters and open up new story opportunities, and allowing the title to bring in new readers.&lt;ref name="Willits"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lorendiac|title=Lorendiac’s Lists: The DC Reboots Since Crisis on Infinite Earths|url=http://www.cbr.com/lorendiacs-lists-the-dc-reboots-since-crisis-on-infinite-earths|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic books sometimes use an [[Fictional universe|in-universe]] explanation for a reboot, such as merging parallel worlds and timelines together, or destroying a fictional universe and recreating it from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Crisis"&gt;''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #1-12 (April 1985 – March 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flashpoint"&gt;''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' #1-5 (May – September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'' #4-0 (Sept. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
With reboots, filmmakers revamp and reinvigorate a film series in order to attract new fans and stimulate revenue.&lt;ref name="Parfitt"/&gt; A reboot can renew interest in a series that has grown stale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vasquez |first1=Zach |title=Beyond the grave: what's next for the horror reboot? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/23/halloween-horror-reboots-upcoming-pet-sematary-it |accessdate=October 25, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 23, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reboots act as a safe project for a studio, as a reboot with an established fanbase is less risky (in terms of expected profit) than an entirely original work, while at the same time allowing the studio to explore new demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billington|first1=Alex|title=Sunday Discussion: The Mighty Hollywood Reboot Trend|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/sunday-discussion-the-mighty-hollywood-reboot-trend/|website=FirstShowing.net|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reboots also allow directors and producers to cast a new set of younger actors for the familiar roles of a film series in order to attract a younger audience.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Unlike a remake, however, a reboot often presupposes a working familiarity on the part of the audience with the original work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Television===

'''Rocket Jets''' was an attraction in [[Disneyland]] at the [[Disneyland Resort]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. This attraction opened in 1967 with the new Tomorrowland and closed in 1997 for the 1998 New Tomorrowland. It was the third spinning rocket attraction in [[Tomorrowland]] and stood three stories above the ground. When Tomorrowland was redone for 1998, the Rocket Jets were replaced by a new attraction based on Orbitron at the entrance to Discoveryland in [[Parc Disneyland|Disneyland Park Paris]].

==Observatron==
The Rocket Jets remained in their place above the former PeopleMover station as the Observatron, a sculpture that was intended to spin and play music every fifteen minutes. There are only two tracks, from [[Space Mountain: De la Terre à la Lune]] (Space Mountain: From the Earth to the Moon) and [[Le Visionarium]] (The Timekeeper), both of which are defunct [[Disneyland Paris]] attractions (De la Terre à la Lune is now Space Mountain: Mission 2, while The Timekeeper was also an attraction at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in Florida). The rockets were replaced by satellite dishes and the [[Saturn V]] rocket in the center was replaced by a laser-beam. However, the Observatron often malfunctioned, as the machinery was built to operate more frequently and to carry the rockets, rather than the satellite dishes they were replaced with. It appeared to have mechanical issues, sometimes only playing music every 15 minutes, or not doing anything at all.

In late 2006, the Observatron received much needed maintenance which allows the Observatron to now rotate every 15 minutes while playing its music as originally planned. As part of the maintenance, the old speakers were replaced with new ones and new speakers were added. Since this maintenance, the Observatron rarely breaks down and operates on a daily basis as intended.

The Saturn V rocket that the rockets were attached to was sold on [[eBay]] by Disney Auction in 2005. One remains on display, along with [[Skyway (Disney)|Skyway]] gondolas, in "Little Green Men Store Command" with a space ranger design. During Disneyland's 50th anniversary, one of the satellite dishes was replaced by a 50 [[Mickey Mouse]] head.

==In popular culture==
The Rocket Jets appear in a scene from the Disney animated film ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'' alongside another Disneyland attraction, [[Space Mountain (Disneyland, Anaheim)|Space Mountain]]. The area they are shown in is known as "Todayland".

The poster of the attraction appears as an easter egg in ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' on the [[kid]] [[bedroom]] during the scene when [[Mike Wazowski]] tries to make the kid laugh.

'''''Saint Augustine in His Study''''', is a painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]], finished around 1490–1494. It is housed in the [[Uffizi]], in [[Florence]].

This work was probably executed for an [[Augustinian hermit]] of [[Santo Spirito, Florence|Santo Spirito]], as shown by the fact the saint wears both episcopal and hermit garments.

As many of Botticelli's late works, it is inspired by the preaching of [[Savonarola]].

A '''standard illuminant''' is a theoretical source of [[visible light]] with a profile (its [[spectral power distribution]]) which is published. Standard illuminants provide a basis for comparing images or colors recorded under different lighting.

==CIE illuminants==
The [[International Commission on Illumination]] (usually abbreviated '''CIE''' for its French name) is the body responsible for publishing all of the well-known standard illuminants. Each of these is known by a letter or by a letter-number combination.

Illuminants A, B, and C were introduced in 1931, with the intention of respectively representing average incandescent light, direct sunlight, and average daylight. Illuminants D represent phases of daylight, Illuminant E is the equal-energy illuminant, while Illuminants F represent fluorescent lamps of various composition.

There are instructions on how to experimentally produce light sources ("standard sources") corresponding to the older illuminants. For the relatively newer ones (such as series D), experimenters are left to measure to profiles of their sources and compare them to the published spectra:&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt;
{{quote|At present no artificial source is recommended to realize CIE standard illuminant D65 or any other illuminant D of different CCT. It is hoped that new developments in light sources and filters will eventually offer sufficient basis for a CIE recommendation.|CIE|Technical Report (2004) Colorimetry, 3rd ed., Publication 15:2004, CIE Central Bureau, Vienna}}

Nevertheless, they do provide a measure, called the [[Metamerism Index]], to assess the quality of daylight simulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=CIE Technical Report|year=1999|isbn=92-9034-051-7|title=A Method for Assessing the Quality of Daylight Simulators for Colorimetry|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/51-2-99.html|series=51.2-1999 (including Supplement 1-1999)|quote=A method is provided for evaluating the suitability of a test source as a simulator of CIE Standard Illuminants D55, D65, or D75. The Supplement, prepared in 1999, adds the CIE Illuminant D50 to the line of illuminants where the method can be applied to. For each of these standard illuminants, spectral radiance factor data are supplied for five pairs of nonfluorescent samples that are metameric matches. The colorimetric differences of the five pairs are computed for the test illuminant; the average of these differences is taken as the visible range metamerism index and is used as a measure of the quality of the test illuminant as a simulator for nonfluorescent samples. For fluorescent samples, the quality is further assessed in terms of an ultraviolet range metamerism index, defined as the average of the colorimetric differences computed with the test illuminant for three further pairs of samples, each pair consisting of a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent sample which are metameric under the standard illuminant.|publisher=Bureau central de la CIE|location=Paris|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416151749/http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/51-2-99.html|archivedate=2008-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=CIE Standard|title=Standard Method of Assessing the Spectral Quality of Daylight Simulators for Visual Appraisal and Measurement of Colour|series=S012/E:2004|year=2004|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/s012.html}} Prepared by TC 1-53 "A Standard Method for Assessing the Quality of Daylight Simulators". [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=41694 ISO Standard 23603:2005(E)].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Metamerism (color)|Metamerism]] Index tests how well five sets of metameric samples match under the test and reference illuminant. In a manner similar to the [[color rendering index]], the average difference between the metamers is calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of the quality of different D65 simulators for visual assessment|first=Yuk-Ming|last=Lam|author2=Xin, John H. |date=August 2002|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|volume=27|issue=4|pages=243–251|doi=10.1002/col.10061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminant A===
The CIE defines illuminant A in these terms:
{{quote|CIE standard illuminant A is intended to represent typical, domestic, tungsten-filament lighting. Its relative spectral power distribution is that of a Planckian radiator at a temperature of approximately 2856&amp;nbsp;K. CIE standard illuminant A should be used in all applications of colorimetry involving the use of incandescent lighting, unless there are specific reasons for using a different illuminant.|CIE|[http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/s005.html CIE Standard Illuminants for Colorimetry]}}

The [[spectral radiant exitance]] of a [[black body]] follows [[Planck's law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;M_{e,\lambda}(\lambda, T) = \frac{c_1 \lambda^{-5}}{\exp\left(\frac{c_2}{\lambda T}\right) - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

At the time of standardizing illuminant A, both &lt;math&gt;c_1=2\pi \cdot h \cdot c^2&lt;/math&gt; (which does not affect the relative SPD) and &lt;math&gt;c_2=h \cdot c/k&lt;/math&gt; were different. In 1968, the estimate of c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was revised from 0.01438&amp;nbsp;m·K to 0.014388&amp;nbsp;m·K (and before that, it was 0.01435 m·K when illuminant A was standardized). This difference shifted the [[Planckian locus]], changing the color temperature of the illuminant from its nominal 2848&amp;nbsp;K to 2856&amp;nbsp;K:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{new} = T_{old} \times \frac{1.438,8}{1.435} = 2,848\ \text{K} \times 1.002,648 = 2,855.54\ \text{K}.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to avoid further possible changes in the color temperature, the CIE now specifies the SPD directly, based on the original (1931) value of c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_{A}(\lambda) = 100\left(\frac{560}{\lambda}\right)^5 \frac{\exp \frac{1.435 \times 10^7}{2,848 \times 560} - 1}{\exp\frac{1.435 \times 10^7}{2,848 \lambda} - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients have been selected to achieve a normalized SPD of {{nowrap|100}} at {{nowrap|560 nm}}. The tristimulus values are {{nowrap|1=(''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'') = (109.85, 100.00, 35.58)}}, and the chromaticity coordinates using the standard observer are {{nowrap|1=(''x'', ''y'') = (0.447,58, 0.407,45)}}.

===Illuminants B and C===
Illuminants B and C are easily achieved daylight simulations. They modify Illuminant A by using liquid filters. B served as a representative of noon sunlight, with a [[correlated color temperature]] (CCT) of 4874&amp;nbsp;K, while C represented average day light with a CCT of 6774&amp;nbsp;K. Unfortunately, they are poor approximations of any phase of natural daylight, particularly in the short-wave visible and in the ultraviolet spectral ranges. Once more realistic simulations were achievable, Illuminants B &amp; C were deprecated in favor of the D series:&lt;ref name=schanda&gt;{{cite book|title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|first=János|last=Schanda|publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|year=2007|chapter=3: CIE Colorimetry|isbn=978-0-470-04904-4|pages=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Lighting cabinets, such as the Spectralight III, that use filtered incandescent lamps have better fits to the D illuminants in the {{nowrap|400 nm}} to {{nowrap|700 nm}} range than do the fluorescent daylight simulators.&lt;ref name=Wyszecki&gt;{{cite journal|title=Development of New CIE Sources for Colorimetry|first=Gunter|last=Wyszecki|publisher= |date=1970|journal=Die Farbe|volume=19|pages=43-}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{quote|Illuminant C does not have the status of CIE standard illuminants but its relative spectral power distribution, tristimulus values and chromaticity coordinates are given in Table T.1 and Table T.3, as many practical measurement instruments and calculations still use this illuminant.|CIE|Publication 15:2004&lt;ref name=cie2004/&gt;}} Illuminant B was not so honored in 2004.

The liquid filters, designed by [[Raymond Davis, Jr.]] and Kasson S. Gibson in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Raymond|last=Davis|author2=Gibson, Kasson S. |title=Filters for the reproduction of sunlight and daylight and the determination of color temperature|publisher=[[National Bureau of Standards]]|date=January 21, 1931|journal=Precision Measurement and Calibration|volume=10|pages=641–805}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a relatively high absorbance at the red end of the spectrum, effectively increasing the CCT of the [[incandescent lamp]] to daylight levels. This is similar in function to a CTO [[color gel]] that photographers and cinematographers use today, albeit much less convenient.

Each filter uses a pair of solutions, comprising specific amounts of distilled water, [[copper sulfate]], [[mannite]], [[pyridine]], [[sulfuric acid]], [[cobalt]], and [[ammonium sulfate]]. The solutions are separated by a sheet of uncolored glass. The amounts of the ingredients are carefully chosen so that their combination yields a color temperature conversion filter; that is, the filtered light is still white.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; had independently measured the spectral power distribution (SPD) of daylight from {{nowrap|330 nm}} to {{nowrap|700 nm}}, totaling among them 622 samples. Judd ''et al.'' analyzed these samples and found that the (''x'', ''y'') chromaticity coordinates had a simple, [[quadratic function|quadratic]] relation:
:&lt;math&gt;y = 2.870 x - 3.000 x^2 - 0.275.&lt;/math&gt;

Simonds supervised the [[characteristic vector analysis]] of the SPDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[JOSA]]|first=John L.|last=Simonds|title=Application of Characteristic Vector Analysis to Photographic and Optical Response Data|volume=53|issue=8|pages=968–974|date=August 1963| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-53-8-968|doi=10.1364/JOSA.53.000968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A review of principal component analysis and its applications to color technology|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|first=Di-Yuan|last=Tzeng|author2=Berns, Roy S. |volume=30|issue=2|pages=84–98|date=April 2005|doi=10.1002/col.20086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of his method revealed that the SPDs could be satisfactorily approximated by using the mean (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and first two characteristic vectors (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;S(\lambda) = S_0(\lambda) + M_1 S_1(\lambda) + M_2 S_2(\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;

In simpler terms, the SPD of the studied daylight samples can be expressed as the [[linear combination]] of three, fixed SPDs. The first vector (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is the mean of all the SPD samples, which is the best reconstituted SPD that can be formed with only a fixed vector. The second vector (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) corresponds to yellow–blue variation, accounting for changes in the correlated color temperature due to presence or absence of clouds or direct sunlight.&lt;ref name=jmw/&gt; The third vector (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) corresponds to pink–green variation caused by the presence of water in the form of vapor and haze.&lt;ref name=jmw/&gt;

To construct a daylight simulator of a particular correlated color temperature one merely needs to know the coefficients M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the characteristic vectors S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:CIE illuminants D components.svg|right|thumb|250px|Characteristic vectors of illuminant D; component SPDs S0 (blue), S1 (green), S2 (red).]]

Expressing the chromaticities x and y as:
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{X_0 + M_1 X_1 + M_2 X_2}{S_0 + M_1 S_1 + M_2 S_2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{Y_0 + M_1 Y_1 + M_2 Y_2}{S_0 + M_1 S_1 + M_2 S_2}&lt;/math&gt;
and making use of known tristimulus values for the mean vectors, they were able to express M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:

[[File:Planckian-locus.png|thumb|Kelly's figures depicted the lines of constant correlated color temperature on the CIE 1960 UCS, as shown here, as well as the familiar xy diagram.]]

:&lt;math&gt;M_1 = \frac{-1.351,5 - 1.770,3 x + 5.911,4 y}{0.024,1 + 0.256,2 x - 0.734,1 y},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_2 = \frac{0.030,0 - 31.442,4 x + 30.071,7 y}{0.024,1 + 0.256,2 x - 0.734,1 y}.&lt;/math&gt;

The only problem is that this left unsolved the computation of the coordinate &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for a particular phase of daylight. Judd ''et al.'' simply tabulated the values of certain chromaticity coordinates, corresponding to commonly used correlated color temperatures, such as 5500&amp;nbsp;K, 6500&amp;nbsp;K, and 7500&amp;nbsp;K. For other color temperatures, one could consult figures made by Kelly.&lt;ref name=kelly&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Kenneth L.|date=August 1963|title=Lines of Constant Correlated Color Temperature Based on MacAdam's (u,v) Uniform Chromaticity Transformation of the CIE Diagram|journal=JOSA|volume=53|issue=8|pages=999–1002| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-53-8-999|doi=10.1364/JOSA.53.000999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was addressed in the CIE report that formalized illuminant D, with an approximation of the x coordinate in terms of the reciprocal color temperature, valid from 4000&amp;nbsp;K to 25,000&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Proceedings of the 15th Session, Vienna|author=Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The y coordinate trivially followed from Judd's quadratic relation.

Judd ''et al.'' then extended the reconstituted SPDs to {{nowrap|300 nm}}–{{nowrap|330 nm}} and {{nowrap|700 nm}}–{{nowrap|830 nm}} by using Moon's spectral absorbance data of the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proposed standard solar-radiation curves for engineering use| first=Parry|last=Moon|date=November 1940|volume=230|issue=5|pages=583–617|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|doi=10.1016/S0016-0032(40)90364-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tabulated SPDs presented by the CIE today are derived by [[linear interpolation]] of the {{nowrap|10 nm}} data set down to {{nowrap|5 nm}}. &lt;ref&gt;[http://files.cie.co.at/204.xls CIE 1931 and 1964 Standard Colorimetric Observers] from {{nowrap|380 nm}} to {{nowrap|780 nm}} in increments of {{nowrap|5 nm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar studies have been undertaken in other parts of the world, or repeating Judd ''et al.'''s analysis with modern computational methods. In several of these studies, the daylight locus is notably closer to the Planckian locus than in Judd ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Studies from the 1960s and 1970s include:

; Computation:
The relative [[spectral power distribution]] (SPD) &lt;math&gt;S_D (\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; of a D series illuminant can be derived from its [[chromaticity coordinate]]s in the [[CIE 1931 color space]], &lt;math&gt;(x_D,y_D)&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;The coefficients differ from those in the original paper due to the change in the constants in [[Planck's law]]. See [http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_DIlluminant.html Lindbloom] for the current version, and [[Planckian locus]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
x_D = \begin{cases}
0.244,063 + 0.09911 \frac{10^3}{T} + 2.967,8 \frac{10^6}{T^2} - 4.607,0 \frac{10^9}{T^3} &amp; 4,000\ \mathrm{K} \leq T \leq 7,000\ \ \mathrm{K} \\

\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_D = -3.000 x_D^2 + 2.870 x_D - 0.275&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' is the illuminant's CCT. The chromaticity coordinates of the Illuminants D are said to form the ''CIE Daylight Locus''. The relative SPD is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;S_D(\lambda) = S_0(\lambda) + M_1 S_1(\lambda) + M_2 S_2(\lambda),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_1 = (-1.351,5 - 1.770,3 x_D + 5.911,4 y_D)/M,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_2 = (0.030,00 - 31.442,4 x_D + 30.071,7 y_D)/M,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M = 0.024,1 + 0.256,2 x_D - 0.734,1 y_D&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S_0(\lambda), S_1(\lambda), S_2(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; are the mean and first two [[eigenvector]] SPDs, depicted above.&lt;ref name=bruce/&gt; The characteristic vectors both have a zero at {{nowrap|560 nm}}, since all the relative SPDs have been normalized about this point.

The CCTs of the canonical illuminants, D&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;65&lt;/sub&gt;, and D&lt;sub&gt;75&lt;/sub&gt;, differ slightly from what their names suggest. For example, D50 has a CCT of 5003&amp;nbsp;K ("horizon" light), while [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] has a CCT of 6504&amp;nbsp;K (noon light). As explained in a previous section, this is because the value of the constants in Planck's law have been slightly changed since the definition of these canonical illuminants, whose SPDs are based on the original values in Planck's law. In order to match all significant digits of the published data of the canonical illuminants the values of M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have to be rounded to three decimal places before calculation of ''S&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;.''&lt;ref name="schanda" /&gt;

===Illuminant E===
Illuminant E is an equal-energy radiator; it has a constant SPD inside the [[visible spectrum]]. It is useful as a theoretical reference; an illuminant that gives equal weight to all wavelengths, presenting an even color. It also has equal [[CIE XYZ]] tristimulus values, thus its chromaticity coordinates are (x,y)=(1/3,1/3). This is by design; the XYZ color matching functions are normalized such that their integrals over the visible spectrum are the same.&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt;

[[File:Planckian-locus.png|thumb|right|Illuminant E is beneath the Planckian locus, and roughly isothermal with D&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

Illuminant E is not a black body, so it does not have a color temperature, but it can be approximated by a D series illuminant with a CCT of 5455&amp;nbsp;K. (Of the canonical illuminants, D&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt; is the closest.) Manufacturers sometimes compare light sources against Illuminant E to calculate the [[colorfulness#Excitation purity|excitation purity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Philips|title=Optical Testing for SuperFlux, SnapLED and LUXEON Emitters|url=http://www.philipslumileds.com/pdfs/AB08.pdf|quote=CIE has defined the color coordinates of several different white Illuminants, but within Lumileds, CIE Illuminant E is used for all color calculations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminant series F===
The '''F''' series of illuminants represent various types of [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]].

F1–F6 "standard" fluorescent lamps consist of two semi-broadband emissions of [[antimony]] and [[manganese]] activations in calcium halophosphate [[phosphor]].&lt;ref&gt;For commercial examples of calcium halophosphate fluorescents, see for example {{patent|US|5447660|Method for making a calcium halophosphate phosphor}} or {{patent|US|6666993|Single component calcium halophosphate phosphor}}&lt;/ref&gt; F4 is of particular interest since it was used for calibrating the CIE [[color rendering index]] (the CRI formula was chosen such that F4 would have a CRI of 51). F7–F9 are "broadband" ([[full-spectrum light]]) fluorescent lamps with multiple phosphors, and higher CRIs. Finally, F10–F12 are narrow triband illuminants consisting of three "narrowband" emissions (caused by ternary compositions of rare-earth phosphors) in the R,G,B regions of the visible spectrum. The phosphor weights can be tuned to achieve the desired CCT.

The spectra of these illuminants are published in Publication 15:2004.&lt;ref name=cie2004&gt;{{cite book|author=CIE Technical Report|year=2004|title=Colorimetry|edition=3rd|series=Publication 15:2004|publisher=CIE Central Bureau, Vienna|isbn=3-901906-33-9|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/15-2004.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213035758/http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/15-2004.html|archivedate=2008-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/CIE/Fluorescents.htm Spectral power distribution of Illuminants Series F] ([http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/CIE/Fluorescents.xls Excel]), in {{nowrap|5 nm}} increments from {{nowrap|380 nm}} to {{nowrap|780 nm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminant series L===
Publication of an '''L''' series of illuminants is expected mid-2018. It will represent various types of [[LED lamp|LED lighting]].

==White point==
{{main|White point}}
The spectrum of a standard illuminant, like any other profile of light, can be converted into [[tristimulus value]]s. The set of three tristimulus coordinates of an illuminant is called a ''white point''. If the profile is [[Normalizing constant|normalized]], then the white point can equivalently be expressed as a pair of [[chromaticity coordinate]]s.

If an image is recorded in tristimulus coordinates (or in values which can be converted to and from them), then the white point of the illuminant used gives the maximum value of the tristimulus coordinates that will be recorded at any point in the image, in the absence of [[fluorescence]]. It is called the white point of the image.

The process of calculating the white point discards a great deal of information about the profile of the illuminant, and so although it is true that for every illuminant the exact white point can be calculated, it is not the case that knowing the white point of an image alone tells you a great deal about the illuminant that was used to record it.

[[File:Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment'', [[Michelangelo]], c. 1500–1501. ]]
'''''Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment''''' is a drawing of c. 1500–1501  by [[Michelangelo]], now in the [[Louvre Museum]].  It is in black chalk, with pen and ink and white highlighting, on pink prepared (coloured) paper, and measures 26.6&amp;nbsp;cm x 15.1&amp;nbsp;cm.  It is a [[figure study]] made in preparation for his painting ''[[The Entombment (Michelangelo)|The Entombment]]'', and is Michelangelo's only surviving study that was probably drawn from a nude female model.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt; It also may be the earliest extant European drawing of a nude female model.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure in the drawing relates to a woman seated in the lower left foreground of the painting. Included in the study are narrative details such as the nails of the cross, held in her left hand, and the crown of thorns in her right. Although the drawing's attribution has been doubted, it is now accepted as authentic.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hirst, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The elaboration of the plaited hair suggests that the drawing was made from life using a young girl as the model.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hirst, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The drawing was made in three stages: first it was lightly laid down in black chalk, then gone over with pen and light [[bistre]], and finally drawn over completely with a finer pen and darker ink.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;Hirst, 64&lt;/ref&gt; Lateral strokes were placed at the bottom to indicate the ground plane, and touches of white body color were added to details of the figure. Rare for a drawing by Michelangelo is the pink ground,&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;Hirst, 64&lt;/ref&gt; in this case achieved by rubbing crushed red chalk onto the paper.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;Chapman, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the use of nude female models was controversial, relatively few such drawings were made before the 17th century, when academic life classes were established.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt; Before that boys or young men, typically studio apprentices, were used as models for figures of both sexes, as is sometimes rather apparent. Exceptions from the [[Italian Renaissance]] include [[Raphael]], who made nude drawings, apparently of his mistress, and [[Lorenzo Lotto]], who recorded in his account book having used women of ill repute as life models.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Florence]], Michelangelo and Raphael initiated the practice of making preparatory studies of the nude prior to painting the figure fully clothed, in order to better understand the underlying structure of the body.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12348">'''The Center for Arts Education''' ('''CAE''') is a [[nonprofit]] organization in [[New York City, New York]], in the United States. It promotes [[Arts in education|arts education]] in the public schools and between 1996 and 2008 spent nearly $40 million. It claimed to have affected over 500 schools, 490,000 students, 21,000 teachers and 75,000 parents and to have supported more than 400 cultural organizations.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for Arts Education Fact Sheet, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Center for Arts Education was founded in 1996 to restore and sustain arts education in New York City’s [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] after two decades of system-wide cutbacks in funding for arts programs. The fiscal budget crisis of the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Article [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E4DC1639F936A25750C0A960958260&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=center+for+arts+education The Arts Go Back To School, March 15: 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; immediately impacted the City’s commitment to arts education. Budget cuts resulted in teacher layoffs and the gradual abandonment of the arts as essential to academic development.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Article [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E7D61439F931A15751C1A963958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=rothstein New York Schools Grant to Revive Arts Teaching: December 22, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; For the next twenty years, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers experienced a [[K-12]] education without instruction in arts education, aside from schools with private funding.

In the early 1990s, the [[New York City Board of Education]], New York City’s cultural institutions, and [[private-sector]] foundations grew increasingly alarmed by the changes. By 1991, two-thirds of New York City schools had no licensed art or music teachers.

In 1993 [[Walter Annenberg]] announced the single largest gift ever made to American public education, the Annenberg Challenge,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040602100927/http://www.annenberginstitute.org/Challenge/sites/nynsr.html The Annenberg Challenge] &lt;/ref&gt; a half-billion dollar, five-year challenge grant designed to support efforts at school [[reform]] throughout the country. In a collaboration, the [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs]] and Board of Education envisioned a five-year plan, The Annenberg Arts and Education Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060109192915/http://www.annenberginstitute.org/challenge/pubs/annrpt/preface_pg2.html Annenberg Arts and Education Initiative] &lt;/ref&gt; to initiate arts education reform. This plan, created under the guidance of consulting firm Artsvision, proposed a model for institutionalizing arts education in NYC public schools.

In March 1996, [[The Annenberg Foundation]] approved the proposal&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Article [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E2DE1F39F935A35750C0A960958260&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=center+for+arts+education Program Helps Arts In Schools, March 6 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; and The Center for Arts Education was created to administer the initiative, serve as a liaison and oversee the distribution of funding. The Annenberg plan established CAE as an independent agency that was administratively distinct from the BOE. The initiative began with a two-to-one $12 million grant from the Annenberg Foundation, to be matched by a $12 million investment each from the public and private sectors, for a total $36 million.

In 2001 Annenberg Foundation provided another $12 million challenge grant to CAE to continue its work. This grant was to be matched by an $12 million that would be used to fund additional rounds of Partnership grants. CAE also used this second challenge grant to fund new programs that permitted parents to take part in arts education, expose teenagers to arts careers and enable existing Partnership schools to share their successes with other schools.

=== Public school reform===

The cornerstone of the Annenberg Challenge effort was the creation of "arts partnerships" in which schools, working with [[orchestras]], [[museums]], [[dance]] groups, [[theater]] companies, community-based organizations and other groups to institutionalize school-wide arts programs and promote school reform. In 1997, 81 of New York City’s public schools were awarded the first of these three-year "Partnership [[Grants]]" to form collaborations with cultural and community-based organizations, creating an arts curricula tailored to meet the individual needs of each school. By supporting the use of the New York City’s cultural resources, CAE provided a link that made institutions, ranging from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] to the [[Pregones Theater]] Company in the [[South Bronx]], an integral part of the public school system.

Over one-third of public schools applied for the $75,000 partnership grants through CAE, and while 81 schools received a grant, hundreds did not. In response, BOE, with support from former Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], created Project ARTS, the first system-wide per capita funds for the arts since the mid-seventies.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Article [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E3D91E39F930A15756C0A96E958260&amp;scp=9&amp;sq=%22Project+ARTS%22&amp;st=nyt An Arts Revival Grows in New York Schools, May 23 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Project ARTS, used for the training and hiring of arts teachers as well as arts supplies, laid the groundwork for the Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, the first citywide arts [[curriculum]] since original cutbacks.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Article [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/26/arts/26blue.html?scp=3&amp;sq=%22blueprint+for+teaching+and+learning+in+the+arts%22&amp;st=nyt Renewed Push for the Artistic ABC's in N.Y., June 26 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
CAE offers family engagement programs, [[professional development]] opportunities for the education industry and career development training for high school students. CAE’s programs include:
* Parents As Arts Partners Grant: supports arts activities for parents and children. The PAAP grant, which funds 150 schools, engages families with hands-on interactive arts experiences, including workshops with [[Teaching artist]]s and visits to cultural organizations.
* Career Development Program: provides high school students with school-to-[[career]] preparation and work experience in the [[creative industries]]. Students access creative industries with career training that results in an [[internship]]. In 2007 CAE created a website that expands the reach of CDP beyond New York City to engage students, teachers and [[mentor]]s in the many career opportunities available in the creative industries. CAE also offers careers in the Arts Summer Institute (CITASI) to offer students, teachers, counselors, administrators and parents a deeper awareness of career opportunities.
* School Arts Support Initiative: launched in Spring 2008 in partnership with [[The New York Times Company]] Foundation and the New York City Department of Education to provide funding and additional in-kind professional support to three New York City public schools with little or no arts education. SASI grants went to MS 267: Math, Science and Technology Institute in [[Bedford Stuyvesant]], JS 231: Magnetech/Tri-Community Jr. High School in [[Queens]] and MS 223: The Laboratory School of Finance and Technology in the [[South Bronx]] to assess their arts education needs, engage appropriate providers of arts education and then implement arts education curricula.

=== Publications ===
''My Child, the Arts and Learning: A Guide for Parents, PreK-Second Grade'' was published in August 2007 in nine languages. CAE created the guide to help parents understand the benefits of and need for arts education. The guide provides parents with resources including, New York City and New York State arts requirements, which states every public school child is legally entitled to arts education. It was widely distributed throughout public schools and the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caenyc.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803171804/http://caenyc.org/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-08-03|title=The Center for Arts Education Website|publisher=|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

''A Decade of Progress'' is an 88-page report published by CAE in September 2007. It chronicles the movement to restore arts education in NYC public schools. The publication includes a companion DVD "A Decade of Progress" DVD Nominated for ARTS PROGRAMING AWARDS OF EXCELLENCE by [[Ovation (U.S. TV channel)|Ovation (TV channel)]], December 13, 2007 narrated by [[Anna Deavere Smith]] and provides exclusive segments with Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], then-School’s Chancellor [[Joel Klein]], and [[United Federation of Teachers]] President [[Randi Weingarten]] about the importance of and need for arts education in schools and the community.

In September 2007, CAE launched "ArtSmart New York",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationupdate.com/archives/2007/OCT/html/mad-thecenter.html|title=Education Update - The Center for Arts Education Helps New York Get "Arts Smart"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an advocacy campaign intended to raise awareness about arts education. CAE awarded New York City Council Members [[Robert Jackson (NYC)]] and Dominic Recchia the first ArtSmart award for their continued support.

== Leadership ==
{{Update|date=September 2016}}

CAE formed a [[Board of Directors]] to include representatives from the private and [[public sector]], including the schools’ Chancellor [[Rudy Crew]], [[Rudolph Giuliani|Giuliani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/rwg/html/96/annenber.html|title=Speech delivered by former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announcing the creation of CAE, December 11 1996|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110180117/http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/rwg/html/96/annenber.html|archivedate=2006-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Commissioner of the City of New York Cultural Affairs.

'''''The Death of Procris''''', '''''A Satyr mourning over a Nymph''''' or simply '''''A Mythological Subject''''' are names given to an unsigned, undated [[panel painting]] in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in [[London]], United Kingdom, securely attributed to [[Piero di Cosimo]] (who never signed his works).  Its date is uncertain, and its subject has been a matter of dispute. The name ''The Death of Procris'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Morte di Procri'') has been used since the 19th century, and is supposed to have been inspired by [[Ovid]]'s tale of the death of [[Procris]] at the hands of her husband [[Cephalus]], in ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' VII. The National Gallery has rejected this title since at least [[Cecil Gould]]'s catalogue of 1951, since when it has preferred to describe the subject as "''A Mythological Subject''" or "''A Satyr mourning over a Nymph''".&lt;ref name="Gould, 421"&gt;Gould, 421&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gallery"&gt;{{cite web | title=A Satyr mourning over a Nymph | url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng698 | work= | publisher=The National Gallery | date= | accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the uncertainty surrounding the subject matter, the painting, which shows a satyr mourning over the body of a young woman, has been one of the most popular works by Piero di Cosimo. [[Erwin Panofsky]] was mesmerized by the "strange lure emanating from the picture", and other commentators have admired its "hazy atmosphere of a waking dream".&lt;ref name="hagen"&gt;Rose-Marie Hagen, Rainer Hagen. ''What Great Paintings Say''. Taschen, 2003. {{ISBN|3-8228-2100-4}}. Pages 104-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

== A lesson for the newlyweds ==
[[File:Procris1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Detail of the mourning faun.]]
Piero's interest in the story of Procris might have been occasioned by one of the first Italian plays based on a mythological subject, [[Niccolò da Correggio]]'s ''Cefalo'', which had its premiere at a wedding feast in the [[Castello Estense]] (21 January 1487) and was printed in [[Venice]] in 1507.&lt;ref name="hagen"/&gt; The story is supposed to have been adapted from [[Plautus]] rather than Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and, in contrast to earlier treatments of the story, it ends happily.&lt;ref name="geronimus"/&gt; If so, the painting should be read as a warning to the newlyweds against the dangers of jealousy which brought about the death of Procris.&lt;ref name="hagen"/&gt;

The association with the theme of marriage is reinforced by the painting's unusual dimensions which suggest it was intended for the front of a ''[[cassone]]'', or bridal chest.&lt;ref name="hagen"/&gt; Gould suggests that although it has often been described as a ''cassone'' front, as most Florentine paintings of similar dimensions are, it is possible that it served a different purpose, and may have been designed to be set in [[wainscoting]].&lt;ref name="Gould, 421"/&gt; Fermor also finds it plausible that the painting hung in the marital chamber.&lt;ref name="fermor"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sharon |last=Fermor|title=Piero di Cosimo: Fiction, Invention, and Fantasìa|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=1993|isbn=0-948462-36-1|pages=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper part of the painting bears the artist's fingerprints.&lt;ref name="gallery"/&gt; On the back of the panel are a card and a seal with the stemma of the [[Guicciardini]] (which may have been a later addition).&lt;ref name="geronimus"/&gt; There is also a drawing interpreted as the frame of a [[pilaster]].&lt;ref name="gallery"/&gt;

== Inconsistencies ==

The subject matter lends itself to various levels of interpretation, prompting Dennis Geronimus to comment on some "mounting inconsistencies" of the painting with the Procris myth such as the absence of her husband, the deadly [[spear]] and the unusual location of her wounds.&lt;ref name="geronimus"&gt;Dennis Geronimus. ''Piero di Cosimo: Visions Beautiful and Strange''. Yale University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-300-10911-3}}. Pages 85-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Most conspicuously, the woman is mourned by a [[faun]] rather than her husband. The creature is absent from Ovid's story but is featured in Correggio's play where it acts "as the fatal meddler".&lt;ref name="geronimus"/&gt; [[File:Procris2.jpg|thumb|200px|A river landscape in the background.]]

Another controversial figure is the dog looking at the scene. It is tempting to interpret it as [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]], the transparent symbol of Procris's fidelity to her jealous husband.&lt;ref name="fermor"/&gt; By Ovid's account, Laelaps and the [[Teumessian fox]] had been turned into stone earlier in the story, so the identity of the dog remains problematic.&lt;ref name="geronimus"/&gt; The river in the distance may be one of the three rivers of the Underworld.&lt;ref name="hagen"/&gt;

== Alchemical symbolism ==

Considering the alchemist background of [[Cosimo Rosselli]] (the painter's teacher and father-in-law), it has been suggested that the painting "can be explained in terms of the pictorial language of [[alchemy]]".&lt;ref name="hagen"/&gt; According to this conceit, the dog (whose form is visually echoed by three other dogs in the background) represents none other than [[Hermes Trismegistos]] and a tree shown growing over Procris's breast symbolises the ''[[arbor philosophica]]''.&lt;ref name="hagen"/&gt; The red-and-gold veil of the victim is seen as symbolic of the "red-hot" [[philosopher's stone]], and the entire composition allegedly represents the alchemist's longed-for [[Elixir of life|victory over death]].&lt;ref name="hagen"/&gt;

'''''The Night Café''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Café de nuit}}) is an oil painting created by Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh]] in September 1888 in [[Arles]].&lt;ref name="walther"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walther |first1=Ingo F. |last2=Metzger |first2=Rainer |title=Vincent van Gogh:The Complete Paintings |publisher=Taschen |location=Köln |year=2012 |pages=428–29 |isbn=978-3822896433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its title is inscribed lower right beneath the signature. The painting is owned by [[Yale University]] and is currently held at the [[Yale University Art Gallery]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

The interior depicted is the ''Café de la Gare'', 30 Place Lamartine, run by Joseph-Michel Ginoux and his wife Marie, who in November 1888 posed for Van Gogh's and Gauguin's ''[[L'Arlésienne (painting)|Arlésienne]]''; a bit later, Joseph Ginoux evidently posed for both artists, too.

==Description==
The painting was executed on industrial primed canvas of size 30 ([[French Standard Sizes for Oil paintings|French standard]]). It depicts the interior of the cafe, with a half-curtained doorway in the center background leading, presumably, to more private quarters. Five customers sit at tables along the walls to the left and right, and a waiter in a light coat, to one side of a billiard table near the center of the room, stands facing the viewer.
 
The five customers depicted in the scene have been described as "three drunks and derelicts in a large public room [...] huddled down in sleep or stupor."&lt;ref name=mvg&gt;Harris, Nathaniel: ''The Masterworks of Van Gogh'', pp 167-168. Godalming, Surrey, United Kingdom: Colour Library Direct, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar wrote, "The cafe was an all-night haunt of local down-and-outs and prostitutes, who are depicted slouched at tables and drinking together at the far end of the room.".&lt;ref name=yuag&gt;Shestack, Alan, editor, ''Yale University Art Gallery Selections'', "Vincent van Gogh", pp 68-69, by Antonia Lant ("AL").

In wildly contrasting, vivid colours, the ceiling is green, the upper walls red, the glowing, gas ceiling lamps and floor largely yellow. The paint is applied thickly, with many of the lines of the room leading toward the door in the back. The perspective looks somewhat downward toward the floor.&lt;ref name=mvg/&gt;

==Genesis==
[[File:Night Cafe in Arles, The.jpg|thumb|Watercolour, private collection]]
In a jocular passage of a letter Van Gogh wrote to his brother, Theo, the artist said Ginoux had taken so much of his money that he'd told the cafe owner it was time to take his revenge by painting the place.&lt;ref name=mvg/&gt;

In August 1888, the artist told his brother in a letter:
{{cquote|Today I am probably going to begin on the interior of the café where I have a room, by gas light, in the evening. It is what they call here a “café de nuit” (they are fairly frequent here), staying open all night. “Night prowlers” can take refuge there when they have no money to pay for a lodging, or are too drunk to be taken in.&lt;ref&gt;Letter [http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/518.htm  518]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
In the first days of September 1888, Van Gogh sat up for three consecutive nights to paint the picture, sleeping during the day.&lt;ref name="webexhibits.org"&gt;Letter [http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/533.htm  533]&lt;/ref&gt; Little later, he sent the water-colour, copying the composition and again simplifying the colour scheme on order to meet the simplicity of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese woodblock prints]].

Van Gogh's ''[[Cafe Terrace at Night]]'', showing outdoor tables, a street scene and the night sky, was painted in Arles at about the same time. It depicts a different cafe, a larger establishment on the Place du Forum.&lt;ref name=mvg/&gt;

==Critical reaction==

===Van Gogh on the painting===
Van Gogh wrote many letters to his brother, Theo van Gogh, and often included details of his latest work. The artist wrote his brother more than once about ''The Night Café''. According to [[Meyer Schapiro]],&lt;ref name=msvg&gt;Schapiro, Meyer, ''Van Gogh'', 2000 (reprint of the 1994 edition). New York: Harry N. Abrams Inc., pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; "there are few works on which [Van Gogh] has written with more conviction."

In one of the letters&lt;ref name="webexhibits.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=awoa&gt;Sayre, Henry M., ''A World of Art'', third edition, 2000, p 136. Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt; he describes this painting: 
{{cquote|I have tried to express the terrible passions of humanity by means of red and green. The room is blood red and dark yellow with a green billiard table in the middle; there are four lemon-yellow lamps with a glow of orange and green. Everywhere there is a clash and contrast of the most alien reds and greens, in the figures of little sleeping hooligans, in the empty dreary room, in violet and blue. The blood-red and the yellow-green of the billiard table, for instance, contrast with the soft tender Louis XV green of the counter, on which there is a rose nosegay. The white clothes of the landlord, watchful in a corner of that furnace, turn lemon-yellow, or pale luminous green.}}

The next day (September 9), he wrote Theo: "In my picture of the ''Night Café'' I have tried to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad or commit a crime. So I have tried to express, as it were, the powers of darkness in a low public house, by soft Louis XV green and malachite, contrasting with yellow-green and harsh blue-greens, and all this in an atmosphere like a devil's furnace, of pale sulphur. And all with an appearance of Japanese gaiety, and the good nature of [[Tartarin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Van Gogh, Vincent, [http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/534.htm letter to Theo van Gogh], September 9, 1888, "Translated by Mrs. Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, edited by Robert Harrison, published in The Complete Letters of Vincent van Gogh, Publisher: Bulfinch, 1991, number 534", retrieved March 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote: "It is color not locally true from the point of view of the stereoscopic realist, but color to suggest the emotion of an ardent temperament."&lt;ref name=awoa/&gt;

The violent exaggeration of the colours and the thick texture of the paint made the picture "one of the ugliest pictures I have done", Van Gogh wrote at one point.&lt;ref name=yuag/&gt; He also called it "the equivalent, though different, of ''[[The Potato Eaters]]''", which it resembles somewhat in its use of lamplight and concerns for the condition of people in need.&lt;ref name=msvg/&gt;

Soon after its execution, Van Gogh incorporated this painting into his ''[[The Décoration for the Yellow House|Décoration for the Yellow House]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Letters [http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/544.htm 544], [http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/B18.htm B18], [http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/552.htm 552]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction of critics and scholars===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ghidfa9TE ''The Night Café'' - Vincent Van Gogh], [[Smarthistory]]&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;{{cite web | title =The Night Café - Vincent Van Gogh | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | date = | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ghidfa9TE | accessdate =August 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
The work has been called one of Van Gogh's masterpieces&lt;ref name=mvg/&gt; and one of his most famous.&lt;ref name=yuag/&gt;

Unlike typical [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] works, the painter does not project a neutral stance towards the world or an attitude of enjoyment of the beauty of nature or of the moment. The painting is an instance of Van Gogh's use of what he called "suggestive colour" or, as he would soon term it, "arbitrary colour" in which the artist infused his works with his emotions, typical of what was later called [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=mvg/&gt;

The red and green of the walls and ceiling are an "oppressive combination", and the lamps are "sinister features" with orange-and-green halos, according to Nathaniel Harris. "The top half of the canvas creates its basic mood, as any viewer can verify by looking at it with one or the other half of the reproduction covered up; the bottom half supplies the 'facts.'" The thick paint adds a surreal touch of waviness to the table tops, billiard table and floor. The viewer is left with a feeling of seediness and despair, Harris wrote. "The scene might easily be banal and dispiriting; instead, it is dispiriting but also terrible."&lt;ref name=mvg/&gt;

The objects of pleasure (billiard table, wine bottles and glasses) are contrasted in the picture with the "few human beings absorbed in their individual loneliness and despair", Antonia Lant commented.&lt;ref name=yuag/&gt;

The perspective of the scene is one of its most powerful effects, according to various critics. Schapiro described the painting's "absorbing perspective which draws us headlong past empty chairs and tables into hidden depths behind a distant doorway &amp;mdash; an opening like the silhouette of the standing figure."&lt;ref name=msvg/&gt; Lant described it as a "shocking perspectival rush, which draws us, by the converging diagonals of floorboards and billiard table, towards the mysterious, courtained doorway beyond."&lt;ref name=yuag/&gt; Harris wrote that the perspective "pitches the viewer forward into the room, towards the half-curtained private quarters, and also creates a sense of vertigo and [[distorted vision]], familiar from nightmares."&lt;ref name=mvg/&gt; Schapiro also noted, "To the impulsive rush of these converging lines he opposes the broad horizontal band of red, full of scattered objects [...]"&lt;ref name=msvg/&gt;

==Gauguin's competition piece==
[[Image:Paul Gauguin 072.jpg|thumb|Gauguin's ''Night Café at Arles'']]
Soon after his arrival in Arles, [[Paul Gauguin]] painted the same location, as a background to his portrait of Madame Ginoux.&lt;ref&gt;See [[L'Arlésienne (painting)|L'Arlésienne]] for details&lt;/ref&gt; While the Van Gogh painting depicts the café as a room of isolation, Gauguin's ''Night Café at Arles'' mixes the concepts of isolation (to the painting's left) and spirited socializing (in the center), behind Mme. Ginoux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/f05/manli/gallery_3_the_night_cafe_gauguins_vs_van_goghs.html |last=Chung Li |first=Man |title=The Night Cafe: Gauguin's VS Van Gogh's |publisher=princeton.edu |work=Van Gogh, Solitude &amp; Alcohol |accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also acquired by Ivan Morozov and now hangs in the [[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/2010-01-28-01-28-27-french-masterpieces-from-the-pushkin-museum-on-view-in-budapest.html |title=French Masterpieces from the Pushkin Museum on View in Budapest |publisher=Art Knowledge News |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Van Gogh used the picture to settle debts with Ginoux, the landlord said to be depicted (standing) in it.&lt;ref name=yuag/&gt; Formerly a highlight of the [[Ivan Morozov]] collection in [[Moscow]], the painting was [[nationalization|nationalized]] and sold by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s. The painting was eventually acquired by [[Stephen Carlton Clark]], who bequeathed it to [[Yale University Art Gallery|the art gallery]] of [[Yale University]].

On March 24, 2009, Yale sued Pierre Konowaloff, Morozov's purported great-grandson, to maintain the university's title to the work. Konowaloff had allegedly asserted a claim to own the painting on the grounds that the Soviets had invalidly nationalized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/A-Lawsuits-a-Go-on-a-Valuable-van-Gogh.html |title=Yale: Hands Off the Van Gogh |last1=Drazen |first1=Brad |last2=Gendreau |first2=LeAnne |date=March 26, 2009 |work= |publisher=NBC Connecticut |accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale dropped its lawsuit in October of that year, in a motion which stated “it is well-established that a foreign nation’s taking of its own national’s property within its own borders does not violate international law,” claiming that both the Soviet and Yale acquisitions of the painting were therefore legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2009/oct/27/yale-moves-to-drop-museum-suits/ |title=Yale moves to drop museum suits |author=Caplan-Bricker, Nora |date=Oct 27, 2009 |work=Yale Daily News |publisher= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2016 the [[United States Supreme Court]] rejected an appeal by Konowaloff regarding the case, siding with a federal appeals court in New York cited the “act of state” doctrine. The rejection means Yale's ownership is absolute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stohr|first1=Greg|title=Yale Can Keep Van Gogh Masterpiece as Supreme Court Rejects Appeal|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-28/yale-can-keep-van-gogh-masterpiece-as-top-court-rejects-appeal|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=24 May 2018|date=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Teniers the Younger - modello for Theatrum Pictorium 1673.jpg|thumb|Modello for the frontispiece for the ''Theatrum Pictorium'', by Teniers]]
'''''Theatrum Pictorium''''', or ''Theatre of Painting'', is a short-hand name of a book published in the 1660s by [[David Teniers the Younger]] for his employer, the [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]]. It was a catalog of 243 Italian paintings in the Archduke's collection of over 1300 paintings, with engravings of the paintings taken from small models that Teniers had personally prepared. A second edition with page numbers was published in 1673.

During the years 1646-1656  Leopold Wilhelm was governor of the Netherlands and formed one of the greatest art collections of his age. Teniers effectively became its curator after the death of his predecessor [[Jan van den Hoecke]] in 1651. Leopold Wilhelm’s collection came to hold works by [[Hans Holbein the Elder]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Raphael]], [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese]] and more than 15 works by [[Titian]]. Teniers made a list of the painters in the collection as part of the forward to his 1673 catalog:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Theatrum Pictorium gri 33125009347911 0012.jpg
File:Theatrum Pictorium gri 33125009347911 0013.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This list is an important document that reflects the contemporary taste in paintings in Brussels at that time. Of all the painters, the names [[Magdalena Woutiers]] and [[Madonna Fitta de Milano]] are the only women whose work is documented as being in the Archduke's collection. No matter how illustrious the name however, only works by the better known Italian painters were chosen to be engraved for illustrations. At the end of his governorship, the Archduke and his collection moved to the [[Stallburg]]. This archducal collection now forms the heart of Vienna’s [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]].

Before moving to Vienna in 1659, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm formed his art collection in [[Brussels]], where [[David Teniers the Younger]] painted views of the most prized possessions of his Brussels gallery. He painted several of these in various compositions which are now spread among various collections:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khm.at/en/visit/collections/picture-gallery/history-of-the-collection/ History of the collections] of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Teniers employed a team of 12 engravers for reproducing the 243 paintings in the Theatrum. He produced small copies in oil of each of the chosen paintings, issuing these as models to his engravers and 120 of which were auctioned by the estate of [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7BU-36sK16MC&amp;pg=PA130 Fifteenth- to Eighteenth-century European Paintings in the Robert Lehman Collection: France, Central Europe, The Netherlands, Spain and Great Britain], by [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Charles Sterling&lt;/ref&gt; Teniers’ painted copies measuring approximately 17 x 25&amp;nbsp;cm are now spread among various collections. The [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] Gallery holds 14 of these works, the largest group in any public collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codart.com/exhibitions/details/1139/ David Teniers and the Theatre of Painting, 19 October 2006 – 21 January 2007] exhibition press release on [[codart]]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 12 engravers, the five who contributed most were [[Jan van Troyen]] with 56, [[Lucas Vorsterman the Younger]] with 52, [[Pieter van Lisebetten]] 40, [[Theodoor van Kessel]] 27, and [[Coryn Boel|Coryn]] or Quirin Boel 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnanews.org/archive/2007/04/vegelin.html History of the project] on website for ''Historians of Netherlandish Art''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Popels]] contributed five engravings.

==Surviving works==
The works listed in the book that survive are generally in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, while the modelli or small models for the engravings have been lost or are in other collections. The engravings and the modelli were inscribed with the dimensions of the original paintings, though their characteristics were often adjusted to take advantage of the maximum illustration possibilities of the album page size. The dimensions were in the form "4 alta 3 lata", which means 4 palm-widths high and 3 palm-widths wide, such as the case with the engraving after [[Francesco Bassano the Younger|Bassano's]] ''Boy with a Flute'':

'''Anthony James Heaton [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]''' (born 11 October 1954) is a British sculptor, [[disability rights]] activist and arts administrator, who was awarded an OBE in 2013 for services to the arts and the [[disability arts]] movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was CEO of the arts charity [[Shape Arts|Shape]] until March 2017. In 2012, he won the competition to produce an installation celebrating [[Channel 4]]'s involvement in the [[London 2012 Paralympic Games]].  This produced his 'Monument for the Unintended Performer'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Early years==

Heaton was born in [[Preston, Lancashire]], in 1954, the son of a [[coppersmith]].  When, at the age of 16, a motor bike accident left him with a [[spinal injury]], he switched from a [[comprehensive school]] to a local arts college at [[Southport]].  From 1972, he was self-employed as artist, sign writer, disc jockey, record shop proprietor, progressive rock band member and mural painter. According to a Disability Arts Online profile, at this period "Heaton gathered enormous expertise and self-reliance whilst appearing to drift aimlessly".&lt;ref name=square&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/tony_heaton_profile |title=Tony Heaton: Squaring The Circle |publisher=disability arts online |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he enrolled on a visual arts degree at [[Lancaster University]] whilst earning a living as a sign-painter.&lt;ref name=square/&gt;

A contemporary of [[Andy Goldsworthy]], Heaton experimented with environmental sculpture on sands at [[Morecambe Bay]]. Lancaster's head of sculpture, Paul Hatton, noted that the marks left by Heaton were immediately distinguishable from the footprints of his fellow students and urged him to develop work about this. Heaton states that, "A chance comment about how the marks left in the sand by my feet and crutches made my tracks immediately identifiable became the catalyst for a whole series of works relating to disability and my interaction with the environment".&lt;ref name="square" /&gt; Heaton exhibited a plaster cast of his feet and stick imprints, his first piece of disability art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyheaton.co.uk/squareinthecircle.htm |title=Squareinthecircle? |publisher=tonyheaton.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic career ==

Heaton’s early sculptures often use what Disability Arts in London magazine described as "the everyday impedimenta of disability: [[Street fundraising|collecting can]]s, [[wheelchair|NHS wheelchairs]], [[X-ray]]s, [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom#Part M. Access to and use of Buildings|Part M of the Building Regulations]]".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; But his work contradicts the normal associations of such materials by turning them into "profound and joyously witty statements about the nature of our oppression".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Tony Heaton...exposed - a retrospective |journal=Disability Arts in London |volume=Issue 107 |date=November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early piece, "Springback" (1990), is an assemblage including a spinal X-Ray juxtaposed above the [[Shock absorber|shock absorber spring]]s of a scrapped motorcycle, referring to the accident which caused his impairment and the metal strengthening spring placed inside his spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/tony-heaton-interview |title=Interview: John O'Donoghue talks to Tony Heaton, Shape CEO |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Shaken..not Stirred' (1991) consisted of a seven-feet high pyramid of 1,760 [[Street fundraising|charity collecting cans]], its ascending ranks of red plastic referring to the hierarchical nature of the charity system.  The whole edifice was brought crashing to the ground when Heaton threw an artificial leg at it, suggesting that the hierarchical system could be destroyed by the collective power of disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutherland, A. |chapter=Choices, Rights and Cabaret |editor1=Swain, J. |editor2=French S. |title=Disability on Equal Terms |publisher=Sage |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4129-1987-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his work has developed, it has embodied ideas about disability and impairment.  For instance, "Split" (1995) is a [[woodcarving]] made from a piece of ash discarded by a wood turner as useless because it has a [[Shakes (timber)|shake]]; a fault running through it.  Heaton saw this as "indicative of a society that sees only perfection and disregards all that is damaged or perceived as impaired".&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

[[File:Wheelchair sculpture 6493.JPG|thumb|Great Britain from a Wheelchair]]
The 1994 sculpture, ‘Great Britain from a Wheelchair’ is a map of Britain made from two grey NHS wheelchairs.  "A delightful game, it forms a wonderful repudiation of the value judgement ('This is for some tragic bastard', in Heaton’s words) implicit in the wheelchairs."&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; An image of this work was chosen by the National Disability Arts Collection and Archive as an example of work from the ‘golden age’ of disability arts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-35063050 |title=The 'golden age' of disability arts - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-12-15 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2012 Paralympics  Heaton was invited to redesign 'Great Britain From a Wheelchair' as lecterns for [[Lord Coe]] and [[Philip Craven|Sir Phillip Craven]] during the opening and closing ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsinternational.org/artists/profiles/tony-heaton/ |title=Tony Heaton |publisher=Disability Arts International |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he was commissioned to produce ‘Monument to the Unintended Performer’, an installation for the [[Big 4 (sculpture)|Big 4]]  sculpture sited outside Channel Four’s offices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/channel-4-unveils-new-big-4-installation |title=Channel 4 unveils new 'Big 4' installation |publisher=Channel 4 |date=2012-05-28 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brought together three elements in addition to the Big 4: the first based on the classical Greek sculpture [[Discobolus]], the discus thrower, evoking the spirit of the Olympics; the second element, a circle, representing the wheel of the international symbol of access; and lastly, the introduction of gold, silver and bronze considers hierarchy. Heaton stated: "I wanted to use the structure of the Big 4 as one of four elements that would fuse together to form a new cohesive piece - which would provoke thought and celebrate Channel 4's involvement and commitment to the Paralympics. The subtext is the assertion that disabled people are almost always the object of scrutiny and curiosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/steps/features/clare-amsel-produces-the-paralympics/tony-heaton/ |title=Tony Heaton &amp;#124; Lancaster University |publisher=Lancaster.ac.uk |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2012/07/public-art-and-disability |title=Public art and disability: Getting noticed |publisher=The Economist |date=2012-07-19 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Gold Lamé', included in the 2014 exhibition Art of The Lived Experiment, is an [[Cars for wheelchair users|invalid car]] covered in [[gold leaf]].  The title puns on the word "lame". Heaton states that the [[Invacar]] has been “transformed from prosthetic to sculpture, transmuted from spazz blue to gold, from Lame to Lamé”, mirroring his own life adjustments, where he says, "I transmuted from biker to invalid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedoublenegative.co.uk/2014/11/i-always-avoided-referring-to-disability-in-my-work-because-i-was-afraid-to-seem-pitiful-the-transformation-of-dadafest/ |title="I Always Avoided Referring To Disability In My Work, Because I Was Afraid To Seem Pitiful": The Transformation Of DaDaFest |publisher=The Double Negative |date=2014-11-04 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/dadafest-2014-art-of-the-lived-experiment-review |title=Review: DaDaFest International 2014: Art of the Lived Experiment |publisher=disability arts online |date=2014-11-14 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holton Lee ==

From 1997 to 2007, Heaton was based in [[Dorset]], as Director of the [[Holton Lee Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/movers-tony-heaton-chief-executive-shape/management/article/800469 |title=Movers: Tony Heaton, chief executive, Shape |publisher=Third Sector |date=2008-04-09 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers a mix of environmental, artistic and spiritual activities, with short stay residential facilities for Disabled people, in an [[SSSI]] comprising 350 acres of woodland, reed bed and heath land landscape adjacent to [[Poole Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrysidemobility.org/locations/holton-lee |title=Holton Lee |publisher=Countryside Mobility |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaton developed a 10-year strategic plan for the organisation: a contemporary arts and education programme based on a series of accessible buildings including a gallery and artists’ studios, which would enable a new programme of artistic work, a growth in residential capacity and a focus for disability arts. All the buildings would use local materials blending in with Holton Lee's natural surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/NDACA |title=National Disability Arts Collection and Archive |publisher=disability arts online |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these, Faith House gallery, designed by [[Tony Fretton]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;was hailed by Jonathan Glancey in the Guardian as ‘one of the most beautiful new buildings in Britain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Glancey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/oct/07/architecture.artsfeatures |title=Tony Fretton's Faith House &amp;#124; Art and design |publisher=The Guardian |date=2002-10-07 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Heaton organised the DA21 Disability Arts Conference at Holton Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/2000_2003 |title=2000 - 2003 |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also planned the inaugural conference to discuss the establishment of what would become the [[National Disability Arts Collection and Archive]]. The idea then envisaged was to create a purpose-built archive as part of the developing Holton Lee campus. This was abandoned after Heaton moved on. NDACA will now take the form of an interactive website and catalogue, after receiving funding of nearly £1 million from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndaca.org.uk/about-ndaca |title=about ndaca - National Disability Arts Collection &amp; Archive |publisher=Ndaca.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shape ==

In 2007 Heaton became CEO of [[Shape Arts]], the arts and disability charity founded by dancer Gina Levete. He brought to the organisation a new emphasis on disability arts and professional opportunities for artists.

He instituted the Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary, which provides 3-month bursaries for disabled artists to undertake residencies at leading visual arts institutions.  These have included the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Camden Arts Centre]], [[Spike Island Artspace|Spike Island]], [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art|The Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]], the Bluecoat Gallery and [[The New Art Gallery Walsall|New Art Gallery Walsall]]. The bursary is named after the late sculptor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/Pages/News/Category/adam-reynolds-memorial-bursary |title=News &amp;#124; Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom Heaton had a close friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/adam-reynolds |title=Adam Reynolds: an Obituary |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early winners were Caroline Cardus, Aaron Williamson, Sally Booth and Noëmi Lakmaier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/Adam-Reynolds-Memorial-Bursary-Shape-The-First-Four |title=Discussion: John O'Donoghue gives an overview of the Shape's Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary: The First Four |publisher=disability arts online |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also created the Shape Open, an annual open exhibition of artwork by disabled and non-disabled artists created in response to a disability-centred theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/Pages/News/Category/shape-open |title=News &amp;#124; Shape Open |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition's patron is [[Yinka Shonibare]], at whose Guest Projects space in Hackney, London the 2016 exhibition took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/yinka-shonibare-to-host-shape-arts-annual-open-exhibition |title=Yinka Shonibare To Host Shape Arts’ Annual Open Exhibition |publisher=Artlyst.com |date=2015-12-17 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eastlondonlines.co.uk/2016/02/yinka-shonibare-hosts-shape-open-exhibition/ |author=Jude Jweihan |title=Yinka Shonibare Hosts Shape Open Exhibition – Eastlondonlines |publisher=Eastlondonlines.co.uk |date=2016-02-10 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaton has announced that he will stand down as CEO in 2017 and become Chair of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Trish Wheatley |url=http://disabilityarts.online/magazine/opinion/new-chapter-shape-tony-heaton/ |title=A new chapter for Shape and Tony Heaton - My blog |publisher=Disabilityarts.online |date=2016-11-02 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Order of the British Empire ==
Heaton was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours, 2013, for services to the arts and the disability arts movement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/15/queens-birthday-honours-obe |title=Queen's birthday honours list 2013: OBE &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7430">'''Virtual art''' is a term for the [[virtualization]] of art, made with the technical media developed at the end of the 1980s (or a bit before, in some cases).&lt;ref&gt;Frank Popper, From Technological to Virtual Art, Leonardo Books, MIT Press, 2007, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; These include human-machine interfaces such as visualization casks, [[stereoscopic]] spectacles and screens, digital painting and sculpture, generators of three-dimensional sound, data gloves, data clothes, position sensors, tactile and power feed-back systems, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6938244.stm Mobile snaps reveal invisible art]&lt;/ref&gt; As virtual art covers such a wide array of mediums it is a catch-all term for specific focuses within it. Much [[contemporary art]] has become, in [[Frank Popper]]'s terms, '''virtualized'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Frank Popper and Virtualised Art'', Tema Celeste Magazine: Winter 2004 issue #101, pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Virtual art can be considered a [[post-convergent]] art form based on the bringing together of art and technology, thus containing all previous media as subsets.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1367975&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing this focus on art and technology are the books of [[Jack Burnham]] (''Beyond Modern Sculpture'' 1968) and [[Gene Youngblood]] (''[[Expanded Cinema]]'' 1970). Since virtual art can consist of [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], or [[mixed reality]], it can be seen in other aspects of production such as [[video games]] and movies.

In his book ''From Technological to Virtual Art'', Frank Popper traces the development of immersive, [[interactive]] new media art from its historical antecedents through today's [[digital art]], [[computer art]], [[cybernetic art]], [[multimedia]] and [[net art]]. Popper shows that contemporary virtual art is a further refinement of the [[technological]] art of the late twentieth century and also a departure from it. What is new about this [[new media art]], he argues, is its humanization of technology, its emphasis on [[interactivity]], its [[philosophical]] investigation of the real and the [[Virtuality|virtual]], and its multisensory nature.&lt;ref&gt; [[Margaret Boden]], Mind As Machine, [[Oxford University Press]], 2006, p. 1089&lt;/ref&gt; He argues further that what distinguishes the artists who practice virtual art from traditional artists is their combined commitment to [[aesthetics]] and [[technology]]. Their "extra-artistic" goals – linked to their [[aesthetic]] intentions – concern not only [[science]] and [[society]] but also basic human needs and drives.&lt;ref&gt;''Origins of Virtualism: An Interview with Frank Popper conducted by [[Joseph Nechvatal]]'', CAA Art Journal, Spring 2004, pp. 62-77&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain and illustrate the emergence of a techno-aesthetic, Popper stresses the panoramic and multi-generational reach of virtual art. As regards to virtual art, openness is stressed both from the point of view of the artists and their creativity and from that of the follow-up users in their reciprocating thoughts and actions. This commitment to the teeming openness found in virtual art can be traced to the theories of [[Umberto Eco]] and other aestheticians.

==In virtual worlds and entertainment==
Virtual art can be seen in worlds like [[Second Life]], and Inworldz virtual environments in which anything is possible to the user, who is represented by an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. In the [[virtual world]], the avatar's abilities ranges from ordinary walking to flying. The environment and scenery of such environments is similar to the real world, except that it can be altered by the avatar. Worlds like Inworldz and Second Life feature an editor which allows the user to build his or her own experience just the way he or she wants it to be. The user is not bounded by physics or improbabilities that he or she faces in the real world.

Virtual art is made of many computer programs and has no boundaries, so it uses animations, movies, computer games and so on. As it becomes more and more popular and important, it results in people being able to live another virtual life. With the advancements in technology virtual art has transformed and evolved quickly from simple 8-bit representations to 3D models containing millions of polygons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2957">[[Image:Youra Potsherd.jpg|thumb|right|The Youra Potsherds are ceramic fragments with symbols discovered by [[Adamantios Sampson]] on the islet of Youra in [[Greece]]; they are dated between [[6000 BC]] and [[5500 BC]].]]

The '''Youra Potsherds''' (or '''Gioura Potsherds''') are [[ceramic]] fragments dated to 6000 BC – 5500 BC discovered during systematic explorations in the "Cyclops Cave" at the uninhabited [[Gioura|islet of Youra]] (20 miles from [[Alonissos]]) in the northern [[Sporades]], an [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] archipelago off the coast of [[Thessaly]] in [[Greece]]. These fragments were discovered in 1992 by [[Adamantios Sampson]], Inspector of Antiquities, during a project whose more general purpose was to clarify the prehistoric occupation sequence in the area, with an emphasis on the pre-pottery sequences from the Late [[Pleistocene]], especially two thick areas of deposits: Late Aegean [[Neolithic]] Ib and Early Neolithic II. 

Some of the incisions on the potsherds bear some apparent resemblance to letter shapes. Adamantios Sampson notes that the "vase bear[s] incised unidentifiable symbols. It is possible that it echoes evidence on an Aegean Neolithic 'script' or 'proto-script', a very fashionable subject of discussion in Greece, after similar finds in [[Lake Orestiada|Kastoria lake]], East [sic] Macedonia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1624 Cave of Cyclope], Greek Ministry of Culture; for the finds in Kastoria, or [[Lake Orestiada]], see the [[Dispilio Tablet]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adamantios Sampson, [http://www.magnesia-tourism.gr/%CE%95%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82%CE%A4%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82/%CE%91%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82%CE%A4%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82/%CE%A3%CF%80%CE%AE%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%9A%CF%8D%CE%BA%CE%BB%CF%89%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%93%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82%CE%91%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%85.aspx Magnisia Peripheral Unit: Cave of Cyclope, Youra, Alonnessos], ([http://www.magnesia-tourism.gr/%CE%91%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%81%CF%8E%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1/tabid/91/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/52/language/en-US/Default.aspx signed from author at greek edition)]&lt;/ref&gt;
