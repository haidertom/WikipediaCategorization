      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5728">The '''ADMS 3''' (Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System) is an advanced [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric pollution dispersion model]] for calculating concentrations of [[air pollutants|atmospheric pollutants]] emitted both [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|continuously]] from [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|point, line, volume and area sources]], or [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|intermittently]] from point sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/scram001/dispersion_alt.htm#adms3 US Environmental Protection Agency "SCRAM" website]&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants (CERC) of the UK in collaboration with the [[UK Met Office|UK Meteorological Office]], [[National Power|National Power plc]] (now INNOGY Holdings plc) and the [[University of Surrey]]. The first version of ADMS was released in 1993. The version of the ADMS model discussed on this page is version 3 and was released in February 1999. It runs on [[Microsoft Windows]]. The current release, ADMS 5 Service Pack 1, was released in April 2013 with a number of additional features.&lt;ref name=CERC&gt;[http://www.cerc.co.uk/environmental-software/ADMS-model.html The CERC web site pages about ADMS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features and capabilities of the ADMS 3==

The model includes [[algorithm]]s which take into account: [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|downwash]] effects of nearby buildings within the path of the dispersing pollution plume; effects of complex terrain; effects of coastline locations; [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet deposition]], gravitational settling and [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|dry deposition]]; short term fluctuations in pollutant concentration; chemical reactions; [[radioactive decay]] and gamma-dose; [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling#Briggs plume rise equations|pollution plume rise]] as a function of distance; jets and directional releases; averaging time ranging from very short to annual; and condensed plume visibility. The system also includes a [[Meteorology|meteorological]] data input preprocessor.&lt;ref name=CERC/&gt;

The model is capable of simulating [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|passive or buoyant]] continuous plumes as well as short duration [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|puff]] releases. It characterizes the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|atmospheric turbulence]] by two parameters, the [[boundary layer]] depth and the [[Monin-Obukhov length]], rather the single parameter [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Pasquill class]].&lt;ref name=CERC/&gt;

ADMS 3 can simultaneously model up to 100 [[air pollutants|emission]] sources, of which:&lt;ref name=CERC/&gt;

* up to 100 may be point or jet sources
* up to 6 may be line, area or volume sources
* 1 may be a line source

The latest version (ADMS 5) allows up to 300 sources. Within that limit, up to 300 point sources, 30 line sources, 30 area sources and 30 volume sources may be modelled.

The performance of the model has been evaluated against various measured dispersion data sets.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Steven R et al.

The '''''AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors''''' is a compilation of the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)'s [[emission factor]] information on [[air pollution]], first published in 1968. {{As of |2018}}, the last edition is the 5th from 2010. 

==History==
The AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors is a compilation of [[emission factor]]s of [[Air pollution|air pollutants]], in other words numbers which relate the quantity of a pollutant released into the ambient air with a certain activity. This compilation was first compiled and published by the [[US Public Health Service]] in 1968. In 1972, it was revised and issued as the second edition by the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] EPA. 
In 1985, the subsequent fourth edition was split into two volumes: Volume I has since included stationary [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|point and area source]] [[emission factor]]s, and Volume II includes [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|mobile source]] emission factors. Volume I is currently in its fifth edition and is available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;EPA [https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-factors-and-quantification/ap-42-compilation-air-emission-factors AP 42, Volume I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924132127/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/index.html |date=September 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Volume II is no longer maintained as such, but [[roadway air dispersion model]]s for estimating emissions from onroad vehicles and from [[non-road vehicle]]s and mobile equipment are available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;EPA [http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models.htm Mobile source emission models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513041628/http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models.htm |date=May 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In routine common usage, Volume I of the emission factor compilation is very often referred to as simply ''AP 42''.

==Content==
Air pollution emission factors are usually expressed as the weight of the pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate matter emitted per megagram of coal burned). The factors help to estimate emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, the factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages. 

The equation for the estimation of emissions before [[Air pollution#Control devices|emission reduction controls]] are applied is:

:'''E = A × EF'''

and for emissions after reduction controls are applied:

:'''E = A × EF × (1-ER/100)'''

Chapter 5, Section 5.1 "Petroleum Refining" discusses the air pollutant emissions from the equipment in the various refinery processing units as well as from the auxiliary steam-generating boilers, furnaces and engines, and Table 5.1.1 includes the pertinent emission factors. Table 5.1.2 includes the emission factors for the fugitive air pollutant emissions from the large wet [[cooling tower]]s in [[Oil refinery|refineries]] and from the oil/water separators used in treating refinery [[wastewater]].

The fugitive air pollutant emission factors from [[safety valve|relief valves]], piping [[valves]], open-ended piping lines or drains, piping [[flange]]s,  sample connections, and [[mechanical seal|seals]] on [[pump]] and [[Gas compressor|compressor]] shafts are discussed and included the report EPA-458/R-95-017, "Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates" which is included in the Chapter 5 section of AP 42. That report includes the emission factors developed by the EPA for petroleum refineries and for the synthetic organic chemical industry (SOCMI).

In most cases, the emission factors in Chapter 5 are included for both ''uncontrolled'' conditions before emission reduction controls are implemented and ''controlled'' conditions after specified emission reduction methods are implemented.

Chapter 7 "Liquid Storage Tanks" is devoted to the methodology for calculating the emissions losses from the six basic tank designs used for organic liquid storage: [[Fixed roof tank|fixed roof]] (vertical and
horizontal), [[External_floating_roof_tank|external floating roof]], domed external (or covered) floating roof, internal floating roof, variable vapor space, and pressure (low and high). The methodology in Chapter 7 was developed by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] in collaboration with the EPA.

The EPA has developed a software program named "TANKS" which performs the Chapter 7 methodology for calculating emission losses from storage tanks.  The program's installer file along with a user manual, and the source code are available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/software/tanks/index.html#order TANKS download site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305212130/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/software/tanks/index.html#order |date=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 5 and 7 discussed above are illustrative of the type of information contained in the other chapters of AP 42. It should also be noted that many of the fugitive emission factors in Chapter 5 and the emissions calculation methodology in Chapter 7 and the TANKS program also apply to many other industrial categories besides the petroleum industry.

== Introduction ==
Advocacy planning was formulated in the 1960s by [[Paul Davidoff]]. It is a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] and inclusive planning theory where planners seek to represent the interests of various groups within society. Davidoff (1965) was an activist lawyer and planner who believed that advocacy planning was a necessary method for representing the low-income and minority groups who were not always on equal footing with the rich and powerful.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidoff|first=Paul|date=1965|title=Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning|url=|journal=The City Reader|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and Context ==
Before the 1960s, planning was usually performed by trained professionals within local governments who worked directly under the guidance of planning commissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This method of planning is commonly referred to as top down and was a result of the planning practices that developed throughout history. Top down is characterised by its authoritative and [[undemocratic]] methods, where institutions and individuals plan without first consulting the various stakeholders who are involved with the use and development of the land. An example of this approach is [[colonialism]] in Africa during the early nineteenth century, where settlements were created simply for the purpose of exploiting workers and extracting the wealth produced by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The African City: A History|last=Freund|first=Bill|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This attitude to planning continued beyond colonialism and spread throughout the [[modernist]] movement in the 1920s. During this time, designers and planners were given opportunities to conceive a vision for utopian cities. These designs were a response to the rise of industrialisation in cities, which led to the working class living in dirty and often overcrowded slums. Although the vision and intention of these [[utopian]] cities was to create a society that sought to protect and preserve humanity through the built environment, this top down method of planning assumes that the values and beliefs held by the planner are the same as those that they are planning for. Many of these projects failed to achieve expectations and were instead discarded or set aside.

Directly following modernism and continuing this trend of a top down approach was the post world war period of reconstruction and planning. With the war over, there was a need for social and economic reconstruction. Governments were given the task to rebuild cities that had been afflicted by the damage left behind from the war. With the rise of the [[technocratic]] experts, they were consulted to design and plan the city in a scientific, logical and rigorous manner which would produce the best outcome for all stakeholders. This disconnected and elitist approach led to the constant failure of the government to meet the needs of its citizens and was met with backlash, giving rise to alternative planning practices.

== Advocacy Planning ==
Davidoff understood that not all stakeholders are equally represented and involved in the planning process. Leaving the groups of lower socioeconomic status vulnerable to the interests of larger public institutions or private companies. Without sufficient protection and care, the concerns and opinions of these individuals were left unheard and unaccounted for when developing plans. Davidoff realised that it was necessary to implement a “humanistic, grassroots and pluralistic”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; system where planners would advocate for the interests of the oppressed and powerless.

In practice advocacy planners use their experience and knowledge within the field of planning to represent the ideas and needs of their clients. These clients are often groups of lower socioeconomic standing who are unable to access the resources, tools or skills to represent themselves. Advocate planners work with these disadvantaged groups to develop plans which incorporate and preserve their social and economic needs.

The plans are then produced in front of a planning commission where they consider the various pros and cons of each plan produced by other advocate planners. This is what Davidoff claimed would lead to a rigorous and systematic legal methodology of “fair notice and hearings, production of supporting evidence, cross-examination and reasoned decision”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Allowing the planning commission to arrive at “a just decision”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Davidoff believed that upholding the political ideology of democracy through the planning process led to three major improvements within his discipline.

First is the raising of the public’s awareness. By employing a method of participatory planning and engaging with the wider community, this helps the public to realise that planning is not simply a process engaged by well educated men of science, rather that the best planners are the people themselves. It is the realisation that the public has the freedom and choice to develop plans according to their needs.

Secondly, this ideal structure for advocacy planning allows planners to compete among themselves while representing the views of their clients. Healthy amounts of competition should in fact raise the standard and quality of planning practices and outcomes. Davidoff acknowledges that “conflict keeps people honest”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Finally, rather than critiquing the planners and institutions that support them, those that are critical are given the opportunity to instead provide input and feedback on the plans with which they disagree. Creating an environment that encourages positive attitudes towards constructive participation.

However, simply providing a platform for expression is not always sufficient, as participatory and democratic planning requires a certain level of critical consciousness from the individual participating. Otherwise the participant may struggle to identify problems without being aware of the larger social and economic forces that influences their choices. The role of the advocate then, must be not only to provide assistance in developing an appropriate plan for the committee to judge, but must also be to encourage the people to be “free, informed, participating to the fullest degree, working together cooperatively, possessed of an understanding of their problems and those of their fellow men”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reveille for Radicals|last=Alinsky|first=Saul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aerobic granular reactor''' is a type of waste treatment facility.

==Overview==
[[Sewage treatment]] plants (STP) based on [[activated sludge]] often cover large surface areas, necessitated mainly by the large [[settling tank]]s. To build compact STP’s, [[biomass]] can be grown as [[biofilms]] on a carrier material, or as fast settling [[Aerobic granulation|aerobic granular sludge]] without a carrier.  Recent research showed the advantages of a discontinuously fed system, in which it is possible to grow stable granulated sludge under aerobic conditions.

Simultaneous [[Chemical oxygen demand]], and [[Nitrogen]] and [[Phosphorus]] removal, can be easily integrated in a discontinuous fed system.  Because of the high settling capacity of the granules, the use of a traditional settler is unnecessary.  Therefore the installation can be built very compact, needing only 20% of the surface area of conventional activated sludge systems.

'''Anahit Tsitsikian''' ({{lang-hy|Անահիտ Ցիցիկյան}}; born [[Leningrad]], August 26, 1926; death [[Yerevan]], May 2, 1999) was the first renowned [[Armenians|Armenian]] female [[violin]]ist. She toured around the world through more than 100 cities during the [[Armenian SSR|Soviet]] times; she taught at the [[Yerevan State Musical Conservatory|State Conservatory]] for approximately 40 years and wrote more than 300 articles and scenarios for television and radio programs. She was also a scholar who established a new branch of Armenian musicology, history of performing art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armeniaonline.ru/product.php/988 |title=Армянское смычковое искусство Анаит Цицикян |publisher=Armeniaonline.ru |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated the last twenty years of her life to research in the field of [[music history|ancient music history]], becoming the founder of a new branch of Armenian musical archaeology.

Tsitsikian was Merited Artist of Armenia or [[People's Artist of Armenian SSR]] (1967), [[PhD]] of [[Musicology|Musical Science]] (1970) and Professor of Music (1982).

==Bio==
Anahit Tsitsikian was born in Leningrad (currently St. Petersburg), Russia, into a family of an engineer and a doctor. She began playing the violin at the age of six. Her teachers were musician [[Grigory Ginzburg]] and later on professor [[Lev Moiseyevich Zeitlin]] ([[:ru:Цейтлин, Лев Моисеевич|ru]]). At the beginning of World War II, at the age of fifteen, she left Leningrad for Armenia. Her birthplace left an unforgettable mark on her development as a person and musician. She remained an individual with fine tastes and a careful and sincere approach and attitude toward historical legacy; and she was gentle and respectful toward her friends, colleagues and students.{{Tone inline|date=March 2011}}

She studied at the [[Yerevan State Conservatory]] from 1946–1950 as a student of Professor [[Karp Dombayev]]. She was granted the Stalin Scholarship. In 1954 she completed her graduate course at the [[Moscow State Conservatory]] (adviser - Professor [[Konstantin Mostras]]).

She began performing professionally at elementary school age; her performances included many solo performances as well as with symphonic orchestras. Beginning in 1961 she was the principal soloist at the Armenian Philharmonic Hall. Tsitsikian performed throughout the Republics of the former Soviet Union and in 27 countries around the world. As a violinist she produced four vinyl discs under the [[Melodiya]] label. The music of [[modern Armenian composers]] held a special place in Ms. Tsitsikian’s repertoire. She was often the co-author, editor and first interpreter of their original pieces.

She taught at the Yerevan State Conservatory starting in 1950, and she established three new courses in its curriculum: history and theory of bowed instruments, history of Armenian performing arts, and course of music teaching practice.

Tsitsikian started her scholarly research while she was still a student of the Conservatory. Her research focused on bowing art, [[organology]] and [[musical archaeology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naasr.org/index.php/events-site-map-menu-105/past-events-site-map-menu-147/1990-1999-site-map-menu-152 |title=1990-1999 |publisher=Naasr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127065806/http://www.naasr.org/index.php/events-site-map-menu-105/past-events-site-map-menu-147/1990-1999-site-map-menu-152 |archivedate=2015-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which she was the founder in Armenia. She spoke five languages, and lectured in English, French, and German. She participated in numerous international scientific conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/AnahitFoundation#grid/user/E8784E133EA66900 |title=AnahitFoundation |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she also published he articles in Armenia and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kultura-portal.ru/tree_new/cultpaper/article.jsp?number=580&amp;crubric_id=1000178&amp;rubric_id=207&amp;pub_id=650932 |title=п я┐п╩я▄я┌я┐я─п╟ п÷п╬я─я┌п╟п╩: "п░я─п╪я▐п╫я│п╨п╬п╣ я│п╪я▀я┤п╨п╬п╡п╬п╣ п╦я│п╨я┐я│я│я┌п╡п╬" п░п╫п╟п╦я┌ п╕п╦я├п╦п╨я▐п╫ |publisher=Kultura-portal.ru |date=2001-02-22 |accessdate=2015-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716155353/http://www.kultura-portal.ru/tree_new/cultpaper/article.jsp?number=580&amp;crubric_id=1000178&amp;rubric_id=207&amp;pub_id=650932 |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her artistic life, Tsitsikian performed in more than a thousand recitals, recorded sixty pieces of archived music, and authored more than 300 articles and scripts for many radio and television programs. She was a member of many local and international organizations such as: [[Composer’s Union of Armenia]] or [[Union of Soviet Composers]], [[Armenian Theater Union]], [[Journalists Union]], [[Women’s Committee of the USSR]], [[AOKS]] (cultural liaison committee of Armenia with foreign countries), "History of World Culture" Committee in the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, [[The World Scientific Association of Historical Archaeology]], etc.

Anahit Tsitsikian died on May 2, 1999. The Anahit Cultural Foundation was established in the same year to continue her work and fulfill her dreams. The mission of the foundation is to facilitate the promotion of Armenian music by supporting musicians in their professional education and work, setting up and implementing cultural programs and events, and stimulating the integration of Armenian music within international music.

==Honours and awards==
Anahit Tsitsikian was a [[Merited Artist of Armenia]] (1967), [[PhD of Musical Science]] (1970), and [[Professor of Music]] (1982). In 2004 music school was named after her in Yerevan, Armenia.

[[Image:Covent Garden 1762.gif|thumb|right|240px|A theatrical riot at Covent Garden's Royal Theatre in 1762 over a rumored increase in ticket prices. Although drama declined in the Augustan era, it was still popular entertainment.]]

'''''Augustan drama''''' can refer to the [[drama]]s of [[Ancient Rome]] during the reign of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]], but it most commonly refers to the [[English drama|plays of Great Britain]] in the early 18th century, a subset of 18th-century [[Augustan literature]]. King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] referred to himself as "Augustus," and the poets of the era took this reference as apropos, as the [[Latin literature|literature of Rome]] during Augustus moved from historical and didactic poetry to the poetry of highly finished and sophisticated [[Epic poetry|epic]]s and [[satire]].

In [[poetry]], the early 18th century was an age of [[satire]] and public verse, and in prose, it was an age of the developing [[novel]]. In drama, by contrast, it was an age in transition between the highly witty and sexually playful [[Restoration comedy]], the pathetic [[she-tragedy]] of the turn of the 18th century, and any later plots of middle-class anxiety. The Augustan stage retreated from the Restoration's focus on cuckoldry, marriage for fortune, and a life of leisure. Instead, Augustan drama reflected questions the mercantile class had about itself and what it meant to be [[gentry]]: what it meant to be a good merchant, how to achieve wealth with morality, and the proper role of those who serve.

Augustan drama has a reputation as an era of decline. One reason for this is that there were few dominant figures of the Augustan stage. Instead of a single genius, a number of playwrights worked steadily to find subject matter that would appeal to a new audience. In addition to this, playhouses began to dispense with playwrights altogether or to hire playwrights to match assigned subjects, and this made the producer the master of the script. When the public did tire of anonymously authored, low-content plays and a new generation of [[wit]]s made the stage political and aggressive again, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] ministry stepped in and began official [[censorship]] that put an end to daring and innovative content. This conspired with the public's taste for [[special effects]] to reduce theatrical output and promote the novel.

==The middle-class tragedy==
{{further|Bourgeois tragedy}}
As for prose and poetry, there is no clear beginning to the "Augustan era" in drama, but the end is clearly marked. Augustan-era drama ended definitively in 1737 with the [[Licensing Act 1737|Licensing Act]]. Prior to 1737, the English stage was changing rapidly from [[Restoration comedy]] and [[Restoration drama]] and their noble subjects to the quickly developing [[melodrama]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:R-Steele.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Richard Steele]], collaborator of [[Joseph Addison]]'s and author of ''The Conscious Lovers'']] --&gt;
[[George Lillo]] and [[Richard Steele]] wrote the trend-setting plays of the early Augustan period. Lillo's plays consciously turned from heroes and kings toward shopkeepers and apprentices. They emphasized drama on a household scale rather than a national scale, and the ''[[hamartia]]'' and ''[[agon]]'' in his tragedies are the common flaws of yielding to temptation and the commission of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sin]]. The plots are resolved with Christian forgiveness and [[repentance]]. Steele's ''The Conscious Lovers'' (1722) hinges upon his young hero avoiding fighting a [[duel]]. These plays set up a new set of values for the stage. Instead of amusing or inspiring the audience, they sought to instruct the audience and ennoble it. Further, the plays were popular precisely because they seemed to reflect the audience's own lives and concerns.

[[Joseph Addison]] also wrote a play entitled ''Cato'' in 1713, but it did not inspire followers. ''Cato'' concerned the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Cato the Younger|statesman]] who opposed [[Julius Caesar]]. The year of its première is important for understanding why the play is unique, for [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was seriously ill at the time, and both the [[Tory]] ministry of the day and the Whig opposition (already led by [[Robert Walpole]]) were concerned about the succession. Both groups were in contact with Anne's exiled brother [[James Francis Edward Stuart]]. Londoners sensed this anxiety, for Anne had no surviving children; all of the closest successors in the [[House of Stuart|Stuart family]] were [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Therefore, the figure of Cato was a transparent symbol of Roman integrity. The Whigs saw in him a Whig refusal to accept an [[Divine Right of Kings|absolute monarch]] from the House of Stuart, while the Tories saw in him a resistance to rule by a triumphant general ([[John Churchill]], the Duke of Marlborough, whose wife Sarah was rumored to control Anne). Further, Cato's claim that Caesar profited by illegal war echoed the Tory accusations against Marlborough. Both sides cheered the play, even though Addison was himself clearly Whig and had meant the play as something near [[propaganda]]. [[John Home]]'s play ''[[Douglas (play)|Douglas]]'' (1756) would have a similar fate to ''Cato'' in the next generation after the [[Licensing Act]].

==The problem of "Spectacle"==
[[Image:Rich-Covent-Garden.jpg|thumb|left|260px|"Rich's Glory": [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] takes control of Covent Garden Theatre in 1732. The first play he would stage was ''[[The Way of the World]]''.]]
As during the Restoration, economic reality drove the stage during the Augustan period. Under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] court patronage meant economic success, and therefore the Restoration stage featured plays that would suit the monarch and/or court. The drama that celebrated kings and told the history of Britain's monarchs was fit fare for the crown and courtiers. Charles II was a philanderer, and so Restoration comedy featured a highly sexualized set of plays.  However, after the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], the court and crown stopped taking a great interest in the playhouse. Theaters had to get their money from the audience of city dwellers, therefore, and consequently plays that reflected city anxieties and celebrated the lives of citizens were the ones to draw crowds. The aristocratic material from the Restoration continued to be mounted, and adaptations of [[Tudor period|Tudor]] plays were made and ran, but the ''new'' plays that were authored and staged were the domestic- and middle-class dramas. The other dramatic innovation was "[[spectacle]]": plays that had little or no text, but which emphasized novel special effects.

===Pantomime and tableau spectacle===
The public attended when they saw their lives represented on the stage, but also attended when there was a sight that would impress them.  If costumes were lavish, the sets impressive or the actresses alluring, audiences would attend.  The [[Restoration spectacular]] had seen the development of English opera and [[oratorio]] and a war between competing theaters to produce the most expensive and eye-popping plays.  However, these [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] productions could mean financial ruin as much as security, and neither of the two main playhouses could continue the [[brinksmanship]] for long.  After these battles between the playhouses, and these were multiple,&lt;ref&gt;Shesgreen 27&lt;/ref&gt; the theaters calculatingly sought the highest appeal with the lowest cost.  If the cost of ''rehearsal'' time, in particular, could be shortened, the theater's investment would be reduced.  Rehearsal time cost a playhouse its cast, its property masters, and its stages, and a long rehearsal meant fewer plays put on.  Additionally, dramatists received the money from each third night of box office, and this could be dangerous to a house that needed every farthing to defray costs.  Star dramatists could negotiate for more than one benefit night and might have terms for benefits on revival, while new, unknown, or dependent authors could be managed.  The solution for the theatrical producers was to cut the costs of plays and actors while increasing the outright spectacle, and there were quite a few plays that were not literary at all that were staged more often than the literary plays.
[[File:Hogarth-rehearsal (2).png|thumb|right|200px|A print by [[William Hogarth]] entitled ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' from 1724 depicting the managers of [[Drury Lane]] ([[Robert Wilks]], [[Colley Cibber]], and [[Barton Booth]]) rehearsing a play consisting of nothing but special effects, while they used the scripts for ''The Way of the World'', ''inter al.'', for toilet paper.  This battle of effects was a common subject of satire for the literary wits, including [[Alexander Pope|Pope]].]]

[[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] and [[Colley Cibber]] dueled over special theatrical effects.  They put on plays that were actually just spectacles, where the text of the play was almost an afterthought.  Dragons, whirlwinds, thunder, ocean waves, and even actual elephants were on stage.  Battles, explosions, and horses were put on the boards (Cibber).  Rich specialized in [[pantomime]] and was famous as the character "Lun" in [[harlequin]] presentations.  The playwrights of these works were hired men, not dramatists, and so they did not receive the traditional third-night author's profits.  A pantomime, after all, required very little in the way of a playwright and much more in the way of a director, and with John Rich and Colley Cibber both acting as star players and directors, such on-demand spectacles did not necessitate a poet.  Further, spectacles could be written quickly to answer to the public's whims or the rival theater's triumphs, rarely risked offensive political statements, and did not require paying benefits to a playwright.  In other words, they gave the managers more profit.  The plays put on in this manner are not generally preserved or studied, but their near monopoly on the theaters, particularly in the 1720s, infuriated established literary authors.  Alexander Pope was only one of the poets to attack "spectacle" (in the 1727 ''[[Dunciad|Dunciad A]]'' and, with more vigor, the ''Dunciad B'').  The criticism was so widespread that Colley Cibber himself made excuses for his part in the special-effects war, claiming that he had no choice but to comply with market pressures.

===The "chromatic tortures" and divas of opera===
If vacant, subliterary spectacles were not enough of a threat to dramatists, [[opera]], which had crossed over to England in the [[Restoration drama|Restoration]], experienced an enormous surge in popularity with [[Italian opera|Italian]] [[grand opera]] in England in the 1710s and 1720s.  In ''[[The Spectator]]'', both in number 18 and the 3 April 1711 number, and many places elsewhere, [[Joseph Addison]] fretted that foreign opera would drive English drama from the stage altogether. These early fears followed the sudden rage for the Italian singers and operas that took over London in 1711 with the arrival of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]].  Inasmuch as opera combined singing with acting, it was a mixed genre, and its violation of [[neo-classicism|neoclassical]] strictures had made it a controversial form from the start.  Addison, damning opera's heterogeny, wrote, "Our Countrymen could not forbear laughing when they heard a Lover chanting out a Billet-doux, and even the Superscription of a Letter set to a Tune."&lt;ref&gt;Addison, Joseph ; Steele, Richard. "The Spectator", 1853. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of opera not only took up theatrical rehearsal time and space, it also took away dramatic subject matter.  Straight playwrights were at a loss.  As John Gay lamented (see below), no one could use music in a play unless it was as an opera, and Englishmen were nearly forbidden from that.  To add insult to injury, the casts and celebrated stars were foreigners and, as with [[Farinelli]] and [[Senesino]] (the latter of whom was paid two thousand pounds for a single season in 1721), [[castrati]].  Castrati were symbols, to the English, of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  The satirists saw in opera the ''non plus ultra'' of invidiousness.  High melodies would cover the singers' expressions of grief or joy, conflating all emotion and sense under a tune that might be entirely unrelated.  [[Alexander Pope]] blasted this shattering of "decorum" and "sense" in ''Dunciad B'' and suggested that its real purpose was to awaken the Roman Catholic Church's power ("Wake the dull Church") while it put a stop to the political and satirical stage and made all Londoners fall into the sleep of un-Enlightenment:

:::Joy to Chaos! let Division reign:
:::Chromatic tortures soon shall drive them [the muses] hence,
:::Break all their nerves, and fritter all their sense:
:::One Trill shall harmonize joy, grief, and rage,
:::Wake the dull Church, and lull the ranting Stage;
:::To the same notes thy sons shall hum, or snore,
:::And all thy yawning daughters cry, ''encore.'' (IV 55–60)

[[Image:Dukes-theater-1671.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An 1875 [[postcard]] from the [[Victoria and Albert Hall]] showing the Duke's Company theatre in [[Dorset Gardens]] (the so-called "machine house") in operation from 1671 to 1709, which began as a playhouse and gradually became a house for [[spectacle]].]]
Furthermore, grand opera had a high degree of spectacle in it.  In the 17th century, when opera first came to England, it prompted enormously complex theatrical stagings to present illusions of [[ghost]]s, mythological figures, and epic battles.  When Handel's arrival in England spurred a new vogue for English opera, it also caused a new vogue for imported opera, no matter the content, so long as it would create an enormous visual impact.  Although some of the "Tory Wits" like Pope and [[John Gay]] wrote opera [[libretto]]s (the two combining for ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' with Handel), opera was a spectacular form of theater that left too little room for dramatic acting for most of the playwrights.  Pope argued in ''The Dunciad'' that Handel's operas were "masculine" in comparison to Italian and French opera.  While this is a musical commentary, it is also a commentary on the amount of decoration and frippery put on the stage, on the way that Handel's operas concentrated on their stories and music rather than their theatrical effects.

It was not merely the fact that such operas drove out original drama, but also that the antics and vogue for the singers took away all else, seemingly, that infuriated English authors.  The singers (particularly the [[soprano]]s) introduced London to the concept of the [[prima donna]], in both senses of the term.  In 1727, two Italian sopranos, [[Francesca Cuzzoni]] and [[Faustina Bordoni]], had such a rivalry and hatred of each other (the latter had been paid more than the former) that the audiences were encouraged to support their favorite singer by hissing her rival, and during a performance of ''Astyanax'' in 1727, the two women actually began to fight on stage (Loughrey 13).  John Gay wrote to [[Jonathan Swift]] on 3 February 1723:
 
::There's nobody allow'd to say I sing but an Eunuch or an Italian Woman. Every body is grown now as great a judge of Musick as they were in your time of Poetry &amp; folks that could not distinguish one tune from another now daily dispute over different Styles of Handel, [[Bononcini]], and [[Aitillio]].  People have now forgot [[Homer]], and [[Virgil]] &amp; [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]].

These operas were spectaculars in every sense.  The personalities of the stars were before the stage, the stars were before the music, and the music before the words.  Additionally, opera brought with it new stage machines and effects.  Even Handel, whom Pope values as restrained and sober, had his heroine brought on stage by "two huge Dragons out of whose mouths issue Fire and Smoke" in ''Rinaldo'' in 1711.

The "problem" of spectacle continued in the 1720s and 1730s.  In 1734, [[Henry Fielding]] has his tragedian, [[Fustian]], describe the horror of a pantomime show:

::intimating that after the audience had been tired with the dull works of Shakespeare, Jonson, [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh]], and others, they are to be entertained with one of these pantomimes, of which the master of the playhouse, two or three painters, and half a score dancing-masters are the compilers.  ...I have often wondered how it was possible for any creature of human understanding, after having been diverted for three hours with the production of a great genius, to sit for three more and see a set of people running about the stage after one another, without speaking one syllable, and playing several juggling tricks, which are done at Fawks's after a much better manner; and for this, sir, the town does not only pay additional prices, but loses several fine parts of its best authors, which are cut out to make room for the said farces.  (''[[Pasquin]]'', V i.)

Fustian complains as well that authors are denied stagings because of these entertainments, and, as well, that playhouse managers would steal plays from their authors.  As Fustian says earlier, a playwright could spend four months trying to get a manager's attention and then "he tells you it won't do, and returns it to you again, reserving the subject, and perhaps the name, which he brings out in his next pantomime" (''Pasquin'' IV i.).

==The reemergence of satirical drama, and the Licensing Act==
Toward the end of the 1720s, the behavior of opera stars, the absurdity of spectacle productions, and an escalation of political warfare between the two parties led to a reclamation of the stage by political dramatists.  During the later years of King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], who favored Robert Walpole, there was a scramble for the favor of the future King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], his wife, and his mistress, and this combined with a shattering of public confidence in the government after the [[South Sea Bubble]] and revelations of corruption in the trial of [[Jonathan Wild]], [[Charles Hitchen]], the Earl of Macclesfield, and others.

===John Gay and comic inversion===
John Gay parodied the opera with his satirical ''[[The Beggar's Opera|Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728) and with it delivered a [[satire]] of [[Robert Walpole]]'s actions during the [[South Sea Bubble]].  Superficially, the play is about a man named Macheath who runs a gang for a criminal fence named Peachum, whose daughter, Polly Peachum, is in love with him, and who escapes prison over and over again because the daughter of the jailor, Lucy Lockitt, is also in love with him.  Peachum wishes to see Macheath hanged because Polly has married Macheath, unlike Lucy Lockitt, who is merely pregnant by him (and neither woman is concerned with Macheath's sexual activity, but only with whom he marries, for marriage means access to his estate when he is eventually hanged).  Peachum fears that Macheath will turn him in to the law, and he also feels that marriage is a betrayal of good breeding, that prostitution is the genteel thing.  Gay announced his intention to create the "[[ballad opera]]" with the play.  The music for the songs came from tunes already popular, and ten of the tunes were from the satirist [[Tom D'Urfey]], whose ''Pills to Purge Melancholy'' was a collection of coarse, bawdy, and amusing songs on various topics.  The [[ballad]] was associated with [[folk song]]s and folk poetry, and so Gay's choice of using ballads (although ballads written by a well-known author) for his music was itself an attempt to deflate the seeming pomposity and elitism of the opera.

For most of the audience, the central entertainment of the opera was the [[love triangle]] between Macheath, Polly, and Lucy, but satirically, the centre of the opera was the Peachum/Macheath story.  This story was an obvious parallel with the case of [[Jonathan Wild]] (Peachum) and [[Jack Sheppard]] (Macheath).  However, it was also the tale of Robert Walpole (Peachum) and the South Sea directors (Macheath).  Robert Walpole was one of the most divisive ministers in British history, and his control of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] ran for over two decades.  Until [[Margaret Thatcher]], no other [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] (the office would not exist in name until later) had as adversarial a relationship with authors, and he had ruthlessly consolidated power and jealously guarded it against all threats.  During the South Sea Bubble, Walpole was accused of being "the screen," protecting the moneyed directors of the corporation from prosecution and of cashing in his own shares for full value before the collapse of the stock.  Further, during the life and career of the actual Jonathan Wild, Walpole's Whig ministry was suspected of protecting and supporting the master "thief-taker."

Additionally, Gay's opera was a strict [[parody]] and inversion of the opera.  Gay has his thieves and prostitutes speak like upper-class gentlemen and ladies.  Implicitly, he suggests that the nobles are no better than the thieves even as he suggests that thieves have their own mock-monarchies, senates, and religion.  He has his Beggar (the putative author of the opera) explain that the two female leads have equal parts and therefore should not fight (a joke that witnesses of the diva battle would understand).  The supernaturally lofty settings of opera are, in Gay's hands, the warrens of [[St Giles]] parish.  For palace settings, he has prisons.  For throne rooms, he has taverns.  For kings, he has criminal fences.  For [[knight errant|knights errant]]/[[pastoral poetry|shepherd lovers]], he has a highwayman.  For goddesses drawn about on gilded chariots, he has a ruined maid, a chorus of prostitutes, and Polly (who is perversely chaste).  The [[aria]]s also use the same metaphors that were common in opera, and Gay's songs are themselves parodies of the predictable lyrics in opera.  In each case, high and low trade places and Gay's suggestion of an essential likeness of the ministry with its most famous thief extended also to a suggestion that high opera is essentially like tavern songs and rounds.  The play was a hit, running for an unheard-of eighty performances.  Subsequently, the songs, as well as the play, were printed up and sold.

Robert Walpole, who had some personal animosity to John Gay, attended the play and enjoyed it.  However, upon learning from a friend that he was one of the targets of the satire, he tried to have the play stopped.  When Gay wrote a follow-up called ''Polly,'' Walpole had the play suppressed before performance.  The suppression was without precedent, although it was soon to be used ''as'' a precedent, for there had been no actual attack on the ministry.  The anti-ministerial (Tory) sentiment was entirely derived from interpretation.

Playwrights were therefore in straits.  On the one hand, when the playhouses were not running operas imported wholesale from the continent, they were dispensing with dramatists by turning out hack-written pantomimes.  On the other hand, when a satirical play appeared from a literary source, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] ministry suppressed it even though it came from the most popular dramatist of the day (i.e., John Gay).  Furthermore, the grounds of the suppression were all implicit comparisons, and nothing explicit.  Gay had not ''said'' that Walpole was a crook as bad as Wild, although he had suggested it.

===The new Tory wits, escalating satire, and the creation of the Licensing Act===
[[File:Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Magnificent History of Tom Thumb the Great (frontispiece).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frontispiece to Fielding's ''Tom Thumb'', a play satirizing plays (and [[Robert Walpole]])]]
Robert Walpole's personal involvement in censoring entertainments critical of him only fanned the flames of the antagonism between himself and the stage.  [[Henry Fielding]], among others, was not afraid to provoke the ministry, and anti-Walpolean plays spiked after the suppression of ''Polly''.  Fielding's ''[[Tom Thumb]]'' (1730) was a satire on all of the tragedies written before him, with quotations from all the worst plays patched together for absurdity, and the plot concerned the eponymous tiny man attempting to run the kingdom and insinuate himself into the royal ranks.  It was, in other words, an attack on Robert Walpole and the way that he was referred to as "the Great Man" and his supposed control over [[Caroline of Ansbach]].  As with Gay's ''Beggar's Opera,'' the miniature general speaks constantly in elevated tones, making himself a great hero, and all of the normal-sized ladies fight each other to be his lover.  The contrast between reality, delusion, and self-delusion was a form of [[bathos]] that made the audience think of other grand-speaking and grandly spoken of people.  If a ridiculously tiny figure could be acclaimed a hero because of his own braggadocio, might other great leaders be similarly small?  Were they titans, or dwarves like Tom Thumb?  Fielding announced, essentially, that the emperor had no clothes, the [[prime minister]] no greatness.  Walpole responded by suppressing the performance of the play.  Fielding was a [[justice of the peace]] by profession, and so he knew that the ministry could only control the stage and not book publication.  Therefore, he tapped into the market for printed plays, and his revision of the play was solely in book form.  It was written by "Scribblerus Secundus," its title page announced (a reference to the [[Scriblerus Club]] of [[Jonathan Swift]], Gay, Pope, [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], [[John Arbuthnot]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St. John]]), and it was the ''Tragedy of Tragedies,'' which did for drama what Pope's ''Peri Bathos: or The Art of Sinking in Poetry'' had done for verse.  Fielding placed a critical apparatus on the play, showing the sources of all the [[parody|parodies]], and thereby made it seem as if his target had all along been bad tragedy and not the prime minister.  (Fielding's later novel, ''[[Jonathan Wild]]'', makes it clear that such was not the case, for it used exactly the same satirical device, "the Great Man," to lambaste the same target, Robert Walpole.)

Henry Fielding was not done with ministry satire.  His ''Covent-Garden Tragedy'' of 1732 was set in a [[brothel]] amongst the prostitutes.  Although the play was only acted once, it, like ''Tom Thumb,'' sold when printed.  Its attacks on ''[[poetic license]]'' and the antirealism of domestic tragedians and morally sententious authors was an attack on the values central to the Whig version of personal worth.  Two years later, Fielding was joined by [[Henry Carey (writer)|Henry Carey]] in anti-Walpolean satire.  His ''[[Chrononhotonthologos]]'' takes its cue from ''Tom Thumb'' by outwardly satirizing the emptiness of bombast.  However, it also encoded a very specific and dangerous satire of King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and his statutory wife.  The king and queen never meet in the play, and the subject is the former's wars with personal discomfort and the latter's desire for adultery.  In particular, the Queen herself is implicitly attacked.  However, the play also appears to be a superficial work of fancy and nonsense verse, and it delighted audiences with tongue twisters and parody.  However, Carey worked ''[[The Dragon of Wantley]]'' into a play in 1734.  Fielding and Carey, among others, picked up the cudgels where the Tory Wits had set them down and began to satirize Walpole and [[Parliament]] with increasing ferocity (and scatology).  Although a particular play of unknown authorship entitled ''A Vision of the Golden Rump'' was cited when Parliament passed the Licensing Act of 1737 (the "rump" being [[Parliament]], a rump roast, and human buttocks simultaneously), Carey's ''Dragon of Wantley'' was an unmistakable attack on tax policy and the ever-increasing power of the London government over the countryside.  Notably, Fielding's and Carey's plays made allowances for spectacle.  Indeed, their plays relied upon a [[burlesque]] of spectacle and by spectacle, for the effects of TopsyTurvy armies in ''Chrononhotonthologos'' (stacked atop each other instead of in ranks) and the titular dragon of Wantley, as well as the miniaturizing of Tom Thumb and the lurid scenery of the Covent Garden brothel, were part of the draw and part of the humor for these plays.

The Licensing Act required all plays to go to a censor before staging, and only those plays passed by the censor were allowed to be performed.  Therefore, plays were judged by ''potential'' criticism of the ministry and not just by reaction or performance.  The first play to be banned by the new Act was ''Gustavus Vasa'' by [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]].  The play invoked the [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[Protestant]] king [[Gustav Vasa]] to castigate the purportedly corrupt Parliament of Walpole's administration, although Brooke would claim that he meant only to write a history play.  [[Samuel Johnson]] wrote a Swiftian parodic satire of the licensers, entitled ''A Complete Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage'' (1739).  The satire was, of course, not a vindication at all but rather a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of the position for censorship.  Had the licensers not exercised their authority in a partisan manner, the Act might not have chilled the stage so dramatically, but the public was well aware of the bannings and [[censorship]], and consequently any play that ''did'' pass the licensers was regarded with suspicion by the public.  Therefore, the playhouses had little choice but to present old plays and pantomime and plays that had no conceivable political content.  One consequence was that [[William Shakespeare]]'s reputation grew enormously as his plays saw a quadrupling of performances, and sentimental comedy and melodrama were the only "safe" choices for new drama.  Dramatists themselves had to turn to prose or to less obvious forms of criticism, such as [[puppet]] shows that [[Charlotte Charke]] would invest in.

==Effects of the Licensing Act==
[[Image:Othello-tragedy-18th.gif|thumb|right|200px|Othello "strikes" Desdemona in ''[[Othello]]'' from the 1744 Thomas Hanmer deluxe edition of [[William Shakespeare]].  Hanmer's was one of the "improved" editions that was roundly hissed by textual critics.]]
In comedy, one effect of the Licensing Act was that playwrights began to develop a comedy of sentiment.  This comedy was critically labeled as "high" comedy, in that it was intended to be entertaining rather than actually be funny, and brought about its entertainment by elevating the sentiments of the viewer.  The plots also relied upon characters being in or out of sympathy with each other.  Very late in the 17th century [[Oliver Goldsmith]] attempted to resist the tide of sentimental comedy with ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (1773), and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] would mount several satirical plays after Walpole's death. Both of these playwrights were taking advantage of a loosening of the censorship and popular weariness with "refined" comedy. Goldsmith's play reintroduces the country bumpkin character who outwits the sophisticated would-be rakes who are engaged in a plot to marry well. Sheridan, on the other hand, very consciously turned back to the [[Restoration comedy]]  for his models but carefully toned down the dangers of the sexual plots.

As mentioned above, another effect of the Licensing Act was to send the playhouses to old plays. Since any play written before 1737 could be staged without permission, theaters had a great deal to choose from.  However, they sought out Shakespeare, in particular, as the one author whose name alone could generate an audience as large as those formerly provided by leading poets.  Shakespeare's stature had been rising throughout the 18th century, and [[textual criticism]], particularly of Shakespeare, had resulted in reliable texts (''see [[Shakespeare's reputation]] for details''). Further, many of the expurgated and "improved" versions of Shakespeare were falling from favor.  Actors such as [[David Garrick]] made their entire reputations by playing Shakespeare.  The Licensing Act may be the single greatest factor in the rise of "[[Bardolatry]]."  However, other, less sparkling, plays were also revived, including multiple versions of ''Lady Jane Grey'' and ''The Earl of Essex'' (including one by [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] that had been written before the Act).  Each of these could be used as a tacit commentary on the politics of the contemporary court and as a political gesture. Therefore, when playhouses wished to answer the public's political sentiment, they could quickly mount a performance of ''Cato'' or one of the Lady Jane Greys or, if the mood was otherwise, one of [[Aphra Behn]]'s royalist plays, and some of the Restoration plays such as [[William Wycherly]]'s ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' and [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s ''[[The Way of the World]]'' were always promising comedy.  However, when they needed to fill the house reliably, regardless of political season, and show off their actors, they staged Shakespeare.

[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|400px|[[David Garrick]], a celebrity actor, starring as King [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] in [[Colley Cibber]]'s revision of Shakespeare's play six years after the Licensing Act]]
Finally, authors with strong political or philosophical points to make would no longer turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living. Prior to 1737, plays were ''de rigueur'' for authors who were not journalists. This had to do with the economics of booksellers. A bookseller would purchase a book from an author, whether that book was ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' or ''Collected Sermons,'' and would calculate his chances of making money off of sales. He would pay the author according to the money he expected to make.  (For example, Goldsmith's ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' was famously sold to pay a single rent installment, whereas John Gay had been paid 1,000 pounds for his ''Poems on Various Occasions'', which was more than seven years of salary for his government job). That would be the only money an author would see from the book, and therefore he or she would need to produce a new version, new book, or a serial publication of the next work to have hopes of more income. Prior to 1737, novelists had come from the ranks of satirists (Jonathan Swift) and journalists ([[Daniel Defoe]]), but these novels had in common wide changes of scenery, long plots, and often impossible things (such as talking horses)—all features that made the works unsuitable for the stage. The exception was [[Aphra Behn]], who was a dramatist first and a novelist second. Her ''[[Oroonoko]]'' seems to have been written as a novel simply because there was no time for staging, as it was a political commentary on ongoing events, and she could not have another play on the boards at the time. Her ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'', like ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Moll Flanders]]'', was inappropriate for the stage.  However, after 1737, novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors.

Additionally, prior to 1737 the economic motivations for dramatists were vast. A playwright received the house take of the third night of a play. This could be a very large amount of money, and it would be renewed with each season (depending upon arrangements). Thus, [[John Gay]] grew wealthy with ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''. In 1726, [[Leonard Welsted]]'s indifferent success, ''The Dissembled Woman'', was acted at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]]. It netted him £138 for the author's benefit but only £30 for the printing rights.  After the Licensing Act closed off hopes for serious authors on the stage, the novel was the next logical path. In particular, [[Samuel Richardson|Samuel Richardson's]] ''[[Clarissa]]'' was published in serial form and made the author a substantial amount of money from subscriptions. The novel became a potentially lucrative form of publishing, and booksellers began to pay more for novels as novels began to sell more.  From being a form of exigency, the novel became a form of choice after the stage was shut down by the Licensing Act.  Therefore, the Licensing Act had the unintended effect of increasing rather than decreasing the power of dissenting authors, as it put a stop to anti-Walpolean sentiments and anti-ministry arguments on the stage (which could only reach audience members in London) and sent these messages instead to the novel form, where they would remain in print, pass from hand to hand, and spread throughout the kingdom.

The '''[[conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] of feathers''' can be a real challenge for conservators and requires knowledge of specialized care procedures and potential environmental problems like pests.

== Anatomy ==
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals Contour feather.jpg|thumb|The anatomy of a contour feather]]

=== Basic Overview ===
-Feathers are made of a protein commonly found in the bodies of many animals known as [[keratin]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160539034/conservation-biologist-explains-why-feathers-matter|title=Conservation Biologist Explains Why 'Feathers' Matter|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-Feathers take on a protective function

-91% protein, 8% water, and 1% lipids&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bishopmuseum.org/research/pdfs/cnsv-feathers.pdf|title=Bishop Museum Art Conservation Handout|last=|first=|date=1996|website=|publisher=|access-date=4/10/16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-The most common types of feathers are contour and down&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalalbertamuseum.ca/_includes/docs/research/lifeSciences/ornithology/Hudon1.pdf|title=Considerations in the Conservation of Feathers and Hair, Particularly their Pigments|last=Hudon|first=Jocelyn|date=2005|website=|publisher=|access-date=4/10/16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Although there are many different parts to a feather, all of the parts fall into two subsections of the feather. The two main sections of the feather are the shaft and the vane.

==== Shaft&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Feathers|title=Feathers - Wiki|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The shaft is composed of the calamus and the rachis. The calamus can also be called the quill and is the hollow portion of the shaft that enters the skin follicle. While the rachis is the solid portion of the shaft  where the barbs attach.

==== Vane&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ====
The vane extends to either side of the rachis and is made up of interconnecting barbs. This is considered the most substantial portion of the feather.

== Conservation care ==

=== Cleaning ===
Removing debris and organic matter from feathers is a key step in the conservation process. Here are several of the ways that feathers are typically cleaned by conservators:

==== Vacuuming ====
Using a small vacuum allows conservators to clean off dust and other particulate debris that is not embedded on to the feather. This method cannot be done by conservators when dealing with fragile feathers due to the likelihood of damage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = An Effective Method for Cleaning Feather Bonnets|url=https://www.icom-cc.org/54/document/ethnographic-conservation-newsletter-31-february-2010/?action=Site_Downloads_Downloadfile&amp;id=769.|last=Fonicello|first=Nancy|website=|publisher=&lt;!--|date=January 2010--&gt;|date = February 2010|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Solvents ====
Certain gentle solvents are typically used to "dry clean" feathers. One such solvent, isopropyl alcohol, is usually diluted to make it less caustic to the specimen. Isopropyl alcohol is also a fast drying solution that will not cause the feathers to remain wet for an extended period of time. Gentle soaps and solvents will often also be used on living specimens when approved by a vet or zoologist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Warkworth Museum - Kiwi feather basket.jpg|thumb|191x191px|Feather Basket from the Warkworth Museum]]

=== Storage ===
The proper storage of feathers and other organic material is essential for the survival of the object. Relative humidity in the storage area is always kept in the 50% range and the ambient temperature is controlled at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|last=Buck|first=Rebecca|publisher=The AAM Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0838911228|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative humidity is monitored with a climate control system or managed in a smaller range using silica gel packets that are added to individual storage boxes. Specially made acid free drawers or boxes are an ideal place for items containing feathers. Some of the best materials for storage of organic materials are made from "metal that is sulfur-free and painted using an electrostatic process to prevent off-gassing".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ideally, conservators would put dust covers over the items to prevent dust from building up on the object while in storage.

=== Repairing ===
A living specimen can sometimes lose some of their vital flight feathers and there are ways of repairing them to restore flight to the bird. Feathers from another source are placed in the hollow portion of the quill and securing them with small splints. In the aviary world this process is called imping. A procedure such as this allows a bird to resume flight until the old quill falls out and a new feather takes its place during molting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryfederation.org/gfas/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Imping-Repairing-a-Birds-Damaged-or-Clipped-Wings-Greg-Glendell.pdf|title=Imping-Repairing-a-Birds-Damaged-or-Clipped-Wings-Greg-Glendell|last=Glendell|first=Greg|date=2006|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mounted birds and feathers are repaired with several simple steps. Feathers that are tattered or messy will be moved back into shape with the use of steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.featherfolio.com/how-to-fix-a-tattered-frayed-feather/|title=How to fix a tattered, frayed feather - Featherfolio|website=Featherfolio|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of feathers that are falling out of a mount or broken in two, the pieces are reattached with small amounts of adhesive.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.horniman.ac.uk/collections/conserving-our-taxidermy|title=Conserving our taxidermy - Collections - Horniman Museum and Gardens|last=Gardens|first=The Horniman Museum and|website=www.horniman.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme care is always used to not get the adhesive stuck onto the barbs. A wheat starch paste adhesive is utilized in some cases to reattach feathers to skin or to each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Special Issues ==
In the case of many of the issues contained in this section can be eliminated or reduced through the proper care instructions listed in the previous section.[[File:Dermestid beetle.png|thumb|121x121px|Dermestid Beetle also known as the Carpet Beetle]]

=== Pests&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
Due to the fact that feathers are mainly made of protein, they lend themselves a whole host of insect problems. Insects that like to eat protein based material will often feed on the feather causing serious damage.

==== Pests While Alive ====
While the birds are alive they are susceptible to several different pests including [[Louse|lice]] and [[mite]]s. Special sprays and soaps can kill these pests allowing the birds to regain feather growth and become healthy.

==== Pests In Collections ====
Once the feathers make it into a non-living collection atmosphere it is possible for them to fall victim to insects including the [[Dermestidae|carpet beetle]] and [[Clothes moth|clothing moths]].

=== Dust&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ===
When feathers are stored in a way that allows dust to accumulate on the object the relative humidity around the feather could rise. This rise in humidity and the addition of moisture accelerates the deterioration of the feather.

== Resources ==
There are many different sources both online and in person that can be museum workers use to learn more about feather conservation. The AIC Wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Main_Page|title=AIC WIKI Main Page|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a jumping point into a whole host of conservation topics, including the care of feathers. Many museums and conservation organizations are also providing classes in the conservation of feathers.

'''Crime mapping''' is used by analysts in [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] to map, visualize, and analyze crime incident patterns.  It is a key component of [[crime analysis]] and the [[CompStat]] policing strategy.  Mapping crime, using [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), allows crime analysts to identify [[Crime hotspots|crime hot spots]], along with other trends and patterns.

==Overview==
Using GIS, crime analysts can overlay other datasets such as [[census]] [[demographics]], locations of [[pawnbroker|pawn shops]], schools, etc., to better understand the underlying causes of [[crime]] and help [[police|law enforcement]] administrators to devise strategies to deal with the problem.  GIS is also useful for law enforcement operations, such as allocating police officers and dispatching to [[9-1-1|emergencies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/library/brochures/pdfs/crime-analysis.pdf|title=Crime Analysis: GIS Solutions for Intelligence-Led Policing|last=esri|first=|date=|website=esri.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underlying theories that help explain spatial behavior of criminals include [[environmental criminology]], which was devised in the 1980s by Patricia and Paul Brantingham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental Criminology|year=1981|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=0-88133-539-8|editor-last=Brantingham|editor-first=Paul J.|editor2-last=Brantingham|editor2-first=Patricia L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[routine activity theory]], developed by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson and originally published in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Lawrence E.|last2=Felson|first2=Marcus|title=Social change and crime rate trends: A routine activity approach|journal=American Sociological Review|year=1979|volume=44|issue=4|pages=588–607|doi=10.2307/2094589|publisher=American Sociological Association|jstor=2094589}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice theory]], developed by Ronald V. Clarke and Derek Cornish, originally published in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cornish | first=Derek | last2=Clarke | first2=Ronald V. | title=The Reasoning Criminal | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1986 | isbn=3-540-96272-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, crime mapping and analysis has incorporated spatial data analysis techniques that add [[statistics|statistical]] rigor and address inherent limitations of spatial data, including spatial [[autocorrelation]] and spatial heterogeneity.  Spatial data analysis helps one analyze crime data and better understand why and not just where crime is occurring.

Research into computer-based crime mapping started in 1986, when the [[National Institute of Justice]] (NIJ) funded a project in the [[Chicago Police Department]] to explore crime mapping as an adjunct to [[community policing]]. That project was carried out by the CPD in conjunction with the Chicago Alliance for Neighborhood Safety, the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], and [[Northwestern University]], reported on in the book, ''Mapping Crime in Its Community Setting: Event Geography Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maltz|first=Michael D.|last2=Gordon|first2=Andrew C.|last3=Friedman|first3=Warren|title=Mapping Crime in Its Community Setting: Event Geography Analysis|year=2000|origyear=1990|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0-387-97381-8|url=http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/forr/pdf/crimjust/mappingcrime.pdf|edition=Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of this project prompted NIJ to initiate the Drug Market Analysis Program (with the appropriate acronym D-MAP) in five cities, and the techniques these efforts developed led to the spread of crime mapping throughout the US and elsewhere, including the [[New York City Police Department]]'s [[CompStat]].

==Applications==
Crime analysts use crime mapping and analysis to help law enforcement management (e.g. the police chief) to make better decisions, target resources, and formulate strategies, as well as for tactical analysis (e.g. crime forecasting, [[geographic profiling]]).  [[New York City]] does this through the [[CompStat]] approach, though that way of thinking deals more with the short term.  There are other, related approaches with terms including Information-led policing, [[Intelligence-led policing]], [[Problem-oriented policing]], and [[Community policing]].  In some law enforcement agencies, crime analysts work in civilian positions, while in other agencies, crime analysts are sworn officers.

From a research and [[public policy|policy]] perspective, crime mapping is used to understand patterns of [[prison|incarceration]] and [[recidivism]], help target resources and programs, evaluate [[Crime prevention through environmental design|crime prevention]] or crime reduction programs (e.g. Project Safe Neighborhoods, Weed &amp; Seed and as proposed in ''[[Broken windows theory|Fixing Broken Windows]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelling|first=George|last2=Coles|first2=Catherine|title=Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities|isbn=0-684-83738-2|year=1997|publisher=Simon &amp;amp; Schuster|place=New York|origyear=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and further understanding of causes of crime.

The boom of internet technologies, particularly web-based geographic information system (GIS) technologies, is opening new opportunities for use of crime mapping to support crime prevention. Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leong|first=Kelvin.|last2=Chan|first2=Stephen|title=A content analysis of web-based crime mapping in the world's top 100 highest GDP cities|journal=Crime Prevention and Community Safety|year=2013|volume=15|pages=1–22|doi=10.1057/cpcs.2012.11|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the functions provided in web-based crime mapping are less than in most traditional crime mapping software. In conclusion, existing works of web-based crime mapping focus on supporting community policing rather than analytical functions such as pattern analysis and prediction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6135">{{Expand German|Tanzverbot|date=November 2012}}
'''Dancing bans''' are legal or religious prohibitions against dancing, which have been applied at various times in various jurisdictions around the world. Even more controversial than recreational or artistic dancing have been sexually suggestive forms such as [[lap dancing]], [[topless dancing]], and [[rave]] dancing.

==Legal bans==
''Tanzverbot'' is the German term for "dancing ban". In Germany and Switzerland, dancing on some holidays is banned by most [[German states|state]] or [[Swiss cantons|canton]] governments. These occasions are certain [[Christianity|Christian]] and secular holidays aimed at mourning or contemplation, such as [[Good Friday]], [[All Saints' Day]] (from its association with [[All Souls' Day]] practices) or memorial days like [[Volkstrauertag]]. The German and Swiss dancing bans prohibit public parties, but not dancing in one's private residence.

Until 1999, an ordinance in [[Pound, Virginia]] required that dance hall permits not be granted "to anyone who is not a proper person, nor to a person who is not a person of good moral character". After community opposition to granting him a permit, a lawsuit by William Elam, owner of the Golden Pine restaurant, resulted in the ordinance being struck down as unconstitutionally vague and infringing on free expression protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. A replacement ordinance drafted more narrowly prompted a 2001 lawsuit from Elam, though the restaurant later went out of business after revocation of its alcohol license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/identity/dance_pound.htm|title=Pound, Virginia Bans Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/z/gpine.htm|title=Part 2: ABC revokes Golden Pine restaurant's license to sell alcohol|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1926, the [[New York City Cabaret Law]] has prohibited dancing in all spaces open to the public that sell food and/or drink with the exception of those who obtain a cabaret license. This law was still enforced until it was repealed in 2017. 

Between 1985 and 2002, a [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] law called the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] enacted strict legal requirements for those wishing to have dancing by youth under the age of 21, effectively banning events that would feature young people dancing.

===Historic bans===
From the 1830s to 1950s, [[play party (U.S. traditional)|play parties]] became popular as a means to circumvent restrictions on dancing.

The events of the [[Footloose (1984 film)|1984 film ''Footloose'']] were inspired by a dancing ban in the heavily [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] town of [[Elmore City, Oklahoma]], which lasted until 1980.
==Religious bans==
===Christianity===
Various Christian groups believe that dancing is either inherently sinful or that certain forms of dancing could lead to sinful thoughts or activities, and thus proscribe it either in general or during religious services. These include some adherents of [[Mennonite]], [[Hutterite]], [[Baptist]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]], and [[Holiness movement]] sects. [[Jehovah's Witness]]es disfavor events where there might be sexually suggestive dancing or excessive drinking of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defendingjehovahswitnesses.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-do-jehovahs-witnesses-view-dancing.html|title=How Do Jehovah's Witnesses View Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Church of the Nazarene]] recommends against "All forms of dancing that detract from spiritual growth and break down proper moral inhibitions and reserve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|title=Manual|page=51|year=2005–2009|author=Church of the Nazarene|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302214359/http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian churches determine doctrine locally and may be non-denominational, and these vary on their stances on social dancing.

In contrast, some strains of [[Charismatic Christianity]] practice rituals in which the [[Holy Spirit]] is believed to cause spontaneous dancing, among other behaviors. [[Mormonism]] has embraced social dancing to some degree since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5654 |contribution= Dance |pages= 354-355 |last= Jacobson |first= Phyllis C. |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H.

In Islam, [[Salafists]] and [[Wahhabis]] consider dancing in general to be ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-31/news/33500441_1_music-and-dance-couples-dances-anti-dance|date=2012-08-31|title=Does Islam ban dancing and music?|agency=Slate|author=Brian Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Islamic and [[Orthodox Jewish]] traditions prohibit contact between men and women in public (especially those not married to each other), and thus in these societies men and women either dance separately or not at all.

In contrast, [[Sufism]] encourages dancing, for example [[Sufi whirling]] and dancing to celebrate [[Mela Chiraghan]]. This has resulted in conflict in areas influenced by the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/07/pakistani-festival-dancer_n_183960.html|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2009-05-08|title=Pakistani Festival Dancers Banned By Religious Group|author=Stuart Whatley|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DIPROMISTO''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: ДІПРОМІСТО) is a research and planning institute in the field of spatial and urban planning in Ukraine. It is a state enterprise within the field of governance of the [[Ministry of Regional Development (Ukraine)|Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing of Ukraine]]. It was established on September 12, 1930. Its full name is ''State Enterprise Y.Bilokon Ukrainian State Scientific-Research Institute of Urban Design "DIPROMISTO"''.
&lt;br /&gt;In Russian language sources it is also known as Giprograd ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Гипроград). During Soviet times it was a system of planning institutes consisting of the central institute in Kyiv and a range of affiliates in oblasts' centres of USSR. In due time, most of the affiliates separated from the Dipromisto system into separate institutes. Currently the Institute has three affiliates: Ivano-Frankivsk, Rivne, and Volyn affiliates.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;[http://dipromisto.gov.ua/files/Publications/BookGiprograd1990.pdf Giprograd. Information, page 3 (in Russian, English, and French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dipromisto Team1930.jpg|thumb|300px|Dipromisto's team in 1933 or 1934.|left]]
The Institute “DIPROMISTO” was established on September 12, 1930. According to the Government of Ukrainian SSR Statute, the Institute had been assigned the tasks of urban planning, design residential and community buildings, and scientific work in the field of urban planning.&lt;br /&gt; During the pre-war period, Dipromisto’s team had produced a great amount of projects on regional planning in the most significant industrial regions, planning of cities and villages, design of community facilities, residential and public buildings, allocation of new industrial development, guidance and control on construction, scientific elaboration of key issues in spatial and urban planning, and experimental and standard design.&lt;ref name="Book2"&gt;[http://dipromisto.gov.ua/files/Publications/BookGiprograd1990.pdf Giprograd. Information, page 6 (in Russian, English, and French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; During 1943-44 the key task of the Institute was to identify the loss to urban economies caused by war and define top-priority measures to assist the recovery of the cities of Ukrainian SSR. The huge destruction caused by war events in cities and villages demanded not only wide planning measures, but also new approaches to solving problems in the sphere of urban planning.&lt;br /&gt; In the 1950s, the attention of planners turned to verdurization and improvement of cities and villages, and the formation of their architectural view and landscape. In relation to such tendencies in 1962 a new architectural-planning workshop on resort-recreational objects design was created in the Institute in which both theoretical and practical works on resort design and typification have been made. In 1960-70s a landscape workshop was formed in the Institute in which the works on landscape reconstruction of green plantations and natural landscapes organisation have been designed.
[[File:Dipromisto Bilokon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|'''Yurii Mykolayovych Bilokon''', &lt;br /&gt; Director of the Institute in 1993-2009, &lt;br /&gt; People’s Architect of Ukraine]]Having started in late 1960s the work on schemes of regional planning for 25 Oblasts of Ukrainian SSR lasted until 1989. In 1985 the Institute “DIPROMISTO” started working on Summary Scheme of Regional Planning of Ukrainian SSR.&lt;ref name="Book3"&gt;[http://dipromisto.gov.ua/files/Publications/BookGiprograd1990.pdf Giprograd. Information, page 9 (in Russian, English, and French)]&lt;/ref&gt; In this complex scheme the versatile analyses of territorial resources and the state of environment, settlement systems, social, engineer and transport infrastructure has been given. &lt;br /&gt; With obtaining the state independence by Ukraine the tasks of revaluation of factors of regions and the whole state development, defining new priority axes of development, reorganisation of settlement system in consideration with political and economic changes, providing the integrated intrastate system of spatial and urban development, taking into account a market relations in planning of settlements development had arisen ahead of the experts in the field of spatial and urban planning.&lt;br /&gt; Since the beginning of 1990s an active work on implementation of geographical information technologies into spatial and urban planning is carried out in the Institute. Already in 1991-1993 the experts of the Institute “DIPROMISTO” have elaborated geographical information system for the purposes of urban planning – MISTO. Since 1995 the Base Center on implementation of GIS into spatial and urban planning is functioning in the structure of the Institute. Already in the end of 1995 it became evident that further usage of own software wasn’t enough to solve the tasks arisen before the Center and the whole Institute. Consequently, an active implementation of software products by [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] – the leader in GIS software production – had been started. Such technological re-equipment allowed not only to rise significantly the quality of spatial and urban planning works, but also to come to rethinking of methodology of both spatial and urban planning and of regions and settlements governing development.&lt;br /&gt;The strengthening of the Institute in conditions of independent Ukraine has been realized under the direction of Yurii Mykolaiovych Bilokon, Doctor of Architecture, Professor, People’s Architect of Ukraine. The activity of Yurii Mykolaiovych Bilokon in the Institute has been wide and versatile – as a talented architect, who was highly aware of the problems of both planning and architectural design, he made a lot for improvement and development of the Institute functioning. Yurii Bilokon became one of the initiators of spatial planning of cross-border regions and elaborated methodological basis for these works. Bilokon Y.M. paid a great attention to scientific activity development in the Institute, education of the next generation of experts having been created a scientific-production-educational complex "Arhmistobud"&lt;ref name="АМБ"&gt;[http://www.knuba.edu.ua/ukr/?page_id=554 Information about the scientific-production-educational complex "Arhmistobud" on the web-page of the Department of Urban Planning of Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; on the base of the Institute in collaboration with the Department of Urban Planning of [[Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture]], implementation of the latest information technologies into the productive activity.&lt;br /&gt;In 2009 in gratitude for 16 years of the talented leadership and in memory of the passionate role of Yurii Bilokon’s personality in the development of the Institute, the staff has initiated to name the Institute “DIPROMISTO” after Y.M.Bilokon which was adopted by the Order of the Ministry of Regional Development of Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Name"&gt;[http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/FIN60585.html The Order of the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing of Ukraine from October, 26, 2010 No. 415 “About Renaming of  the State enterprise Ukrainian State Scientific-Research Institute of Urban Design “Dipromisto”]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dublin Core Schema''' is a small set of [[Controlled vocabulary|vocabulary terms]] that can be used to describe digital resources (video, images, web pages, etc.), as well as physical resources such as books or CDs, and objects like artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/ |title=DCMI Type Vocabulary |website=dublincore.org |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full set of Dublin Core [[metadata]] terms can be found on the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/ |title=DCMI Metadata Terms |website=dublincore.org |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original set of 15 classic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dublincore.org/specifications/ |title=DCMI Specifications |website=dublincore.org |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; metadata terms, known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES),&lt;ref name="DCMES"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ |title=Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 |website=dublincore.org |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is endorsed in the following standards documents:

Dublin Core metadata may be used for multiple purposes, from simple resource description to combining metadata vocabularies of different [[Metadata#Standards|metadata standards]], to providing interoperability for metadata vocabularies in the [[linked data]] cloud and [[Semantic Web]] implementations.

==Background==
"Dublin" refers to [[Dublin, Ohio]], USA where the schema originated during the 1995 invitational OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincore.org/news/1995/1995-03-01_the-oclcncsa-metadata-workshop-the-essential-elements-of-network-object-description/|title=DCMI: The OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop: The Essential Elements of Network Object Description|author=|date=|website=www.dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by the [[OCLC]] (Online Computer Library Center), a library consortium based in Dublin, and the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA). "Core" refers to the metadata terms as "broad and generic being usable for describing a wide range of resources".&lt;ref name="DCMES"/&gt; The semantics of Dublin Core were established and are maintained by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from [[librarianship]], [[computer science]], [[text encoding]], [[museum]]s, and other related fields of scholarship and practice.

Starting in 2000, the Dublin Core community focused on "[[application profile]]s" &amp;ndash; the idea that metadata records would use Dublin Core together with other specialized vocabularies to meet particular implementation requirements. During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium's work on a generic [[data model]] for metadata, the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF, more recently in the context of the [[linked data]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DCMI Metadata Basics|publisher=dublincore.org/metadata-basics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dublin Core Metadata Initiative''' (DCMI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/ |title=DCMI Home: Dublin Core® Metadata Initiative (DCMI) |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an open forum for the development of interoperable online [[metadata standards]] for a broad range of purposes and of business models. DCMI's activities include consensus-driven working groups, global conferences and workshops, standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices. In 2008, DCMI separated from OCLC and incorporated as an independent entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=OCLC Research and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative | url=http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/past/orprojects/dublincore/default.htm | accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, any and all changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy (DCMI-NAMESPACE). This policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ |title=Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of the standard==
The Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified. '''Simple Dublin Core''' comprised 15 elements; '''Qualified Dublin Core''' included three additional elements (Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers) that could refine the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource discovery.

Since 2012, the two have been incorporated into the '''DCMI Metadata Terms''' as a single set of terms using the [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] data model.&lt;ref name="dublincore1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/ |title=DCMI Metadata Terms |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full set of elements is found under the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms/. Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges, which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/|title=DCMI: Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1: Reference Description|author=|date=|website=dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dublin Core Metadata Element Set===
The original '''DCMES''' Version 1.1 consists of 15 metadata elements:&lt;ref name="DCMES"/&gt;
# Title
# Creator
# Subject
# Description
# Publisher

# Date
# Type
# Format
# Identifier
# Source
# Language
# Relation
# Coverage
# Rights

Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has established standard ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became a NISO standards, Z39.85, and IETF RFC 5013 in 2007.  ISO 15836 standard in 2009 and is used as a base-level data element set for the description of learning resources in the [[ISO/IEC 19788]]-2 Metadata for learning resources (MLR) &amp;ndash; Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC36|ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36]].

Full information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in the Dublin Core Metadata Registry.&lt;ref name="registry"&gt;[http://dcmi.kc.tsukuba.ac.jp/dcregistry/ Dublin Core Metadata Registry]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example of use [and mention] by WebCite====
On the "archive form" web page for [[WebCite]] it says,&lt;ref name="WebCite form"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcitation.org/archive |title= WebCite archive form |website=[[WebCite]] |quote=These are Dublin Core elements. Entering these will help you to correctly cite the URL. [...]}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part: "Metadata (optional): These are Dublin Core elements. [...]".

===Qualified Dublin Core===
(Superseded in 2008 by the DCMI Metadata Terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/2000/07/11/dcmes-qualifiers/ |title=Dublin Core Qualifiers |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Subsequent to the specification of the original 15 elements, an ongoing process to develop exemplary terms extending or refining the DCMES was begun. The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the DCMI, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.

Element refinements make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. The guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the ''Dumb-Down Principle'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/|title=DCMI: DCMI Grammatical Principles|author=|date=|website=www.dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that an application that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery.

In addition to element refinements, Qualified Dublin Core includes a set of recommended encoding schemes, designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes include [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]] and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (for example, a term from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation, for example, "2000-12-31" as the ISO standard expression of a date. If an encoding scheme is not understood by an application, the value may still be useful to a '''human reader'''.

'''Audience, Provenance''' and '''RightsHolder''' are elements, but not part of the Simple Dublin Core 15 elements. Use Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core. DCMI also maintains a small, general vocabulary recommended for use within the element Type. This vocabulary currently consists of 12 terms.&lt;ref name="registry"/&gt;

===DCMI Metadata Terms===
The DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary.&lt;ref name="dublincore1"/&gt; This set includes the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in ''italic''), as well as the qualified terms. Each term has a unique URI in the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms, and all are defined as [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] properties.

==Syntax==
Syntax choices for Dublin Core metadata depends on a number of variables, and "one size fits all" prescriptions rarely apply. When considering an appropriate syntax, it is important to note that Dublin Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent and are equally applicable in a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation both by machines and by human beings.

The '''Dublin Core Abstract Model'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/|title=DCMI: DCMI Abstract Model|author=|date=|website=dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a reference model against which particular Dublin Core encoding guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such a reference model allows implementers to gain a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions they are trying to encode and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations between different syntax.

==Notable applications==
One [[Document Type Definition]] based on Dublin Core is the Open Source Metadata Framework (OMF) specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/osrt/omf/|title=m e t a l a b open source metadata framework|author=|date=|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMF is in turn used by [[Rarian]] (superseding [[ScrollKeeper]]), which is used by the [[GNOME]] desktop and [[KDE]] help browsers and the ScrollServer documentation server. [[PBCore]] is also based on Dublin Core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pbcore.org/schema/|title=PBCore Schema – PBCore|last=|first=|date=|website=pbcore.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-19|quote=PBCore is built on the foundation of the Dublin Core (ISO 15836), an international standard for resource discovery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zope]] [[Zope Content Management Framework|CMF's]] Metadata products, used by the [[Plone (software)|Plone]], [[ERP5]], the Nuxeo CPS [[Content management system]]s, [[SimpleDL]], and [[Fedora Commons]] also implement Dublin Core. The [[EPUB]] [[e-book]] format uses Dublin Core metadata in the [[OPF (file format)|OPF file]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0_latest.htm#Section2.2 |title=Open Packaging Format (OPF) § Publication Metadata |website=[[International Digital Publishing Forum]] |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Expressive_therapies_continuum.png|frame|A diagram of the Expressive Therapies Continuum depicting all four levels of creative functioning, the fourth of which is displayed as a vertical line intersecting, and integrating, the previous three levels.]]

The '''expressive therapies continuum''' ('''ETC''') is a model of creative functioning&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lusebrink, V. (2010) Assessment and therapeutic application of the expressive therapies continuum: Implications for brain structures and functions. ''Art Therapy: Journal of the American Art Therapy Association, 27''(4), 168-177&lt;/ref&gt; used in the field of [[art therapy]] that is applicable to creative processes both within and outside of an expressive therapeutic setting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hinz, L. (2009). ''Expressive Therapies Continuum.'' New York: Taylor &amp; Francis Group&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was initially proposed and published in 1978 by art therapists Sandra Kagin and Vija Lusebrink, who based the continuum on existing models of [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and [[information processing]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kagin, S, and Lusebrink, V. (1978) The expressive therapies continuum. ''Art Psychotherapy, 5'', 171-180&lt;/ref&gt;

This schematic model serves to describe and assess an individual's level of creative functioning based on aspects such as the artist's purpose for creating a piece, choice of medium, interaction with the chosen medium, and imagery within the piece. Conversely, it also serves to meet the needs of the client by assisting the art therapist in choosing a developmentally or situationally appropriate activity or art medium.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, J. (1984). ''The Art of Art Therapy.'' Levittown, PA: Taylor &amp; Francis Group&lt;/ref&gt; By analyzing an individual's art making process and the resulting artwork using the ETC, art therapists can assess strengths, weaknesses, and disconnect in various levels of a client's cognitive functioning - suggesting or substantiating diagnosis of, or recovery from, a mental health condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Levels of functioning==

According to Lusebrink:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first three levels of the ETC reflect three established systems of human information processing: the Kinesthetic/Sensory (K/S level); the Perceptual/Affective (P/A level); and the Cognitive/Symbolic (C/S level) ... The fourth level of the ETC is the Creative level (CR). It is seen as a synthesis of the other three levels of the continuum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A diagram of the ETC, as pictured in the top right of the page, can be read from left to right and from the bottom, upwards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The model flows in a direction that travels from simple information processing and image formation to increasingly complex thought processes and interactions with the media. Individuals can fluctuate from level to level depending on personal and situational factors. They may also display an integration of all of the first three levels of functioning. This integration indicates that the individual is operating on the fourth and final level of functioning, known as the Creative level. The Creative level both transcends and intersects the prior three levels, in which the individual is either equally incorporating all aspects of the ETC ''or'' is able to find a satisfying and meaningful creative experience on one of the three levels alone.

However, an individual cannot wholly operate at both ends of a level, as each level is bipolar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC): Interdisciplinary bases of the ETC|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17454832.2012.713370|journal = International Journal of Art Therapy|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1745-4832|pages = 75–85|volume = 18|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/17454832.2012.713370|first = Vija Bergs|last = Lusebrink|first2 = Kristīne|last2 = Mārtinsone|first3 = Ilze|last3 = Dzilna-Šilova}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the individual is more focused on the quick and scribbly ''movement'' of a chalk-pastel on paper, then he or she is less focused on the ''sensory'' aspects of the media, such as the sound of the chalk against the paper or the powdery feel of chalk in one's hand.

===Kinesthetic/Sensory Level (K/S)===

As the first level of the ETC, the Kinesthetic/Sensory level is described as a form of preverbal information processing that is "rhythmic, tactile, and sensual".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This simple type of interaction with various art media stimulates primal areas of the brain and meets basic expressive needs—all while providing sensory and kinesthetic feedback for the artist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If an individual is operating at the kinesthetic end of the spectrum, he or she may find satisfaction in movement—i.e. pounding at a piece of clay or scribbling frantically with a crayon. In contrast, if the individual is gravitating towards the sensory end of the spectrum, he or she might take more pleasure in the ''feel'' of finger-paints or the ''smell'' of scented markers.

This level is particularly useful for young children but may also be useful for anyone needing to focus on sensorimotor skills. In addition, functioning at this level may allow for better access to preverbal memories or expression of extreme emotions. Individuals may identify operation at the K/S as a personal coping mechanism, in which the experience rather than the product is viewed as therapeutic.

===Perceptual/Affective Level (P/A)===

The second level of the ETC, the Perceptual/Affective level may or may not include verbal thought processes. However, the focus has shifted from the experience alone (with little focus on the outcome, as in the K/S level) to using the media to create an intentionally expressive or self-satisfying final product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The process may be characterized either by an individual's intent to express his or her own literal reality ''or'' be characterized by content that is "emotional and raw...without regard to form".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

By working with individuals at the P/A level, art therapists can help clients to perceive images or notions in a new way, strengthening communication and assisting with the formation of meaningful relationships. They can also focus on the identification and healthy expression of one's emotions.

===Cognitive/Symbolic Level===

Operation at the third level of the ETC, the cognitive/symbolic level, requires "complex and sophisticated" information processing, in which the individual consciously and strategically plans—prior to creating the art piece—for an expressive and self-satisfying final product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At this level, individuals are able to step outside their own sphere of perception and emotional expression and focus on ways that they interact with the world around them. They may begin to use satire and hidden meanings in their pieces to best express their unique response to their surroundings or situation (symbolic) or use art to plan and to problem-solve (cognitive).

===Creative level===

The final level, which either intersects the previous three levels or transcends above them, is the Creative level. This level symbolizes a wholeness, in which the individual achieves a sense of joy, fulfillment, or wellbeing by taking part in the creative process and expressing the self.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This may be accomplished through the integration of the three previous levels (where there was inclusion of all expressive operations in the art-making process; a feeling of oneness) or success in fulfilling an individual's need at any given level, which may be healing in and of itself.

'''Forensic footwear evidence''' can be used in legal proceedings to help prove that a shoe was at a [[crime scene]]. Footwear evidence is often the most abundant form of evidence at a crime scene and in some cases can prove to be as specific as a [[fingerprint]]. Initially investigators will look to identify the make and model of the [[shoe]] or trainer which made an impression. This can be done visually or by comparison with evidence in a [[database]]; both methods focus heavily on pattern recognition and [[brand]] or [[logo]] marks. Information about the footwear can be gained from the analysis of [[wear]] patterns which are dependent on angle of footfall and [[weight distribution]]. Detailed examination of footwear impressions can help to link a specific piece of footwear to a footwear imprint as each shoe will have unique characteristics.

==Types of footwear evidence==

Footwear evidence can come in at least three forms, footwear outsole impressions, footwear insole impressions and footwear trace evidence.

===Footwear outsole impressions===
Footwear outsole impressions are impressions left on an object that was caused by contact with a piece of footwear. These can be left on the ground or raised surface by persons treading over it, left on doors or walls by persons attempting to kick or climb over a wall or even left on other persons after being kicked or stomped on.
[[Image:Shoeprint dusty.jpg|Shoeprints left on a dusty surface|thumb|100px|right]]

There can also be latent impressions not easily visible to the naked eye, on many different surfaces such as floor tiles, concrete or even carpet. Detection may require the use of additional specialized light sources such as portable [[ultraviolet]] lighting. Recovery typically includes photography as well as lifting with "gel" or "electrostatic" dust lifters.

===Footwear insole imprints===
Imprints of a person's foot can be left on the insole's inside footwear. The size and arrangement of foot and toe imprints can be used to determine whether a person has worn a piece of footwear. The analysis and comparisons of foot imprints is part of the discipline of forensic podiatry. The insole will show a virtual image of the bare foot print of the wearers foot. This can be compared to the actual barefoot print of the shoe owner to gain a match. Useful in forensic evidence casting and identification. H Farmer 2017

===Footwear trace evidence===
Footwear trace evidence is trace evidence that is recovered from footwear. Types of trace evidence that could be recovered include skin, glass fragments, body hair, fibers from clothing or carpets, soil particles, dust and bodily fluids. The study of this trace evidence could be used to link a piece of footwear to a location or owner. DNA can be one of the contributing factors in forensic footwear evidence.

==Detection of footwear evidence==

}}
Footwear impressions can be detected with a variety of methods including:
*Visually using natural or artificial lighting. 
*Using artificial light sources to provide oblique, coaxial, and polarized light for detection of visible and latent impressions.
*Using electrostatic lifting devices to lift dusty impressions.
*Using fingerprint powder to develop latent impressions.
*Using physical or chemical enhancement methods to develop or enhance faint impressions.

==Recovery of footwear impression evidence==
Footwear evidence occurs most often as either footwear impressions left in a [[wikt:soft|soft]] surface, such as [[mud]] or as [[dust]] deposits, which are difficult for the human eye to detect. At violent crimescenes footmarks can be left as a result of a person standing in blood and subsequently trailing it as they move around the scene.

===Lifting===

Footwear impressions can be lifted from surfaces with tools such as adhesive lifters, gelatin lifters or electrostatic lifting devices.

===Casting===

Evidence left via impressions can generally be recovered utilizing a [[plaster]] [[casting|cast]]. Initially the impression is isolated by framing the area with a solid boundary. Following this a plaster mix can be gently poured inside the frame; it is generally considered not best practice to pour directly onto the impression. In some cases where the surface is not ideal for casting prior techniques can be utilised to gain a better cast of the impression. [[Sand]] can often be fixed in place by applying an [[aerosol]] [[resin]] or [[glue]] although [[hair spray]] is often used. Wet mud impressions can be dried using a combination of [[pipette|pipetting]] water from the surface and applying hot air, often in the form of a [[hair dryer]].

=== 3D scanning ===
Footwear evidence can be recovered with use of 3D scanners.

There are two types of 3D scanners used in forensics:
* crime scene scanners able to capture a large overview map of the scene; 
* ‘close-up’ 3D scanners able to capture individual objects in high resolution and full colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forensicmag.com/article/2009/02/3d-scanning-new-tool-cracking-tough-cases|title=3D Scanning: A New Tool for Cracking Tough Cases|date=2009-02-01|newspaper=Forensic Magazine|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Advantage of 3D scanning over casting is that 3D scanners can scan the object without touching or affecting it – most 3D scanners use lasers to capture 3D information. Some scanners can also capture the colour surface, [null producing] a visually [null accurate] replica of the object. To create a complete and highly detailed 3D model of a footprint less than 15 minutes is required.

=== Three-dimensional imaging ===
Recent approach takes advantage of digital photography. A set of digital images of a footmark or target area of interest, taken in different viewpoints is required to create detailed and accurate 3D model. Appropriate software allows to visualise a 3D model in different ways, make accurate measurements from a 3D trace or perform a comparison of multiple traces.

==Examination of footwear impressions evidence==
Footwear impression can reveal information that may be of use to forensic investigators. Analysis of impressions found at a crime scene may provide the following information:

'''Number of people at a crime scene:''' Different footwear impressions left at a crime scene will indicate more than one person was present at the crimescene.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Approximate height of the wearer:''' There is statistical correlation&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Kevin T. The foot length to stature ratio: a study of racial variance. Diss. Texas Tech University, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; between foot/footwear size and height and also stride length and height.  The dimensions of the footwear impression and the distance between impressions can be used to provide an estimate of height. 
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Activity of wearer when impression was made:''' Plastic footwear impression left on soft surfaces can reveal whether a person was walking, running or carrying a heavy load when the impression was made. An impression made by person running will make impressions that are deeper in the heel and toe sections. A person carrying a heavy load such as a body will leave imprints that are deeper than when not carrying a heavy load.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Manufacture, model and approximate size of footwear:''' Footwear impression can show the design elements (shapes, patterns, arrangement)  that form the outsole design. These can be compared with a footwear outsole database to identify the model of footwear that made the impression. Knowledge of the model of footwear that made the impression can assist in narrowing down the list of suspects and can also be used to link multiple crime scenes to the same perpetrator(s).
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Establish link between crime scene impression with a specific piece of footwear:'''
Comparison of crime scene impressions with a specific piece of footwear recovered from a suspect can determine if there is any relationship. A worn piece of footwear will gradually acquire unique wear and tear on the outsoles. These randomly acquired characteristics will be unique to that specific shoe and may show in crime scene impressions. 
* If class characteristics and size matches: investigators can determine that footwear could have made the impression, but other footwear with similar design and size could also have made the impression. 
* If class characteristics, size match and randomly acquired characteristics found in the footwear outsole can also be found in the crime scene impressions:  Investigators can determine that the specific piece created the crime scene impression. This relationship can be used as evidence to prove that the footwear's owner was at the crime scene.

The '''Forest Products Laboratory''' (FPL) is the national research laboratory of the [[United States Forest Service]], which is part of [[USDA]]. Since its opening in 1910, the FPL has provided scientific research on wood, wood products and their commercial uses in partnership with academia, industry, tribal, state, local and other government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6309544/Forest-Products-Laboratory-supporting-|title=Find Local Contractors - Home Remodeling Contractors on Ecnext|website=goliath.ecnext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The laboratory is headquartered in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].  The focus of the Forest Products Laboratory is to promote healthy forests and forest-based economies through the efficient, sustainable use of the Nation's wood resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2017/01/12/the_forest_products_laboratory_is_a_federally_funded_lab_conducting_experiments.html|title=The Federally Funded Laboratory Conducting Experiments on All Things Wooden|date=12 January 2017|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Old U.S. Forest Products Lab.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Old U.S. Forest Products Laboratory|old Forest Products Laboratory]] (1910) on the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] campus, at 1509 University Avenue, is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]]
[[File:Forest Products Building, U.S. Government, taken from the Lake Drive, Madison, Wisconsin (63064).jpg|thumb|250px|The new Laboratory location, illustrated between the 1930s and 40s]]
The Forest Products Laboratory was conceived of in 1907 by McGarvey Cline, chief of the U.S. Forest Service Office of Wood Utilization. Cline saw the need for a centralized research facility in order to improve coordination among regional research centers.  Along with Forest Service Chief [[Gifford Pinchot]], Cline selected the [[University of Wisconsin]] campus as the site for this new laboratory. Operations began at 1509 University Avenue, in what today is the UW Materials Science and Engineering Building.  The dedication ceremony occurred under new Chief [[Henry S. Graves]] on June 4, 1910.  [[Raphael Zon]]'s advocacy of research led to the organization of the first Federal Forest Experiment Stations and the Forest Products Laboratory under the Branch of Research, which was formed in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fhsarchives.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/december-1-1874-a-red-star-is-born/|title=December 1, 1874: A [Red] Star is Born|date=1 December 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fseee.org/forest-magazine/200061&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, the Forest Products Laboratory began relocation to its current facility on the western end of the University of Wisconsin campus. 
 
Research at the FPL has improved quality of life for nearly every American by facilitating breakthroughs in housing, packaging, recycling, and conservation of forest resources. The FPL has also made numerous important contributions to the country during its history, including crucial research for the armed forces during times of war.&lt;ref&gt;Risbrudt, C.D., Ross, R.J., Blankenburg, J.J., Nelson, C.A. (2007). Forest Products Laboratory: Supporting the Nation's Armed Forces with valuable wood research for 90 years. Forest Products Journal, Vol. 57(1&amp;2), pp. 6-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The mission of the Forest Products Laboratory is to identify and conduct innovative wood and fiber utilization research that contributes to conservation and productivity of the forest resource, thereby sustaining forests, the economy, and quality of life. The FPL is organized into seven primary Research Work Units. These units utilize the testing resources of several laboratories and informational repositories located within numerous FPL campus facilities. Five primary Areas of Focus are the center of all FPL research. Collaboration on this research takes place with various other Federal agencies; state, local, and tribal governments; private industry and academic institutions.

===Research Emphasis Areas===

*'''Underutilized Woody Biomass''': Forests in the United States contain a significant amount of small-diameter and underutilized woody [[biomass]]. Overstocked stands of trees increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires and damage due to insects, disease, and drought. Thinning these stands can help reduce risks but can be very costly and may exceed the value of the biomass being removed. The commercial use of thinning material creates a market for [[value-added]] products and is one way to improve the economics of thinning operations aimed at improving forest health. Since 1993, the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) has focused some of its many research efforts on characterizing and identifying potential uses for small-diameter and thinning material. FPL researchers also provide technology to help rural communities create successful businesses from the by-products of [[ecosystem management]]. Some projects have explored the potential of "in the round" form small-diameter structural material for uses in bridges, boardwalks, trail structures, picnic shelters, storage sheds, and other rustic-type buildings.
*'''Nanotechnology''': [[Nanotechnology]] research presents great potential for improved wood product performance and serviceability. As such, the FPL is poised to be the preeminent Federal facility for the application of nano-science in forest products research. Potential nanotech applications include wood composite materials with embedded nanosensors to measure and react to structural forces, loads, moisture, and temperatures. Nano-enabled antimicrobial and water resistant coatings on lumber for use in flood-prone areas and hurricane zones could improve health, safety, and wood resiliency in these areas. The development of high-value products from undervalued wood resources using cellulose [[nanocrystal]]s and nanofibrilated cellulose components can also improve the performance and durability of [[fiberboard]], [[particleboard]], and glued structural products for use in a wide array of structural applications.
*'''Forest Biorefinery and Biomass Utilization''': The FPL is well-placed to pursue research opportunities to improve the economics of producing transportation fuel, [[bioenergy]], and chemicals from woody [[biomass]]. Development of profitable biorefineries helps lower the cost of [[forest management]], improves forest health, advances sustainable forest management practices, reduces dependence on fossil fuels, and decreases production of [[greenhouse gases]]. Decades of [[fire suppression]] have disrupted the natural fire cycle of U.S. forests, resulting in an estimated 8.4 billion dry tons of material that needs to be removed from the National Forests to improve their resiliency.  This material is available for production of wood products, chemicals, and energy, yet profitable uses for the material are needed to reduce the costs of [[forest management]]. Business concepts that focus on converting wood resources into liquid fuels and chemical feedstock are becoming cost competitive.  As international concerns over [[global warming]] and [[greenhouse gas]] generation rise, governmental support for [[biofuels]] is increasing and likely reduces investment risks. Fuels derived from biomass are generally regarded as greenhouse gas neutral because the amount of carbon dioxide released on combustion equals the amount adsorbed from the atmosphere and sequestered by the plant through [[photosynthesis]].
*'''Advanced Structures Research''': In the past, structures were primarily designed based on life and safety issues. Today, structural design also includes functionality, [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]], and economics. Performance-based engineering encompasses these considerations in [[structural design]] and is gaining momentum with architects and engineers. Performance-based engineering implies design, evaluation, and construction of engineered facilities that meet uncertain future demands.  The concepts require a shift away from empirical and experience-based conventions towards a design and assessment process more firmly rooted in accurate prediction of structural performance under a realistic description environmental loading factors that the structure experiences. This approach also emphasizes monitoring the health of the structural system, evaluating performance characteristics and identifying the need for renovation or new construction. It forms the foundation of strategies for revitalizing our decaying infrastructure.	
*'''Advanced Composites''': For decades, wood [[composite materials]] have been used to create [[value-added]] commodity building and home furnishing products (for example, [[plywood]], [[particleboard]], [[fiberboard]], [[hardboard]]). More recently, biobased composite products based on natural fibers, and hybrid products, such as wood–plastic composites, have come on the market.  New composite technologies, such as nano-enabled composites, are being developed as low-volume, high-value composites. Each of these technologies adds considerable value to diverse wood- and bio-fiber feedstocks, including small-diameter timber, plantation-grown timber, agricultural and industrial residues, exotic–invasive species, and demolition and recycled materials. Biobased composites are also an outlet for timber removals and thinning, which helps forest managers restore damaged ecosystems and promotes sustainable [[forest management]] practices. Recent advances in wood and [[biocomposite]] research have led to a new understanding between materials, process, and composite performance. Advances in engineered biocomposites impact a wide range of composite products, including economical commodity products and high-performance niche products.

===Research Work Units===

*'''Durability &amp; Wood Protection''': Improving durability and wood protection through improved building design, advances in low-toxicity wood preservatives, and improvements in fire safety.
*'''Economics &amp; Statistics''': Providing economic information, analysis, and projections and to enhance the efficiency of research through development, evaluation, and application of modern statistical research.
*'''Engineered Composites Sciences''': Understanding relationships between materials, process, and performance to engineer biocomposites that benefit users while promoting sustainability of both virgin and recycled forest resources.
*'''Engineering Properties of Wood, Wood-based Materials &amp; Structures''': Improving the characterization of the mechanical and physical properties of wood and wood-based products that are important in engineering design and fostering their efficient use in wood building systems.
*'''Fiber &amp; Chemical Sciences Research''': Formulating efficient processes for converting wood to chemicals and fibers, developing economically viable uses for underutilized wood resources, and improving methods for recovering and reusing forest products such as waste paper and construction debris.
*'''Institute for Microbial &amp; Biochemical Technology''': Developing biotechnology and nanotechnology for wood and fiber conversion through research that contributes to efficient wood utilization and improved forest health.
*'''Forest Biopolymer Science &amp; Engineering''': Understanding the basic properties of wood and other materials used in conjunction with wood to improve their properties, enhance their service life, and develop new uses.

===Laboratory Units===

*'''Analytical Chemistry &amp; Microscopy Laboratory''' (ACML): The ACML provides high-quality analytical support and technical consultation to FPL researchers using specialized equipment and capabilities, such as a [[nanoindenter]], [[atomic force microscope]] and [[scanning electron microscope]].
*'''Engineering Mechanics &amp; Remote Sensing Laboratory''' (EMRSL): The EMRSL conducts physical and mechanical tests on a wide range of materials, building systems, and structures for use in the development of [[building codes]] and [[structural design]]. Testing of products and structures can involve samples ranging in size from toothpicks to full structural beams to three-dimensional building mock-ups.
*'''Paper Test Laboratory''': The Paper Test Laboratory focuses mainly on analyzing printing and writing grades of paper.  Researchers are able to address most paper testing needs regarding strength, optical, and surface properties. Testing is conducted in a tightly controlled humidity room for optimum accuracy.

===Resources &amp; Technical Assistance===
*'''Center for Wood Anatomy Research''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/research/centers/woodanatomy/index.php|title=Forest Products Laboratory - USDA Forest Service|website=www.fpl.fs.fed.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Wood Anatomy Research at FPL is home to the world's largest research wood collection. Over 100,000 samples are used for research and identification purposes. Researchers study anatomical and other characteristics of wood that may affect their utilization potential, provide wood identification services, and answer questions concerning the properties, characteristics, and uses of tropical and obscure native species.
*'''Center for Forest Mycology Research''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/research/centers/mycology/culture-collection.shtml|title=Forest Products Laboratory - USDA Forest Service|website=www.fpl.fs.fed.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for [[Mycology]] Research maintains a [[herbarium]] containing 70,000 dried specimens of decay [[fungi]] collected since the early 1900s, as well as a collection of more than 12,000 living cultures. Samples from these collections are used by researchers around the world to further their studies.  While located at FPL, the Center for Forest Mycology Research is officially a unit of the Forest Service's Northern Research Station.
*'''Technology Marketing Unit''':&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/research/units/tmu/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Located at FPL, the USDA Forest Service State and Private Forestry's Technology Marketing Unit (TMU) provides a broad scope of expertise in wood products utilization and marketing, [[technology transfer]], and technical assistance.  The TMU works in collaboration with many different partners to ensure ready adoption of forest-based material technologies to many small, rural [[forest products]] businesses.  The breadth of their work includes forest products conservation, processing, manufacturing efficiency, marketing, recycling, and [[bioenergy]].  The technical assistance they provide includes publications, technical assistance visits, conferences, workshops, meetings, and one-on-one consultations over the phone or in person.  The TMU also manages and awards annual grants dedicated to helping improve the utilization of woody [[biomass]] removed from forest restoration projects.
*'''FPL Library''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/products/library/index.php|title=Forest Products Laboratory - USDA Forest Service|website=www.fpl.fs.fed.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; FPL houses a national Forest Service library that is open to the public. Subject areas include solid wood products, pulp and paper, mycology, wood anatomy, wood engineering, biotechnology, adhesives, wood preservation, fire research, economics, biodeterioration of wood, paints and coatings, and recycling.

==Research &amp; Testing Facilities==

===Centennial Research Facility===

[[Image:CRF rendering02.tif|thumb|right|The USDA Forest Products Laboratory's Centennial Research Facility in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].]]The most advanced large-scale addition to the FPL in over 70 years is the new Centennial Research Facility (CRF), a {{convert|87000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} multi-use laboratory. This facility was built to meet qualifications for Silver certification by the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) rating system developed by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]]. As such, the CRF was designed and built using strategies to improve performance across the most important efficiency metrics: energy savings, water usage, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions reduction, improved indoor environmental quality, and stewardship of resources including sensitivity to their impacts. CRF researchers in engineering mechanics can test the strength of full-scale structures while durability researchers put wood products to the test in a rather punishing weather simulation chamber. Modern preservation testing equipment will replace the older vessels previously used, while an efficient and manufacturing-friendly floor plan will help advance research in wood- and bio-based composites.&lt;ref&gt;Forest Products Journal, October, 2009, A Century of Research Working for You. Vol. 59(10) pp. 6-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research Demonstration House and Carriage House===

FPL has constructed two full-scale structures, the Research Demonstration House and Carriage House, for research and educational activities.  Both of these structures allow researchers to conduct housing-related studies in a real-world setting, which can significantly extend knowledge obtained in a laboratory environment. These structures are a result of collaboration through the Advanced Housing Research Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/research/centers/ahrc/index.shtml|title=Forest Products Laboratory - USDA Forest Service|website=www.fpl.fs.fed.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; established by FPL in 2000, which includes a wide range of partners from both the public and privates sectors working to improve housing technologies.

===Fire Test Lab===

The fire testing facility at FPL is key to developing safe, durable building products.  The current facility is equipped to perform standardized tests for flame retardancy and fire resistance.  Plans for construction of a new fire test facility are underway, and current capabilities will be enhanced by enabling simulation of actual fire scenarios on a larger scale. The new facility will allow researchers to better address wildland fire threats to structures and development of performance-based building codes.

===Pulp &amp; Paper Plant===

FPL's fiber processing pilot plant is equipped to replicate industrial pulping and papermaking processes on a pilot scale.  With capabilities in chip production, pulping, paper and fiberboard production, and even recycling, researchers can test new methods and evaluate their effectiveness on equipment similar to that used by commercial manufacturers.

===Nanocellulose Pilot Plant===

In August, 2012, the FPL unveiled a $1.7 million production facility for renewable, forest-based nanomaterials. This facility is the first of its kind in the United States and one that positions the laboratory as the country's leading producer of nanocellulose materials. Nanocellulose is simply wood fiber broken down to the nanoscale. For perspective, a nanometer is roughly one-millionth the thickness of an American dime. Materials at this minute scale have unique properties; nanocellulose-based materials can be stronger than Kevlar fiber and provide high strength properties with low weight. Applications for nanocellulose materials, for example, include use in lightweight armor and ballistic glass. Companies in the automotive, aerospace, electronics, consumer products, and medical device industries also see high potential for these innovative materials in a wide variety of applications.

The facility will support an emerging market for wood-derived renewable nanomaterials, helping to spur forest-based job growth and contribute an estimated $600 billion to the American economy by 2020.
The U.S. and other nations will see numerous benefits from the commercialization of wood-derived cellulosic nanomaterials.  Development and commercialization of new lightweight, high-performance wood-derived products can help reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions while increasing the potential for rural manufacturing opportunities, including the creation of many new high-paying jobs. The Forest Product Lab's new facility will aid in the commercialization of these materials by providing researchers and early adopters of the technology with working quantities of forest-based nanomaterials.

== Educating about genocide in Rwanda ==
Recent Rwanda history curricula explicitly stipulate the teaching of the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide of the Tutsi]], notably through the comparison "of different genocides" with a view to "suggest ways of preventing genocide from happening again in Rwanda and elsewhere". A comparative approach has been adopted, which is clearly reflected in the 2015 Curriculum for [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The competence-based curriculum framework mentions "[[genocide studies]]" as a cross-cutting issue, therefore introducing the study of genocide in a variety of subject areas. It further states that "Rwandan children should know about the genocide perpetrated against the Tutsi alongside the Holocaust and other genocides".&lt;ref&gt;Rwanda Education Board. 2015. Competence based curriculum: Curriculum framework pre-primary to upper secondary. Ministry of Education, Republic of Rwanda. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.tcop.rw/&lt;/nowiki&gt; le/2041/download?token=T398Bm6a&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching about the 1994 genocide of the [[Tutsi]] in Rwanda, and thereby introducing genocide studies in history textbooks and curricula, has been part of a gradual process to promote national unity and peace. This process included a moratorium on some chapters of Rwandan history in 1995, which ended when considerations pertaining to the 1994 genocide were introduced into the 2008 history curriculum. Recent approaches also built on the acknowledgement of the disastrous effects of pre-genocide Rwandan education, which contributed to discrimination against the Tutsi population and constituted a backdrop for the ideology that led to the genocide. In contrast, introducing the history of the genocide in the education system was a recognition that schools, in addition to non-formal and informal learning environments, are crucial venues to impart knowledge about the genocide and to overcome silence, denial and conflict. These changes also correspond to a deeper reflection on appropriate pedagogies to help learners grapple with the legacy of the genocide. According to Jean-Damascène Gasanabo, director-general of the Research and Documentation Center on Genocide at the National Commission for the Fight against Genocide (CNLG) in Kigali, "This change in the curriculum has been supplemented by a shift to transform learning from one based on standard rote memorization to one that encourages discussion and a spirit of critical thinking and analysis. This approach identi es the student as an active participant in the learning experience, not merely a silent recipient of history as 'evangelical speech'."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Aegis Trusts Education about the Holocaust.svg|thumb|Aegis Trust's Sustainable Peace Model/Framework]]
The [[Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre|Kigali Genocide Memorial]] and [[Aegis Trust]], in partnership with other Rwandan organizations such as the Educators' Institute for Human Rights, has developed education programmes and in-service training to help teachers build capacity and acquire historical knowledge to deal with genocides and mass atrocities. Such programmes emphasize "critical thinking, empathy and individual moral responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;Gasanabo, J.D., Mutanguha, F. and Mpayimana, A.. 2016. Teaching about the Holocaust and Genocide in Rwanda. Contemporary Review of the Middle East. Special Issue: Holocaust Education, Volume 3, Issue 3, pp. 329-345. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2347798916654583&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They explore historical examples, primarily the genocide of the Jewish people and the genocide of the Tutsi, through a "Sustainable Peace Model/Framework" which seeks to link genocide education (looking back) to genocide prevention (looking into the present) to peace-building (looking forward).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Education about the Holocaust ==
{{Main|Education about the Holocaust}}

"Genocide education" deals with the phenomenon of genocide, while education about the Holocaust focuses above all on the causes and dynamics of the genocide of the Jewish people and responses to it. However, both fields are increasingly interconnected. [[Genocide studies]] – referring to academic research about the broader trends and patterns of genocide and mass atrocities – and genocide education have become more widespread in universities and schools, as genocide and mass atrocities are recurring phenomena in the world. The studies have expanded to examine theories about how and why genocide happens. Education about the particular event of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] includes considerations about the concept, planning and implementation of that genocide, and can prompt reflections as to how what we learn about the Holocaust can contribute to the prevention of mass atrocities today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The role of gender ==
Scholars and educators are increasingly recognizing and exploring gender as a dimension of genocide and other mass atrocities. Educators may wish to consider how gender influences, affects, and manifests itself in genocide, from the strategies of its perpetrators to the experiences of its victims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Historically, most atrocities have been committed by men. Genocide scholar [[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Adam Jones]], however, notes that "when women, along with men, are mobilized, forced, encouraged, allowed to participate in genocide and other atrocious violence, they generally display no more reluctance than (often reluctant) males". [[Wendy Lower]], for example, studied the role of German women during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and found that relative to their role in German society and their professional positions, women participated in the perpetration of crimes "as zealous administrators, robbers, tormentors, and murderers".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. 2017. Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction, 3rd edition, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lower, W. 2013. Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields, Houghton Mi in Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gender can shape and dictate both the experiences of victims and the methods perpetrators employ when committing genocide and mass atrocities. Roles often relegated to the female sphere can influence the fates of women. As traditional caregivers, for example, women who provide direct care for children or elderly relatives may inadvertently hinder or eliminate their own ability to survive genocidal violence. At the same time, perpetrators often differently persecute men and women. During the Holocaust, pregnant women and mothers of small children were consistently labeled "incapable of work". Consequently, women often found themselves among the  first sent to the [[gas chamber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, "Women during the Holocaust," &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005176&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressors' intent on a symbolic and physical disruption of group reproduction often target women and girls for sexualized violence, such as mass rape or forced sterilization. Cases also exist in which boys and men have been systematically sexually victimized. Transgressions of gender norms such as homosexuality and transsexuality have also served as grounds for the targeting of both men and women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History and mission==
ITC was founded in 1950 with the name International Training Centre for Aerial Survey by the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Prof. Dr. [[Willem Schermerhorn]] to provide training in map making as an aid to developing countries. Over the years its mission has been adjusted to changing technological and development realities, so that today it offers [[MSc]], [[Master's degree|Master's]], Diploma and Certificate courses in Geo-information Science (GIS) and Earth Observation (EO) with emphasis on applications in developing countries. ITC promotes [[PhD]] Research in collaboration with universities in the Netherlands. In addition, ITC undertakes applied and technological consultancy projects world wide and contributes to fundamental research in the fields of its expertise.

==Education at ITC ==
More than 19,000 students from over 170 countries have followed ITC courses since 1950. The institute's degrees are accredited by the Dutch system of higher education.

ITC offers degree, diploma and certificate courses in geo-information science and earth observation applied to eight domains: Disaster management; Earth sciences; Geoinformatics; Governance; Land administration; Natural resources; Urban planning; and Water resources.

ITC has several joint educational programmes with partner institutes in the developing world, for example joint MSc programmes in geo-hazards with the [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]] in [[Dehradun]], [[India]] and [[Gadjah Mada University]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. It also offers much of its curriculum as distance education modules, and offers custom training courses to meet specific capacity building requirements, both in Enschede and abroad.

The '''Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics''' at the [[University of Manchester]], is among the largest astrophysics groups in the [[UK]]. It includes the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]], the MERLIN/VLBI National Facility, and the Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre.  The Centre was formed after the merger of the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] and [[UMIST]] which brought two astronomy groups together. The Jodrell Bank site also hosts the headquarters of the SKA Organisation (SKAO) - a global entity that is set to become an International Governmental Organisation (IGO). The SKA&lt;ref&gt;http://skatelescope.org&lt;/ref&gt; will be the largest telescope in the world - construction is expected to start at the end of this decade. 

The JBCA is part of the [[School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester|School of Physics and Astronomy]]. The current Director is Professor Michael Garrett.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/news-and-events/new-director-of-the-jodrell-bank-centre-for-astrophysics.htm New Director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Jodrell Bank Observatory}}
The Jodrell Bank Observatory, located near [[Goostrey]] and [[Holmes Chapel]] in [[Cheshire]], has played an important role in the research of [[meteor]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[astrophysical maser|masers]] and [[gravitational lens]]es, and was heavily involved with the tracking of [[space probe]]s at the start of the [[Space Age]].

The main telescope at the observatory is the [[Lovell Telescope]], which is the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world. There are three other active telescopes located at the observatory; the [[Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark II]], as well as 42ft and 7m-diameter radio telescopes. Jodrell Bank Observatory is also the base of the [[e-MERLIN|Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network]] (MERLIN), a National Facility run by the [[University of Manchester]] on behalf of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]].

'''Justin L. Barrett''' (born 1971) is an [[Americans|American]] [[cognitive scientist]], Director of the Thrive Center for Human Development in [[Pasadena, California]], Thrive Professor of Developmental Science, and Professor of Psychology at Fuller Graduate School of Psychology. He previously held a post as senior researcher of the Centre for Anthropology and Mind and The Institute for Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at [[Oxford University]].

==Career==
Barrett earned a B.A. in [[psychology]] from [[Calvin College]] and a Ph.D in experimental psychology (cognitive and developmental focus) from [[Cornell University]]. He served on the psychology faculties of Calvin College and the [[University of Michigan]] (Ann Arbor), and as a research fellow of the [[Institute for Social Research]].

Dr. Barrett is a founding editor of the ''Journal of Cognition &amp; Culture'' and is author of numerous articles and chapters concerning the [[cognitive science of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolutionofreligion.org/speakers.php?s=Justin+Barrett Speakers Bio Hawaii conference of the evolution of religion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/staff/publications/justin.barrett.shtml Barrett's Selected Publications] at the [[University of Oxford]] website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728102522/http://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/staff/publications/justin.barrett.shtml |date=July 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on evolution of religious belief==
Barrett is described in the [[New York Times]] as a  "prominent member of the byproduct camp" and "an observant Christian who believes in “an all-knowing, all-powerful, perfectly good God who brought the universe into being,” [and] “that the purpose for people is to love God and love each other.” He considers that “[[Christian theology]] teaches that people were crafted by God to be in a loving relationship with him and other people, Why wouldn’t God, then, design us in such a way as to find belief in divinity quite natural?” Having a scientific explanation for mental phenomena does not mean we should stop believing in them. “Suppose science produces a convincing account for why I think my wife loves me — should I then stop believing that she does?”&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]] [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html?pagewanted=11&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;em&amp;en=166dbd9e75680e73&amp;ex=1173243600 Darwin's God] March 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Why Would Anyone Believe in God?''==
In  his book ''Why Would Anyone Believe in God?'' he suggests that "belief in God is an almost inevitable consequence of the kind of minds we have. Most of what we believe comes from mental tools working below our conscious awareness. And what we believe consciously is in large part driven by these unconscious beliefs." and "that beliefs in gods match up well with these automatic assumptions; beliefs in an all-knowing, all-powerful God match up even better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altamirapress.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=%5EDB/CATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0759106673 Book description ] - see also the preface [http://www.altamirapress.com/Chapters/Index.shtml?SKU=0759106673&amp;Site=altamirapress&amp;Title=Why%20Would%20Anyone%20Believe%20in%20God%3F&amp;FileType=PDF online here]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202081331/http://www.altamirapress.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=%5EDB%2FCATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0759106673 |date=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''List of Egyptian [[scribe]]s''', almost exclusively from the '''[[Ancient Egypt]]ian''' periods.

&lt;div&gt;The hieroglyph used to [[scribe equipment (hieroglyph)|signify the scribe]], ''to write'', and ''"writings"'', etc., is [[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner]] sign Y3, &lt;hiero&gt;Y3&lt;/hiero&gt; from the category of: 'writings, games, &amp; music'. The hieroglyph contains the scribe's writing palette, a vertical case to hold writing-reeds, and a leather pouch to hold the colored ink blocks, mostly black and red.&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11785">In [[cultural studies]], '''media culture''' refers to the current [[Western world|Western]] [[capitalist]] society that emerged and developed from the 20th century, under the [[influence of mass media]].&lt;ref name="Jansson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thoman1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas2012p30"/&gt; The term alludes to the overall impact and intellectual guidance exerted by the media (primarily TV, but also the press, radio and cinema), not only on public opinion but also on [[Taste (sociology)|taste]]s and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]].

The alternative term '''mass culture''' conveys the idea that such culture emerges spontaneously from the masses themselves, like popular art did before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno (1963) quotation: {{quotation|...the interpretation agreeable to its advocates: that it is a matter of something like a culture that arises spontaneously from the masses themselves, the contemporary form of popular art.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression media culture, on the other hand, conveys the idea that such culture is the product of the mass media.

Media culture, with its declinations of advertising and public relations, is often considered as a system centered on the manipulation of the mass of society.&lt;ref name="Bignell2007p21"/&gt; [[Corporate media]] "are used primarily to represent and reproduce dominant ideologies."&lt;ref name="Nomai2008p5"&gt;Nomai (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4auF2ysN0wC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5 pp.5], 41&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in the development of this perspective has been the work of [[Theodor Adorno]] since the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Bignell2007p21"&gt;Bignell (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lVabD9fYBIC&amp;pg=PA21 pp.21-2]&lt;/ref&gt; Media culture is associated with [[consumerism]], and in this sense called alternatively "consumer culture."&lt;ref name="Jansson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas2012p30"&gt;Thomas (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=v76Ksn6vFIIC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30 p.30] quotation: {{quotation|The twenty-first century Western world, driven by American corporate and consumer ideology, is a perpetual media culture that depends on sound bites and ''the next thing'', leaving the public reduced  to media consumers never allowed time to reflect on the information.

{{quote|"[[Popular culture]] and the mass media have a symbiotic relationship: each depends on the other in an intimate collaboration."|K. Turner (1984), p. 4&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, Roy (1994). ''Understanding Popular Music'', p. 4. {{ISBN|0-415-10723-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[news media]] mines the work of [[scientist]]s and [[scholar]]s and conveys it to the [[general public]], often emphasizing elements that have inherent appeal or the power to amaze. For instance, [[giant panda]]s (a species in remote Chinese woodlands) have become well-known items of popular culture; [[intestinal parasite|parasitic worms]], though of greater practical importance, have not. Both scholarly facts and news stories get modified through popular transmission, often to the point of outright falsehoods.

[[Hannah Arendt]]'s 1961 essay "The Crisis in Culture" suggested that a "market-driven media would lead to the displacement of culture by the dictates of [[entertainment]]."&lt;ref name=nomuzak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nomuzak.co.uk/dumbing_down.html |title=Dumbing down |publisher=Nomuzak.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029011017/http://nomuzak.co.uk/dumbing_down.html |archivedate=October 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Sontag]] argues that in our culture, the most "...intelligible, persuasive values are [increasingly] drawn from the entertainment industries", which has spelt the "undermining of standards of seriousness." As a result, "tepid, the glib, and the senselessly cruel" topics are becoming the norm.&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;
Some critics argue that popular culture is "dumbing down": "newspapers that once ran foreign news now feature celebrity gossip, pictures of scantily dressed young ladies... television has replaced high-quality drama with gardening, cookery, and other "lifestyle" programmes [and] reality TV and asinine soaps," to the point that people are constantly immersed in [[trivia]] about [[celebrity culture]].&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;

According to Altheide and Snow, media culture means that within a culture, the media increasingly influences other institutions (e.g. politics, religion, sports), which become constructed alongside a media logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altheide, D. L., &amp; Snow, R. P.|title=Media Logic|date=1979|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, television has been the main medium for molding [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rosenberg and White's book ''Mass Culture'', [[Dwight Macdonald]] argues that "Popular culture is a debased, trivial culture that voids both the deep realities ([[sex]], [[death]], [[failure]], [[tragedy]]) and also the simple spontaneous pleasures... The masses, debauched by several generations of this sort of thing, in turn come to demand trivial and comfortable cultural products."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt; Van den Haag argues that "all mass media in the end alienate people from personal experience and though appearing to offset it, intensify their moral isolation from each other, from the reality and from themselves."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van den Haag, in Bernard Rosenberg and David Manning White, ''Mass Culture'', p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have lamented the "replacement of high art and authentic folk culture by tasteless industrialised artefacts [[mass production|produced on a mass scale]] in order to satisfy the [[lowest common denominator]]."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt; This "mass culture emerged after the Second World War and have led to the concentration of mass-culture power in ever larger global media conglomerates." The popular press decreased the amount of news or information and replaced it with entertainment or [[titillation]] that reinforces "fears, [[prejudice]], scapegoating processes, [[paranoia]], and aggression."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt; Critics of television and film have argued that the quality of TV output has been diluted as stations pursue ratings by focusing on the "glitzy, the superficial, and the popular". In film, "Hollywood culture and values" are increasingly dominating film production in other countries. Hollywood films have changed from creating formulaic films which emphasize "shock-value and superficial [[:wikt:thrill|thrill]][s]" and the use of special effects, with themes that focus on the "basic [[instinct]]s of aggression, revenge, violence, [and] greed." The plots "often seem [[simplistic]], a standardized template taken from the shelf, and dialogue is minimal." The "characters are shallow and unconvincing, the dialogue is also simple, unreal, and badly constructed."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;

More recently, scholars turned to the concept of the [[Mediatization (media)|mediatization]] of culture to address the various processes through which culture is influenced by the modus operandi of the media. On one hand, the media are cultural institutions and artifacts of their own, on the other hand, other domains have become dependent on the media and their various affordances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Hjarvard  |author2=L. N. Petersen|title=Mediatization and cultural change|journal=MedieKultur|date=2013|issue=54|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Through religion==
Media culture, in its mass marketing, has been compared to the role of religions in the past. It has been considered as taking the place of the old traditional religions.&lt;ref&gt;from Debord (1977) thesis 20: "The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1967) thesis 25 on the spectacle and the [[sacred]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nomai2008p176"&gt;Nomai (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4auF2ysN0wC&amp;pg=PA176 p.176]&lt;/ref&gt; The waves of enthusiasm and fervent exaltation for a given product, a characteristic [[consumerist]] phenomenon, has been compared to the "ecstasies of the convulsions and miracles of the old religious fetishism".&lt;ref name="Thesis67"&gt;Debord (1977) Thesis 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from Debord (1977) thesis 132: "The masters who make history their private property, under the protection of myth, possess first of all a private ownership of the mode of illusion: in China and Egypt they long held a monopoly over the immortality of the soul ... The growth of their real historical power goes together with a popularization of the possession of myth and illusion."&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the [[Catholic Church]], the dominant religious institution in the Western world, has been considered retrospectively as an antecedent and sophisticated form of [[public relations]], [[advertiser]] and [[multinational corporation]], selling its product to a mass of worshipers/consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Ballardini, Bruno (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=n1zyAAAACAAJ ''Gesù lava più bianco.

In [[visual arts]], [[Minimal music|music]], and other mediums, '''minimalism''' is an [[art movement]] that began in post–[[World War II]] Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with minimalism include [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], and [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10459 |title=Christopher Want, ''Minimalism'', Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minimalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-minimalism.htm|title=Minimalism|publisher=theartstory.org|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the reductive aspects of [[modernism]] and is often interpreted as a reaction against [[abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|postminimal]] art practices.

[[Minimalist music|Minimalism in music]] often features repetition and iteration such as those of the compositions of [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Julius Eastman]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. The term ''minimalist'' often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has accordingly been used to describe the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novel]]s of [[Samuel Beckett]], the films of [[Robert Bresson]], the stories of [[Raymond Carver]], and the automobile designs of [[Colin Chapman]]. &lt;!--The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe a 1915 composition by the Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.

Minimalism in visual art, generally referred to as "minimal art", "literalist art"&lt;ref&gt;Fried, M. "Art and Objecthood", ''Artforum'', 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and "ABC Art"&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Barbara. "ABC Art", ''Art in America'' 53, no. 5 (October–November 1965): 57–69.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in New York in the early 1960s as new and older artists moved toward [[geometric abstraction]]; exploring via painting in the cases of [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Robert Ryman]] and others; and sculpture in the works of various artists including [[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], [[Anthony Caro]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]] and others. Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan, as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture'' shown from April 27 – June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, "Engineer's Esthetic", pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, "The New Druids", pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]] also in 1966 that showcased [[Geometric abstraction]] in the American art world via [[Shaped canvas]], [[Color Field]], and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 |title=''Systemic Painting'', Guggenheim Museum |publisher=Guggenheim.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/systemic-art |title=Systemic art, Oxford-Art encyclopedia |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of those exhibitions and a few others the art movement called ''minimal art'' emerged.

In a more broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of Kazimir Malevich, [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ |title=Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'' |publisher=Artcritical.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein had painted [[Monochrome painting|monochromes]] as early as 1949, and held the first private exhibition of this work in 1950—but his first public showing was the publication of the [[Artist's book]] ''[[Yves: Peintures]]'' in November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Weitemeier, ''Yves Klein, 1928–1962: International Klein Blue'', Original-Ausgabe (Cologne: Taschen, 1994), 15. {{ISBN|3-8228-8950-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Paint Uncovered|chapter=Restoring the Immaterial: Study and Treatment of Yves Klein's ''Blue Monochrome (IKB42)''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false |title=Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161–172 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 [[Artforum]] essay ''Last Exit: Painting,'' minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's&lt;ref name="sharecom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |title=Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960 |publisher=Sharecom.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson, minimalism was the result, even though the term "minimalism" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this interpretation of what he said, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me—or anyone at all—arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.&lt;ref name="sharecom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, and unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], a theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, "Notes on Sculpture 1–3", originally published across three issues of ''Artforum'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] – "parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation." Morris later described an art represented by a "marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals..." in "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in ''Artforum'', 1969, continuing on to say that "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transition into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.

One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter [[Frank Stella]], four of whose early "black paintings" were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's black paintings were often determined by the dimensions of the lumber he used for stretchers to support the canvas, visible against the canvas as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side. Stella's decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a "given" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripes]]. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, but other artists—including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Robert Ryman]]—had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Britannica.com |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oisteanu |first=Valery |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman |title=Brooklynrail.org |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticized by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of Artforum. Smithson stated the following: "What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing—namely being himself theatrical."

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

''The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.''&lt;ref&gt;in Barbara Rose, ed. ''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-520-07670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an interview with Dorothy Strickler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Oral history interview with Lee Krasner, 1964 Nov. 2-1968 Apr. 11 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When I brought Hofmann up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann’s reaction was—one of the questions he asked Jackson was, "Do you work from nature?" There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson’s answer was, "I am nature." And Hofmann’s reply was, "Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself." To which Jackson did not reply at all. The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in [[design]] and [[architecture]], wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Minimalist architectural designers focus on the connection between two perfect planes, elegant lighting, and the void spaces left by the removal of three-dimensional shapes in an architectural design.{{according to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} 

Minimalistic design has been highly influenced by [[Japanese architecture|Japanese traditional design and architecture]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The works of [[De Stijl]] artists are a major reference: De Stijl expanded the ideas of expression by meticulously organizing basic elements such as lines and planes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} With regard to home design, more attractive "minimalistic" designs are not truly minimalistic because they are larger, and use more expensive building materials and finishes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

There are observers who describe the emergence of minimalism as a response to the brashness and chaos of urban life. In Japan, for example, minimalist architecture began to gain traction in the 1980s when its cities experienced rapid expansion and booming population. The design was considered an antidote to the "overpowering presence of traffic, advertising, jumbled building scales, and imposing roadways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fractal Dimension of Architecture|last=Ostwald|first=Michael|last2=Vaughan|first2=Josephine|publisher=Birkhauser|year=2016|isbn=9783319324241|location=Newcastle|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chaotic environment was not only driven by urbanization, industrialization, and technology but also the Japanese experience of constantly having to demolish structures on account of the destruction wrought by World War II and the earthquakes, including the calamities it entails such as fire. The minimalist design philosophy did not arrive in Japan by way of another country as it was already part of the Japanese culture rooted on the Zen philosophy. There are those who specifically attribute the design movement to Japan's spirituality and view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Architecture of Minimalism|last=Cerver|first=Francisco|publisher=Arco|year=1997|isbn=9780823061495|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] (1886–1969) adopted the motto "Less is more" to describe his aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Philip Johnson]], op. cit.  A similar sentiment was conveyed by industrial designer Dieter Rams' motto, "Less but better."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tactic was one of arranging the necessary components of a building to create an impression of extreme simplicity—he enlisted every element and detail to serve multiple visual and functional purposes; for example, designing a floor to also serve as the radiator, or a massive fireplace to also house the bathroom. Designer [[Buckminster Fuller]] (1895–1983) adopted the engineer's goal of "Doing more with less", but his concerns were oriented toward technology and engineering rather than aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Johnson]], ''Mies van der Rohe'', [[Museum of Modern Art]], 1947, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Barragán]] is an exemplary modern minimalist designer.{{According to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other contemporary minimalist architects include [[Kazuyo Sejima]], [[John Pawson]], [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], [[Álvaro Siza Vieira]], [[Tadao Ando]], [[Alberto Campo Baeza]], [[Yoshio Taniguchi]], [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Hugh Newell Jacobsen]], Vincent Van Duysen, [[Claudio Silvestrin]], [[Michael Gabellini]], and [[Gluckman Mayner Architects|Richard Gluckman]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006).

==Minimalist architecture and space==
Minimalist architecture became popular in the late 1980s in London and New York,&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; where architects and fashion designers worked together in the boutiques to achieve simplicity, using white elements, cold lighting, large space with minimum objects and furniture.

===Concepts and design elements===
The concept of minimalist architecture is to strip everything down to its essential quality and achieve simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is not completely without ornamentation,&lt;ref name="Rossell"&gt;Rossell (2005), Minimalist Interiors, New York: HapperCollins. p6.&lt;/ref&gt; but that all parts, details, and joinery are considered as reduced to a stage where no one can remove anything further to improve the design.&lt;ref name="Pawson"&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The considerations for ‘essences’ are light, form, detail of material, space, place, and human condition.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalist architects not only consider the physical qualities of the building. They consider the spiritual dimension and the invisible, by listening to the figure and paying attention to  details, people, space, nature, and materials.,&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; believing this reveals the abstract quality of something that is invisible and aids the search for the essence of those invisible qualities—such as natural light, sky, earth, and air. In addition, they "open a dialogue" with the surrounding environment to decide the most essential materials for the construction and create relationships between buildings and sites.&lt;ref name="Rossell"/&gt;

In minimalist architecture, design elements strive to convey the message of simplicity. The basic geometric forms, elements without decoration, simple materials and the repetitions of structures represent a sense of order and essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p8.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of natural light in buildings reveals simple and clean spaces.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"/&gt; In the late 19th century as the arts and crafts movement became popular in Britain, people valued the attitude of ‘truth to materials’ with respect to the profound and innate characteristics of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. P.87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Minimalist architects humbly 'listen to figure,' seeking essence and simplicity by rediscovering the valuable qualities in simple and common materials.&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"/&gt;

===Influences from Japanese tradition===
{{see also|Japanese architecture}}

[[Image:RyoanJi-Dry garden.jpg|thumb|right|Ryōan-ji dry garden.The clay wall, which is stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones, reflects "wabi" and the rock garden "sabi", together reflecting the Japanese worldview or aesthetic of "[[wabi-sabi]]".&lt;ref&gt;森神逍遥 『侘び然び幽玄のこころ』桜の花出版、2015年 Morigami Shouyo, "Wabi sabi yugen no kokoro: seiyo tetsugaku o koeru joi ishiki" (Japanese) {{ISBN|978-4434201424}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]&lt;!-- The size of this image is specified because its default size is a bit too small considering the importance of the garden -- and the details can be more fully appreciated in an enlarged scale. --&gt;

The idea of simplicity appears in many cultures, especially the Japanese traditional culture of Zen Philosophy. Japanese manipulate the Zen culture into aesthetic and design elements for their buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p.85–97.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of architecture has influenced Western Society, especially in America since the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster (September 1953), Japanese Buildings in the United States before 1900: Their Influence upon American Domestic Architecture, The Art Bulletin, vol. 35, no. 3. p217–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it inspired the minimalist architecture in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt;

Zen concepts of simplicity transmit the ideas of freedom and essence of living.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt; Simplicity is not only aesthetic value, it has a moral perception that looks into the nature of truth and reveals the inner qualities and essence of materials and objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p87.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[sand garden]] in [[Ryoanji]] temple demonstrates the concepts of simplicity and the essentiality from the considered setting of a few stones and a huge empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic principle of [[Ma (negative space)|Ma]] refers to empty or open space. It removes all the unnecessary internal walls and opens up the space. The emptiness of spatial arrangement reduces everything down to the most essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic of [[Wabi-sabi]] values the quality of simple and plain objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p85.&lt;/ref&gt; It appreciates the absence of unnecessary features, treasures a life in quietness and aims to reveal the innate character of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Japanese floral art, also known as [[Ikebana]], has the central principle of letting the flower express itself. People cut off the branches, leaves and blossoms from the plants and only retain the essential part of the plant. This conveys the idea of essential quality and innate character in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1.p86.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, far from being just a spatial concept, Ma is ever-present in all aspects of Japanese daily life, as it applies to time as well as to daily tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wawaza.com/pages/when-less-is-more-the-concept-of-japanese-ma.html |title=When Less is More: the Concept of Japanese "MA" |publisher=Wawaza.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist architects and their works===
The Japanese minimalist architect, [[Tadao Ando]] conveys the Japanese traditional spirit and his own perception of nature in his works. His design concepts are materials, pure geometry and nature. He normally uses concrete or natural wood and basic structural form to achieve austerity and rays of light in space. He also sets up dialogue between the site and nature to create relationship and order with the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;96–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Ando’s works and the translation of Japanese aesthetic principles are highly influential on Japanese architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Japanese minimalist architect, [[Kazuyo Sejima]], works on her own and in conjunction with [[Ryue Nishizawa]], as [[SANAA]], producing iconic Japanese Minimalist buildings. Credited with creating and influencing a particular genre of Japanese Minimalism,&lt;ref&gt;Puglisi, L.P. (2008), New Directions in Contermporary Architecture, Chichester, John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Sejimas delicate, intelligent designs may use white color, thin construction sections and transparent elements to create the phenomenal building type often associated with minimalism. Works include [[New Museum]](2010) New York City, Small House (2000) Tokyo, House surrounded By Plum Trees (2003) Tokyo.

In Vitra Conference Pavilion, Weil am Rhein, 1993, the concepts are to bring together the relationships between building, human movement, site and nature. Which as one main point of minimalism ideology that establish dialogue between the building and site. The building uses the simple forms of circle and rectangle to contrast the filled and void space of the interior and nature. In the foyer, there is a large landscape window that looks out to the exterior. This achieves the simple and silence of architecture and enhances the light, wind, time and nature in space.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Pawson]] is a British minimalist architect; his design concepts are soul, light, and order. He believes that though reduced clutter and simplification of the interior to a point that gets beyond the idea of essential quality, there is a sense of clarity and richness of simplicity instead of emptiness. The materials in his design reveal the perception toward space, surface, and volume. Moreover, he likes to use natural materials because of their aliveness, sense of depth and quality of an individual. He is also attracted by the important influences from Japanese Zen Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin Klein Madison Avenue, New York, 1995–96, is a boutique that conveys Calvin Klein’s ideas of fashion. John Pawson’s interior design concepts for this project are to create simple, peaceful and orderly spatial arrangements. He used stone floors and white walls to achieve simplicity and harmony for space. He also emphasises reduction and eliminates the visual distortions, such as the air conditioning and lamps to achieve a sense of purity for interior.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Campo Baeza]] is a Spanish architect and describes his work as essential architecture. He values the concepts of light, idea and space. Light is essential and achieves the relationship between inhabitants and the building. Ideas are to meet the function and context of space, forms, and construction. Space is shaped by the minimal geometric forms to avoid decoration that is not essential.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a residence that the client wanted to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and the stone floors used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary minimalism==
Literary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words and a focus on surface description. Minimalist writers eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning. Readers are expected to take an active role in creating the story, to "choose sides" based on oblique hints and innuendo, rather than react to directions from the writer.

Some 1940s-era crime fiction of writers such as [[James M. Cain]] and [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] adopted a stripped-down, matter-of-fact prose style to considerable effect; some classify this prose style as minimalism.{{Weasel inline|date=November 2011}}

Another strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the [[metafiction]] trend of the 1960s and early 1970s ([[John Barth]], [[Robert Coover]], and [[William H. Gass]]). These writers were also spare with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Minimalist writers, or those who are identified with minimalism during certain periods of their writing careers, include the following: [[Raymond Carver]], [[Ann Beattie]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[K. J. Stevens]], [[Amy Hempel]], [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], [[Tobias Wolff]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Mary Robison]], [[Frederick Barthelme]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Patrick Holland (author)|Patrick Holland]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Alicia Erian]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

American poets such as [[Stephen Crane]], [[William Carlos Williams]], early [[Ezra Pound]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]], and [[Aram Saroyan]] are sometimes identified with their ''minimalist'' style. The term "minimalism" is also sometimes associated with the briefest of poetic genres, [[haiku]], which originated in Japan, but has been domesticated in English literature by poets such as [[Nick Virgilio]], [[Raymond Roseliep]], and [[George Swede]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Irish writer [[Samuel Beckett]] is well known for his minimalist plays and prose, as is the Norwegian writer [[Jon Fosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=Samuel Beckett|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5161|website=Literary Encyclopedia|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''The Easy Chain'', [[Evan Dara]] includes a 60-page section written in the style of musical minimalism, in particular inspired by composer [[Steve Reich]]. Intending to represent the psychological state (agitation) of the novel's main character, the section's successive lines of text are built on repetitive and developing phrases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Minimal music==
{{main article|Minimal music}}

The term "minimal music" was derived around 1970 by [[Michael Nyman]] from the concept of minimalism, which was earlier applied to the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name=Bernard93&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernard|first=Jonathan W.|title=The Minimalist Aesthetic in the Plastic Arts and in Music|journal=Perspectives of New Music|date=1993|volume=31|issue= 1 (Winter)|page=87|jstor=833043}}, citing Dan Warburton as his authority.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warburton88&gt;{{cite web|last=Warburton|first=Dan|title=A Working Terminology for Minimal Music|url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/archives/minimalism.html|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, it was in a 1968 review in ''The Spectator'' that Nyman first used the term, to describe a ten-minute piano composition by the Danish composer [[Henning Christiansen]], along with several other unnamed pieces played by [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Nam June Paik]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Nyman 1968, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Mshatta Facade''' is the decorated part of the [[facade]] of the 8th century [[Umayyad]] residential palace of [[Qasr Mshatta]], one of the [[Desert Castles of Jordan]], which is now installed in the south wing of the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It is part of the permanent exhibition of the [[Pergamon Museum of Islamic Art]] dedicated to [[Islamic art]] from the 8th to the 19th centuries.  This was only a relatively small section of the full length of the facade, surrounding the main entrance; most of the wall was undecorated and remains ''in situ''.

The facade belonged to the Qasr Mshatta or Mshatta palace, which was excavated about 30&amp;nbsp;km south of the contemporary Jordanian capital of [[Amman]]. It is thought to have served as a winter residence and storage halls during the [[Umayyad]] period. The building of the palace probably dates to the era of the [[caliph]] [[Al-Walid II]] (743-744). After Al Walid was murdered, it was left incomplete and later ruined in an [[earthquake]].  The sections of the outer wall remaining ''in situ'' are much plainer.

Unusually for an Umayyad building, the main structures are built from burnt bricks resting on a foundation layer of finely dressed stone; the carved facade is also in stone. The name of the place, Mshatta, is a name used by the modern [[Bedouin]]s in the area, and the original name remains unknown.

The remains of the palace were excavated in 1840. The facade was a gift from the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]]. A large part of it was brought to the then [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] (now the [[Bode Museum]]) in Berlin in 1903. It was reconstructed as a 33 metres long, 5 metres high facade, with two towers, and parts of a central gateway.  In 1932 it was reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum. It was seriously damaged during the Second World War and the bombardment of Berlin. Today, it is one of the most important exhibits of the ''Museum für Islamische Kunst'' in the [[Pergamon Museum]], and a key monument of early [[Islamic art]] and architecture, demonstrating early forms of the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], [[millefleur]] and also animals carved in [[relief]].

There has been much discussion of the fact that the decoration on the left side of the facade contains many animals among the foliar forms, while on the right of the entranceway in the centre there are no animals. It has been suggested that this is because the right-hand side was the outside wall of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ettinghausen, [[Oleg Grabar]] and Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, 2001, ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650-1250'', 50, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-08869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Myths to Live By''''' is a 1972 book, a collection of essays, originally given as lectures at the [[Cooper Union]] Forum, by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]] between 1958 and 1971. The work has an introduction by Johnson E. Fairchild.

The deep power of [[mythology|myth]] on the inner, spiritual lives of human beings throughout the ages (including our own age) is the common theme running throughout all of the essays in the collection. Campbell explains the differences between western and oriental myths and rites. He shows how fundamental universal thoughts are adapted to local requirements of legitimation. A typical form of adaptation of the ''hero'' is the American image of the ''lone rider'' who dispels evil.&lt;ref&gt;Edition London 1985, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debate and public attention ==

=== Support ===

In a 1996 article "Abortion and Fathers' Rights,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven D. Hales|authorlink1=Abortion and Fathers' Rights|editor1-last=Humber|editor1-first=James|title=REPRODUCTION, TECHNOLOGY, AND RIGHTS|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC|isbn=978-1-4757-6403-1|pages=5–26|format=Biomedical Ethics Reviews|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher Steven Hales made an argument that presupposes the following assertions:

# That women have an absolute right to abortion on demand;
# That men and women have equal moral rights and duties and should have equal legal right and duties; and
# That parents have a moral duty to support their children once they are born and legal duties of support should supervene on this moral duty.

Hales contends that the conjunction of these three principles is prima facie inconsistent and that this inconsistency should be eradicated by firstly acknowledging that men have no absolute duty to provide material support for their children, and secondly by admitting that fathers have the right of refusal.

[[Laurie Shrage]], professor of philosophy and women’s and gender studies, questions whether men should be 'penalized for being sexually active', and she puts the subject in the perspective of feminists who had to fight the same idea with different gender portent, namely that consenting to sexual intercourse is not the same as consenting to parenthood. Furthermore, both men and children are punished, according to professor Shrage; children have to live with an absent father who never 'voluntarily' became a parent.&lt;ref name=AnneSophia2016-01-30/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shrage 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Shrage | first=Laurie | title=Is Forced Fatherhood Fair? | website=Opinionator | date=2013-06-12 | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/is-forced-fatherhood-fair/ | accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|if women’s partial responsibility for pregnancy does not obligate them to support a fetus, then men’s partial responsibility for pregnancy does not obligate them to support a resulting child.|Elizabeth Brake in the Journal of Applied Philosophy, 2005&lt;ref name="Shrage 2013" /&gt;}}At most, according to Brake, men should be responsible for helping with the medical expenses and other costs of a pregnancy for which they are partly responsible.

=== Opposition ===
Paper abortion has met opposition by those who see it as an excuse for men to shirk their responsibilities as a father.&lt;ref name=PolitkenA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/profiler/bob/ECE2182043/aldrig-har-maend-udstillet-sig-selv-mere-kaellingeagtigt/|title=Aldrig har mænd udstillet sig selv mere kællingeagtigt|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Never have men exhibited themselves more hag-like }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gudme (2016)"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gudme |first1=Maria |last2=Dyrkjær |first2=Maja Vedel |title=Fædre skal tage ansvar for børn - ikke kræve juridisk abort |trans-title=Fathers must take responsibility for children - does not require legal abortion |language=Danish |date=2016-02-04 |newspaper=[[Politiken]] |department=Debate |url=http://politiken.dk/debat/ECE3050409/faedre-skal-tage-ansvar-for-boern---ikke-kraeve-juridisk-abort/ |access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that men should use birth control (either contraception or sterilization) or practice abstinence if they want to avoid the financial and personal responsibilities of fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/fomo/ECE3050063/stor-guide-saadan-undgaar-du-at-blive-far/|title=Stor guide: Sådan undgår du at blive far|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Great guide: How to avoid becoming a father }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/klummer/amaliekestler/ECE3067223/skyl-juridisk-abort-ud-med-badevandet/|title=Skyl 'juridisk abort' ud med badevandet|website=politiken.dk|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Rinse 'legal abortion' out with the bathwater }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also argue that a father's paper abortion is different from a female abortion since a child is born. Thus the best interests of the child should weigh more than equal opportunity to deny parenthood.{{r|Gudme (2016)}}

== In Scandinavia ==

=== Denmark ===
The concept of a paper abortion was first introduced in Denmark in 2000 by the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomicist]] Henrik Platz. He says that it is necessary from an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] perspective, to ensure that women and men have equal rights under the law. According to a Gallup poll from 2014 and earlier polls, between 40% and 70% of Danes agree with legalizing paper abortion.&lt;ref name=nyheder2016-03-13/&gt;

Sociologist Karen Sjørup, who conducted research on the topic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sjørup|first1=Karen|title=Men´s right to paper abortion – a feminist perspective|url=http://interactingminds.au.dk/events/single-events/artikel/gendering-in-research-talk-by-karen-sjoerup-ruc/|website=Interacting Minds Centre|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that it would give women more freedom by allowing those who want to become mothers without having to share the rights and duties of parenthood with men an additional way to do so. She also suggests that it could decrease the abortion rate because it would prevent men who wished to avoid fatherhood from pressuring women to abort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.information.dk/moti/2016/02/juridisk-abort-god-ting-ogsaa-kvinderne|title=Juridisk abort er en god ting – også for kvinderne|website=Information|language=Danish|access-date=2016-03-14|trans-title=Juridical abortion is a good thing - even for women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates argue that just as women are able to choose whether to have a child or not, men should also be able to choose whether to assume paternity or not. Allowing men to have the opportunity to renounce the economic, social and legal responsibility for an unborn child during the first three months of pregnancy would give men and women as close to equal opportunities as possible.&lt;ref name=AnneSophia2016-01-30&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://annesophia.blogs.berlingske.dk/2016/01/30/skal-maend-have-fri-abort/|title= Skal mænd have fri abort?|website=ASH|access-date=2016-03-14 | language = Danish |trans-title=Should men be free to abort? | author = Anne Sophia Hermansen | date = 2016-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
In 2016, a regional branch of the Swedish Liberal Youth Party decided to support paper abortion for men until the 18th week of pregnancy, the time limit on abortions for women. The proposition was supported by some commentators, but not by the LYP's parent party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Pasqual Maragall Foundation for Research on Alzheimer''' was founded to answer publicly the commitment made by [[Pasqual Maragall]], President of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] (Government of Catalonia 2003–2006) and Mayor of [[Barcelona]] (1982–1997), in October 2007, when he announced that he had been diagnosed with the disease.

The Foundation was established in April 2008, and is led by Dr. [[Jordi Camí]], director and promoter of the [[Barcelona Biomedical Research Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prbb.org/contingut/part00?from_action=eng_part00 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706034255/http://www.prbb.org/contingut/part00?from_action=eng_part00 |archivedate=2007-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation promotes scientific research into the prevention and cure of [[Alzheimer's]] and related [[neurodegenerative]] diseases and aims to create a dedicated scientific research center.

== Future Institute for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases ==
The research center is planned and directed by an international scientific council with the aim of becoming a global benchmark in the field of [[neuroscience]]. The center will host young researchers from around the world, and it will provide them with unrestricted support. The Institute will also lead interdisciplinary teams, risky projects and will be committed to cross-border research programs following the high-risk/high-reward research philosophy.

== International ambition ==
The foundation has established contacts and partnerships with two international centers: the [[Lou Ruvo Brain Institute]] in Las Vegas, headed by Professor Zaven Khachaturian, and the [[Janelia Farm Research Campus]] at the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], in Ashburn, Virginia, United States.

In order to internationalize the project, an American corporation associated with the Foundation was created in September 2008; the Friends of Pasqual Maragall Foundation. This partner aims to deploy an international scientific network and assist in raising resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6276">The '''Philharmonic Society of Corfu''' ({{lang-el|Φιλαρμονική Εταιρεία Κερκύρας}}, ''Philharmonice Ɛtaerɛia Cɛrcyras'', {{IPA-el|filarmoɲiˈci eteˈri.a cerˈciras|pron}}) is today widely known as a community [[Musical ensemble|band]] in [[Corfu|Corfu, Greece]]. However, when it was founded in 1840, its initial scope was to become the first Greek music academy organised on European prototypes. Its first Artistic Director was [[Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros]], who retained this office until his death in 1872. The Philharmonic (PSC) had a fully organised programme of tuition both in [[music]] [[theory]] and practice. Its students, who for the first time in modern Hellenic history could learn music regardless of their social class, had the opportunity to be taught by professional musicians and teachers basic music theory, harmony, counterpoint, instrumentation, composition, as well as piano, vocal music, string and wind instruments.

==History==
[[Image:FEK1920.jpg|thumb|left|The wind-band of the Corfu Philharmonic Society on its premises in 1920. The Music Museum of the Society is situated on the 1st floor of this historic building.]]
The tuition of the latter category found its artistic expression through the wind band of the philharmonic, an ensemble, which became very popular by developing into an integral part of public and religious festivities. Nonetheless, the popularity of the band (which was the fourth civilian band of the [[Ionian Islands]] after those of [[Zante]] (1816), Argostoli (1836) and Lixouri (1838) in [[Kefalonia]]) was so strong, that in the end in the public opinion of Corfu 'band' became synonymous to the 'philharmonic'. This misunderstanding, however, became gradually a reality, especially after the [[Second World War]], mainly because of the financial problems that a non-governmental institution like PSC came across. as well as a result of the shortage of professional teachers.

Nonetheless, it was only in 1907, as well as during the 1930s when the symphonic orchestra of the society performed in the [[Municipal Theatre of Corfu]], to much critical acclaim. The symphonic orchestra of the Philharmonic made sporadic appearances until the early postwar years. Since 2003 the orchestra has again commenced its activities (as a result of the re-organization of the tuition of the string instruments within the Society).

In 1979 [[Maria Desylla-Kapodistria]], former mayor of Corfu and the first female mayor in Greece, bequeathed the Kapodistrias summer home under contract No. 4541/3.11.1979 to the Reading Society of Corfu, the Philharmonic Society of Corfu and the Society of Corfiote Studies for the purpose of converting it to a museum dedicated to the memory of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]. The [[Kapodistrias Museum]], under the stewardship of the three societies, was formally inaugurated in 1981.

The '''Museum of the Corfu Philharmonic Society''', which occupies the first floor of the Society's building (Nikiforou Theotoki 10), opened for the public on September 18, 2010. The Museum attempts to present in brief the history of the institution after almost two centuries of incessant activity (which coincides with some of the most dramatic periods of modern history). Moreover, the Museum honours [[Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros]] (1795–1872), the Society’s first artistic director (1841–1872), composer –among others– of the Greek national anthem, well-known music teacher and contrapuntist, as well as inspirer of a whole generation of composers that shaped the music of Ionian Islands, and not only, during the 19th century.

The Museum of the Corfu Philharmonic Society «Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros» consists of five thematic sections, which present its activities and history:
# Foundation, Administration, Organization: Features historical documents related to the Society’s early days and organization.
#Educational activities: Presents documents and artifacts related to the music pedagogy within the limits of the Society.
#The concerts: The Philharmonic as a concert society for vocal and orchestral music.
#The wind band: Documents, scores, instruments and artifacts related to the repertory and the activities of the Society’s wind band.
#The people and their work: Important composers and teachers, who related themselves through their presence and their works with the history of the Society, as well as with the development of art music in 19th-century Greece. Scores by [[Spyridon Samaras]] (Spiro Samara), [[Pavlos Carrer]] (Paolo Carrer), the Liberali brothers, [[Spyridon Xyndas]], Domenikos Padovanis, Dionissios Rodotheatos, Alexander Grek, Napoleon Lambelet, Andreas Seiler, as well as women composers from Ionian Islands are exhibited in this section.

The Museum also organizes an annual circle of musicological lectures and has initiated a series of musicological publications. It is open Monday to Saturday from 09.30 until 13.30. The entrance is free.

[[File:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|200px|A 12th-century [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] manuscript of the [[Hippocratic oath]].]]
'''Professional ethics'''  encompass the personal, and corporate standards of behavior expected by [[professional]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBAProfessionalServices/ProfessionalConduct/Constitution/CodeOfConduct/2005RIBACodeOfProfessionalConduct.pdf Royal Institute of British Architects - Code of professional conduct] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618044002/http://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBAProfessionalServices/ProfessionalConduct/Constitution/CodeOfConduct/2005RIBACodeOfProfessionalConduct.pdf |date=2013-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word professionalism originally applied to vows of a religious order. By at least the year 1675, the term had seen secular application and was applied to the three learned professions: [[Divinity]], [[Law]], and [[Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.co.wise.tx.us/constable/Downloads/Professionalism%20and%20Ethics.pdf|title = Professionalism and Ethics|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term professionalism was also used for the military profession around this same time.

Professionals and those working in acknowledged professions exercise specialist knowledge and skill. How the use of this knowledge should be governed when providing a service to the public can be considered a moral issue and is termed professional ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Chadwick (1998). Professional Ethics. In E. Craig (Ed.), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. London: Routledge. Retrieved October 20, 2006, from https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/professional-ethics/v-1&lt;/ref&gt;

It is capable of making judgments, applying their skills, and reaching informed decisions in situations that the general public cannot because they have not attained the necessary knowledge and skills.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Whitbeck, "Ethics in Engineering Practice and Research" Cambridge University Press, 1998 page 40&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of professional ethics is the [[Hippocratic oath]] to which medical [[physician|doctors]] still adhere to this day.

==Components==
Some professional organizations may define their ethical approach in terms of a number of discrete components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rics.org/site/download_feed.aspx?fileID=6309&amp;fileExtension=PDF RICS- MAINTAINING PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216090731/http://www.rics.org/site/download_feed.aspx?fileID=6309&amp;fileExtension=PDF |date=2011-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically these include:
*[[Honesty]]
*[[Integrity]]
*[[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]]
*[[Accountability]]
*[[Confidentiality]]
*[[Objectivity (journalism)|Objectivity]]
*[[Respect]]
*[[Legal|Obedience to the law]]
*[[Loyalty]]

==Implementation==
Most professionals have internally enforced codes of practice that members of the profession must follow to prevent [[wikt:exploitation|exploitation]] of the client and to preserve the integrity of the profession. This is not only for the benefit of the client but also for the benefit of those belonging to that profession. Disciplinary codes allow the profession to define a standard of conduct and ensure that individual practitioners meet this standard, by disciplining them from the professional body if they do not practice accordingly. This allows those professionals who act with a conscience to practice in the knowledge that they will not be undermined commercially by those who have fewer ethical qualms. It also maintains the public’s trust in the profession, encouraging the public to continue seeking their services.

===Internal regulation===
In cases where professional bodies regulate their own ethics, there are possibilities for such bodies to become self-serving and fail to follow their own ethical code when dealing with renegade members.  This is particularly true of professions in which they have almost a complete monopoly on a particular area of knowledge. For example, until recently, the English courts deferred to the professional consensus on matters relating to their practice that lay outside case law and legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Brazier, ‘’Medicine, Patients and the Law’’, Penguin, 1987 page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory regulation==
In many countries there is some statutory regulation of professional ethical standards such as the [[statutory body|statutory bodies]] that regulate [[nursing]] and [[midwife]]ry in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/annex_a/chapter_4_15.htm The Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry-Professional regulation - nursing: the UKCC ] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729062133/http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/annex_a/chapter_4_15.htm |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to comply with these standards can thus become a matter for the courts.

==Examples==
For example, a lay member of the public should not be held responsible for failing to act to save a [[car crash]] victim because they could not give an appropriate [[emergency treatment]]. Though, they are responsible for attempting to get help for the victim. This is because they do not have the relevant knowledge and experience. In contrast, a fully trained doctor (with the correct equipment) would be capable of making the correct [[diagnosis]] and carrying out appropriate procedures. Failure of a doctor to not help at all in such a situation would generally be regarded as [[negligent]] and [[unethical]]. Though, if a doctor helps and makes a mistake that is considered negligent and unethical, there could be [[wikt:egregious|egregious]] repercussions. An untrained person would only be considered to be negligent for failing to act if they did nothing at all to help and is protected by the [[Good Samaritan law|"Good Samaritan" laws]] if they unintentionally caused more damage and possible loss of life.

A business may approach a professional engineer to certify the safety of a project which is not safe. While one engineer may refuse to certify the project on moral grounds, the business may find a less [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scrupulous scrupulous] engineer who will be prepared to certify the project for a [[bribe]], thus saving the business the expense of redesigning.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Davis, ‘Thinking like an Engineer’ in Philosophy and Public Affairs, 20.2 (1991) page 158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separatism===
On a theoretical level, there is debate as to whether an ethical code for a profession should be consistent with the requirements of morality governing the public. Separatists argue that professions should be allowed to go beyond such confines when they judge it necessary. This is because they are trained to produce certain outcomes which may take moral precedence over other functions of society.&lt;ref name=Gewirth&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|282}} For example, it could be argued that a doctor may lie to a patient about the severity of his or her condition if there is reason to believe that telling the patient would cause so much distress that it would be [[detrimental]] to his or her health. This would be a disrespect of the patient's [[autonomy]], as it denies the patient information that could have a great impact on his or her life. This would generally be seen as morally wrong. However, if the end of improving and maintaining health is given a moral priority in society, then it may be justifiable to [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contravene contravene] other moral demands in order to meet this goal.&lt;ref name=Gewirth/&gt;{{rp|284}} Separatism is based on a relativist conception of morality that there can be different, equally valid, moral codes that apply to different sections of society and differences in codes between societies (see [[moral relativism]]). If [[moral universalism]] is ascribed to, then this would be inconsistent with the view that professions can have a different moral code, as the universalist holds that there is only one valid moral code for all.&lt;ref name=Gewirth/&gt;{{rp|285}}.

==Student ethics==
As attending college after high school graduation becomes a standard in the lives of young people, [[colleges]] and [[universities]] are becoming more business-like in their expectations of the students.  Although people have differing opinions about if it is effective, surveys state that it is the overall goal of the university administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Colleges Preparing Students For The Workplace|url=http://www.thecollegesolution.com/are-colleges-preparing-students-for-the-workplace}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Setting up a business-like atmosphere helps students get adjusted from a more relaxed nature, like high school, towards what will be expected of them in the business world upon graduating from College.

===Codes of conduct===
Codes of conduct, such as the St. Xavier Code of Conduct, are becoming more a staple in the academic lives of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SXU Code of Conduct|url=http://www.sxu.edu/academics/resources/cie/conduct.asp|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of these rules are based solely on academics others are more in depth than in previous years. Such as, detailing the level of respect expected towards staff and gambling.

Not only do codes of conduct apply while attending the schools at home, but also while studying abroad. Schools also implement a code of conduct for international study abroad programs which carry over many of the same rules found in most student handbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Conduct|url=http://handbook.sxu.edu/Student/Code_Conduct/student_conduct.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gorn-1922.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Gorn'' (Furnace), an official organ of Proletkult]]
'''Proletkult''' ({{lang-rus|Пролетку́льт|p=prəlʲɪtˈkulʲt}}), a [[portmanteau]] of the Russian words "proletarskaya kultura" ([[proletarian culture]]), was an experimental Soviet artistic institution that arose in conjunction with the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917. This organization, a federation of local cultural societies and [[avant-garde]] artists, was most prominent in the visual, literary, and [[drama]]tic fields. Proletkult aspired to radically modify existing artistic forms by creating a new, revolutionary [[working class|working-class]] aesthetic, which drew its inspiration from the construction of modern industrial society in backward, agrarian Russia.

Although funded by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] of [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]], the Proletkult organization sought autonomy from state control, a demand which brought it into conflict with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] hierarchy and the Soviet state bureaucracy. Some top party leaders, such as [[V.I. Lenin]], sought to concentrate state funding on the basic education of the working class rather than on whimsical artistic endeavors. He and others also saw in Proletkult a hotbed of [[bourgeois]] intellectuals and potential political oppositionists.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

At its peak in 1920, Proletkult had 84,000 members actively enrolled in about 300 local studios, clubs, and factory groups, with an additional 500,000 members participating in its activities on a more casual basis.

== History ==

=== Factional background ===
[[File:A A Bogdanov.jpg|thumb|[[Bolshevik]] philosopher [[Alexander Bogdanov]], one of the founding fathers of the Proletkult movement]]

The earliest roots of the Proletarian Culture movement, better known as Proletkult, are found in the aftermath of the failed [[Revolution of 1905|1905-1907 Revolution]] against [[Nicholas II of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Culture of the Future: The Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1990; pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[censorship]] apparatus of the Tsarist regime had stumbled briefly during the upheaval, broadening horizons, but the revolution had ultimately failed, resulting in dissatisfaction and second-guessing, even within [[Bolshevik Party]] ranks.

In the aftermath of the Tsar's reassertion of authority a radical political tendency known as the "[[Left Bolsheviks]]" emerged, stating their case in opposition to party leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref name=Mally4&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  This group, which included such luminaries as philosophers [[Alexander Bogdanov]] and [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] and writer [[Maxim Gorky]], argued that the [[intelligentsia]]-dominated Bolsheviks must begin following more inclusive tactics and working to develop more [[working class]] political activists to assume leadership roles in the next round of anti-Tsarist revolution.&lt;ref name=Mally4 /&gt;

Among the Left Bolsheviks, Anatoly Lunacharsky in particular had been intrigued with the possibility of making use of art as a means to inspire revolutionary political action.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, together with the celebrated Gorky, Lunacharsky hoped to found a "human religion" around the idea of [[socialism]], motivating individuals to serve a greater good outside of their own narrow self-interests.&lt;ref name=Mally5&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working along similar lines simultaneously was Lunacharsky's brother-in-law Bogdanov, who even in 1904 had published a weighty philosophical tome called ''Empiriomonism'' which attempted to integrate the ideas of non-Marxist thinkers [[Ernst Mach]] and [[Richard Avenarius]] into the socialist edifice.&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;  (Lunacharsky had studied under Avenarius in Zurich and was responsible for introducing Bogdanov to his ideas.)  Bogdanov believed that the socialist society of the future would require forging a fundamentally new perspective of the role of science, ethics, and art with respect to the individual and the state.&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;

Together all these ideas of Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Gorky, and their co-thinkers came to be known in the language of the day as "god-building" ''(bogostroitel'stvo).''&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;

These ideas did not exist in a vacuum; there was a political component as well. During the period between the failure of the 1905 revolution and the outbreak of [[World War I]], Alexander Bogdanov stood as the chief rival to Lenin for leadership of the Bolshevik party.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks: Lenin and His Critics.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1986; pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the intellectually rigid Lenin, Bogdanov was not only a political rival, but also a positive threat to the [[ideology]] of [[Marxism]]. Lenin saw Bogdanov and the "god-building" movement with which he was associated as purveyors of a reborn [[Idealism|philosophical idealism]] that stood in diametrical opposition to the fundamental [[materialism|materialist]] foundation of Marxism. So disturbed was Lenin that he spent much of 1908 combing more than 200 books to pen a thick polemical volume in reply — ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism|Materialism and Empirio-Criticism: Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy]].''&lt;ref&gt;For ''Materialism and Empirio-Criticism,'' see: V.I. Lenin, ''Collected Works: Volume 14.'' Abraham Fineberg, trans. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1962; pp. 17-361. Details of Lenin's writing process may be found in the same volume, page 366, footnote 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin ultimately emerged triumphant in the struggle for hegemony of the Bolshevik faction. Relations between them in Western European exile remained tense. During the first decade of the 20th Century Bogdanov wrote two works of [[utopianism|utopian]] [[science fiction]] about socialist societies on [[Mars]], both of which were rejected by Lenin as attempts to smuggle "Machist idealism" into the radical movement.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pp. 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these, a book called ''Engineer Menni'' (1913), was pronounced by Lenin to be "so vague that neither a worker nor a stupid editor at ''Pravda'' [a rival publication] could understand it."&lt;ref name=Williams170&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 Bogdanov, a student of the [[Scientific management|Taylor system]] of factory work-flow rationalization, published a massive work on the topic, ''General Organizational Science,'' which Lenin liked no better.&lt;ref name="Williams170"/&gt;

The pair went their separate ways, with Bogdanov dropping out of radical politics at the end of 1913, returning home with his wife to [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later be reinvigorated by the course of events to become a leading figure in the Moscow Proletkult organization — a fact which emphasizes the tension between that organization and state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally argues that this traditional emphasis on Alexander Bogdanov as the "best known leader" of Proletkult helps obscure the fact that Proletkult's ongoing battle for "autonomy" ''(samostoiatel'nost')'' was in essence a fight with the state bureaucracy rather than the Communist Party, per se. See: Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The birth of Proletkult===
[[File:Moscow SpiridonovkaStreet Morozova Palace 01-2017.jpg|thumb|right|Morozova Palace, home of Proletkult]]
====Preliminary conference====
[[File:Anatoly Lunacharsky.jpg|thumb|left|Anatoly Lunacharsky, a founding father of the Proletkult organization, was People's Commissar of Education of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1929.]]

The [[February Revolution|February Revolution of 1917]] which overthrew the Tsarist regime came comparatively easily. So, too, did the [[October Revolution]] which followed, events which overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] and brought Lenin and the Bolsheviks to the seat of power. The [[Russian Civil War]] was another matter altogether — a long and brutal struggle which strained every sinew.

The radical intelligentsia of Russia was mobilized by these events. Anatoly Lunacharsky, who had briefly broken with Lenin and the Bolshevik Party to become a [[newspaper correspondent]] in [[France]] and [[Italy]], returned to Russia in May 1917 and rejoined the party in August.&lt;ref name=Fitz310&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment: Soviet Organization of Education and the Arts under Lunacharsky.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1970; pg. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the October Revolution, Lunacharsky was appointed Commissar of Education of the new regime.&lt;ref name=Fitz310 /&gt;

Lunacharsky's factional ally, Alexander Bogdanov, remained sharply critical of Lenin and his political tactics and never rejoined the Communist Party, however.&lt;ref name=Fitz295&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he served at the front as a doctor during World War I, returning home to Moscow in 1917 and becoming involved there as a founder of the Proletarian Culture organization, Proletkult.&lt;ref name=Fitz295 /&gt;

The aim of unifying the cultural and educational activities of the Russian labour movements first occurred at the Agitation Collegium of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet which met on 19 July 1917 with 120 participants. It was attended by many different currents, and when the [[Menshevik]] Dementiev suggested that the meeting just be confined to public lectures and that the [[Bolsheviks]] should be excluded, but this was soundly rejected. Consequently, the Central Council of [[Factory committee|Factory Committee]]s was instructed to work with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] to organise a second conference of "proletarian cultural-educational organizations" to bring them together in a centralized organization.&lt;ref name=Fitz89&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; A first conference of these groups was held in [[Petrograd]] from October 16 to 19, 1917 &lt;small&gt;(O.S.)&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Fitz89 /&gt; The conclave was called by Lunacharsky in his role as head of the Cultural-Educational Commission of the Petrograd Bolshevik organization and was attended by 208 delegates representing Petrograd trade unions, factory committees, army and youth groups, city and regional dumas, as well as the Petrograd Committee of the Bolshevik and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionary]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

This October 1917 conference elected a Central Committee of Proletarian Cultural-Educational Organizations of Petrograd which included among its members Lunacharsky, Lenin's wife [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], talented young journalist [[Larisa Reisner]], and a long-time [[Vpered]] associate of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky named [[Fedor Kalinin]], among others.&lt;ref name=Fitz90&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Also playing a key role was [[Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii]], another former member of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky's émigré political group.&lt;ref name=Fitz306&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these would be catapulted into leading roles in the People's Commissariat of Education following the Bolshevik seizure of power which followed less than two weeks later.&lt;ref name=Fitz90 /&gt;

====After the Bolshevik seizure of state power====

Nikitin, Vasili Ignatov Standing from left to right: [[Stefan Krivtsov]], [[Karl Ozol-Prednek]], Anna Dodonova, N. M. Vasilevskii, [[Vladimir Kirillov]]]]
The October Revolution led to a marked increase in the number of new cultural organizations and informal groups.&lt;ref name=Mally33&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs and cultural societies sprung up affiliated with newly empowered factories, unions, cooperatives, and [[soviet (council)|workers' and soldiers' councils]], in addition to similar groups attached to more formal institutions such as the [[Red Army]], the Communist Party, and [[Komsomol|its youth section]].&lt;ref name=Mally33 /&gt; The new government of Soviet Russia was quick to understand that these rapidly proliferating clubs and societies offered a potentially powerful vehicle for the spread of the radical political, economic, and social theories it favored.&lt;ref name=Mally33 /&gt;

The chief cultural authority of the Soviet state was its People's Commissariat of Education ([[Narkompros]]), a bureaucratic apparatus which quickly came to include no fewer than 17 different departments.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky, this organization sought to expand adult literacy and to establish a broad and balanced general school curricula, in opposition to pressure from the trade unions and the [[Supreme Council of National Economy]], which sought to give preference to [[vocational education]].&lt;ref name=Mally35&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The as-yet loosely organized Proletkult movement emerged as another potential competitor to the primacy of Narkompros.

This confusing welter of competing institutions and organizations was by no means unique to the cultural field, as historian Lynn Mally has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All early Soviet institutions struggled against what was called 'parallelism,' the duplication of services by competing bureaucratic systems. The revolution raised difficult questions about governmental organization that were only slowly answered during the first years of the regime. Political activists disputed the authority of the central state, the role of the Communist Party within it, and the influence national agencies should wield over local groups. Altercations over scarce resources and institutional authority were intertwined with theoretical debates over the ideal structure of the new policy."&lt;ref name=Mally34&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, in the early revolutionary period control over local institutions by the central government of the Soviet state was weak, with factory workers often ignoring their trade unions and teachers the curriculum instructions of central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; In this political environment any centrally-devised scheme for a division of authority between Narkompros and the federated artistic societies of Proletkult remained largely a theoretical exercise. In the early days of the Bolshevik regime the local apparatus of Proletkult retained the most powerful hand.&lt;ref name=Mally36&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With its adherent Anatoly Lunacharsky at the helm of Narkompros, the Proletkult movement had an important patron with considerable influence over state policy and the purse. This did not mean an easy relationship between these institutions, however. Early in 1918 leaders of Petrograd Proletkult refused to cooperate with an effort by Narkompros to form a citywide theatre organization, declaring their refusal to work with non-proletarian theatre groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow Proletkult, in which Alexander Bogdanov played a leading role, attempted to extend its independent sphere of control even further than the Petrograd organization, addressing questions of food distribution, hygiene, vocational education, and issuing a call for establishment of a proletarian university at its founding convention in February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Some hardliners in the Proletkult organization even insisted that Proletkult be recognized as the "ideological leader of all public education and enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Vasilii Ignatov, writing in ''Griadushchee'' (The Future) 1918, no. 4 (April 1918), pg. 15. Quoted in Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, the vision of Proletkult as the rival and guiding light of Narkompros fell by the wayside, subdued by the Proletkult's financial reliance on the Commissariat for operational funding.&lt;ref name=Mally44&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Proletkult received a budget of 9.2 million gold rubles for the first half of 1918 — nearly one-third of the entire budget for Narkompros's Adult Educational Division.&lt;ref name=Mally44 /&gt; Requisitioned buildings were put to the organization's use, with the Petrograd organization receiving a large and posh facility located on one of the city's main thoroughfares, [[Nevsky Prospect]] — the name of which was actually changed to "Proletkult Street" ''(Ulitsa Proletkul'ta)'' in the organization's honor.&lt;ref name=Mally44 /&gt;

Mayakovsky makes use of stencil, simple agitational poetry, and primitive workerist graphics to create an almost [[folk art]] effect.]]

While the Proletkult movement began as independent groups in Petrograd (October 1917) and Moscow (February 1918), it was not long before the group's patrons in the Soviet state intervened to help forge a national organization.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet government itself moved from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918 and the center of Proletkult's own organizational gravity shifted simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Mally45&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lines became blurred between the Proletkult organization and the Division for Proletarian Culture of the People's Commissariat of Education, headed by Proletkult activist Fyodor Kalinin.&lt;ref name=Mally45 /&gt; While the organization retained its staunch supporters in the Narkompros apparatus seeking to coordinate activities, it also contained no small number of activists like Alexander Bogdanov who tried to promote the organization as an independent cultural institution with a homogeneous working class constituency.&lt;ref name=Mally45 /&gt;

In September 1918 the first national conference of Proletkult was convened in Moscow, including 330 delegates and 234 guests from local organizations from around Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; While no delegate list has survived, the stenogram of the conference indicates that the bulk of attendees hailed from trade unions, factory organizations, cooperatives, and workers' clubs.&lt;ref name=Mally46&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates were split between those favoring an autonomous and leading role for the organization in general education in Soviet society and those who favored a more narrow focus for the group as a subordinate part of the Narkompros bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

While those favoring autonomy were in the majority at the first national conference, the ongoing problem of organizational finance remained a real one, as historian Lynn Mally has observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Although the Proletkult was autonomous, it still expected Narkompros to foot the bills. The government would supply the central Proletkult with a subsidy, to be distributed among provincial affiliates. But because financial dependence on the state clearly contradicted the organization's claims to independence, the central leaders held out the hope that their affiliates would soon discover their own means of support."&lt;ref name=Mally48&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proletkult and its desire for autonomy also had another powerful patron in the person of [[Nikolai Bukharin]], editor of ''[[Pravda]].''&lt;ref name=Fitz94&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Bukharin provided favorable coverage for Proletkult during the organization's formative period, welcoming the idea that the group represented a "laboratory of pure proletarian ideology" with a legitimate claim to independence from Soviet governmental control.&lt;ref name=Fitz94 /&gt;

Proletkult made use of different organizational forms. In large industrial cities, the organization set up an elaborate bureaucratic apparatus resembling that of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Fitz98&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow Proletkult, for example, had departments for literary publishing, theatre, music, art, and clubs.&lt;ref name=Fitz98 /&gt; In addition to this central bureaucracy, Proletkult established factory cells attached to the highly concentrated mills and manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref name=Fitz98 /&gt; Finally, Proletkult established "studios" — independent facilities in which workers learned and developed the techniques of the various arts.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narkompros, for its part, sought to influence Proletkult to concentrate its efforts upon the expansion of the network of studios.&lt;ref name=Fitz99&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1919 People's Commissar of Education Lunacharsky declared that Proletkult "should concentrate all its attention on studio work, on the discovery and encouragement of original talent among the workers, on the creation of circles of writers, artists, and all kinds of young scholars from the working class..."&lt;ref&gt;A. Lunacharsky, "Once Again on Proletkult and Soviet Cultural Organizations," ''Izvestiia VTsIK,'' No. 80 (April 13, 1919), pg. 2. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proletkult and its studios and clubs gained a certain measure of popularity among a broad segment of the urban Russian population, particularly factory workers.&lt;ref name=Siegelbaum&gt;Lewis H. Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1992; pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1918 the organization counted 147 local affiliates, although the actual number of functioning units was probably somewhat fewer.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 51. See especially footnote 57 on that page.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of the organization's strength in 1920, Proletkult claimed a total of 84,000 members in 300 local groups, with an additional 500,000 more casual followers.&lt;ref&gt;Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929,'' pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 15 different Proletkult periodicals were produced over the course of the organization's short existence,&lt;ref name=Maguire157&gt;Robert A. Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil: Soviet Literature in the 1920s.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1968; pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; including most importantly ''Proletarskaia kultura'' (Proletarian Culture — 1918 to 1921) and ''Gorn'' (Furnace — 1918 to 1923).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/litenc/encyclop/le9/le9-5192.htm "Пролеткульт,"] (Proletkult). Fundamental Electronic Library of Russian Literature and Folklore, feb-web.ru/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideology===

Historically the relationship between the Russian liberal [[intelligentsia]] and the working class was that of teacher and student.&lt;ref name=CultFront19&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1992; pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation presumed a "higher" level of culture on the part of the aristocratic teachers — an accepted premise of the Bolsheviks themselves during the pre-revolutionary period.&lt;ref name=CultFront19 /&gt;

Under Marxist theory, however, culture was conceived as a part of the [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] associated with the dominant class in society — in the Russian instance, that of the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name=CultFront20&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a workers' state, some [[theoretician (Marxism)|Marxist theoreticians]] believed, the new proletarian ruling class would develop its own distinct class culture to supplant the former culture of the old ruling order.&lt;ref name=CultFront20 /&gt; Proletkult was seen as a primary vehicle for the development of this new "proletarian culture."

The nature and function of Proletkult was described by [[Platon Kerzhentsev]], one of the movement's top leaders in 1919:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The task of the 'Proletkults' is the development of an independent proletarian spiritual culture, including all areas of the human spirit — science, art, and everyday life. The new socialist epoch must produce a new culture, the foundations of which are already being laid. This culture will be the fruit of the creative efforts of the working class and will be entirely independent. Work on behalf of proletarian culture should stand on a par with the political and economic struggle of the working class.

"But in creating its own culture, the working class by no means should reject the rich cultural heritage of the past, the material and spiritual achievements, made by classes which are alien and hostile to the proletariat. The proletarian must look it over critically, choose what is of value, elucidate it with his own point of view, use it with a view to producing his own culture. *  *  *

"This work on a new culture ought to proceed along a completely independent path. 'Proletkults' should be class-restricted, workers' organizations, completely autonomous in their activities."&lt;ref&gt;V. Kerzhentsev, ''Oktiabr'skii perevorot i diktatura proletariata'' (The October Overturn and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat). Moscow: 1919;  pp. 154-161. Reprinted in William G. Rosenberg (ed.), ''Bolshevik Visions: First Phase of the Cultural Revolution in Soviet Russia.'' Second Edition. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1990; pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proletkult's theorists generally espoused a hardline [[economic determinism]], arguing that only purely working class organizations were capable of advancing the cause of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; An early editorial from the official Proletkult journal ''Proletarskaia Kultura'' (Proletarian Culture) demanded that "the proletariat start right now, immediately, to create its own ''socialist forms of thought, feeling, and daily life,'' independent of alliances or combinations of political forces."&lt;ref&gt;"From the Editors," ''Proletarskaia Kul'tura,'' 1918, no. 3 (March 1918), pg. 36. Emphasis in original. Quoted in Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Alexander Bogdanov and other Proletkult theoreticians, the arts were not the province of a specially gifted elite, but rather were the physical output of individuals with a set of learned skills.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt; All that was required, it was assumed, was for one to study basic artistic technique in a very few lessons, after which anyone was capable of becoming a proletarian artist.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt; The movement by Proletkult to establish a network of studios in which workers could enroll was seen as an essential part of training this new cohort of proletarian artists.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt;

Despite the organization's rhetoric about its proletarian exclusivity, however, the movement was guided by intellectuals throughout its entire brief history, with its efforts to promote workers from the bench to leadership positions largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929,'' pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on the various arts===

====Literature====

Proletkult expended great energy in attempting to launch a wave of worker-poets, with only limited artistic success. The insistence upon developing new poets of questionable talent led to a split of the Proletkult in 1919, when a large group of young writers, most of whom were poets, broke from the organization due to what they believed to be a stifling of individual creative talent.&lt;ref name=Maguire158&gt;Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil,'' pg. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

These defectors from Proletkult initially formed a small, elite organization called Kuznitza (The Forge) before again launching a new [[mass organization]] known as the [[All-Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]] (VAPP) a year later.&lt;ref name=Maguire158 /&gt;

====Theater====
{{main|Proletcult Theatre}}
The Proletkult organizations of Petrograd and Moscow controlled their own dramatic theatrical network, including under its umbrella a number of smaller city clubs maintaining their own theatrical studios.&lt;ref name=Acts31&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Revolutionary Acts: Amateur Theater and the Soviet State, 1917-1938.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2000; pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrograd Proletkult opened a large central studio early in 1918 which staged a number of new and experimental works with a view to inspiring similar performances in other amateur theaters around the city.&lt;ref name=Acts31 /&gt; Moscow Proletkult opened its own central theater several months later.&lt;ref name=Acts31 /&gt;

Proletkult constituted the leading center of a radical minority within the theatrical community of the day which aspired to promote so-called "proletarian theater."&lt;ref name=Acts22&gt;Mally, ''Revolutionary Acts,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of this new form was defined in one early conference resolution as "the task of workers themselves, along with those peasants who are willing to accept their ideology."&lt;ref name=Acts22 /&gt; Conventional modes of performance were discouraged, in favor of unconventional stagings designed to promote "mass action" — including public processions, festivals, and social dramas.&lt;ref name=Acts22 /&gt;

===Contemporary criticism===

Artists in the Proletkult movement, while not by any means a homogeneous bloc, were influenced to a great extent by the [[iconoclasm]], technological orientation, and revolutionary enthusiasm bound up in the thematic movements of the day, [[Russian futurism|futurism]] and [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].&lt;ref name=Fitz100&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite lip service paid to classical forms of poetry, drama, writing, sculpture, and painting, strong encouragement was given to the use of new techniques and forms in so-called "proletarian art," including the use of photography, cinematography, and collage.&lt;ref name=Fitz100 /&gt;

This commitment to experimentalism drew the fire of those party leaders who preferred more classical modes of artistic expression. Petrograd Communist Party leader [[Grigory Zinoviev]]  took the lead at a conference of "proletarian writers" held in that city in the fall of 1919, declaring that while previously "we allowed the most nonsensical futurism to get a reputation almost as the official school of Communist art" and let "doubtful elements attach themselves to our Proletkults."&lt;ref name=Zin&gt;Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; it was henceforth "time to put an end to this," Zinoviev demanded.&lt;ref name=Zin /&gt;

Also among those critical of the Proletkult movement and its vision to create a wholly new proletarian culture was top Soviet party leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. At a public speech in May 1919 Lenin declared any notions of so-called "proletarian culture" to be "fantasies" which he opposed with "ruthless hostility."&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniia: Tom 38, Mart—Iiun' 1919.'' Moscow: Politizdat, 1969; pp. 368-369. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, Lenin had profound misgivings about the entire institution of Proletkult, viewing it as (in historian [[Sheila Fitzpatrick|Sheila Fitzpatrick's]] words) "an organization where futurists, idealists, and other undesirable bourgeois artists and intellectuals addled the minds of workers who needed basic education and culture..."&lt;ref name=CultFront22&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin also may have had political misgivings about the organization as a potential base of power for his long-time rival [[Alexander Bogdanov]] or for ultra-radical [[Left communism|"Left Communists"]] and the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] dissidents who comprised the [[Workers' Opposition]].&lt;ref name=CultFront22 /&gt;

===Dissolution===
[[File:Vintage Potemkin.jpg|thumb|The ethic of Proletkult is found in the early cinematic works of Sergei Eisenstein. This promotional poster for his 1926 film ''The Battleship Potemkin'' making use of indistinct masses of people and diagonal lines is exemplary of [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].]]

By the fall of 1920 it became increasingly clear that the Soviet regime would emerge from the Russian Civil War victorious. With fall of the [[White movement|Whites]], a common enemy which united disparate factions around the Soviet banner, much unity was loosened. Dissident groups such as the so-called Workers' Opposition and the [[Group of Democratic Centralism|Democratic Centralists]] emerged in the Communist Party, widespread dissatisfaction among the [[peasantry]] over forced grain requisitioning resulted in isolated uprisings. All of these factors prompted a wave of debate about the institutions that had sprung up in Soviet society during wartime, including Proletkult.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its short history, Proletkult had sought both autonomy from state control and hegemony in the cultural field. This had created a substantial number of critics and rivals. These included leaders of the Soviet trade union movement, who saw the management of workers' cultural opportunities as part of their own purview; local Communist Party committees, which sought centralization under their own direction rather than a hode-podge of autonomous civic institutions; and the People's Commissariat of Education (Narkompros), which believed its own mission included the cultural training of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Narkompros proved the most outspoken and unyielding in its criticism.&lt;ref name=Mally197&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1918 [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] — the wife of Vladimir Lenin — had sought to reign in Proletkult and integrate it under the agency in which she herself played a leading role, the Adult Education Division of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally197 /&gt; A May 1919 conference of adult education workers had, spurred on by Krupskaya, determined that Proletkult was an adult education agency owing to its studio system, and therefore rightfully part of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally197 /&gt;

Bureaucratic wrangling between top leaders of Proletkult and the Adult Education Division of Narkompros had produced a working agreement in the summer of 1919 bringing Proletkult formally under the auspices of the latter, albeit with its own separate budget.&lt;ref name=Mally198&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; This proved, however, to be a stop-gap and institutional conflict remained.&lt;ref name=Mally198 /&gt;

Proletkult leaders subsequently made an effort to expand their movement on an international basis at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|2nd World Congress of the Communist International]] in August 1920, founding [[Kultintern]], an international organization headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky.&lt;ref name=Mally200&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's grandiose vision and practical efforts to expand the Proletkult movement globally was particularly concerning to Lenin, himself a man of staid and traditional cultural tastes who had already come to see Proletkult as utopian and wasteful.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 199, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred to action by Lenin, in the fall of 1920 the governing Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) &lt;!---this is the correct name and capitalization for the organization---&gt; began to take an active interest in the relationship of Proletkult with other Soviet institutions for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mally198 /&gt; Lenin sought and obtained information from [[M. N. Pokrovsky|M.N. Pokrovsky]], second in command at Narkompros, and top Proletkult leaders about the organization's budget and semi-independent status and pushed through a decision to absorb Proletkult into Narkompros to end the situation of parallelism once and for all.&lt;ref name=Mally201&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The already scheduled National Congress of Proletkult, held in Moscow from October 5 to 12, 1920, was to be the occasion for the announcement.&lt;ref name=Mally201 /&gt; While Lunacharsky, head of Narkompros but a patron of Proletkult and its interests, dragged his feet on the merger, the congress eventually — following long debate and a stern appeal to party discipline — formally approved the Central Committee's decision to directly integrate Proletkult into Narkompros.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The integration was not a smooth one, however, and Proletkult activists fought to the last ditch to retain organizational autonomy even within Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally203&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Committee reacted with a scathing decree denouncing Proletkult that was published in ''Pravda'' on December 1, 1920.

===Legacy===

Despite its formal termination as an organization, the Proletkult movement continued to influence and inform early Soviet culture. Historian Peter Kenez has noted the heavy influence of the Proletkult ethic in the work of pioneer Soviet filmmaker [[Sergei Eisenstein]], director of the classic films ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925), ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1926), and ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' (1927):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The intellectual content of [Eisenstein's] early films was profoundly influenced by his earlier association with Proletkult, a complex politicocultural movement that reached the height of its influence during the revolutionary period.... [Its leaders] argued that the new, socialist culture would be profoundly different from what it replaced. In their view there could be no accommodation with the old world; the proletariat on the basis of its experience would create a new culture that would reflect the spirit of the collective. It followed that the new art had to emphasize not the accomplishments of individuals but those of the workers and peasants. Eisenstein was attracted to this movement because it justified the necessity of a complete break with the art of the '[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]' world. All of his early films expressed, though in his own idiom, the ideology of Proletkult."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kenez, ''Cinema and Soviet Society, 1917-1953.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992; pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''reference scenario''' is an imagined situation where a [[library]] patron brings a question to a [[librarian]] and there is then a conversation, called in the field a [[reference interview]], where the librarian works to help the patron find what he or she wants.  These scenarios are used in training future librarians how to help patrons.  Basically, a scenario is as short as a couple of sentences, including a question and a situation that underlies that question.

A great deal of reference teaching puts students to researching the answers to made-up questions.  This focuses the student on learning about the reference sources at hand by using them to answer those questions.  Scenarios are something different.  They focus the student on the interaction with patrons.  In class practice sessions, one student can be the patron and the other the librarian, as long as the one practicing as the librarian doesn't know the whole scenario in advance.

Scenarios are valued because often the question asked is not the end of the patron's information hunt, but the start.  Patrons often start by voicing a question that they think the library can answer, rather than the question they are really seeking to answer.  Or they pose a question that the librarian doesn't understand.  Reference librarian skills are very much about mediating a gap between what the patron wants and what the library can provide.  This can involve the librarian making him or herself a partner in the patron's search, teaching them what the library really has to offer, or even just clarifying a confusing word: Does the patron want information about soaps to clean with or soaps as in soap operas?

A '''sediment control''' is a practice or device designed to keep [[erosion|eroded]] [[soil]] on a [[construction]] site, so that it does not wash off and cause [[water pollution]] to a nearby stream, river, lake, or sea. Sediment controls are usually employed together with [[erosion control]]s, which are designed to prevent or minimize erosion and thus reduce the need for sediment controls.  Sediment controls are generally designed to be temporary measures, however, some can be used for storm water management purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Erosions and Sediment Control|year=2010|publisher=Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active treatment systems==
Chemical treatment of sediment, commonly called an '''active treatment system,''' is a relatively new form of sediment control for the construction industry.  It is designed to reduce [[turbidity]] in nearby water bodies and involves collection of sediment-laden stormwater in a basin or tank, and adding a chemical [[Flocculation#Flocculants|flocculant]]. An example video of chemical dosing on slow settling solids is on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oya6cQsUzqY Example video of chemical dosing on slow settling solids]&lt;/ref&gt;  This causes the sediment to settle so it can be more easily removed from the water.  Some of the flocculent chemicals used for sediment treatment are [[chitosan]] and  [[polymer]]s such as [[polyacrylamide]]. The water is then pumped through a removal system, such as a [[Siltbuster]], [[sand filter|sand]] or cartridge filter, prior to discharge. Chemical sediment control is currently used on some construction sites around the [[United States]] and Europe, typically larger sites where there is a high potential for damage to nearby streams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA.
[http://www.cabmphandbooks.com/Documents/Construction/SE-11.pdf “California Stormwater BMP Handbook: Chemical Treatment.”] Fact Sheet No. SE-11. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another active treatment system design uses [[electrocoagulation#Electrocoagulation in water treatment|electrocoagulation]] to flocculate suspended particles in the stormwater, followed by a filtration stage.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Arthur H., et al. 2004. [http://www.stormh2o.com/may-june-2004/construction-stormwater-treatment.aspx "Raising the Bar on Construction Stormwater Treatment."]  [http://www.stormh2o.com ''Stormwater:''] May–June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory requirements==
All [[U.S. state|states]] in the U.S. have laws requiring installation of erosion and sediment controls (ESCs) on construction sites of a specified size.  Federal regulations require ESCs on sites {{convert|1|acre|ha|abbr=on}} and larger.  Smaller sites which are part of a common plan of development (e.g. a residential [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]) are also required to have ESCs.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/regulations/sw2-part1.pdf “Regulations for Revision of the Water Pollution Control Program Addressing Storm Water Discharges; Final Rule”]  (Commonly called the “Phase II Stormwater Rule.”) ''Federal Register,'' 64 FR 68721, December 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, non-contiguous sites under {{convert|1|acre|m2|sing=on}} are also required to have ESCs. For example, the State of [[Maryland]] requires ESCs on sites of {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} or more.&lt;ref&gt;State of Maryland. ''Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR).'' [http://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/26/26.17.01.05.htm ''Activities for Which Approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plans are Required.''] Sec. 26.17.01.05.&lt;/ref&gt; The sediment controls must be installed before the beginning of land disturbance (i.e. land clearing, grubbing and [[land grading|grading]]) and must be maintained during the entire disturbance phase of construction.

{{Culture of Turkey}}
'''Seljuk architecture''' comprises the building traditions used by the [[Seljuq dynasty]], when it ruled most of the [[Middle East]] and [[Anatolia]] during the 11th to 13th centuries. After the 11th century, the [[Seljuks of Rum]] emerged from the [[Great Seljuk Empire]] developing their own architecture, though they were influenced and inspired by the [[Armenian architecture|Armenian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Persian architecture|Persian]] architectural traditions.

==Great Seljuq Empire architecture==
Seljuq architectural elements can be found in a vast area stretching from the [[Hindu Kush]] to eastern Anatolia and from [[Central Asia]] to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The homeland of this building tradition was [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Iran]], where the first permanent Seljuk edifices were constructed. However, the [[Mongol invasions]] and [[earthquakes]] destroyed most of these buildings and only a few remain. In 1063 [[Isfahan]] was established as capital of the Great Seljuk Empire under [[Alp Arslan]].
[[File:Shrine_of_Warrior_Khalid_Waleed_(Back_side_Image).jpg|thumb|The [[Shrine of Khalid Walid]] in central [[Pakistan]] features Seljuk architectural elements that had been introduced to the region.&lt;ref name=mughal/&gt;]] 
The most significant alteration carried out in the early twelfth century was the conversion of the mosque plan into a four-iwan plan mosque. Another mosque-type introduced at this time was the kiosk mosque, consisting of a domed space with three open sides and wall containing a mihrab on the qibla side.The architecture of this period was also characterized by memorial tombs which were usually octagonal structures with domed roofs, called [[Gonbad|Kümbet]] or [[Türbe]]. An impressive example of tomb architecture is the [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar|mausoleum]] of [[Sultan Sanjar]] at [[Merv]], a massive building measuring {{convert|27|m|abbr=off}} square with a huge double dome resting on squinches and muqarnas pendentives.

In [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] the surviving monuments are represented by [[madrassas]] and tombs. The madrassas such as the Mustansiriya in [[Baghdad]] or the Muristan in [[Damascus]] were built to a four-iwan plan, while the tombs were characterized by conical muqarnas domes. The [[Shrine of Khalid Walid]] in southern [[Pakistan]] features Seljuk architectural elements that had been introduced to the region via [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=mughal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mughal|first1=Mohammad|authorlink1=Expansion of Architectural Traditions of Kunya-Urgench to Pakistan and Beyond|title=TURKEMINSTAN-UNESCO: APPRAISAL OF THE HISTORICAL CULTURAL VALUES AND DETERMINATION OF THE WAYS ON THE PROTECTION OF THE WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES: Abstracts of reports of the International Scientific Conference|date=2006|publisher=Abstracts of reports of the International Scientific Conference|url=http://www.rafiquemughal.com/MUGHAL_2006_Ashgabat-KU-&amp;-Pakistan.pdf|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of Seljuk Empire architecture include:
* [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar]]
* [[Kharraqan towers]]

==Anatolian Seljuk architecture==
[[File:Erzurum Cifte Minareli Sunrise.JPG|thumb|Çifte Minareli Medrese in Erzurum]]
The greatest number of surviving Seljuk monuments are in [[Anatolia]].
The [[Seljuks of Rum]] built monumental stone buildings of elegantly simple design and harmonious proportion, for the most part severely plain, but with bursts of elaborate decoration around doorways.

In their construction of [[caravanserai]]s, [[medrese]]s and mosques, the Rum Seljuks translated the Iranian Seljuk architecture of bricks and plaster into the use of stone.&lt;ref&gt;''West Asia:1000-1500'', Sheila Blair and Jonathan Bloom, '''Atlas of World Art''', ed. John Onians, (Laurence King Publishing, 2004), 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, the caravanserais (or hans), used as stops, trading posts and defense for caravans, and of which about a hundred structures were built during the Anatolian Seljuqs period, are particularly remarkable. Along with Persian influences, which had an indisputable effect,&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture(Muhammadan)'', H. Saladin, '''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics''', Vol.1, ed. James Hastings and John Alexander, (Charles Scribner's son, 1908), 753.&lt;/ref&gt; Seljuk architecture was also influenced by [[Armenian architecture]], such as by having Muslim architects who originated from historical Armenia, and by having Armenian architects and masons.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Stierlin, "Turkey From the Selcuks to the Ottomans", Taschen's World Architecture, 1998, p73-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Armenia during the Seljuk and Mongol Periods'', Robert Bedrosian, '''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times: The Dynastic Periods from Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century''', Vol. I, ed. Richard Hovannisian, (St. Martin's Press, 1999), 250.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Anatolian architecture represents some of the most distinctive and impressive constructions in the entire history of Islamic architecture. Later this Anatolian architecture would be transmitted to [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate India]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lost in Translation: Architecture, Taxonomy, and the "Eastern Turks"'', Finbarr Barry Flood, '''Muqarnas: History and Ideology: Architectural Heritage of the "Lands of Rum''', ed. Gulru Necipoglu, (Brill, 2007), 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Anatolian Seljuk works are of dressed stone, with brick reserved for minarets. The use of stone in Anatolia is the biggest difference with the Seljuk buildings in Iran, which are made of bricks. The buildings make frequent use of [[muqarnas]] (stalactite vaulting). In the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] the courts are often covered to protect against the colder and snowier winters of the Anatolian plateau. Thus some [[madrasas]] (theological seminaries) such as the [[Çifte Minareli Medrese]] in Erzurum have an open court, and others, such as the [[Karatay Medrese]] in Konya, have covered courts.

[[File:Ince Minareli Medrese 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ince Minaret Medrese in Konya]].

[[Konya]], the capital of the Seljuks and the other great Seljuk cities--[[Alanya]], [[Erzurum]], [[Kayseri]], [[Sivas]]—have important Seljuk buildings, but Seljuk works are abundant in almost any Anatolian city or town, especially in Central and Eastern Anatolia. Seljuk power extended (briefly) as far as the Aegean coast, so there are Seljuk türbes (tombs) even in—appropriately—the town of [[Selçuk]], next to Ephesus, south of [[İzmir]].
The great [[caravanserais]], or hans, are among the finest and most characteristic of Seljuk buildings. Built during the 13th century to encourage trade throughout the empire, several dozen survive in good condition.

After the [[Mongol invasions]] of the mid-13th century, the wealth and power of the Seljuk empire declined. The few late 13th century-early 14th century buildings that survive include the bimarhane (madhouse) in [[Amasya]], and the "Süngür Bey Mosque" in [[Nigde]]. One of the last Seljuk architectural endeavors was the tomb of 'Ismat al-Dunya wa 'l-Din ibint al-malik al-Adil built by her daughters after 1243.&lt;ref&gt;'' Notes on Saldjūq Architectural Patronage in Thirteenth Century Anatolia'', H. Crane, ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 36, No. 1 (1993), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Sex education curriculum''' is a [[sex education]] program encompassing the methods, materials, and assessments exercised to inform individuals of the issues relating to [[human sexuality]], including human [[sexual anatomy]], [[sexual reproduction]], [[sexual intercourse]], [[reproductive health]], emotional relations, [[reproductive rights]] and responsibilities, [[abstinence]], [[birth control]], and other aspects of [[human sexual behavior]]. Common [[sex education]] curricula include an abstinence-only approach, as well as a comprehensive approach, implemented in academia via the [[Internet]], peer education, visual media, games, health care organizations, and school instruction.

==European Union==
{{Hatnote|"Sex Education Curriculum" redirects here. For other uses, see [[Sex Ed]].}}

===Purpose===
The purpose of [[sexuality education]] curriculum in [[Europe]] is to facilitate [[adolescents]] to gain knowledge, attitudes, skills and values to make appropriate and healthy choices in their sexual behavior, thus preventing them from [[sexually transmitted infections]], including [[HIV]] and [[HPV]], teenage or unwanted pregnancies, and from domestic and [[sexual violence]], contributing to a greater society.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeber|first=O.|author2=Reuter, S. |author3=Apter, van der Doef |author4=Lazdane, Pinter |title=Aspects of sexuality education in Europe – definitions, differences and developments|journal=European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care|date=June 2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–176|pmid=20465399|doi=10.3109/13625181003797280}}&lt;/ref&gt; While European educators and policy makers recognize the benefits of sexuality education as being essential in the realm of [[sexual health]], the content and approach of the curriculum have undergone significant changes over time and differ among each European country.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"/&gt; Influenced by [[politics]], as well as social and religious movements, European educators and policy makers recognize the struggle to find common criteria of sexuality education curriculum.

===Common Sex Education Curricula===
Researchers identify the most common delivery of [[sexuality education]] curriculum as being through a [[biology]], relationship, and ideological focus.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} In this form of curriculum, practiced through a moral and informative approach by a teacher’s instruction, attention is directed towards the reproductive and physical aspects of [[sexuality education]] rather than the emotional and social aspects. While this approach is identified as the most common form of [[sexuality education]] in [[Europe]], [[Europe]] is not limited to this practice. With a total of twenty seven countries within the [[European Union]], a wide variety of practices are implemented in an attempt to address and/or ignore [[sexuality education]].{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} European policy makers and educators recognize the need for an implementation of an ideal curriculum for European countries to adopt, while distinguishing the political, social, and religious movements that hinder this action.

===The Safe Project===
The Safe Project was introduced by a coalition of European health organizations including the IPPF European Network, [[WHO]] Regional Office for Europe, and [[Lund University]], in 2004 in response to European policy makers and educators speaking out about the political, social, and religious struggles encountered when implementing [[sexuality education]] curriculum in [[Europe]].{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} The SAFE project conducted extensive research, implemented advocacy, engaged the youth, and created a greater recognition among public health organizations of the sexual rights of European youth as well as the creation of a model curriculum, providing an outline of the ideal [[sexuality education]] curriculum to be practiced within the [[European Union]].{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} This model of [[sexuality education]] curriculum was charted in a ninety eight page product entitled ''The Reference Guide to Sexuality Education in Europe'', selling thousands of copies to public health organizations and journals, as well as various books within academia.

===The Model Sex Education Curricula===
The ideal [[sexuality education]] curriculum within the [[European Union]], as proposed by the SAFE Project, is one that would be provided for varying ages of students, from the primary to the secondary level.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} A multi-dimensional staff including public health professionals, school instructors with knowledge in the sciences, and [[non-governmental organizations]], would be responsible for providing instruction in an interactive approach.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Educators recognize the benefits of health organizations and agencies not only as offering a more emotional and social approach to [[sexuality education]], but also expertise in recognizing issues among youth such as indications of [[sexual abuse]], [[sexually transmitted diseases]], and [[pregnancy]].{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Similarly, [[non-government organizations]](NGOs) provide students as well as the public with private counseling, sexuality seminars, public health campaigns, as well as peer-led informational groups, in which they are able to step outside of a strictly lecture and informational curriculum in [[sexuality education]] and accommodate the personal needs of European youth.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} While the ideal curriculum would be altered to accommodate the needs of its audience, its goal is to inform students on the topic of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], raising awareness and therefore allowing students to make healthier decisions in regards to sexuality and relationship activity as well as European youth distinguishing their sexual rights.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Younger audiences within the primary setting would be instructed by their classroom teacher in areas of [[puberty]], sexual development, and [[bullying]] while secondary audiences would be instructed by a multi-dimensional staff in the topical areas of [[racism]], [[homophobia]], [[sexual violence]], [[abstinence]], [[safe sex]], [[sexually transmitted diseases]], [[pregnancy]] and [[contraceptives]], as well as the biological, emotional, and social effects of sexuality.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}

===Complications===
Several complications are associated with the implementation of an ideal [[sexuality education]] curriculum including the area and diversity of each European country, variances in political and religious views, and a lack of sustainability. 
The area in which a country is located can affect religious and political beliefs, as well as resources and access to [[health education]], similarly the idea of diversity and the exposure to information and resources as well.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}
[[Politics]] and [[religion]] are two controversial topics that both have strong oppositions to [[sexuality education]]. With strong oppositions and public protests, political and religious affiliated organizations voice their negative opinions of a [[sexuality education]] curriculum that informs youth of sexual resources and options concerning [[contraception]] and [[abortion]].{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} With [[sexuality education]] not being mandatory in all twenty seven countries of the [[European Union]] and the controversial opposition of political and religious organizations, policy makers are unable to make an ideal [[sexuality education]] curriculum concrete. 
A lack of sustainability within [[sexuality education]] curriculum is also an issue addressed by European policy makers and educators. Upon a country acknowledging the benefits, as well as a need for [[sexuality education]], they implement the ideal [[sexuality education]] curriculum in which they see positive results in the decline of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] as well as teenage and unplanned pregnancies.{{sfn|SAFE|2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}} Upon government officials recognizing the positive results of the curriculum, the program is eliminated due to the significant improvements and the mindset that the problem is fixed and therefore the curriculum is no longer needed. With governmental cuts in [[sexuality education]] programs as well as the funding provided for those programs, policy makers and educators face great difficulty in the implementation of a continent-wide curriculum.

===Corrupted Children===

A child's mindset is shaped in numerous ways whether it is from their:
*parents
*environment
*experiences
As they grow, sex education will become a topic in their life that they will be curious about. Depending on how they are raised, they will have many questions or no questions at all. This article explains sexual innocence and how children flourish as adults.

their sexual desires simply signs of raging hormones, and their sexual behaviors transgressions
to control. Within this adultist framework, young people are at their best when
sexually innocent. At their most vulnerable, they are on the verge of succumbing to sexual
danger; and, at their most corrupting, they are the source of significant risks to others."

====Australia====
The [[Victorian Government]] (Australia) developed a policy for the promotion of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools in 1980 that was introduced into the State's primary and secondary schools during 1981.[https://archive.org/stream/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation#page/n0/mode/1up] The initiative was developed and implemented by the Honorable [[Norman Lacy]] MP, Minister for Educational Services from 1979-1982.

A ''Consultative Council for Health and Human Relations Education'' was established in December 1980 under the chairmanship of Dame [[Margaret Blackwood]]; its members possessed considerable expertise in the area.

The Council had three major functions:
# 1. to advise and to be consulted on all aspects of Health and Human Relations'Education in schools;
# 2. to develop, for consideration of the Government, appropriate curriculum for schools;
# 3. to advise and recommend the standards for in-service courses for teachers and relevant members of the school community.

Support services for the Consultative Council were provided by a new Health and Human Relations Unit within the ''Special Services Division'' of the ''Education Department of Victoria'' and was responsible for the implementation of the Government's policy and guidelines in this area. The Unit advised principals, school councils, teachers, parents, tertiary institutions and others in all aspects of ''Health and Human Relations Education''.

In 1981 the Consultative Council recommended the adoption of a set of guidelines for the provision of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools as well as a Curriculum Statement to assist schools in the development of their programs. These were presented to the Victorian Cabinet in December 1981 and adopted as Government policy.

====Canada====

A [http://sex-edu.ca/catalogue/ catalog of Canadian sex education films], ranging from 1953 to 2012, was recently compiled by researchers at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sex-edu.ca/|title = Ideology and Inequality in Canadian Sex Education Films|date = 2013|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = McLean|first = Shauna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silvia Maciá''' (born 1972) is an American [[marine biologist]] and [[professor]] of [[biology]] at [[Barry University]] in [[Miami Shores, FL]].  Courses she has taught include [[marine biology]], [[oceanography]], [[marine ecosystems|tropical marine ecosystems]], [[ecology]], [[environmental science]] and [[botany]].

Her research interests include [[pipefish]] mating behavior, [[seagrass]] community ecology, [[coral reef]] grazing ecology and seagrass restoration. Her research involves both laboratory and field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barry.edu/biology/faculty/macia.html|title=Silvia Maciá, PhD : Faculty and Staff :  Biology : College of Arts and Sciences : Barry University, Miami Shores, Florida|website=www.barry.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maciá is perhaps best noted for her discovery that [[Caribbean reef squid]] (''Sepioteuthis sepioidea'') can fly. She and her biologist husband Michael Robinson were boating on the north coast of [[Jamaica]] when she spotted something fly out of the water. She initially thought they were [[flying fish]] but after watching for a few seconds, she realized they were squid.&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-squid-fly/|title=''Fact or Fiction: Can a Squid Fly Out of Water?''|author=Ferris Jabr|publisher=[[Scientific American]]|date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sirpur Group of Monuments''' are an archaeological and tourism site containing Buddhist monuments from the 5th to 12th centuries in [[Mahasamund district]] of the state of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=pradhan854&gt;Atula Kumar Pradhan and Shambhoonath Yadav (2013), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/44158887 Sirpur - A unique township of early medieval India], Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 74 (2013), pp. 854-864&lt;/ref&gt; Located near an eponymous village, it is {{convert|78|km}} east of [[Raipur]], the capital of the state.&lt;ref name="raipurgov1"&gt;[http://raipur.gov.in/tourism.htm#Bk3 Sirpur] raipur.gov.in&lt;/ref&gt; The site is spread near the banks of the river [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]].&lt;ref name="prasarbharti"&gt;[http://www.newsonair.nic.in/SIRPUR-%20A%20Goldmine%20of%20History.asp SIRPUR : A Goldmine of History ] Prasar Bharti&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Sirpur (aka Shirpur) has been mentioned in epigraphic and textual records dated to the 5th to the 8th centuries CE. The city was once the capital of the [[Sharabhapuriya dynasty|Sharbhapuriya]] and [[Somavamshi dynasty|Somavamshi]] kings of [[Dakshina Kosala]] state. It was an important Buddhist, Hindu and Jain settlement of the South Kosala kingdom between the 5th and the 12th century CE.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; It was visited by Hieun Tsang, the 7th century Chinese Buddhist pilgrim. Recent excavations have uncovered 12 Buddhist [[vihara]]s, 1 Jain vihara, monolithic statues of [[Buddha]] and [[Mahavira]], 22 [[Shiva]] temples and 5 [[Vishnu]] temples, Shakti and Tantric temples, underground granary market and a sixth century bath house.

==History==
[[File:8th century couple at Tivara Deva temple, she steps on his feet seeks forgiveness with namaste gesture, Sirpur monuments Chhattisgarh India.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Sirpur relief excavated: she steps on his feet, seeks forgiveness with a namaste gesture.]]
Sirpur, also referred to as Shripur and Sripura (literally, "city of auspiciousness, abundance, Lakshmi") in ancient Indian texts and inscriptions, is a village on the [[Mahanadi River]] {{convert|78|km}} east of [[Raipur]]. In the second half of the 1st millennium CE, it was the capital city with major commercial and religious significance for the [[Dakshina Kosala]] kingdom.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; The earliest documented evidence states that it was first a capital of [[Sharabhapuriya dynasty]], followed by [[Panduvamshis of Dakshina Kosala|Panduvamshi]] dynasty.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; The Sharabhapuriya dynasty itself is dated to the late 5th century CE, but inscriptions mention its first capital to be Sharabhapura, as yet an unknown site.&lt;ref name="Williams1981p137"/&gt;

The abundant inscriptions of the mid-6th century CE in the region mention the Hindu Shaiva king Teevardeva and 8th-century king Shivagupta Balarjuna establishing temples and monasteries for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains in his kingdom. The Chinese pilgrim and traveller [[Xuanzang|Huen T'sang]] mentions visiting Sirpur in 639 CE in his memoirs.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; He wrote that the king was a [[Kshatriya]] and benevolent to the Buddhists, the region was prosperous. According to his memoir, some 10,000 Mahayana Buddhist ''bhikshus'' (monks) lived here in some 100 monasteries, and there were over 100 temples.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt;

The earliest dated Sirpur monument is the Lakshmana temple, dated to 595-605 CE. Along with it, numerous other temples along the Mahanadi River stretching over {{convert|150|km}} from Rajim to Kharod have been located and dated to between 600 and 710 CE.&lt;ref name="Williams1981p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanna Gottfried Williams|title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA137 |year=1981|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-06498-2|pages=137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Kosala kingdom, along with the capital Sirpur, was taken over by the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri dynasty]] in the 11th century, with eastern parts of the South Kosala taken over by the Somavamshi kingdom to their east.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarty2010p107"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dilip K.

Excavations in the region have yielded layers of deposits, traceable from the mid 1st millennium BCE, the Gupta Empire period, through the late medieval period with the youngest layer of deposits being ruins mixed with ''chilum'' (smoke pipe) and Sultanate era coins suggesting that Sirpur was an active human settlement at least through the early Delhi Sultanate.&lt;ref name="Sharma2007p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=G.S.

===Archaeological site===
Sirpur became a major archaeological site after it was visited in 1882 by [[Alexander Cunningham]], a colonial British India official.&lt;ref name="Cunningham1884"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Alexander Cunningham|title=Report of a Tour in the Central Provinces and Lower Gangetic Doab in 1881-1882|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUYpAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23|year=1884|pages=23–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His report on a Laxman (Lakshmana) temple at Sirpur brought it to international attention. The site remained neglected in early 20th-century during the decades of the World Wars, and excavations resumed in 1953.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; There were further excavations in 1990s and then particularly after 2003 when 184 mounds were identified and some selectively excavated. Those excavations have so far yielded 22 Shiva temples, 5 Vishnu temples, 10 Buddha Viharas, 3 Jain Viharas, a 6th/7th century market and snana-kund (bath house).&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt; The site shows extensive syncretism, where Buddhist and Jain statues or motifs intermingle with Shiva, Vishnu and Devi temples.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt;

There are two theories on the demise of Sirpur city and what led to the capital's sudden ruin. One posits that an earthquake leveled the entire region and people abandoned the capital and the kingdom. Another posits a catastrophic destruction after invasion and plunder. Coins of Sultan Alaud din Khalji of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] have been found among the ruins, and the stairs of one of the monuments show signs of partial caving in, neither establishes nor rules out the proposals. The discovery of Khalji era coins mixed with the ruins during the excavation can be attributed to other reasons such as trade between Delhi Sultanate and Dakshina Kosala kingdom, and a spot caving in can be because of localized soil [[subsidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Om Prakash Misra|title=Archaeological Excavations in Central India: Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0ISjDDWJwQC |year=2003|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-874-7|pages=208–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirpur is also a major archaeological site for "bronze sculptures from the early medieval period". According to Geri Hockfield Malandra, Sirpur was a significant bronze workshop of ancient India and the Buddhist bronze artwork excavated from Sirpur are among the "finest bronze sculptures" of that era.&lt;ref name="Malandra1993p112"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geri Hockfield Malandra|title=Unfolding A Mandala: The Buddhist Cave Temples at Ellora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MU44LPu3mbUC&amp;pg=PA112|year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1355-5|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are striking similarities between the artwork in Sirpur and the [[Ellora Caves]] as well as Ratnagiri, according to Malandra, and this may suggest a flow of ideas and artists between the two regions.&lt;ref name="Malandra1993p112"/&gt;

==Hindu monuments==
[[File:7th century Lakshmana Hindu temple, Sirpur Chhattisgarh India 1.jpg|thumb|left|Laxman temple at Sirpur]]

===Lakshmana temple===
The Lakshmana temple, also spelled Laxman temple, is a 7th-century brick temple, mostly damaged and ruined. The garbhagriya entrance along with the tower and door carvings of the Lakshmana temple at Sirpur are reasonably intact enough to be studied. Above the sanctum door's lintel are carvings show a reclining Vishnu on Sesha (Anantasayana Vishnu) and a panel on Krishna from ''Bhagavata Purana''. Around the door are bands of carvings which show the ten [[avatar]]s of Vishnu along with daily life and couples in various stages of courtship and [[mithuna]]. The temple stands on a stone ''jagati'' platform (about 40'x80') with wide enough space for circumambulation. The temple itself is built of brick except for the carved frame around the grabha-griya (sanctum) made of stone. The sanctum opens to the east. In front of the sanctum is the outline of an antarala (vestibule), and an oblong mandapa (ceremonial community hall). The hall shows stub places for pillars, all now lost to history. Except for the sanctum and the tower, much is in ruins. The sanctum stone frame outside is a 22x22 feet square, inside it is about 10x10 feet square. The sanctum walls are plain like typical Hindu temples. The original statue of sanctum is missing. The site management has installed several small statues for visitors from what was found in the ruins pile.&lt;ref name=pradhan854/&gt;

===Rama temple===
Rama temple is situated less than 100 meters southeast of the Lakshmana temple, but it is almost entirely in ruins. The Rama temple site, however, does preserve the foundation outline of several shrines as well as brick stub of the lower part of the original Rama temple.&lt;ref name="stadtner139"/&gt; Immediately to the north of the Rama temple is an outline which local tradition states was also dedicated to Lakshmana as Rama-Lakshmana pair. The Rama temple follows a stellate (star-shape) jagati pattern, while its Lakshmana pair was without one. The mandapa and other features of the Rama were destroyed long ago, according to Donald Stadtner, and the Rama temple site is likely to be from about 600 CE. This is one of the earliest star shape ''jagati'' platform temple in central India. It may have served as a prototype practice temple, before Sirpur architects of the 7th century built much grander stellate-principle Hindu temples in Kharod, Palari and Rajim.&lt;ref name="stadtner139"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Stadtner|editor=Joanna Gottfried Williams|title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ|year =1981|publisher=BRILL Academic| isbn=90-04-06498-2|pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gandheshwar temple===
Gandheshwar Temple: an active Shiva temple, Gandheshwar temple is situated on the banks of the [[Mahanadi|Mahanadi River]].&lt;ref name="cgtourism.choice.gov.in"/&gt; From the river, there are stone stairs to walk to the sanctum. The temple is routinely re-washed and re-painted. It likely includes recovered ruins from the area, in which the locals have included Hindu, Buddhist and Jain iconography. A stone slab that is part of the temple wall has a Sanskrit inscription in Nagari script, starting with Om symbol and dedicated to Shiva, which has been dated to the 8th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ajay Mitra Shastri|title=Inscriptions of the Śarabhapurīyas, Pāṇḍuvaṁśins and Somavaṁśins|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7cyQ8BxzR4kC |publisher= Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn= 978-81-208-0637-5|pages= 152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baleshwar Mahadev temples===
Baleshwar Mahadev temples group: A Shiva temple about 50 meter northwest of the Teevar dev monument, across the Sirpur road. It consists of several temples. For three Shiva temples excavated, a circumambulatory [[Jagati (temple)|Jagati]] in the form of a high rise platform, similar to Lakshmana temple survives. For another only the foundation is visible. The cluster was built by the Shaiva king Shivagupta Balarjuna, and is dated to the mid 8th century. Two of the temple are located side by side, and unlike most Sirpur temples, these open to the west. Both have a mandapa, an antarala and have a star shaped garbha griya made out of bricks and stone. The stellate sanctum is formed out of two squares, one rotated by 45 degrees. Some of the artwork discovered during excavations are displayed, and these show women and couple standing dressed up in 8th-century attire. The sanctum has Shiva linga made from marble.

[[File:7th - 9th century Surang tila temple, Sirpur monuments Chhattisgarh.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|Surang tila temple, Sirpur.]]

===Surang tila===
Surang tila: It is the largest temple complex in Sirpur, with a pillared terrace raised 30 feet above the group, stone steps connecting the terrace to the ruined mandapa platform remains below. The stairs have partially caved it in a spot from ground [[subsidence]]. The pillared terrace on the top was likely a mandapa, as it has ruins of many carved pillars in navaranga pattern. The terrace connects with five sanctums, which have two gray Shiva linga, one features a black granite Shiva linga and other two are dedicated to Vishnu. The temple is made out of white stone. It used to be a soil mound with tunnels (''surang'') used by the locals, but the temple was excavated between 2006 and 2007. An inscription was found during the excavation which is now in the Raipur museum. According to this inscription, this temple was operating during the time of Shivagupta Balarjuna, and the temple is dated to 7th or 8th century. Below the temple terrace, are ruins of two buildings, one likely a residence for priests and monks, another a small tantric temple with 16-edge Shiva linga possibly from later centuries.&lt;ref name=outlook2014/&gt;

===Other monuments===
Rakela Tal, fort ruins and other temples: located south near the Rama temple on the east side of the Sirpur road is a man made lake full of lotus flowers. Around the lake are ruins of an old fort, several Hindu and Buddhist monuments mixed in with farmlands and a modern era Krishna temple. Sirpur has over 20 other excavated medieval temples and 50 additional unexcavated mounds spread over a three square kilometres area.

==Buddhist monuments==
[[File:8th century Buddha statue at Tivara Deva Vihara, Sirpur monuments Chhattisgarh India.jpg|thumb|left|A Buddha statue excavated from monastery ruins.]]

===Ananda Prabhu vihara===
Ananda Prabhu Kuti vihara: a temple and 14-room monastery, built by Bhikshu Anand Prabhu, called Ananda Prabha in some inscriptions, with sponsorship from the Hindu king Sivagupta Balarjuna. The monastery and temple ruins included a monument to [[Avalokiteśvara]] and Makarwahini Gange. A stone inscription found at the site, in Sanskrit written in Nagari script and dated to mid 8th century CE uses a mix of Vedic meters (Anustubh, Sragdhara, Arya, Vasantatilaka and others). The inscription states starts with auspicious symbol Om and Siddham, praises Sugata (Buddha) then lauds king Balarjuna. It thereafter mentions monk Anandaprabha, devoted to the Buddha the Maravarin (enemy of Mara) and the destroyer of the cycle of rebirth and death. The inscription says the king established a "vihara kuti" (monastery residences) and a free feeding house for all the monks there furnished with ''setike'' and ''vyanjana'' (rice meal with condiments) for  "so long as the sun adorns the sky" (perpetuity). The inscription poem thereafter reminds the monks to remember the spirit of the king's gift, the [[impermanence]] of wealth, that [[dharma]] is the only saving grace to suffering-filled worldly existence. The inscription is signed by the artist who created it for the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ajay Mitra Shastri|title=Inscriptions of the Śarabhapurīyas, Pāṇḍuvaṁśins and Somavaṁśins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cyQ8BxzR4kC |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-0637-5|pages=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swastika vihara===
Swastika vihara: excavated in the 1950s, the aerial view of this monument's layout reminds of the swastika sign. This site yielded a Buddha statue and metallic idols relating to the Buddhist era. Along with Buddha was the image of Padamapani carrying a fly whisk.&lt;ref name="cgtourism.choice.gov.in"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgtourism.choice.gov.in/sites/default/files/temp/31%20Sirpur%20Leaflet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801134451/http://cgtourism.choice.gov.in/sites/default/files/temp/31%20Sirpur%20Leaflet.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:5th - 7th century reliefs and statue Baleshwar Shiva temple ruins, Sirpur Hindu monuments Chhattisgarh 3.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|An excavated Sirpur Shiva temple]]

===Teevardev===
Teevar dev: a monastery from the [[Dakshina Kosala]] era, this Vihara, also referred to as Tivradeva, is located near a Shiva temple and is about 1&amp;nbsp;km away from the Lakshmana temple. The temple is syncretic, built by a Shaiva king and his Buddhist queen, it shows Hindu and Buddhist themes. The monument is a syncretic collection of Buddhist and Hindu arts, as it shows along with Buddha statues and Buddhist artwork, Hindu themes such as Ganga and Yamuna goddesses, kama and mithuna scenes, ''Panchatantra'' tales as well as Gajalakshmi.&lt;ref name=outlook2014&gt;[https://www.outlookindia.com/outlooktraveller/destinations/sirpur_the_tantric_trail/ Sirpur: The tantric trail], Bibek Bhattacharya, Outlook traveller (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain monuments==
One Jain basati and monastery ruins has been discovered near the river banks and about 100 meters from an 8th-century Shiva temple. A bronze image of [[Rishabhanatha|Adinatha]] (Rishbha, the first Tirthankara) was found in the ruins, and the image is dated to the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Om Prakash Misra|title=Archaeological Excavations in Central India: Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0ISjDDWJwQC |year=2003|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-874-7|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASI Museum==
A museum managed by [[Archaeological Survey of India]] in the Lakshmana temple premises preserves the artwork parts and pieces of archaeological ruins found during excavations in the 1950s and in the 2000s. These belong to [[Shaivism|Shaiva]], [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnav]], Buddha and [[Jainism|Jain]] religions and variously dated to between 6th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref name="cgtourism.choice.gov.in"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_chts_laxman.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The following graduate degrees are offered:

* M.S. and Ph.D. in Plant Biology
* M.S. and Ph.D. in Organismic &amp; Evolutionary Biology
* M.S. and Ph.D. in Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology
* M.S. in Soil Science

The school's main facility and school symbol is [[Stockbridge Hall]], named after [[Levi Stockbridge]], a founder of Massachusetts Agricultural College and its first professor of agriculture; however, its faculty occupies various building on the University of Massachusetts campus, including Agricultural Engineering, Bowditch, Clark, Fernald, French, Stockbridge, and West Experiment Station.  Research, education, and extension activities occur at the UMass Cold Spring Orchard Research &amp; Education Center, the Hadley Farm (Stockbridge Stables), the Joseph Troll Turf Research Center, the UMass Vegetable &amp; Agronomy Research Farm, and the CNS Greenhouses.

== Athletics ==
Stockbridge has two [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) teams: basketball and golf. As a two–year school, its students are not allowed by the NCAA to play on varsity teams. Stockbridge teams compete against small four-year schools, preparatory schools, and community colleges. Stockbridge students may try out for the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association equestrian team and Intercollegiate Dressage Association team. These teams compete throughout the year with other colleges in the Northeast. Students may also take advantage of many noncompetitive recreational opportunities or participate in the University of Massachusetts' intramural program, one of the largest in the East.

== Greek life ==
[[Alpha Tau Gamma]] is the social and academic fraternity of the Stockbridge School of Agriculture. Their Chapter House is located at 118 Sunset Avenue on several acres of land near the Southwest dormitories.
There has been at several time throughout the history of the Stockbridge School of Agriculture a sorority Sigma Sigma Alpha. They are currently not active on campus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">'''Sustainable product development (SPD)''' is a method for [[product development]] that incorporates a Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD), also known as [[The Natural Step]] (TNS) framework. As the demand for products continues to increase around the world and environmental factors like [[climate change]] increasingly affect policies - and thus business - it becomes more and more of a [[competitive advantage]] for businesses to consider [[sustainability]] aspects early on in the [[product development]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mike Gordon |author2=Chris Musso |author3=Eric Rebentisch |author4=Nisheeth Gupta  |last-author-amp=yes |quote=Businesses with the best product-development track records stand apart from their less-successful peers in three crucial ways|title=The path to successful new products|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/operations/the_path_to_successful_new_products|journal=McKinsey Quarterly|date=January 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

SPD is not limited to the actual product development, but also the product design. Green design which is a part of SPD has two main goals: the prevention of waste and to minimize environmental impact. Environmental impact involves: deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource/material management, etc. The early stages of design tend to be the areas that effect the environment the worst, the extraction and refining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weenen|first=J.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35494">'''Symbolic Convergence Theory''' ('''SCT''') is a [[communication theory]] developed by [[Ernest Bormann]] where people share common fantasies and these collections of individuals are transformed into a cohesive group. SCT offers an explanation for the appearance of a group's cohesiveness, consisting of shared emotions, motives, and meanings. Through SCT, individuals can build a community or a group consciousness which grows stronger if they share a cluster of fantasy themes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A First Look At Communication Theory|last=Griffin|first=Erin|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=39|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic convergence theory provides a description of the dynamic tendencies within systems of social interaction that cause communicative practices and forms to evolve. This theory allows theorists and practitioners to anticipate or predict what will happen and explain what did happen. One thing SCT does not do is allow for control of human communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=Ernest|title=The Symbolic Convergence Theory of Communication: Applications and Implications for Teachers and Consultants|journal=Communication and Mass Media|date=4 April 1982|volume=10|issue=1|pages=1–2|url=http://sb6nw2tx4e.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=The+symbolic+convergence+theory+of+communication%3A+applications+and+implications&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Applied+Communication+Research&amp;rft.au=Bormann%2C+E+G&amp;rft.date=1982-01-01&amp;rft.volume=10&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.spage=50&amp;rft.epage=61&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=CAX0060020000272|accessdate=12-2-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to explain how communication can create and sustain group consciousness through the sharing of narratives or fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, Arin Rose. 2008. "Symbolic Convergence Theory". In Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Lynda Lee Kaid. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sagepolcom/symbolic_convergence_theory/0&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

To foster this cohesiveness, dramatizing or using fantasy stories are significant types of communication involved in SCT. SCT explains that meanings, emotions, values, and the motives for action are in the communication contexts by people trying to make sense out of a common experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Em|title=A First Look at Communication Theory|year=2012|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It explores the human tendency of trying to understand events in terms of the people involved, who have certain personality traits and motivations, and have agency over how the events unfold.&lt;ref name="Bormann1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bormann|first=E. G.|title=Symbolic Convergence Theory and Communication in Group Decision Making|year=1996|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761904625|pages=81–113|editor=Randy Y. Hirokawa |editor2=[[Marshall Scott Poole]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCT was first proposed by [[Ernest Bormann]] in the ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=Fantasy and rhetorical vision: The rhetorical criticism of social reality|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|year=1972|volume=58|pages=396–407|doi=10.1080/00335637209383138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bormann and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota introduced SCT as a framework for discovering, describing, and explaining the dynamic process by which humans come to share symbolic reality.&lt;ref&gt;Olufowote, James O. 2006. "ROUSING AND REDIRECTING A SLEEPING GIANT: Symbolic Convergence Theory and Complexities in the Communicative Constitution of Collective Action." Management Communication Quarterly : McQ 19 (3): 451-492.&lt;/ref&gt; Bormann defines the basic communicative dynamic of symbolic convergence theory as, "the sharing of group fantasies which bring about symbolic convergence for the participants" (p.&amp;nbsp;4). It is a process through which collectives create and share a consciousness and develop a common symbolic reality.&lt;ref&gt;Endres, Thomas G. 1995. "Co-Existing Master Analogues in Symbolic Convergence Theory: The Knights of Columbus Quincentennial Campaign." Communication Studies 45 (3-4): 294. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/233195476&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic Convergence Theory is related to [[attribution theory]] in that it deals with the human tendency to attribute meaning to signs and objects in order to make sense of them.&lt;ref name="Bormann1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=The symbolic convergence theory of communication: Applications and implications for teachers and consultants|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|year=1982|volume=10|pages=50–61|doi=10.1080/00909888209365212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of symbolic convergence resembles empathic communication.&lt;ref name="Bormann1982" /&gt;

SCT has a three-part structure:
# elucidation of the recurring forms of communication involved in a shared group consciousness
# illustration of why group consciousness begins, rises, and is maintained
# explanation of the process of how an individual begins to share (or stops sharing) a common symbolic reality&lt;ref name="Bormann1982" /&gt;

== Plato's Allegory of the Cave ==
[[File:Plato's_Allegory_of_the_Cave_B+W_clear.jpg|alt=|border|right|413x413px]]Plato's classical Allegory of the Cave illustrates the creation of a shared perception in the manner of Symbolic Convergence Theory.  As show to the right, a group of prisoners are seated in a cave and can only see what is projected on the wall, they have no direct access to the reality the shadows represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plato%27s_Allegory_of_the_Cave_B+W_clear.jpg|title=JohnD'Alembert (2016-01-27), English: Plato's Allegory of the Cave, clear illustration in black and white, retrieved 2018-10-09|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikimedia Commons|archive-url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plato%27s_Allegory_of_the_Cave_B+W_clear.jpg|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11/19/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shadows become language symbols for the prisoners.  They may discuss what they see and form agreements on their perceptions. Their process of discussion and agreement on perceptions is Symbolic Convergence Theory in practice.  The prisoners can only create their perception of reality from the shadows cast of the wall, however they can not know if they are seeing the shadows of real objects, or distortions of reality, or illusions, or if anything has been omitted from their perceived reality.  

== Anatomy ==

===Basic concepts===

==== Fantasy themes ====

Unlike the traditional ideas of what [[fantasy]] means, Bormann uses the word to refer to "the creative and imaginative interpretation of events that fulfills a psychological or rhetorical need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A First Look At Communication Theory|last=Griffin|first=Em|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=38|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy themes are used to construct a rhetorical vision or to dramatize messages embraced by the whole group. They are the means through which interpretation is accomplished through communication. SCT isn't concerned with finding truth, but the reaction from the group when these fantasies are shared.&lt;ref name="Jackson2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=B.G.|title=A Fantasy Theme Analysis of Peter Senge's Learning Organization|journal=Journal of Applied Behavioral Science|year=2000|volume=36|pages=193–209|doi=10.1177/002188630036200}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fantasy themes exist in the form of a word, a phrase, or a statement, which attempt to define past events,
predict future events, or illustrate present events that are chronologically or spatially removed from the actual activities of the group. Most of the time, these fantasies trigger a chain reaction within the group where they will contribute more and more to the conversation or fantasy.&lt;ref name="Jackson2000" /&gt; Bormann sees these fantasy themes fulfilling a psychological or rhetorical need through creative and organized interpretations of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=The rhetoric of Western thought|year=1976|publisher=Kendall/Hunt|location=Dubuque, IA|pages=431–449|authorlink=General and specific theories of communication|editor=J.L. Golden |editor2=G.F. Berquist |editor3=W.E. Coleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy theme analysis is a humanistic method of rhetorical criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=Fantasy and rhetorical vision: Ten years later|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|year=1982|volume=68|pages=288–305|doi=10.1080/00335638209383614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasy themes are broken down into the following three forms:&lt;ref name="Jackson2000" /&gt;
# ''Setting themes'' depicting where either the action takes place or where the characters act out their roles
# ''Character themes'' describing the agents or actors in the drama, assigning qualities and motives to them, implying that they have certain characteristics
#  ''Action themes'' or plot lines dealing with the action of the drama

==== Symbolic cues ====

A symbolic cue is a word, phrase, slogan, or a nonverbal sign or gesture that  works to trigger previously shared fantasies and emotions.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt; An example of a symbolic cue would be a bumper sticker, which actuates the observer into a larger shared reality.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt; Symbolic cues can also heighten a group's cohesiveness.

==== Fantasy types ====

A fantasy type is a fantasy theme that has currency across a large number of rhetorical visions. By providing known references, they help make sense out of a new phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt;

An example of a fantasy type would be when Richard Nixon was campaigning through his home state of California in 1952. A fund was put together by some wealthy Southern California businessman on behalf of Nixon. The newspapers picked this up and ran headlines such as "Secret Rich Men's Trust Fund Keeps Nixon in Style Far Beyond His Salary". The purpose of this fund was to help Nixon pay for expenses that he could not otherwise pay for out of his income. National newspapers were two to one in the favor of dropping Nixon from the ticket after this and his only hope was to find a way to regain public trust and support. Six days after the crisis, Nixon addressed the public by radio to respond to the charges against him. A fantasy theme emerging from this story would be Nixon presenting himself as the American dream. During his speech over the radio, he emphasized how he made his own way in the world and had to work for living. He also said, "How does a candidate pay for political expenses not covered by the government? First, is to be a rich man, which I am not. I feel that it is essential in this country of ours that a man of modest means can run for President." He offers autobiographical references which allow him to appear as the average man. This is an appropriate fantasy theme because it developed a response to the allegations that he is not a rich man who is getting money from everyone, but a hard working man who started from the ground and worked upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wells|first=William|title=Fantasy Theme Analysis of Nixon's "Checkers" Speech|journal=Electronic Journal of Communication|date=November 1996|volume=6|url=http://www.cios.org/EJCPUBLIC/006/1/00611.HTML|accessdate=11/9/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saga ====

A saga is the telling and re-telling of the accomplishments and events in the life of an individual, group, organization, or larger entity such as a nation.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt;  For instance, examples of American sagas include "the spirit of entrepreneurship" and "the power of the ballot box."&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt;   Symbolic convergence theorists argue that the Soviet Union had difficulty maintaining cohesion of the fifteen republics due to the weakening of the communist rhetorical vision and dwindling sagas.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt;

=== Structural concepts ===

==== Rhetorical vision ====

A rhetorical vision is a composite drama that unifies people in a common symbolic reality.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cragan|first=J.F.|author2=Shields, D.C. |title=The use of symbolic convergence theory in corporate strategic planning: A case study|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|date=May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rhetorical vision has five elements:

# ''Dramatis personae'' – the actors and players who give life to the rhetorical vision
# ''Plotline'' – provides the action of the rhetorical vision
# ''Scene'' – details the location of the rhetorical vision
# ''Sanctioning agent'' – legitimizes the rhetorical vision
# ''Master analogue'' – the reflection of a deeper structure within the rhetorical vision

=== Critical evaluation concepts ===

==== Shared group consciousness ====

A shared group consciousness must exist within a rhetorical community in order for a fantasy theme to chain out, a rhetorical vision to develop, a saga to exist, or a symbolic cue to imbue meaning.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt; Some terms that portray a shared group consciousness are a common ground, mutual understanding, created social reality, meeting of minds and empathic communication. Once a group has reached shared group consciousness, they no longer think in terms of "I" or "me" but in terms of "us" and "we." After all, communication is the drive that allows groups of people to move towards their goal. A shared group consciousness also reduces uncertainty by allowing groups to develop an identity that shapes their culture. By shaping their own culture, this can influence norms, roles and even decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beebe &amp; Masterson|title=Communicating in Small Groups|url=http://www.uky.edu/~drlane/groups/ch02.htm|accessdate=11/28/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rhetorical vision reality link ====

A rhetorical vision reality link allows for a viable rhetorical vision that chronicles an authentic account of the phenomena along with tangible evidence.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt; The lack of a rhetorical vision reality link, with no clear observational impressions of the facts, may lead to disprovable fantasies, characterized by rumor, innuendo, gossip, and even paranoia.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt;

==== Fantasy theme artistry ====

Fantasy theme artistry is the rhetorical ability to present situations in a form that appears attractive to people so that they will share them.&lt;ref name=Cragan1992 /&gt; By presenting situations in a form that appears attractive to an audience, or showing that you have an understanding of the stories that group shares, you can speak to their stories and turn their opinions into your favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symbolic Convergence Theory|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/symbolic_convergence.htm|publisher=Changing Minds|accessdate=11/9/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life cycle ==

=== Stage 1: Emergence or creation ===

A dramatic event or series of events leads to uncertainty and a need to develop rhetoric to explain the current state of reality. In the case of the [[Cold War]], the emergence of a fantasy-vision was necessary after Stalin's speech made clear his belief that capitalism and communism were incompatible and that war was inevitable. With the [[Truman Doctrine]] speech, emerging fantasies of Red Fascism (e.g., communism vs. democracy), Power Politics (e.g., containment strategy), and the Hot War vision (e.g., make the world safe for democracy), crystallized into the yet unknown concept of "the Cold War."&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt;

=== Stage 2: Consciousness-raising ===
Fantasies begin to chain out among a collectivity of people over a common interest. As they co-create a new vision, their lives take on new meaning and emotion and
their behavior changes. The ''principle of critical mass'', when a rhetorical vision begins a period of rapid growth, is central to consciousness-raising. Also key to this stage is the ''principle of dedication'', which asserts that when planned events inspire individuals to act according to the key emotions present in the rhetorical vision their consciousness is raised.&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt;

=== Stage 3: Consciousness-sustaining ===
At this stage, communication is focused on maintaining the commitment of people who have shared the rhetorical vision. The ''principle of shielding'' asserts that visions often remain fundamentally unchanged by containing motivation to quash counter messages.&lt;ref name ="ColdWar" /&gt; The ''principle of rededication'' asserts that visions may be sustained through severe criticism of counter-rhetoric and strategic positive dramatizations to maintain the visions vitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jensen lectures: Contemporary communication studies|year=1983|publisher=Department of Communication, University of South Florida|location=Tampa, FL|pages=71–90|author=E.G. Bormann|authorlink=The symbolic convergence theory of communication and the creation, raising, and sustaining of public consciousness.|editor=J.I. Sisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''principle of reiteration'' asserts that rhetorical visions may be sustained by restating the key fantasy themes and types in new manners that fit within the dramatic structure of the vision, along with framing new information within the old rhetorical forms to maintain explanatory power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Applied communication research: A dramatistic approach|publisher=Waveland|location=Prospect Heights, IL|pages=79–91|author=Shields, D.C.|authorlink=Malcolm X's black unity addresses: Espousing middle-class fantasy themes as American as apple-pie.|editor1=J.F. Cragan |editor2=D.C. Shields }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stage 4: Vision-declining ===
Situations in a rhetorical community can change so rapidly that the vision cannot adapt successfully. The ''principle of explanatory deficiency'' assert that when a rhetorical vision loses its explanatory power, it begins to decline. Another possible reason for decline is explained by the ''principle of exploding free speech'', where a significant period of censorship is followed by a deluge of counter-rhetoric. Along similar lines, the ''principle of resurfacing competitive rhetorical visions'' asserts that with opened channels of communication, competition from alternate rhetorical visions increases.&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt;

=== Stage 5: Terminus ===
The end of a rhetorical vision. The ''principle of rapid implosion'' asserts that an inflexible rhetorical vision will not decline incrementally, but will implode on itself when the combination of problems, inability to explain rapid change, and contradictory motives become too much for the vision to deal with.&lt;ref name="ColdWar" /&gt;

== Real world uses ==

Symbolic Convergence Theory has been used to study movements such as the [[Puritans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=The force of fantasy: restoring the American dream|year=2001|publisher=SIU Press|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Knights of Columbus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Endres|first=T.G.|title=Coexisting master analogues in symbolic convergence theory: The knights of Columbus quincentennial campaign|journal=Communication Studies|volume=45|issue=3-4|pages=294–308|doi=10.1080/10510979409368430}}&lt;/ref&gt; American communism, and the [[Women's movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kroll|first=B.S.|title=From Small Group to Public View: Mainstreaming the Women's Movement.|journal=Communication Quarterly|year=1983|volume=31|series=2|pages=139–47|doi=10.1080/01463378309369497}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to study political visions such as the Cold War,&lt;ref name="ColdWar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=Ernest G.|author2=Cragan, J.F. |author3=Shields, D.C. |title=An expansion of the rhetorical vision component of the symbolic convergence theory: The cold war paradigm case|journal=Communication Monographs|date=March 1996|volume=63|pages=1–28|doi=10.1080/03637759609376371}}&lt;/ref&gt; the New South,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell, III|first=J. Louis|title=In search of the new south|journal=Southern Speech Communication Journal|year=1982|volume=47|issue=4|pages=361–388|doi=10.1080/10417948209372540}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vietnam war]] decision making,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball|first=Moya Ann|title=A case study of the Kennedy administration's decision-making concerning the Diem Coup of November, 1963|journal=Western Journal of Speech Communication|year=1990|volume=54|issue=4|pages=557–574|doi=10.1080/10570319009374360}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others.

[[Cold War|The Cold War]] rhetorical vision allowed theorists to mesh findings of previous SCT studies to discern, understand, and explicate more fully the intricate life-cycle of a rhetorical vision. Therefore, one set of studies, written by Bormann and others recommended that rhetorical visions can encompass the gamut of shared consciousness from all parts of the political, social, artistic, military, economic and cultural spectrum. Basically, through this study on the Cold War, they see how unrelated rhetorical visions may be combined in to a masterful rhetorical vision providing rhetorical continuity over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bormann, Ernest G., and John F. Cragan. 1996. “An Expansion of the Rhetorical Vision Component of The Symbolic Convergence Theory: The Cold War Paradigm Case.” ''Communication Monographs'' 63 (1): 1.
&lt;/ref&gt;

SCT can also be applied in corporate [[strategic planning]] through guiding corporate [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]], [[market segmentation]], and advertising and sales message testing. There are relevant cases&lt;ref&gt;Cragan, J. F., &amp; Shields, D. C. (1992). The use of symbolic convergence theory in corporate strategic planning: A case study. ''Journal of Applied Communication Research, 20''(2), 199-218. [[doi:10.1080/00909889209365329]]&lt;/ref&gt; consolidating the SCT theory-method-message complex combining with the strategic planning process and other implications.

== Criticism ==
Ernest G. Bormann, the theorist behind Symbolic Convergence Theory, a past professor of communication at University Minnesota, claimed that SCT is both objective and interpretive theory. The methods of determining fantasy themes, types, and visions create a humanistic approach that is interpretive.  SCT is often praised and even considered a bit unusual because it meets both criteria for being both objective and interpretive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Denise|title=Bormann's Symbolic Convergence Theory|url=http://www.colorado.edu/communication/meta-discourses/Papers/App_Papers/Young.htm|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=11/9/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ernest G. Bormann, John F. Cragan, &amp; Donald C. Shields responded to initial criticisms in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bormann|first=Ernest G.|last2=Cragan|first2=John F.|last3=Shields|first3=Donald C.|date=1994|title=Defense of Symbolic Convergence Theory: A look at the theory and its criticisms after two decades|url=|journal=Communication Theory|volume=4|pages=259-294|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bormann noted that one point that SCT lacks is to allow for predication and control of human communication in 1982.&lt;ref name="Bormann1982" /&gt;

Em Griffen puts forward arguments that Symbolic Convergence Theory is an objective theory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Symbolic Convergence Theory is objective because it focuses on sharing group fantasies that create symbolic convergence which is framed as a universal principle that holds true for all people regardless of the time, culture, and communication context. Below are four of the tests that can be interpreted for SCT on an objective side.

# A good objective theory explains what occurs and why it happens. This theory gives a great explanation of what makes sense to a group discussion and how. It can help us make sense of a chaotic group discussion when group members speak at one time or go off on verbal tangents.However, Boston College communication professor James Olufowote doesn't believe Bormann's explanation goes far enough. In a sympathetic critique aimed at making the theory better, he contends that "SCT does not sufficiently explain why humans are predisposed to dramatizing reality and sharing fantasy in the first place.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Em|title=A First Look at Communication Theory|year=2012|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although SCT covers most of this critique, Bormann says, "SCT does not sufficiently explain why humans are predisposed to dramatizing reality and sharing fantasy in the first place."&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;
# A good objective theory predict what's going to happen. SCT clearly achieves this portion of qualifying to be an objective theory. SCT can predict that when a fantasy chain erupts among members, symbolic convergence will occurs as well. Without this chain eruption, there will no be cohesiveness within the group. Although SCT can predict a fantasies will happen, it cannot predict when  dramatizing message will trigger a chain reaction. Bormann compared SCT as similar to Darwin's biological theory of evolution in that respect.The theory even suggests that without shared fantasies, there will be no cohesiveness. An evolutionary theory can explain the way modern humans evolved but cannot predict the further path of evolution. SCT involves a group consciousness through time and include a description of the dynamic forces that provide an explanation to discovered communication patterns but not when they will happen.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;
# A good interpretive theory clarifies people's values. SCT highlights the values of rhetorical community by creating a common ground, meeting of minds and empathic communication. This theory does not explain what happens when someone that is ignored is left out or excluded from the group because people don't mesh well when they are ignored.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;
# A good interpretive theory offers a new understanding of people. The SCT method does a great job of directing rhetorical critics to focus on symbolic language. Fantasy theme analyst focus on the rhetorical visions within varied communities such as a feminist critique looking for patterns of male dominance and how pro-eating disorder messages influence those in that community.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;

In 2003 Joshua Gunn delivered a sophisticated criticism of of what he considered Bormann's outdated conception of SCT involving a humanist construct of conscious human actors working with agency.  In contrast, Gunn proposed a post-modernist construct working in unconscious, and critiqued Bormann's work as a passing era prior to Michael McGee taking rhetorical study onto issues of ideology. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Joshua|date=Feb 2003|title=Refiguring Fantasy: Imagination and Its Decline in U.S. Rhetorical Studies|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=Vol. 89 Issue 1|pages=41-59|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bormann, Cragan, &amp; Shields responded the same year refuting or dismissing Gunn's criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bormann|first=Ernest|last2=Cragan|first2=John F.|last3=Shields|first3=Donald C.|date=2003|title=Defending symbolic convergence theory from an imaginary Gunn.|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=89|pages=366-372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A supporting argument that SCT is a measure of conscious human agency can be seen in the  intentional use of rhetoric to create a crafted convergence of a group's perceptions by a religious advocacy group in order to address a specific problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald|first=Becky|date=1987|title=Falwell and Fantasy: The Rhetoric of a Religious and Political Movement (Moral Majority)|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303624782/|journal=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Why Symbolic Convergence Theory is useful ==
These stories, or fantasies, can help businesses, corporations or politicians guide the positive and negative feedback directly back to those in power. Because SCT is a [[General systems theory|general theory]] built on the method of [[natural sciences]], it can be applied to many different cultures and timelines.&lt;ref name=30years&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Gudykunst|editor-first=William B.|title=Communication Yearbook 25|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|pages=271–303|author=Bormann, E.G.|chapter=Three decades of developing, grounding, and using symbolic convergence theory (SCT)|author2=Cragan, J.F. |author3=Shields, D.C. |doi=10.1207/s15567419cy2501_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to account for the communicative processes, created by a group, used to foster the creation and sustenance of the group's so-called "consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bormann|first=E.G.|title=Symbolic Convergence Theory: A Communication Formulation|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1985|volume=35|issue=4|pages=128–138|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1985.tb02977.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are a few points of how and why SCT can be useful in everyday situations.

Determining communication malfunctions.
A question that happens a lot within SCT is, "Why do some fantasy themes spark a chain of sharing while other fail?" Groups fate as a part of a group have common experiences that predispose them to share fantasies which relate to their concerns. Therefore, these groups will have successful fantasy chains because they have more in common and are able to share more.  When issues of power, sexism, role conflict, social rejection and other touchy topics come into play, groups members often find the direct confrontation of such issues to be unsettling. These fantasy chains may begin, but often do not last very long.

Assessing communication efforts and persuasive campaigns.
This theory can provide insight within small groups, meetings, lectures and speeches, but it provides a greater use of assessing effects within the media. It is most heavily used within political campaigns. In the 1976 campaign, the investigators included the relationship between the media messages and the audience effects in their study. These studies analyzed the extent to which actual voting behavior can be anticipated by participation. By being able to predict the voting behaviors, political representatives could carefully craft their messages for different groups of people before giving their speeches and lectures to best benefit themselves.

The role of consciousness.
Within fantasy chains there are three phases that keep the chains going. They are consciousness creating, consciousness raising and consciousness sustaining. In the first phase, people to come to create a commonality among their group. If the groups shares this common fantasy, consciousness raising will often fall in line next. And lastly, the two first points combined will create a sustaining fantasy chain that will last.&lt;ref name=Bormann1982 /&gt;

== A Dangerous Phenomenon ==
An important element of Symbolic Convergence Theory is the propensity of the phenomenon it illustrates to be used against the public good.  Whether unintentionally or intentionally, SCT can be seen at work in revisionist history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History Wars|last=Engelhart|first=Tom|last2=Linenthal|first2=Edward|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=978-0805043877|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The intentional malevolent use of SCT principles against the public good can be seen in the rash of "Fake News" campaigns in which false perceptions are feed to society in order to create a false, but widely believed, consensus (convergence) of belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Alfred|date=Winter 2004|title=.).

== Similar Theories ==
'''[[Dramatism]]''' (Burke)

Dramatism is an attempt to understand the world through the construct of drama.  The Dramatism construct allows the analyst to give purpose to life by giving individuals agency as actors within the drama, ties events and locations into the perception of the world as a stage, and as all stories have a plot Dramatism gives existence and humanity purpose.  Dramatism provides groups of individuals conceptual tools on which to build a social convergent perception of reality.  

'''[[Social judgment theory|Social Judgement Theory]] ('''Sherif, Sherif and Hovland)

A self-persuasion theory defined by the perception and evaluation of an idea by comparing it with current attitudes. Persuasion occurs at the end of the process when a person understands a position and then compares the position it advocates to the other person’s position on the issue.  The closer the other person’s position comes to a person’s latitude of acceptance, that position will seem closer than it actually is

'''[[Social exchange theory|Social Exchange Theory]]''' (Thibaut and Kelley)

The major force in interpersonal relationships is the satisfaction of both people's self-interest. Self-interest is not necessarily bad and can actually enhance relationships. Interpersonal exchanges are analogous to economic exchanges where people are satisfied when they receive a fair return on their expenditures.

'''[[Social constructionism|Social Construction of Communication Technology]] ('''Fulk)

Communication technology use is influenced by workgroup attitudes and behaviors.  Social influence is greater when individuals are more attractive to their work group.

'''[http://www.vayne.com/fantasy_theme_analysis.htm Fantasy Theme Analysis]''' (Bormann)

This theory is a form of rhetorical criticism. It takes the shared fantasies of a group of people, perhaps the audience for a business presentation or a public speech, and examines them for inside jokes and other cues to a shared consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vayne.com/fantasy_theme_analysis.htm|title=What is Fantasy Theme Analysis?|last=Bormann|first=Ernest|date=|website=http://www.vayne.com/fantasy_theme_analysis.htm|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Syracuse University]] School of Information Studies''', also known as the '''iSchool''', is a center for research and education in the policy, systems, service, and technology aspects of [[information management]], [[information science]], and [[library science]]. Established in 1896 as the School of Library Science, its name was changed in 1974 to reflect the growing information field.  Syracuse was the first library school to change its name in this way,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Gary|last2=Grudin|first2=Jonathan|year=2009|title=TIMELINES The information school phenomenon|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1487632.1487636#|journal=Interactions|volume=16|issue=2|pages=15–19|doi=10.1145/1487632.1487636}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence its claim as "the ''original'' school for the information age."  Starting in the 1970s, the school began to add new programs focused on information studies that aim to merge technology and management skills with an emphasis on human needs and behavior.

== History ==
The first library science courses were offered at Syracuse University in 1896 at the University’s [[von Ranke]] library, with university librarian Henry Orrin Sibley and his wife as the first and only instructors.  In 1907, the program moved to the University's Carnegie Library, and, in 1908, it received accreditation from the American Library Association. The program eventually split from the College of Liberal Arts in 1915 and began granting graduate degrees in 1934.

The School of Information Studies emerged in 1974 when Dean Robert Taylor suggested the School of Library Science adopt a name that would signal a new direction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout the 1970s, he updated the library science curriculum to keep pace with the changing times. In 1977, the [[Education Resources Information Center]] (ERIC/AE) Clearinghouse was launched at the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/e/eric_ae.htm], ERIC Clearinghouse on Adult Education (ERIC/AE) at Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt; The country’s first master's degree in information resources management (IRM) was added to the curriculum in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acm.org/education/education/curric_vols/is2002.pdf|title=IS 2002 Model Curriculum and Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Information Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611040945/http://www.acm.org/education/education/curric_vols/is2002.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s marked an increase in faculty research and grants that established the School of Information Studies as a leader in the field.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} During this time, the undergraduate program in information management and technology was introduced. In 1983, the school moved from its old home in several large houses on the edge of campus to Huntington Hall. The school's offices and classrooms moved again in 1989 to the Center for Science and Technology, which also housed the Chemistry and Computer Science programs, among others.

The 1990s brought many innovations to the school, including the master's degree program in telecommunications and network management; [[AskERIC]], one of the first [[digital reference services]]; and [[distance learning]] options for graduate study.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Several new research centers opened, including the Convergence Center, the Center for [[Electronic commerce|Digital Commerce]], and the Center for [[Natural Language Processing]].

As the new millennium approached, the school had outgrown its space in the Center for Science and Technology. Dean Raymond von Dran began working toward establishing a new home for the iSchool on campus, announcing his vision for the school's permanent home on the Syracuse University Quad. In 2008, von Dran's vision was realized when the School of Information Studies celebrated the iOpening of a completely redesigned Hinds Hall. The building, with its sleek and modern design, earned the [[American Institute of Architects]] [[Central New York]] Chapter Citation Award that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ischool.syr.edu/newsroom/news.aspx?recid=583|title=Hinds Hall renovations win AIA CNY design award|last=|first=|accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University''' ('''TANUVAS''') is a veterinary university founded in 1989 in [[Madhavaram]] Milk Colony, [[Chennai]], [[India]].  It is composed of the [[Madras Veterinary College]], Veterinary College and Research Institute, [[Namakkal]], Veterinary College and Research Institute, Tirunelveli ; Veterinary College and Research Institute, Orathanadu and the Institute of Food and Dairy Technology, Koduvalli, Chennai-52. Research farms are for leprosy bacteria, for prawn and edible fish culture, and for animal feed safety.

==History==
The institution now operating as a university was established in 1876 and became a college in 1903, with 20 students at Dobbin Hall, Chennai.  The three-year diploma course, Graduate of Madras Veterinary College, was then offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=India Today, Education|title=TANUVAS, Chennai admissions 2015: Apply for MBA programme|date=27 July 2015|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/tanuvas-admissions-2015/1/454317.html|access-date=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] established the university on 20 September 1989 through the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University Act, 1989 (Tamil Nadu Act 42 of 1989). [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]]'s Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (i.e., [[Madras Veterinary College]], [[Veterinary College and Research Institute, Namakkal]] and [[Fisheries College and Research Institute, Thoothukudi]]) formed the nucleus of university and the institutes became constituent colleges of the newly formed university.

A [[viewshed]] is an area that is visible from a specific location. '''Viewshed analyses''' are a common function of most [[geographic information system]] (GIS) software. The analysis uses the elevation value of each cell of the [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) to determine visibility to or from a particular cell. The location of this particular cell varies depending on the needs of the analysis. 
For example, a viewshed analysis is commonly used to locate communication towers or determining the view from a road. Viewsheds can be calculated using an individual point such as a tower or multiple points such as a line representing a road. When analyzing a line segment, each of the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] along the line is calculated to determine its visible area. The process can also be reversed. For example, when locating a [[landfill]], the analysis can determine from where the landfill is visible to keep it hidden from view.

== Viewshed analysis process ==
A viewshed analysis can be performed using one of many [[GIS]] programs, such as [[GRASS GIS]] (r.los, r.viewshed), [http://www.luciad.com/solutions/luciadlightspeed LuciadLightspeed], [http://www.luciad.com/solutions/luciadmobile LuciadMobile], [[SAGA GIS]] (Visibility), TNT Mips, [[ArcMap]], [[Maptitude]], [[ERDAS IMAGINE]]. A viewshed is created from a [[digital elevation model|DEM]] by using an algorithm that estimates the difference of elevation from one cell (the viewpoint cell) to the next (the target cell). To determine the visibility of a target cell, each cell between the viewpoint cell and target cell is examined for line of sight. Where cells of higher value are between the viewpoint and target cells the line of sight is blocked. If the line of sight is blocked then the target cell is determined to not be part of the viewshed. If it is not blocked then it is included in the viewshed (Kim et al., 2004).

The algorithm is also based on a given set of variables. When performing a viewshed analysis, several variables can be used to limit or adjust the calculation. For example, if the analysis is to determine the location of a radio tower, the height of the tower could be added to the elevation of that location (cell value). If no height is given, then the viewshed analysis uses the cell value of the DEM in which the tower is located.

Another way to add the height of the tower is to use an offset variable. Offset values can be added to a sending tower as well as a receiving tower. The offset value is then added to the elevation value of the cell to obtain the actual elevation of each tower.

The viewshed analysis can also have a limited viewing angle. The viewing angle, or [[azimuth]], of the radio tower can be incorporated into the calculation by adding two values. The first value is the lowest possible azimuth angle and the second value is the highest possible azimuth angle. The program will analyze the viewshed only within these given azimuth angles. 
A vertical angle can be added as well. The values for vertical angle are from 90° (looking straight up) to -90° (looking straight down). This variable would need to be added in cases where the radio tower emits a very narrow vertical beam.
The final variable used in the viewshed analysis is the radius value. In the case of the radio tower, if the radio signal has a limited range, perhaps 10 miles, then the radius variable can be set to limit the viewshed analysis to a 10-mile radius.

== Viewshed analysis uses ==
Besides tower placement a viewshed analysis can be used for other applications. For example, a viewshed analysis could estimate the impact of the addition of a large building. The viewshed analysis would show all the areas from which the building could be seen as well as any views that would be obscured from any particular location. Viewshed analyses are also used to locate [[fire lookout tower|fire observation stations]] in mountain areas (Lee and Stucky, 1998). This allows the stations to be placed so that the entire forest can be observed for possible fires.

An example of using a viewshed analysis on a line segment is from the [[Wyoming]] State Office, [[Bureau of Land Management]], in which the office used a viewshed analysis to determine the visibility from [[National Historic Trail]]s across Wyoming. Within the Rock Springs Field Office area there are five different viewsheds to choose from. The example here is viewshed number one. The viewshed indicates the land areas visible from the trails at four different levels from not visible to visible, based on the number of times the area could be seen from the trail. This is an indication of what the pioneers could see as they traveled along the trails of the western frontier (Rock Springs Field Office).

== A unique viewshed analysis ==
[[File:mars viewshed.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gusev (Martian crater)|Gusev crater]] on Mars: the viewshed (red) is overlaid on an elevation map]]
In another example the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) used a viewshed analysis to assist [[NASA]]'s [[Mars Exploration Rover]] (MER) project. When NASA needed to find appropriate landing spots for the [[Mars]] rovers, they turned to the USGS to map the best possible sites. Part of the analysis included a viewshed of the possible site selections. In this case the viewshed indicates the areas which may or may not be visible by the Mars rovers from each landing site (MER Landing Site Viewshed Analysis).

Women have made significant contributions to [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]], a genre which predates Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in Latin America in 1492 and the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. The earliest musicians were [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s across the continent, whose lyrics "reflect conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all [[human experience]]." Indigenous communities reserved [[women in music|music for women]], who were given equal opportunities with men to teach, perform, sing, and dance. [[Ethnomusicologist]]s have measured ceramic, animal-bone, and cane [[flute]]s from the [[Inca Empire]] which indicate a preference for women with a high [[vocal range]]. Women had equal [[social status]], were trained, and received the same opportunities in music as men in indigenous communities until the arrival of Columbus in the late 15th century. European settlers brought patriarchal, [[machismo]] ideologies to the continent, replacing the idea of equality between men and women. They equated [[Native American music|native music]] with "savagery" and European music with "civilization". Female musicians tended to be darker-skinned as a result of the [[slave trade]] (which increased the population of [[African slaves]]), and contemporary society denigrated music as a profession. Latin music became Africanized, with [[syncopated]] [[rhythm (music)|rhythms]] and [[call-and-response]]; European settlement introduced [[harmony]] and the Spanish [[décima]] song form.

Since the [[history of sound recording|pre-recording era of music]], Latin music was male-dominated, and there are relatively few examples of female [[songwriter]]s, [[music producer]]s, [[record executive]]s, and [[music promoter|promoters]]. Women lacked access to musical training; music programs were nonexistent, and cultural norms discouraged female participation. Latin music had a primarily male presence; men discriminated against women, limiting them to singing or dancing and discouraging them from becoming [[instrumentalist]]s, writers, [[List of women composers|composers]], [[music arranger|arrangers]], and executives. Women artists in the sub-genres of Latin music, such as [[Selena]], [[Jenni Rivera]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Ivy Queen]], [[Julieta Venegas]], and [[Ely Guerra]]. have been credited with enhancing the genres' female presence; they have broken through barriers, reshaping Latin music and public perceptions of [[female sexuality]], gender, and [[femininity]]. Women in [[salsa music]] are significantly underrepresented in the industry as very few women, with the exception of [[Celia Cruz]], have been associated with the emergence of the genre; for example, in the British documentary ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cites'' (1985), Cruz is one of the only female singers who is mentioned.

Women Latin singers have a significant demographic imbalance on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[music charts]] compared with their male counterparts. As radio formats explore genres popularized and led by men, such as [[reggaeton]] and [[regional Mexican music]], women on the ''Billboard'' Latin music charts are periodically absent. The last female singer with a number-one single was [[Sofia Reyes]], whose collaborative "[[Solo Yo]]" ended a five-year drought on the [[Latin Pop Songs]] chart in 2016. A year earlier, on the 50-position [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart, 22 weeks passed without a song by a women. Reyes has expressed concern about the disparity between male and female performances at Latin music award shows, noting that 90 percent of the performers are male. Other female singers, such as [[Chiquis Rivera]], have attributed the decline in visibility of women in Latin music to  [[sexist]] radio programmers. Latin music executive Alexandra Lioutikoff believes that the decline is due to a lack of female collaboration. Latin music remains male-dominated, and the [[music industry]] has "prejudiced practice" limiting female recording artists.

== Characteristics ==
Latin American music is varied; it includes thirty countries, influenced by [[European music|European]], [[African American music|African]], and [[Native American music|Amerindian]] cultures.{{sfn|Roberts|1999|p=3}} Latin music uses two European languages: [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], though modern-day widely distinguishes the genre as primarily sung or recorded in Spanish and to a lesser extent [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].{{sfn|Roberts|1999|p=3}} Although heterogeneous, Latin music commonly includes the Spanish [[décima]] song form, African [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[rhythm (music)|rhythms]] and [[call-and-response]], and European [[harmony (music)|harmony]].{{sfn|Miller|2008|p=254}}

[[File:Peru Tembladera Figure flute player DMA 1971-19.jpg|thumb|alt=Squat, reddish ceramic figurine of a person holding a flute|Pre-Columbian ceramic figurine of a Peruvian flute player]]
Pre-modern Latin music refers to music made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=1}} hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s across the continent.{{sfn|Navarro|Sánchez|Ali|1999|p=5}} The first inhabitants of Latin America settled 30,000 years before the arrival of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] at the peak of native cultural diversification into simple and complex societies.{{sfn|Preston|2014|p=11}} These societies included sedentary agricultural tribes and [[hunter gatherers]],{{sfn|Preston|2014|p=11}} who sang [[prayer]]s to a deity asking for prosperity{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=1}} with lyrics of "conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience" and music reflecting their understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=5}} They had "intricate ways of explaining the relationships between the sound, social organization, time, and the sacred",{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=5}} and their rituals included dramatized performances of mythology vocalizing their view of [[creationism|creation]].{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=8}} The creation myth of the [[Keres people]] of [[Laguna Pueblo]] (present west-central [[New Mexico]]) describes "the unformed cosmos as the domain of [[Tse che nako]] (Thought Woman or Spider Woman) who [[chant]]s life into two sacred bundles that become the sisters [[Keres (mythology)|Uretsete and Naosete]] (She Who Matters and She Who Remembers)."{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=8}}

Indigenous communities predating Columbus' arrival reserved [[women in music|music for women]], although men were equally involved in dance.{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=170}} During the [[Inca Empire]] in the mid-14th century, women from royal families and selected ''acallas'' (chosen ones) were taught science, art, poetry, and music from "wise elders".{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} The "chosen ones" were selected for their beauty and "quality of their voices."{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} There were six houses, one of which was called the ''taquiaclla'' (''taqui'' means "song"),&lt;!-- In what language? --&gt; which housed girls aged nine to fifteen with "gifted" singing voices.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} The [[Andean civilizations|Andeans]] preferred young women with a high [[vocal range]].{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} Although no scripts or musical notation survive, archaeologists have uncovered a variety of ceramic, animal bone, and cane [[flute]]s.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} [[Ethnomusicologist]]s who have measured the flutes have found their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] compatible with a high vocal range.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} Women in these communities were well-treated,{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=34}} with equal opportunities to teach, perform, sing, and dance (as soloists, with other women, or in pairs with men).{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=139}} Female singers had a social status equal to men, receiving musical training and opportunities with their male counterparts.{{sfn|Sturman|2015}}

[[File:Columbus landing on Hispaniola adj.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Europeans and natives meeting, with ships and a missionary cross in the background|Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Americas and Spanish colonization brought patriarchy and machismo to Latin music.]]
Columbus' arrival in 1492 and the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] brought [[patriarchy]] and [[machismo]] to the continent, overriding sexual equality.{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=34}} Early [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]] described women as "property and mistrusted [by men]."{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} In a song, "Delgadina", women are servants who must please their men "no matter the cost."{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} According to author Janet Sturman, the Iberian idea of machismo (in which a strong man is superior to others, including women) was held by the [[conquistadors]].{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} Europeans who settled in the [[New World]] associated native music with "savagery" and European music with "civilization".{{sfn|Berglund|Johnson|Lee|2016|p=17}} During the [[slave trade]], musicians in Latin America primarily had a dark complexion.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} This was due to an increased population of African slaves and contemporary society's view of music as a profession.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} Most slaves arriving in Brazil were "bi-musical",&lt;!-- "Bi-musical" needs explanation. --&gt; and introduced their music to [[Music of Brazil|the country]].{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} Rural [[Quechua language|Quechua]]-speaking [[Bolivia]]n farmers sang about European resistance in songs with Native American and European influences.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=439}} [[Dark skin|Black]] Bolivians sang songs with lyrics reflecting a European influence, performed as Africanized European music.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=439}}

In colonial Latin America, [[nun]]s wrote, directed, and performed music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} They played a variety of instruments, including the [[clavichord]], [[harp]], [[flageolet]], and flute.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} The nuns played in front of spectators, choirs, and high-ranking government officials.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} Musically-adept, underprivileged women were allowed to perform during the nuns' [[Christmas]] recital.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} Performances were often "feminine acts", such as sewing, embroidery, bakery, and selling "special confections."{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} For two hundred years in Latin America, the "elite woman" was educated in the arts; "the rest" were consigned to cooking, sewing, spinning, weaving, embroidery, and music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=167}} In 17th- and 18th-century [[Mexico City]], music was often heard by visitors.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} The music emanated from cathedral choirs, indigenous dancers, or black musicians organized in the city.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} During the 17th century, Europeans and their descendants wrote and performed music at cathedrals in Mexico's cities which was repeated in song by [[black people|blacks]], [[mulatto]]s, indigenous Mexicans, [[Asian people|Asians]], and ethnicities.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=49}} In 1690, Mexican author [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] wrote secular and religious poetry, plays, philosophy, and theology.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}} She often discussed topics ranging from mathematics to music with visitors, had no interest in marriage and wanted to pursue "a life of the mind."{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}} Although her views were suppressed, de la Cruz defended [[women's rights]] in education.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}}

At a 1691 celebration, European traveler Juan de Galde described his participation in dancing and singing and placing a [[scapular]] on two young women in Mexico.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} A Mexican singer named Reina performed for six hours, which made "the event more enjoyable".{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|pp=50-51}} The "wild" celebration banned [[Jamaicans]] from entry.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=51}} In 1697, Neapolitan chronicler Gemelli Carreri wrote during his trip off the coast of the [[Dominican Republic]] that he saw a canoe of musicians trying to outdo each other in singing and drawing attention to their "perfection".{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} In 1799 [[Buenos Aires]], privileged women were encouraged to educate themselves in the arts.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=170}} The government required that women be taught to read and write, in addition to physical education and music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=170}}

=== {{anchor|Pre-recorded era of Latin music}}Before recordings ===
Since the arrival of European settlers, Latin music has been male-dominated.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Musical training was nonexistent for women.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Male predominance in the genre left "power imbalances that acted as barriers to women's participation in Latin music."{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Despite this barrier, women have become successful.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Under the authority of men, they were limited to roles as [[vocalist]]s or dancers rather than [[instrumentalists]], writers, composers, [[music arranger|arrangers]], and executives.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} According to musicologist [[Ilan Stavans]], female roles were related to traditional norms; "decent women" cared for their children and remained at home, cleaning and cooking.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Women's dance routines were a growing concern among female fans and performers.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Female dancers, more closely scrutinized than males, were expected to follow "normative gender expectations" and exhibit "appropriate behavior".{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} Although male dancers typically performed suggestively, women who danced similarly were accused of being "loose" or "slack".{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}}

[[File:Celia Cruz 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of Celia Cruz onstage in a fluffy gown|[[Celia Cruz]], who broke barriers against women in [[salsa music]], was instrumental in popularizing the genre.]]
According to author Lise Waxer, Cuban [[trova]] singer [[María Teresa Vera]] is the "great-grandmother of all Latin women singers".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=147}} "Arroz Con Leche" ("Rice Pudding"), which advises the listener to find a spouse who will take care of them, was criticized by [[feminist]] groups.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=37}} [[Bolero]] lyrics have a central theme of women as the object of male desire, [[unrequited love]], and abandonment, portraying women as "physical absence and emotional distance, as ungrateful beings" unequipped to love a man.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Cuban singer [[La Lupe]] "pushed the boundaries" of bolero music, and was called the queen of [[Latin soul]] music.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} She toured the U.S. with bandleader [[Tito Puente]], and was one of the most popular Latin performers of the 1960s.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} In her youth she dominated local singing competitions, which inspired her to pursue a career in music despite her parents' desire for her to become a teacher.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} After divorcing her first husband, La Lupe began a solo career and performed in [[Havana]] nightclubs.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Her popularity grew, and she owned and operated a nightclub in Cuba which was seized by the [[Cuba under Fidel Castro|Castro government]].{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} La Lupe emigrated to the United States, settled in New York in 1962 and began touring the country with other bolero and salsa performers.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} She released several salsa albums with "devotional lyrics."{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Her concert requests began diminishing at the turn of the 1970s as her savings drained because of her second husband's failing health.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} She ended her professional career in a wheelchair at a final, 1985 concert with Puente to help pay her medical expenses.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} La Lupe, who devoted her remaining years to [[Christian music]] in [[the Bronx]], died of [[cardiac arrest]] in February 1992.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Cuban singers [[Rita Montaner]] and [[Celeste Mendoza]] were involved in the "appropriation and rearticulation of [[rhumba|rumba]]", a genre popular before salsa.{{sfn|Poey|2014}}
 
As [[salsa music]] grew in popularity, [[Celia Cruz]] emerged during the 1950s and was known as the queen of the genre.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} Although Cruz was instrumental in popularizing and developing male-dominated salsa,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} few other women are associated with it.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} She was the only female singer featured in the British documentary, ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cities'' (1985), which noted the absence of women in the industry.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} According to the documentary, women were "not trained in popular music and that women dared not improvise—''sonear'' (closeness)—on stage".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Cruz crossed boundaries set by public expectations for music performed at nightclubs, but she was the exception who proved the rule.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} Opportunities for all-female salsa bands were nonexistent; gender discrimination flourished in the market, and women were seen as "less competent than their male counterparts."{{sfn|Poey|2014}} In 1977 Cruz recorded "Usted Abusó", which gave a voice to [[violence against women|battered women]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} The 1980s saw the emergence of [[salsa romántica]], which was "deemed as homogenized, depoliticized, and ultimately, feminized."{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}}
 
[[File:Gloriaestefan ahoy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Gloria Estefan onstage, singing and holding flowers|In 1993, [[Gloria Estefan]] was the first musician to debut an album atop the ''Billboard'' [[Top Latin Albums]] chart.]]
During the 1990s women began playing a larger role in salsa music,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=14}} increasing the genre's popularity,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} and female salsa singers broke "the sexist boundaries of the [Latin] music industry".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=147}} Although women singers were becoming more popular, images of men were emphasized to the public more than those of women.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=14}} [[La India]], Corinne, [[Brenda K. Starr]], [[Lissette Melendez]], and Yolanda la Duke were instrumental in refining salsa in that decade, although all were managed by men.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} Their new salsa sound was influenced by African American music ([[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[jazz music|jazz]], and [[soul music|soul]]), which revolutionized traditional 1970s salsa.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} According to author Lise Waxer, a "careful and attentive listening" of their recordings indicated the "female authority and influence—a female genealogy—of salsa music."{{sfn|Waxer|2002|pp=136, 147}} Salsa's leading female singer was [[La India]],{{sfn|Candelaria|2004|p=412}} who developed salsa romantica music during the 1990s and whose lyrics "turn the tables" on the male salsa narrative of women as objects of desire, "cruel and evil or idealized and unattainable."{{sfn|Poey|2014}} In her most-popular song, "[[Ese Hombre (Rocío Jurado song)|Ese Hombre]]" (originally recorded by [[Rocío Jurado]]), La India contradicts male stereotypes.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} The song's lyrics describe a man who is "a fool/stupid and conceited/selfish and capricious", reversing male "discursive terrorism" toward their female partners.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} La India has been compared to Celia Cruz as leaders in their respective eras,{{sfn|Candelaria|2004|p=413}} and to La Lupe in musical style: "nasal style of singing, growls, and screams that evoke an androgynous style rather than a soft melodious tone."{{sfn|Poey|2014}}

In her Spanish-language debut, [[Gloria Estefan]] released ''[[Mi Tierra]]'' (1993). It was a commercial success, debuting atop the new US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Latin Albums]] chart. Estefan has been described by her [[Latin pop]] contemporaries as performing [[pop ballad]]s and [[soft rock]].{{sfn|Aparicio|2010|p=113}} She has also ventured into salsa and [[merengue music]], using salsa in her English-language compositions; "[[Conga (song)|Conga]]" brought her to European clubs.{{sfn|Broughton|Ellingham|Trillo|1999|p=499}} The rural Cuban genre [[guajira (music)|guajira]] offered a musical identity to [[Afro-Cuban]]s;{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=305}} [[Albita Rodriguez]] became popular, and was named one of the top 100 personalities of the 20th century by ''[[Newsweek (magazine)|Newsweek]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Novas|2007|p=323}} Most of her repertoire are love songs with "openly erotic lyrics" with hetero- and homosexual themes.{{sfn|Aparicio|2010|p=243}}

The duo of [[Monchy y Alexandra]] "established [[bachata (music)|bachata]] as a [[easy listening|'nice']] music that could be listened to in the home by women and children."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=91}} Women "embraced [the] clean-up"; the romantic bachata style, with emotive lyrics, expressed longing for a lost lover.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=91}} In 1950s bachata music, women were accused of "treachery or promiscuity or, in more humorous moments, referring to [[women sexuality|their sexuality]] and sexual organs with thinly veiled double entendres."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=89}} The lyrics were rooted in an era where [[women in the workplace]] became more common, displacing men as [[breadwinner]]s.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=89}}

In 19th-century merengue music, a man "won the love of woman" by dancing.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=34}} Modern merengue (a [[club music|party]] genre) lyrics explored the "vicissitudes of urban life [and] employed skillful wordplay and humorous double entendres about women and sex."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=88}} Because of the genre's "air of male-dominated sexuality", [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] men believed that making merengue music is "no fitting occupation for women."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} According to [[Santo Domingo|Santo Domingans]], listening to merengue music "is only for men" and a woman who enjoys the music is considered "a crazy girl [and] a bad girl."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} During the 1970s, attitudes toward women and merengue music changed with the changing roles of women in Dominican society.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} All-female merengue bands emerged in the 1980s, beginning with [[Las Chicas Del Can]] in 1984.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} Participation in merengue increased in 1990, with women playing [[percussion]] and [[brass]] instruments formerly considered too difficult for women.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}}

Female merengue bands were often formed by successful male merengue musicians, who "often referred to them as the property of the [male musicians who formed them]."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} The mainly-female merengue band [[Milly y los Vecinos|Milly, Jocelyn y Los Vecinos]] formed after Las Chicas del Can.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} The group became popular, despite not setting out to challenge existing gender roles.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} Feminists have noted the "limited values" in merengue recordings by women, since most of their songs are written by men who "do not resolutely challenge patriarchal attitudes."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=118}} [[Olga Tañón]] was the most successful female merengue artist in the 1990s,{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=88}} and has been called the queen of merengue music.{{sfn|Steingress|2002|p=13}} Tañón has been credited with popularizing merengue in [[Music of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], a salsa-dominated market.{{sfn|Morales|2003|p=248}} Her 1994 album, ''Siente el Amor'', outsold her previous recordings: ''[[Mujer de Fuego]]'' (1993) and her platinum-certified debut studio album, ''[[Sola]]'' (1992).{{sfn|Morales|2003|p=248}}

Since the [[history of radio|beginning of radio]] women have been accepted as [[mariachi]] singers, often performing duets with men.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=467}} The Mexican quintet Las Coronelas, formed by María Carlota Noriega during the 1940s, was the first mariachi [[all-female band]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=467}} The first all-female [[ranchera]] band, Las Generales (formed by Elena Muñoz), consisted of wives and mothers of male professional mariachi musicians.{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} The group was criticized by the public for playing in ''[[cantina]]s'' ([[bar]]s),{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} and their partners destroyed their instruments.{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} Other all-female bands tried unsuccessfully to be pioneers.

At the turn of the decade, Tejano music was the fastest-growing music genre in the United States.{{sfn|Anon.|1996|p=10}} The American singer [[Selena]] dominated Tejano music, bringing it [[mainstream]] success.{{sfn|Lomelí|Ikas|2000|p=58}}{{sfn|Stavans|1998|p=5}} During her early career, she was often turned down by music venues because of her age and her fronting of [[Selena y Los Dinos|a Tejano band]].{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=112}} Selena's father, [[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]] was told that she would not be successful because she was a woman.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=112}} She was the first female Tejano singer to receive gold and platinum certifications,{{sfn|Roterman|1995}}{{sfn|Richmond|1995|p=48}} the first female Tejano singer to receive a [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Grammy Award for Best Mexican American Album]],{{sfn|Stacy|2002|p=746}} the first Tejano singer to top the US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Latin Albums]] chart,{{sfn|Lannert|1994 (a)|p=34, 103}} and the first female to outsell male Tejano singers.{{sfn|Patoski|2000}}{{sfn|Acosta|2006}} After Selena's 1995 [[Murder of Selena|murder]], Tejano music waned in popularity.{{sfn|Paredez|2009|p=21}} Selena's popularity increased after her death, and she is the only Tejano singer with constant appearances on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=498}} Her posthumously-released album, ''[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]'' (1995), was the first recording by a Hispanic singer to debut atop the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.{{sfn|Marrero|2003|p=172}}{{sfn|Burr|2005|p=56}} Selena's music explored love, pain, strength and passion,{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=725}} and ''Billboard'' called her the best-selling Latin artist of the 1990s.{{sfn|Mayfield|1999|p=YE-16-18}} Latin music entered the mainstream market in the late 1990s, believed by music critics to be due to the death of Selena and the emergence of [[Ricky Martin]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Marc Anthony]],{{sfn|Márquez|2001}}{{sfn|Brill|2010}} with greater commercial success and worldwide recognition than ever before.{{sfn|Rivera-Servera|2012|p=10}}

As [[hip-hop]] and [[rap music|rap]] became popular in the United States during the 1990s, Latin singers began emulating them.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=333}} Men dominated the Latin urban scene; women were objectified, seen as accessories indicating male status.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=333}} Unlike the hip-hop and rap music scenes, their Latin equivalents did not formulate a female role model; female Latina urban singers failed to attain commercial success.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=333}} During the popularity of [[Latin freestyle]] (also called freestyle music or [[Latin hip-hop]]) in the 1980s, record companies began signing "attractive young women with little musical talent using the same production style for all of them, weakening rather than strengthening the style."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=64}} Many Hispanic freestyle singers tried to downplay their Latino identity after radio programmers discriminated against records by Hispanic performers.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=64}} Lisa Velez changed her name to [[Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam|Lisa Lisa]], and became one of the first commercially successful freestyle musicians.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=64}} Latin hip-hop singer Roja (one half of Rima Roja en Venus) expressed the difficulty of performing (in a male-dominated genre) a song which "insults based on having sex with the opponent's mother, sister, aunt; or calling each other by the names of women's sexual organs. It was bizarre: they were managing to totally objectify women, and at the same time make us invisible."{{sfn|Rigby|2015}} According to Roja, in her early career as a [[rapping|rap]] [[freestyler]] men tried to "shut [her] up".{{sfn|Rigby|2015}} Other female hip-hop singers, such as Argentinian [[MC]] Rebeca Lane and Ecuadorian Audry Funk, concur.{{sfn|Rigby|2015}} Argentinian Actitud María Marta, a hip-hop group formed in prison, has been called a pioneer and has inspired other female hip-hop singers.{{sfn|Rigby|2015}} 
 
[[Reggaeton]] dancers (to music exemplifying sexual desire) have received a negative public reception of their sexually-suggestive routines,{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} with most public outcry about this type of dance focusing on female morality.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} Reggaeton singer [[Ivy Queen]] addressed concerns in her 2003 single, "[[Quiero Bailar (song)|Yo Quiero Bailar]]", which confronts sexual accessibility; dancing suggestively with a man does not necessarily mean that she wants to sleep with him.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} Recording Reggaeton Women called Ivy Queen "the spokeswoman for females in reggaeton" after her 2005 debut album, and she remains the only woman visible in the genre.{{sfn|Rivera|Marshall|Hernandez|2010|p=239}} Reggaeton has been criticized for the roles women play.{{sfn|Rivera|Marshall|Hernandez|2010|p=256}} Recordings often reflect lyrics and dance routines suggesting [[doggy style]] sex, exemplifying machismo behavior and [[hypermasculinity]].{{sfn|Rivera|Marshall|Hernandez|2010|pp=2, 253, 256}} Most reggaeton songs "[circumscribe women] to dancing and fulfilling male sexual desire", which "eliminates almost all possibility of action and translates their presence into a prize or trophy that men exhibit, dominate, and manipulate."{{sfn|Rivera|Marshall|Hernandez|2010|p=256}} In Ivy Queen's song, "[[Chika Ideal]]", the singer introduces her female friend to "the dance floor to satisfy her man's fantasies and answer (with her body) each time he wants to call her."{{sfn|Rivera|Marshall|Hernandez|2010|p=256}} In reggaeton music videos, women often act out or "beg for sexual action" from male musicians.{{sfn|Rivera|Marshall|Hernandez|2010|p=269}} In [[Residente]]'s music video for "[[Chulin Culin Chunfly]]", women wore costumes and played police officers, bartenders, and servers.{{sfn|Rivera|Marshall|Hernandez|2010|p=270}} Before reggaeton became popular, Cuban singer [[Pedro Calvo]] invited preteens and middle-aged women onstage and began to "[go] [[Oral sex|down on them]]".{{sfn|Rivera|Marshall|Hernandez|2010|p=289}} Sexuality among young women in Cuba has been viewed as "normative learning behavior" descended from the Afro-Cuban [[Palo religion]], where men and women dance closely before "the man goes behind the women in a picaresque way" and emulates a "gesture of appreciation".{{sfn|Rivera|Marshall|Hernandez|2010|p=289}} Cover images of reggaeton records often feature women who are "voluptuous, provocative, and scantily clad."{{sfn|Rivera|Marshall|Hernandez|2010|p=263}}

After winning the inaugural Festival of Latin Song in Puerto Rico in 1969, Lucecita Benítez "single-handedly put Puerto Rico on the map."{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017|p=2}} Her winning song, "[[Génesis (Lucecita Benítez song)|Génesis]]", expressed "extreme male melancholy"; author Licia Fiol-Matta called Benitez a "masculine female" whose delivery "unexpectedly delivered this affect home."{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017|p=2}} Throughout her career, Benítez performed and recorded compositions atypical of Puerto Rican music; nonconforming to gender roles, they did not address heterosexual desire.{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017|p=2}} She survived several silencing attempts by those who disliked her music.{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017|p=2}} Women remain a minority in Puerto Rican music, although singers [[Myrta Silva]], [[Ruth Fernandez]], Ernestina Reyes, and La Calandria have achieved moderate success.{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017}}

The 1989 single "Virginidad Sacudida" by Mexican [[hardcore punk]] band Secta Suicida Siglo explores [[sexual repression]] among women, challenged [[heterosexism]] in Latin music, and opposed refraining from [[premarital sex]] for fear of being called a prostitute.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} Colombian singer [[Andrea Echeverri]]'s music "underlines the hybrid nature of Latin American culture"; called the most-important female [[rock en español]] interpreter, she "incorporates [her music with] the past rather than refusing it or mocking it."{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=86}} Echeverri is the lead singer of [[Aterciopelados]], the only female-led [[rock en español]] band.{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=86}} She pursues a feminist agenda with her music, which has made her popular in the "most revolutionary and controversial musical genres in Latin America."{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=86}} The singer grew up encouraged by her mother to sing boleros, ballads, and rancheras.{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=87}} She decided to continue her education in the arts, returning to music during the 1980s. Echeverri joined Delia y Los Aminoácidos in the 1990s; influenced by [[punk music|punk]] and hardcore music, the band's name was later changed to the Aterciopelados.{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=87}} Because of Echeverri's interest the band's repertoire focused on women's issues, with lyrics about women's relationships with men, and performed songs exploring domestic abuse, denouncing [[misogyny]] and "overdramatized passionate love", and examining Latin America's ideology and history of traditional love.{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=87}} As her popularity grew, Echeverri became a feminist icon and released an [[underground music|underground recording]]: ''[[Con el Corazón en la Mano (Aterciopelados album)|Con el Corazón en la Mano]]'' (1993).{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=87}} The album, intended as a [[demo (music)|demo]], reached the top ten in Colombia and piqued the interest of [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Music Group]] and [[MTV]].{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=87}} The band followed with ''[[El Dorado (Aterciopelados album)|El Dorado]]'' (1995) and went to [[London]] to produce ''[[La Pipa de la Paz]]'' (1996), which was certified gold in Colombia and received Aterciopelados' first nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album|Grammy Award for Best Latin Alternative Music Album]].{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=87}}

Although some female Latin singers have explored a range of feminist topics, including [[sexism]], [[domestic abuse]], and "reclaiming women's sexuality through their music", others (such as [[Julieta Venegas]]) have refrained from labeling themselves as feminists.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} Venegas said in a 2004 interview that her music has a "feminine point of view" and does not delve into feminism.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} Chilean [[Folklore|folklorist]] [[Violeta Parra]] recorded songs about failed heterosexual relationships, emphasizing men's incapability to commit to a woman.{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017}} Called the "bad girl" of Latin pop and the queen of Latin American rock music, [[Alejandra Guzmán]] has attained "tabloid notoriety for her flesh-baring displays on stage and for a series of controversial moves and wrong turns in her personal life"{{sfn|Manheim|n.d.}} but has been credited with breaking barriers in Latin music for women.{{sfn|Manheim|n.d.}} Her parents, [[Enrique Guzmán]] and [[Silvia Pinal]], often recorded and performed music together and were considered the Mexican [[Sonny and Cher]].{{sfn|Manheim|n.d.}}

Although women have been credited with reshaping Latin music and public perceptions of sexuality, gender, and feminism,{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=269}} the Latin music industry remains male-dominated.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} American musicologist Ilan Stavans credits Selena, Jenni Rivera, Jennifer Lopez, Ivy Queen, Julieta Venegas, and [[Ely Guerra]] for the visibility of women in Latin music.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} [[NPR]] named [[Maluca]], [[Bomba Estereo]], La Lupe, [[Gloria Trevi]], [[Chavela Vargas]], [[Tita Merello]], as "''las mostras'', fierce women of Latin music."{{sfn|Garsd|2016}} ''Billboard'' magazine named Selena as a "role model to Latinas everywhere",{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} and ''[[Latina (magazine)|Latina]]'' magazine named Gloria Estefan as "a role model for women across the globe."{{sfn|Palomares|2013}} According to ''Latina'', singers [[Rita Moreno]], Selena, Gloria Estefan, Celia Cruz, Shakira, and Jennifer Lopez "changed the world" with their work, achieved "more and [gave] more."{{sfn|Palomares|2013}} With Selena, Jenni Rivera has been credited with the visibility of women in regional Mexican music with the "very large population of [[Mexican American]] women in the United States [with whom they] could identify".{{sfn|Cobo|2013|p=1993}} In Tejano music, Selena's popularity has helped "open the doors" to other female singers.{{sfn|San Miguel|2002|p=118}} Because of the singer's influence, women in Tejano music emerged "as a significant [demographic]" in the genre during the 1990s and major record labels began increasing their female representation.{{sfn|San Miguel|2002|p=118}} After Selena, women were "a significant part of [the Tejano and regional Mexican music] industry."{{sfn|San Miguel|2002|p=118}} Her ''Dreaming of You'' (1995) album topped the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, the first Hispanic artist and the first woman to do so.{{sfn|Dickerson|2010}} At the turn of the 21st century, Thalía, Paulina Rubio, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, and [[Pilar Montenegro]] were the most popular female Latin pop singers.{{sfn|Cobo|2013|p=1}} Graciela Beltran, Jennifer Pena, [[Ana Gabriel]], and [[Paquita la del Barrio]] were the most popular female singers in their respective regional-Mexican genres,{{sfn|Cobo|2013|p=1}} but female singers remain "rare" in regional Mexican music.{{sfn|Cobo|2013|p=1}} ''[[People en Espanol]]'' named singers [[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero]], [[Chiquis Rivera]], and Jennifer Lopez in its 2017 list of the top 25 most-powerful Latina women.{{sfn|Diaz|2017}} ''Billboard'' released a list of the top 100 music executives, which included Maria Fernandez (senior vice president operations and CFO of Latin Iberia-[[Sony Music Entertainment]]) and Rocio Guerrero (global head of Latin content programming for [[Spotify]]).{{sfn|Anon.|2016 (b)}}

Although women in mariachi music are perceived to be widely accepted, contemporary female singers in the genre have found it an "unwelcoming environment for females."{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=467}} According to the [[Duranguense]] group Los Horóscopos de Durango, in 21st-century regional Mexican music it is "hard for women to actually be respected, to be taken into consideration, to be given the time to show [their] talent."{{sfn|Guerra|2015}} The group has found the genre a "struggle" because of male dominance.{{sfn|Guerra|2015}} In 2017, [[Univision]] broadcast the [[reality television]] competition show ''La Reina de la Canción'' (''Queen of Song''), in which participants with "the best voices, compelling stories, and a desire to become a superstar" compete to become the next star of regional Mexican music.{{sfn|Villafañe|2017}} ''Billboard'' executive director of Latin content and programming [[Leila Cobo]] wrote that the public perception of regional Mexican music is a group of men dressed as cowboys.{{sfn|Cobo|2007|p=24}} In the 2004 and 2005 year-end charts, only one female in the genre reached the top twenty; in 2006, there were three.{{sfn|Cobo|2007|p=24}} That year, three singles by women topped the Hot Latin Songs chart: Shakira's collaborative single with [[Wyclef Jean]], "[[Hips Don't Lie]]"; Paulina Rubio's "[[Ni Una Sola Palabra]]", and [[Anaïs (singer)|Anais]]' "[[Lo Que Son Las Cosas]]".{{sfn|Cobo|2009|p=10}} In 2008, there were no number-one singles by a woman on the Latin music charts.{{sfn|Cobo|2009|p=10}} Early in 2009 Jennifer Lopez ended the drought with "[[Qué Hiciste]]" (number one for a week), followed by Gloria Estefan's "[[No Llores]]" and [[Fanny Lu]]'s "[[Y Si Te Digo]]".{{sfn|Cobo|2009|p=10}} In August 2009 three women (Shakira, Paulina Rubio, and [[Nelly Furtado]]) made the top ten of the Hot Latin Songs chart, a "rare occurrence".{{sfn|Cobo|2009|p=10}} According to industry observers, women on the charts are "cyclical, as every couple of years a burst of estrogen appears on the typically testosterone-dominated Latin charts."{{sfn|Cobo|2009|p=10}}

[[File:Jenni Rivera in Concert.jpg|thumb|alt=Jenni Rivera taking a break during a performance|[[Jenni Rivera]]'s recordings have sparked debate in the [[Latino]] community on women's roles.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=671}}]]
Women finalists at the 2016 [[Billboard Latin Music Awards|''Billboard'' Latin Music Awards]] were outnumbered by men, which was described by the magazine as a "continuing [challenge] facing female artists in Latin music."{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} For 2017 [[International Women's Day]] and [[Women's History Month]], the [[music streaming]] service Spotify curated a playlist of women in Latin music.{{sfn|Flores|2017}} The playlist included music from Selena, Celia Cruz, and [[Natalia Lafourcade]].{{sfn|Flores|2017}} An April 2016 ''Billboard'' report noted the absence of women from the magazine's [[music chart]]s.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} The report found that the last female soloist topped the US [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart four years earlier: Shakira, with [[Maná]] (a male rock en español group), singing "[[Mi Verdad (song)|Mi Verdad]]".{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} In 2012 seven women had number-ones on the Top Latin Albums chart, compared with 33 men.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} ''Billboard'' executive Leila Cobo found that three of the seven women were veterans (Gloria Trevi, Thalía, and [[Ednita Nazario]]), and another three were deceased (Selena, Jenni Rivera, and [[Natalie Cole]].{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} [[Leslie Grace]] was the youngest female singer to reach number one on the [[Latin Airplay]] chart when she was 17 years old,{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} and Alexandra Lioutikoff was the first woman executive vice-president at [[Universal Music Publishing Group]]'s Latin division.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} Asked why the visibility of women in Latin music has declined, [[Chiquis Rivera]] suggested that radio programmers are to blame for their "''machista'' culture."{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} According to Lioutikoff, women (unlike their male counterparts) "rarely collaborate".{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} In its report, ''Billboard'' compiled a list of the top five women with the most number-ones on the Hot Latin Songs; Gloria Estefan led the list with 15, Shakira had 10, Selena seven, Ana Gabriel six, and Paulina Rubio five.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} The magazine found women "underrepresented on the Latin-music-focused ''Billboard'' charts", with Rubio the last female number-one with "Me Gustas Todo" on February 11, 2012.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}} A discrepancy existed between the Top Latin Albums and the ''Billboard'' 200 charts; seven women topped the Latin Albums chart, compared to 21 on the ''Billboard'' 200.{{sfn|Cobo|2016}}

Women remain a minority in Puerto Rican music.{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017}} According to Licia Fiol-Matta, the [[music industry]] has a "prejudiced practice of limiting the number of women recording artists" and women singers "did not sell records since women did not buy records."{{sfn|Fiol-Matta|2017}} In July 2017, Alejandra Guzmán and Gloria Trevi were the first female collaboration in the 24-year history of the Top Latin Albums chart to debut atop the chart.{{sfn|Zellner|2017}} In 2016, Mexican pop singer [[Sofia Reyes]] was the first female lead singer with a number-one single in five years.{{sfn|Benjamin|2017}} Her collaboration with [[Prince Royce]] on "[[Solo Yo]]" was the first number-one single on the [[Latin Pop Songs]] chart by a woman since Jennifer Lopez' "[[On the Floor|Ven A Bailar]]" (2011) with [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]].{{sfn|Benjamin|2017}} Eight women have topped the Latin Pop Songs chart as featured acts, duos or groups with female leads: "Solo Yo" (Sofia Reyes with Prince Royce, April 23, 2016); "Mi Verdad" ([[Maná]], featuring Shakira, April 4, 2015); "[[Corre!]]" ([[Jesse &amp; Joy]], March 31, 2012); "[[Dutty Love]]" ([[Don Omar]] with [[Natti Natasha]], March 24, 2012), "[[Fuiste Tu]]" ([[Ricardo Arjona]] with [[Gaby Moreno]], March 10, 2012); "[[Give Me Everything]]" (Pitbull with [[Ne-Yo]], [[Afrojack]] and [[Nayer]], July 23, 2011), and "Ven A Bailar" (Jennifer Lopez with Pitbull, June 18, 2011).{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} Amaya Mendizabal of ''Billboard'' called the decline of women on the Latin music charts "an ongoing trend."{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} In 2015, 22 weeks passed without a female-led single on the 50-position Hot Latin Songs chart.{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} According to Mendizabal, the absence of women on the Latin music charts is "partly attributed to the steady popularity of reggaeton and regional Mexican music, which is often led by male acts."{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} Mendizabal wrote that "traditional pop songs" rarely top the Hot Latin Songs chart; four pop songs did so in the previous three years, most by men.{{sfn|Mendizabal|2016}} Sofia Reyes has expressed concern about the lack of women performers at Latin-music awards shows, telling Jeff Benjamin of [[Fuse TV]] that 90 percent of awards-show performers are men.{{sfn|Benjamin|2017}}

In July 2017, Spanish writer Daniela Bose noted the absence of women in Spanish music charts in comparison with those of [[Music of France|France]] and [[Music of Italy|Italy]]; culturally similar to Spain, women were more successful in the latter countries.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} Bose analyzed the [[Spanish Albums Chart|Spanish Albums]] and [[Spanish Singles Chart|Singles Charts]], finding that the only Spanish singers who placed in the top 50 were [[Malú]], [[Vanesa Martin]], Sweet California, [[India Martinez]], and the [[Spanish folk music]] singers [[Mónica Naranjo]] and [[Isabel Pantoja]].{{sfn|Bose|2017}} When Bose expanded her search to the next 50 positions, she found only non-Spanish singers.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} She concluded that listeners had replaced Spanish and [[Latin pop]] music with reggaeton and [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]], genres performed by men with lyrics belittling women "as meat".{{sfn|Bose|2017}} Bose found a [[subtext]] in the songs encouraging female [[infidelity]] for sexual reasons, alluding to a non-committed relationship.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} According to Bose, music "is not one of those 'secure' professions [for those who] seek stability"; she found women absent from prominent positions held by men, such as heading a record label, producing concerts, and [[audio engineer]]ing; in these fields, with higher pay and power, women lack "decision-making process[es] that set the path for [the Latin music] industry."{{sfn|Bose|2017}} She ended her report by urging the music industry to avoid gender imbalances in their markets: "What dazzles is the beauty of the final work, regardless of who creates it."{{sfn|Bose|2017}}

[[File:"Prove it with a Kodak".jpg|thumb|An early woman amateur photographer. Kodak advertisement from 1918]]

The participation of '''women in photography''' goes back to the very origins of the process. Several of the earliest women photographers, most of whom were from Britain or France, were married to male pioneers or had close relationships with their families. It was above all in northern Europe that women first entered the business of photography, opening studios in Denmark, France, Germany, and Sweden from the 1840s, while it was in Britain that women from well-to-do families developed photography as an art in the late 1850s. Not until the 1890s did the first studios run by women open in New York City.

Following Britain's [[The Linked Ring|Linked Ring]], which promoted artistic photography from the 1880s, [[Alfred Stieglitz]] encouraged several women to join the [[Photo-Secession]] movement which he founded in 1902 in support of so-called [[pictorialism]]. In Vienna, [[Dora Kallmus]] pioneered the use of photographic studios as fashionable meeting places for the Austro-Hungarian aristocracy.

In the United States, women first photographed as amateurs, several producing fine work which they were able to exhibit at key exhibitions. They not only produced portraits of celebrities and Native Americans but also took landscapes, especially from the beginning of the 20th century. The involvement of women in [[photojournalism]] also had its beginnings in the early 1900s but slowly picked up during [[World War I]].

==Early participants==

While the work of the English and French gentlemen involved in developing and pioneering the process of photography is well documented, the part played by women in the early days tends to be given less attention.&lt;ref name="Newhall1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhall|first=Beaumont|title=The history of photography: from 1839 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9xTAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=1982|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|isbn=978-0-87070-381-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beginnings===

Women were however involved in photography from the start. [[Constance Fox Talbot]], the wife of [[Henry Fox Talbot]], one of the key players in the development of photography in the 1830s and 1840s, had herself experimented with the process as early as 1839.&lt;ref name="Buckland1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckland|first=Gail|title=Fox Talbot and the invention of photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtBTAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=1980|publisher=D. R. Godine|isbn=978-0-87923-307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Ovenden]] attributes to her a hazy image of a short verse by the Irish poet [[Thomas Moore]], which would make her the earliest known female photographer.&lt;ref&gt;Maev Kennedy, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/09/bodleian-library-bid-fox-talbot-archive "Bodleian Library launches £2.2m bid to stop Fox Talbot archive going overseas"], ''The Guardian'', 9 December 2012. Retrieved 11 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Atkins]], a botanist, was also introduced to photography by Fox Talbot, who explained his "photogenic drawing" technique to her as well as his camera-based [[calotype]] process. After learning about the [[cyanotype]] process from its inventor, [[John Herschel]], she was able to produce cyanotype [[photogram]]s of dried algae. She published them in 1843 in her ''Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions'', said to be the first book with photographic illustrations.&lt;ref name="AtkinsSchaaf1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkins|first1=Anna|last2=Schaaf|first2=Larry John|last3=Kraus|first3=Hans P.|title=Sun gardens: Victorian photograms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ld5TAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=1985|publisher=Aperture|isbn=978-0-89381-203-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another botanist and keen amateur photographer, [[John Dillwyn Llewelyn]], was possibly introduced to photography by his wife Emma Thomasina Talbot, a cousin of Fox Talbot.&lt;ref name="Marien2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marien|first=Mary Warner|title=Photography: A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsolmLbz8igC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=978-1-85669-493-3|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife had shown an early interest in photography and did all his printing.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pritchard, [http://www.mpritchard.com/photohistory/history/llewelyn.htm "Llewelyn, John Dillwyn"], Michael Pritchard.

===The first professionals===

In France, [[Geneviève Élisabeth Disdéri]] was an early professional in the photography business. Together with her husband, [[André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri]] who is remembered for patenting the [[carte de visite]] process, she established a [[daguerrotype]] studio in [[Brest, France|Brest]] in the late 1840s. After Disdéri left her for Paris in 1847, she continued to run the business alone.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly E.

===Pioneering artists===
Two British ladies are remembered for their early contributions to artistic photography. In the late 1850s, [[Lady Clementina Hawarden]] began to take photographs. The earliest images were landscapes taken on the Hawarden estate in [[Dundrum, County Tipperary|Dundrum]], Ireland. After the family moved to London, in 1862 she converted the first floor of her [[South Kensington]] home into a studio, filling it with props which can be seen in her photographs. She specialised in portraits, especially of her two eldest daughters clad in the costumes of the day. Her work earned her silver medals at the exhibitions of the [[Royal Photographic Society|Photographic Society]] in 1863 and 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/pictures/the-scottish-aristocrat-whose-pioneering-photography-drew-admiration-from-lewis-carroll-1-2778249 Mike Merritt, "The Scottish aristocrat whose pioneering photography drew admiration from Lewis Carroll"], ''The Scotsman'', 7 February 2013.

Although her interest in photography did not begin until 1863 when she was 48 years old, she consciously set out to ensure photography became an acceptable art form, taking hundreds of portraits of children and celebrities. While her commitment to soft focus was frequently criticized as technically deficient during her lifetime, it later formed the basis for the [[Pictorialism]] movement at the beginning of the 20th century and is now widely appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/collections/permanent/object_genres/photographers/women/cameron.html "Artistic Portraiture: Julia Margaret Cameron"], Woman Photographers, UCR/California Museum of Photography.

===History of Female Photographers in America===

Prior to the roaring twenties there were little to non female photographers in existence. After the huge advancement in culture after the roaring twenties the number of photographers that were women increase drastically. Estimated to be about 5,000 female photographers. Despite there still being an apparent line of gender limitations photography allowed for females to bring forth their creativity. Along came with many different opportunities including different publications such as "American Amateur Photographer" that allowed for women photographers whether she was an amateur or not to further showcase their skills. With no longer being labeled as "a wife of a photographer" women who already have a keen eye for the fashionable side of things photographer seem to be strong suit for them.The emergence of women in photography can be attributed to the progressive era. Where the roles of women in our every day society were changed tremendously and reversed. This time period a vast number of women photographers were reportedly apart of photography organizations.

{{See also|Pictorialism}}
The use of photography as an art form had existed almost from the very beginning but it was towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century that under the influence of the American [[Alfred Stieglitz]] its artistic potential, termed [[pictorialism]], became widely recognized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsmia.org/get-the-picture/print/stieglitz.shtml "Get the Picture: Alfred Stieglitz"], Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

Their association with Stieglitz led in 1902 to their becoming co-founders of the [[Photo-Secession]] movement. They went on to take romantic, yet well composed portraits which were presented at influential exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/collections/permanent/object_genres/photographers/women/pictorialism.html "Gertrude Kasebier"], Women Photographers, UCR/California Museum of Photography.

==Evolving American participation==
Peter E. Palmquist who researched the history of women photographers in California and the American West from 1850 to 1950 found that in the 19th century some 10% of all photographers in the area were women while by 1910 the figure was up to about 20%. In the early days, most women working commercially were married to a photographer. Indeed, up to 1890, any woman working on her own was considered to be daring. As the process became easier to handle, more amateurs emerged, many participating in photographic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cla.purdue.edu/WAAW/palmquist/Essays.htm#e21 Peter E.

== African-American women in photography ==

=== History ===

Photographs are pictures ''about'' and ''of'' things (Birt). As society has evolved, African-American photographers have been critical in the preservation of authentic portrayals of images ''about ''and ''of ''black culture. The participation of African-American women in photography began to receive widespread acknowledgment in the mid-20th century and with growing recognition came a shift in focus on social, economic, and political conditions. Some of the most prominent female African-American photographers include [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Lorna Simpson]], and [[Coreen Simpson]].

==== Carrie Mae Weems ====
Born in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]] started her career in 1973 when she received her first camera. Her initial interest in the arts started in 1965, when she met lifelong friend Tom Vinters and began participating in street theater and dance. Though noted as an accomplished photographer, Weems' work spans text, fabric, audio, digital images, installation, and video. "…from the very beginning I've been interested in the idea of power and the consequences of power; relationships are made and articulated through power."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Carrie Mae Weems|last = Bey|first = Dawoud|date = Summer 2009|journal = BOMB|doi = |pmid = |jstor=40428266|pages=60–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; When exploring the idea of power, Weems oftentimes uses herself as the subject of her work, not for her own admiration, but "as a vehicle for approaching the question of power…"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Through different mediums, Weems has made it her mission to explore the family relationships, gender roles, the histories of racism, sexism, class and different types of political systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carriemaeweems.net/bio.html|title= Carrie Mae Weems|date= |accessdate=12 April 2015 |website = carriemaeweems|publisher = Lisa Goodlin Design|last = Weems|first = Carrie Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was introduced to [[Dawoud Bey]] in 1976 and developed a long lasting friendship and professional relationship with the photographer. While on a work trip to Europe, Bey interviewed Weems in BOMB, a magazine focused on artists in conversation. 
[[File:LornaSimpsonApr09 cropped.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Lorna Simpson]]

==== Lorna Simpson ====
[[Lorna Simpson]] began her career in fashion photography, taking pictures of people whose style she admired. Simpson was able to develop her skills and became a photojournalist who captured images in politics, culture, music, and sports.

Receiving her education in photography at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York and the [[University of California, San Diego]], Lorna Simpson was considered a pioneer of conceptual photography well before the peak of her career. Through her work, Simpson aims to challenge the traditional views of gender, identity, culture, history, and memory as viewed by society. Her combination of large-scale photography with meaningful text work together to provide strong visual implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lsimpsonstudio.com/#mi=11&amp;pt=0&amp;pi=6&amp;p=-1&amp;a=-1&amp;at=0|title = Lorna Simpson|accessdate =15 April 2015|website = Lorna Simpson Studio|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work can be found in museums across the country at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York|Museum of Modern Art]] (NY), the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (Chicago, IL), and the [[Walker Art Center]] (Minneapolis), and many others around the world.

==== Coreen Simpson ====
Making her mark as a photojournalist, [[Coreen Simpson]] started her career as a published writer. Her interest in documenting experiences in writing grew into a love for the visual arts when she contacted Essence magazine about an article she wanted to write about a business trip to the Middle East. Although the article was never published, her interest in photojournalism was heightened.

In his article "Coreen Simpson: An Interpretation", Rodger Birt describes looking at a photograph as being "let in on the workings of another human consciousness" allowing for the simultaneous opportunity to receive an authentic depiction of the physical world.&lt;ref name="Birt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birt|first1=Rodger|title=Coreen Simpson: An Interpretation|journal=Black American Literature Forum|date=1987|volume=21|issue=3|pages=289–304|jstor=2904032|doi=10.2307/2904032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her work, Simpson has created visual narratives that aesthetically tell the stories of diverse groups of people. Not only is she able to evoke emotional responses through her storytelling, but through design, [[chiaroscuro]], and color as well.

Simpson's friend, Walter Johnson, became one of her biggest mentors and guide as she expanded her knowledge in photography. She also studied Frank Stewart's process and developed a strong capacity for the history of photography. One of her biggest struggles was to differentiate her visual style from those of her inspiration.

The four greatest influences of Simpson's work include [[Diane Arbus]], [[Adolph de Meyer|Baron Adolph DeMeyer]], [[Joel Peter Witkin]], and [[Weegee]]. Whether conceptually, methodically, or creatively, each of these photographers have contributed to her approach in different ways.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2904032|title = Coreen Simpson: An Interpretation|last = Birt|first = Rodger|date = Autumn 1997|journal = Black American Literature Forum|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of her admiration for Arbus's uniqueness, Weegee's hunt, DeMeyer's study of the compostition, and Witkin's manipulation of the print work together in encompassing the personality of Coreen Simpson's work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Elizabeth "Tex" Williams'''

[[Elizabeth Williams (photographer)|Elizabeth "Tex" Williams]] was a world war 2 military photographer. She was in the last year of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29733207|title=Viewfinders : black women photographers|last=1951-|first=Moutoussamy-Ashe, Jeanne,|date=1993|publisher=Writers &amp; Readers Pub|isbn=0863161588|location=New York|oclc=29733207}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the first women to have a photography career beyond "camera girl".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
