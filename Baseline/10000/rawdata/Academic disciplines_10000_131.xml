'''Advanced Placement European History''' (commonly known as '''AP Modern European History''', '''AP Euro''', '''AP European''', '''APEH''', or '''MEHAP'''), is  a course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] through the [[Advanced Placement Program]]. This course is for [[high school]] students who are interested in a first year [[university]] level course in European history. The course surveys [[European history]] from between 1300-1450 CE to the present,&lt;ref&gt;{https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-european-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf} Retrieved on February 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on religious, social, economic, and political themes. In the [[United States]], the course is usually taken in [[sophomore]] year of [[high school]].

==The exam==
The [[Advanced Placement Exams|AP exam]] for European History is divided into two sections, comprising 55 multiple-choice questions (with four answer choices), three short-answer questions, and two essay responses (one thematic Long Essay Question (LEQ) and one [[Document Based Question]] (DBQ)).&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-european-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf European History Course Description] retrieved on September 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The multiple-choice and short-answer sections are to be completed in 55 minutes and 40 minutes respectively.  The essay section is to be completed in 100 minutes (including the mandated 15-minute reading period). The DBQ is graded out of 7 points and the LEQ is graded out of 6 points. This new structure went into effect beginning Fall 2017.
The exam grade is weighted evenly between the multiple-choice and free-response sections.  The DBQ is weighted at 25 percent while the FRQ/LEQ is weighted at 15 percent.  The Short Answer is weighted 20 percent. Approximately half of the multiple-choice questions cover the period from 1450 to the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic era]], and half cover the period from the French Revolution and Napoleonic era to the present, evenly divided between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  About one-third of the questions focus on [[Cultural history|cultural]] and [[Intellectual history|intellectual]] themes, one-third on [[Political history|political]] and [[Diplomatic history|diplomatic]] themes, and one-third on [[Social history|social]] and [[Economic history|economic]] themes. Many questions draw on knowledge of more than one chronological period or theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_questions/2085.html European History Exam Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is the general trend based on past AP Exams, it is not mandated that the exam follow this format. In recent years and present, the multiple choice portion is Stimulus Based, meaning the students are given an excerpt of a speech or writing, photograph, or painting, to analyze and answer questions and/or give presentations on the given info.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8303">'''Algorithm engineering''' focuses on the design, analysis, implementation, optimization, profiling and experimental evaluation of computer [[algorithms]], bridging the gap between algorithm theory and practical applications of algorithms in [[software engineering]].&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;"Algorithm Engineering", Camil Demetrescu, Irene Finocchi, [[Giuseppe Francesco Italiano|Giuseppe F. Italiano]], web: [http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~finocchi/papers/EATCSBullet.ps http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~finocchi/papers/EATCSBullet.ps]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a general methodology for algorithmic research.&lt;ref name="AEDef"&gt;"Algorithm Engineering – An Attempt at a Definition", [[Peter Sanders (computer scientist)|Peter Sanders]], web: [http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/definition.pdf http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/definition.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

In 1995, a report from an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]-sponsored workshop "with the purpose of assessing the current goals and directions of the Theory of Computing (TOC) community" identified the slow speed of adoption of theoretical insights by practitioners as an important issue and suggested measures to
* reduce the uncertainty by practitioners whether a certain theoretical breakthrough will translate into practical gains in their field of work, and
* tackle the lack of ready-to-use algorithm libraries, which provide stable, bug-free and well-tested implementations for algorithmic problems and expose an easy-to-use interface for library consumers.&lt;ref name="EOTCS"&gt;"Emerging Opportunities for Theoretical Computer Science", Aho, Johnson, Karp, Kosaraju, McGeoch, Papadimitriou, web: [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.9160 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.9160]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Scientists have encountered a widening gap between theoretical insights and their application in software engineering disciplines. While algorithm theory provides the mathematical foundation to discover ..., it often does not meet the practical requirements of software engineering. --&gt;
 
But also, promising algorithmic approaches have been neglected due to difficulties in mathematical analysis.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Algorithm engineering was mentioned as one of the approaches to speed up adoption .... --&gt;

The term "algorithm engineering" was first used with specificity in 1997, with the first Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE97), organized by [[Giuseppe Francesco Italiano|Giuseppe F. Italiano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.unive.it/~wae97 Workshop on Algorithm Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from algorithm theory==
 
Algorithm engineering does not intend to replace or compete with algorithm theory, but tries to enrich, refine and reinforce its formal approaches with [[experimental algorithmics]] (also called empirical algorithmics).

This way it can provide new insights into the efficiency and performance of algorithms in cases where
* the algorithm at hand is less amenable to algorithm theoretic analysis,
* formal analysis pessimistically suggests bounds which are unlikely to appear on inputs of practical interest,
* the algorithm relies on the intricacies of modern hardware architectures like data locality, branch prediction, instruction stalls, instruction latencies which the machine model used in Algorithm Theory is unable to capture in the required detail,
* the crossover between competing algorithms with different constant costs and asymptotic behaviors needs to be determined.&lt;ref name="AE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDEA"&gt;"Towards a Discipline of Experimental Algorithmics", Bernard M. E. Moret, web: [http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97865/files/dimacs_algorithmics.pdf http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97865/files/dimacs_algorithmics.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

Some researchers describe algorithm engineering's methodology as a cycle consisting of algorithm design, analysis, implementation and experimental evaluation, joined by further aspects like machine models or realistic inputs.
They argue that equating algorithm engineering with [[experimental algorithmics]] is too limited, because viewing design and analysis, implementation and experimentation as separate activities ignores the crucial feedback loop between those elements of algorithm engineering.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Realistic models and real inputs===

While specific applications are outside the methodology of algorithm engineering, they play an important role in shaping realistic models of the problem and the underlying machine, and supply real inputs and other design parameters for experiments.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Design===
Compared to algorithm theory, which usually focuses on the asymptotic behavior of algorithms, algorithm engineers need to keep further requirements in mind: Simplicity of the algorithm, implementability in programming languages on real hardware, and allowing code reuse.
Additionally, constant factors of algorithms have such a considerable impact on real-world inputs that sometimes an algorithm with worse asymptotic behavior performs better in practice due to lower constant factors.

===Analysis===
Some problems can be solved with heuristics and randomized algorithms in a simpler and more efficient fashion than with deterministic algorithms. Unfortunately, this makes even simple randomized algorithms ''difficult to analyze because there are subtle dependencies to be taken into account''.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Implementation===
Huge semantic gaps between theoretical insights, formulated algorithms, programming languages and hardware pose a challenge to efficient implementations of even simple algorithms, because small implementation details can have rippling effects on execution behavior.
The only reliable way to compare several implementations of an algorithm is to spend an considerable amount of time on tuning and profiling, running those algorithms on multiple architectures, and looking at the generated machine code.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Experiments===
See: [[Experimental algorithmics]]

===Application engineering===
Implementations of algorithms used for experiments differ in significant ways from code usable in applications.
While the former prioritizes fast prototyping, performance and instrumentation for measurements during experiments, the latter requires ''thorough testing, maintainability, simplicity, and tuning for particular classes of inputs''.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Algorithm libraries===
Stable, well-tested algorithm libraries like [[Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms|LEDA]] play an important role in technology transfer by speeding up the adoption of new algorithms in applications. 
Such libraries reduce the required investment and risk for practitioners, because it removes the burden of understanding and implementing the results of academic research.

==Conferences==
Two main conferences on Algorithm Engineering are organized annually, namely:
* Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA), established in 1997 (formerly known as WEA).
* SIAM Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX), established in 1999.

The 1997 Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE'97) was held in Venice (Italy) on September 11–13, 1997. The Third International Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE'99) was held in London, UK in July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baade's Window''' is an area of the sky with relatively low amounts of [[cosmic dust|interstellar "dust"]] along the line of sight from the Earth. This area is considered an observational "window" as the normally obscured [[Galactic Center]] of the [[Milky Way]] is visible in this direction. It is named for astronomer [[Walter Baade]] who first recognized its significance.  This area corresponds to one of the brightest visible patches of the Milky Way.

==History==
Walter Baade surveyed the stars in this area in the mid-1940s using the {{convert|100|in|m|sing=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] in California while searching for the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Up until this time the structure and location of the galactic center was not known with certainty.&lt;ref name="baadewindow"&gt;{{cite journal 
| title = A Search For the Nucleus of Our Galaxy

|date=August 1946
| bibcode = 1946PASP...58..249B
| doi = 10.1086/125835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Baade's Window is frequently used to study distant central [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] stars in visible and near-visible wavelengths of light. Important information on the internal geometry of the Milky Way is still being refined by measurements made through this "window". It is in the direction of the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].&lt;ref name="simbad"&gt;{{cite simbad
  | title=NAME Baade Window
  | accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The window is now known to be slightly "south" of the main central galaxy bulge. The window is irregular in outline and subtends about 1 degree of the sky. It is centered on the [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 6522]].&lt;ref name="windowwidth"&gt;{{cite journal

| doi = 10.1086/309976|arxiv = astro-ph/9512137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baade's Window is the largest of the six areas through which central bulge stars are visible.&lt;ref name="otherwindows"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment|OGLE]] and other observation programs have successfully detected [[extrasolar planets]] orbiting around central bulge stars in this area by the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Gravitational microlensing|gravitational microlensing]] method.

Stars observed in Baade's Window can be called BW stars, similarly giant stars can be called BW giants.

The '''Centre for Studies on Federalism''' (CSF) was established in November 2000 with the primary purpose of studying and researching the theory and practice of [[Federalism]] both as a  political doctrine and in its implementation in the institutional systems of the Modern [[State (polity)|state]]. CSF’s main focus is on the infra-national, macro-regional and global scale of federalism: it specifically considers [[regional integration]] at a time of [[globalisation]], with special reference to [[Europe]], its history and civilization, its progress towards unification and its future.

== Structure and mission ==

CSF is housed at the [[Collegio Carlo Alberto]] in [[Turin]]. It was established as a research centre jointly with the [[University of Pavia]] and [[University of Turin]], with the Foundation Compagnia di San Paolo, and was subsequently joined by the [[University of Milan]].  
The purpose of CSF – as stated in its Statute of Association is to promote and coordinate scientific research on studies on federalism, as well promoting and coordinating activities with member universities and other Italian and foreign international universities and research centres. Furthermore, CSF also cooperates with private and public agencies and bodies interested in promoting fostering the development of knowledge and implementation of federalist principles.  
The CSF is governed by a Board which sets the guidelines for the scientific projects and fund allocation, the Steering Committee, the Board of Auditors and by a Scientific Committee whose members are renowned international scholars and experts of federalism. The administrative and scientific staff also include researchers from several universities and fields of research, including Law, Economics, Social, Political Science and History. Lastly, CSF’s Library contains some 12,000 books volumes, subscribes to 70 newspapers, journals and magazines. It also houses 500 ones titles that are no longer in print as well as a number of special collections bequeathed to the Centre, such as the CIME Archive of  the Italian Council of the [[European Movement]] and the online document summary of the [[Altiero Spinelli]] Collection, of which the  hard copies are at Historical Archives of the [[European Union]] administered by the European University Institute in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eui.eu/Home.aspx# |title=European University Institute |access-date=2010-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511220935/http://www.eui.eu/Home.aspx# |archive-date=2010-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Research at the  CSF is aimed at furthering the development of knowledge on the various aspects of Federalism, promoting debate in the public arena by studying and researching the public arena through studies and research on the above and to encourage researchers and experts to contribute to the discussion on European and international issues. 
Our Research Papers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/research/research-programmes  Research Papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001953/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/research/research-programmes |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are addressed to Academia but also cover the facets and issues of interest for diplomats, politicians and several other professional arenas. 
Furthermore, CSF activity includes a number of editorial projects, in-depth studies, monitoring and surveying of global trends related to processes of federation, regional integration and international [[democracy]]. These include:

*	'''Perspectives on Federalism''': an online journal with a forum on federalism in all tiers of government – regional and global sub-national authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.on-federalism.eu/index.php  Perspectives on Federalism]&lt;/ref&gt;
*	'''Bibliographical Bulletin on Federalism''': an online quarterly offering providing an overview of articles on  Federalism from 700 Italian, English, French, German and Spanish journals and papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalism-bulletin.eu  Bulletin on Federalism]&lt;/ref&gt;
*	'''International Democracy Watch''': a portal whose purpose is to collect, compare and analyse a set of data to monitor  progress and developments of democracy, international institutions and agencies, assessing such changes through regular  monitoring;
*	Operations within the framework of the '''Common Security and Defence Policy''' (EU CSDP Operations): these projects are aimed at gathering information for a comparative analysis of military, policing and state operations within the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/eu-csdp-operations  EU CSDP Operations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001828/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/eu-csdp-operations |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*	The '''Fiscal Federalism Watch''' to gain a better understanding of the reorganization of the Italian public finance system in Italy and what the consequences of a constitutional reform needed for fiscal federalism would be&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/fiscal-federalism-watch  Fiscal Federalism Watch] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001833/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/fiscal-federalism-watch |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events and activities ==

CSF organises meetings and seminars jointly with other institutions and research bodies &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/resourches-and-links  CSF Partners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627002013/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/resourches-and-links |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to a more comprehensive understanding of certain topics or to the presentation of books some of which published by CSF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/publications/studies-series  CSF "Studies" Series] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001943/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/publications/studies-series |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Altiero Spinelli Lecture is the CSF’s most important academic event: a yearly conference with a keynote lecture (lectio magistralis) held by an internationally renowned expert or academic on a European or Federalist topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/lecture-altiero-spinelli  Lecture Altiero Spinelli] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001900/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/lecture-altiero-spinelli |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of naming the lecture after Altiero Spinelli, one of the founding fathers of European Federalism, came from the need for an ad hoc conference to study [[European integration]] more in depth. CSF also offers and Education programme, with post graduate courses in Law and Business,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/activities/training  L&amp;B] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001711/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/activities/training |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; organised with the Turin University Institute of European Studies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iuse.it/en/  IUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at offering advanced studies on law and economics with a special focus on to the internal EU market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13575">'''Centuriation''' (in Latin ''centuriatio'' or, more usually, ''limitatio''&lt;ref&gt;O. A. W. Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 134, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), also known as '''Roman grid''', was a method of land measurement used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. In many cases land divisions based on the survey formed a [[field system]], often referred to in modern times by the same name. According to [[O. A. W. Dilke]],&lt;ref&gt;O.A.W.Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 34, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; centuriation combined and developed features of land surveying present in Egypt, Etruria, Greek towns and Greek countryside.

Centuriation is characterised by the regular layout of a square [[grid plan|grid]] traced using [[Surveying|surveyors']] instruments. It may appear in the form of [[Roman roads|roads]], canals and agricultural plots. In some cases these plots, when formed, were allocated to [[Roman army]] veterans in a new [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], but they might also be returned to the indigenous inhabitants, as at Orange (France).&lt;ref&gt;A. Piganiol, ''Les documents cadastraux de la colonie romaine d'Orange'', XVIe supplément à ''Gallia'', Paris, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of centuriation is very important for reconstructing [[landscape history]] in many former areas of the [[Roman empire]].

==History==
The Romans began to use centuriation for the foundation, in the fourth century BCE, of new [[Roman colony|colonies]] in the ''ager Sabinus'', northeast of Rome. The development of the geometric and operational characteristics that were to become standard came with the founding of the Roman colonies in the [[Po valley]], starting with ''Ariminum'' ([[Rimini]]) in 268 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''Studi di storia romana e di diritto'', p. 415, 2001, {{ISBN|88-87114-70-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian law introduced by [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BCE, which included the privatisation of the ''[[ager publicus]]'', gave a great impetus to land division through centuriation.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' p. 416, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuriation was used later for [[land reclamation]] and the foundation of new colonies as well as  for the allocation of land to veterans of the many civil wars of the late Republic and early Empire, including the [[battle of Philippi]] in 42 BCE. This is mentioned by [[Virgil]], in his [[Eclogues]], when he complains explicitly about the allocation of his lands near [[Mantua]] to the soldiers who had participated in that battle.

Centuriation was widely used throughout [[Italy]] and also in some provinces. For example, careful analysis has identified, in the area between [[Rome]] and [[Salerno]], 80 different centuriation systems created at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Giacinto Libertini, ''Persistenza di luoghi e toponimi nelle terre delle antiche città di Atella e Acerrae'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==System and procedure==
Various land division systems were used, but the most common was known as the ''ager centuriatus'' system.

The surveyor first identified a central viewpoint, the ''umbilicus agri'' or ''umbilicus soli''. He then took up his position there and, looking towards the west, defined the territory with the following names:
* ''ultra'', the land he saw in front of him;
* ''citra'', the land behind him;
* ''dextera'', the land to his right;
* ''sinistra'', the land to his left.

He then traced the grid using an instrument known as a [[Groma surveying|groma]], tracing two road axes  perpendicular to each other:
* the first, generally oriented east-west, was called ''[[decumanus maximus]]'', which was traced taking as reference the place where the sun rose in order to know exactly where east was;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Anders | title=Castra et urbs romana: An Examination of the Common Features of Roman Settlements in Italy and the Empire and a System to aid in the Discovery of their Origins. | work=CAC Undergraduate Essay Contest for 2000-2001 | publisher=Classical Association of Canada | year=2001 | url=http://cac-scec.ca/concours_essais/01Bell.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the second, with a north-south orientation, was called ''[[cardo maximus]]''.

==Measurement instruments==
* [[Groma surveying|Groma]]
* [[Chorobates]] for levels
* [[Dioptra]] for levels and angles of slopes

==Orientation==
[[File:NE-PLSS.JPG|thumb|left|Example of road system in a PLSS area; [[Nebraska]] – US grid system]]
[[File:Centurisation.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Centuriation near [[Cesena]], [[Italy]], in a late nineteenth century Italian military map – Roman grid system]]
It has been suggested that the Roman centuriation system inspired [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s proposal to  create a grid of [[Survey township|townships]] for survey purposes, which ultimately led to the [[United States]] [[Public Land Survey System]]. The similarity of the two systems is empirically obvious in certain parts of Italy, for example, where traces of centuriation have remained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1451&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Thrower points out that, unlike the later US system, ''"not all Roman centuriation displays consistent orientation"''.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Joseph William Thrower, "Maps &amp; civilization: cartography in culture and society", The University of Chicago Press,  Chicago, 1972, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because, for practical reasons, the orientation of the axes did not always coincide with the four cardinal points and followed instead the orographic features of the area, also taking into account the slope of the land and the flow of rainwater along the drainage channels that were traced (centuriation of [[Florentia]] ([[Florence]]). In other cases, it was based on the orientation of existing lines of communication (centuriation along the [[Via Emilia]]) or other geomorphological features.

Centuriation is typical of flat land, but centuriation systems have also been documented in hilly country.

== Centuriation of the surrounding territory ==
Sometimes the ''umbilicus agri'' was located in a city or a [[castrum]]. This central point was generally referred to as ''groma'', from the name of the instrument used by the ''[[gromatici]]'' (surveyors).

In such cases, the grid was traced by extending the urban ''cardo maximus'' and  the ''decumanus maximus'' through the gates of the city into the surrounding agricultural land.

Parallel secondary roads (''limites quintarii'') were then traced on both sides of the initial axes at intervals of 100 ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|actus]]'' (about 3.5&amp;nbsp;km). The territory was thus divided into square areas.

The road network density was then increased with other roads parallel to those already traced at a distance from each other of 20 ''actus'' (710.40 m). Each of the square areas – 20 × 20 ''actus'' – resulting from this further division was called a ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|centuria]]'' or ''century''.

This dimension of the ''centuria'' became prevalent in the period when the large areas of the Po Valley were delimited, while smaller centuries of 10&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10 ''actus'', as the name ''centuria'' suggests, had formerly been used.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' page 415, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The land was divided after the completion of the roads.

Each century was divided into 10 strips, lying parallel to the ''cardo'' and the ''decumanus'', with  a distance between them of 2 ''actus'' (71.04 m), thus forming 100 squares (''heredia'') of about 0.5 hectares each: 100 ''heredia'' =  1 ''centuria''.

Each ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|heredium]]'' was divided in half along the north-south axis thus creating two ''jugera'': one ''[[jugerum]]'', from ''jugum'' (yoke), measured 2523 square metres, which was the amount of land that could be ploughed in one day by a pair of oxen.

==Regions where centuriation was used==
Even today, in some parts of Italy, the landscape of the plain is determined by the outcome of Roman centuriation, with the persistence of straight elements (roads, drainage canals, property divisions) which have survived territorial development and are often basic elements of urbanisation, at least until the twentieth century, when the human pressure of urban growth and infrastructures destroyed many of the traces scattered throughout the agricultural countryside.

===Significant examples of centuriation in Italy===

* [[Cesena]], and in particular the country to the north-east and north-west of the city;
* Central [[Romagna]];
* [[Padua]], eastern area of the province; in this area of [[Veneto|Venetia]], the geometrical layout of the landscape is known as the ''Graticolato Romano'';
* ''Ager Campanus'' (Acerra, Capua, Nola, Atella);

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5479">'''Chartered Physicist''' ('''CPhys''') is a [[chartered (professional)|chartered status]] and a [[professional qualification]] awarded by the [[Institute of Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/physicist.aspx|title=Job profiles: Physicist|website=National Careers Service|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted by the postnominals "CPhys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkqCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|page=xvii|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving chartered status in any profession denotes to the wider community a high level of specialised subject knowledge and professional competence. According to the Institute of Physics, holders of the award of the Chartered Physicist (CPhys) demonstrate the "highest standards of professionalism, up-to-date expertise, quality and safety" along with "the capacity to undertake independent practice and exercise leadership" as well as "commitment to keep pace with advancing knowledge and with the increasing expectations and requirements for which any profession must take responsibility".&lt;ref name="CPhys guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/membership/char-sta/chartership/cphys/page_51812.html|title=Chartered Physicist (CPhys)|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of Chartered Physicist was introduced in 1985 following approval from the [[Privy Council (UK)|Privy Council]]. It was originally granted  automatically with corporate membership of the Institute of Physics (IoP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtMiBPgdF6cC&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=125 Years: The Physical Society &amp; The Institute of Physics|author=John L. Lewis|publisher=CRC Press|date= 1 January 1999|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reform of the membership structure in 1998 saw Chartered Physicist established as a separate qualification from 2001 that could be gained either alongside or after the status of Member or Fellow of the IoP. In order to gain the qualification, a physicist must be appropriately qualified (an accredited MSci or [[MPhys]] integrated master's degree is standard, although experience leading to an equivalent level can be counted), have had a minimum of two years of structured training and a minimum of two years responsible work experience, have demonstrated a commitment to continuing professional development, and have gained a number of competencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/about/royal_charter/file_38390.pdf| title=Charter and Bylaws|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For physicists gaining the status from 2012, revalidation through proof of [[continuing professional development]] is required every three years.&lt;ref name="CPhys guidelines"/&gt; 

Chartered Physicist is considered to be equal in status to [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]], which the IoP also awards as a member of the [[Engineering Council UK]], and other chartered statuses in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/membership/char-sta/chartership/why/file_38066.pdf|title=Becoming Chartered by the Institute – Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics|quote="[Q]Which one [Chartered Physicist or Chartered Engineer] is best?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9056">The term '''Computational visualistics''' is used for addressing the whole range of investigating  pictures scientifically "in" the computer.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.jrjs.de/Work/Papers/P00/P00-2/index.html Schirra 2000]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[image|Images]] take a rather prominent place in contemporary life in the western societies. Together with language, they have been connected to human culture from the very beginning. For about one century – after several millennia of written word's dominance – their part is increasing again remarkably. Steps toward a general science of images, which we may call 'general visualistics' in analogy to general linguistics, have only been taken recently. So far, a unique scientific basis for circumscribing and describing the heterogeneous phenomenon "image" in an interpersonally verifiable manner hasstill been missing while distinct aspects falling in the domain of visualistics have predominantly been dealt with in several other disciplines, among them in particular [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[art history]]. Last (though not least), important contributions to certain aspects of a new science of images have come from computer science.

In [[computer science]], too, considering pictures evolved originally along several more or less independent questions, which lead to proper sub-disciplines: [[computer graphics]] is certainly the most "visible" among them. Only just recently, the effort has been increased to finally form a unique and partially autonomous branch of computer science dedicated to images in general. In analogy to [[computational linguistics]], the artificial expression ''computational visualistics'' is used for addressing the whole range of investigating scientifically pictures "in" the computer.

==Areas covered==
For a science of images within computer science, the abstract [[data type]] »image« (or perhaps several such types) stands in the center of interest together with the potential implementations (cf. [http://www.jrjs.de/Work/Papers/P05/P05-3/index.html Schirra 2005]). There 
are three main groups of [[algorithms]] for that data type to be considered in computational visualistics:

===Algorithms from »image« to »image«===
In the field called [[image processing]], the focus of attention is formed by the operations that take (at least) one picture (and potentially several secondary parameters that are not images) and relate it to another picture. With these operations, we can define algorithms for improving the quality of images (e.g., contrast reinforcement), and procedures for extracting certain parts of an image (e.g., edge finding) or for stamping out pictorial patterns following a particular Gestalt criterion (e.g., blue screen technique). Compression algorithms for the efficient storing or transmitting of pictorial data also belong into this field.

===Algorithms from »image« to "not-image"===
Two disciplines share the operations transforming images into non-pictorial data items. The field of [[pattern recognition]] is actually not restricted to pictures. But it has performed important precursory work for computational visualistics since the early 1950s in those areas that essentially classify information in given images: the identification of simple geometric Gestalts (e.g., "circular region"), the classification of letters (recognition of handwriting), the "seeing" of spatial objects in the images or even the association of stylistic attributes of the representation. That is, the images are to be associated with instances of a non-pictorial data type forming a description of some of their aspects. The neighboring field of [[computer vision]] is the part of AI ([[artificial intelligence]]) in which computer scientists try to teach – loosely speaking – computers the ability of visual [[perception]]. Therefore, a problem rather belongs to computer vision to the degree to which its goal is "semantic", i.e., the result approximates the human seeing of objects in a picture.

===Algorithms from "not-image" to »image«===
The investigation of possibilities gained by the operations that result in instances of the data type »image« but take as a starting point instances of non-pictorial data types is performed in particular in [[computer graphics]] and [[information visualization]]. The former deals with images in the closer sense, i.e., those pictures showing spatial configurations of objects (in the colloquial meaning of 'object') in a more or less naturalistic representation like, e.g., in virtual architecture. The starting point of the picture-generating algorithms in computer graphics is usually a data type that allows us to describe the geometry in three dimensions and the lighting of the scene to be depicted together with the important optical properties of the surfaces considered. Scientists in information visualization are interested in presenting pictorially any other data type, in particular those that consist of non-visual components in a "space" of states: in order to do so, a convention of visual presentation has firstly to be determined – e.g., a code of colors or certain icons. The well-known fractal images (e.g., of the [[Mandelbrot set]]) form a borderline case of information visualization since an abstract mathematical property has been visualized.

==Computational Visualistics Degree Programmes==
The subject of computational visualistics was introduced at the [[Otto-von-Guericke_University_Magdeburg|University of Magdeburg]], Germany, in the fall of 1996. It was initiated by Thomas Strothotte, Prof. for computer graphics in Magdeburg and largely supported by Jörg Schirra together with a whole team of interdisciplinary researchers from the social and technical sciences as well as from medicine.
This five-year diploma programme has computer science courses as its core: students learn about digital methods and electronic tools for solving picture-related problems. The technological areas of endeavour are complemented by courses on pictures in the humanities. In
addition to learning about the traditional (i.e. not computerized) contexts of using pictures, students intensively practice their communicative skills. As the third component of the program, an application subject such as biology and medicine gives students an early opportunity to apply their knowledge in that they learn the skills needed for co-operating with clients and experts in other fields where digital image data are essential, e.g. microscopy and radiologic image data in biology and medicine. Bachelor and Master's programmes have been introduced in 2006.  

The expression 'computational visualistics' is also used for a similar degree programme of the [[University of Koblenz and Landau|University at Koblenz-Landau]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4509">The '''Dana/Spicer Model 35''' is an automotive [[axle]] manufactured by [[Dana Holding Corporation]] since 1985 when [[American Motors]] (AMC) sold its axle [[machine tool|tooling]] equipment to Dana.&lt;ref name="allen101"&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first= Jim |title=Jeep 4x4 Performance Handbook |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |year=2007 |page=101 |isbn=978-0-7603-2687-9 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The axle was originally named an AMC-15 when it was first made in 1962.&lt;ref name="allen101"/&gt; Dana upgraded the axle, and made [[Independent suspension|IFS]] and [[Twin Traction Beam]] front axle variations, as well.

[[File:Dana 35.jpg|thumb|Dana 35 from a [[Jeep]]]]

==General specifications==
The Dana 35 (as well as the AMC-15) is found in a wide variety of vehicles. The most common Dana 35 applications are as a rear axle in the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]], [[Jeep Wrangler]], and [[Jeep Comanche]] and as a front axle in the [[Ford Explorer]] and [[Ford Ranger]]. It is "reliable in day-to-day street use, but notoriously the opposite when worked hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first= Jim |title=Jeep (Collector's Library) | publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |year=2004 |page=179 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zTsAbTJB5RIC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=DANA+35+axle |isbn=978-0-7603-1979-6 |accessdate=18 April 2013 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the AMC-15 it was used in many AMC car applications, most commonly with four and six cylinder engines.

* Ring and Pinion gear sets for Jeep Dana 35 rear applications can be used in Ford Ranger IFS (Dana 35) front axles.  http://www.4wheelparts.com lists the Spicer gear sets for both versions of this axle as the same part number.  {{cn|date=December 2012}}

==Independent front suspension (IFS) Dana 35 axle==
Throughout the 1990s Ford used the Dana 35 as a front axle in both TTB and full IFS variations.  These units also follow Ford's tradition of using high pinion, reverse cut units.  Dodge used this front axle only for a few years in Dakotas and Durangos.

* [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] up to 2900 lbs depending on variation and set up.

==Rear Dana 35 solid axle==
The Dana 35 is used extensively in the Jeep models.  This axle had a [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] up to 2700 lbs.

===Available Gear Ratios===
There were many ratios offered over the lifetime of the Dana 35/AMC 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AMC 1980 Technical Service Manual|year=1980|publisher=American Motors Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deaccessioning''' is defined as the process by which a work of art or other object is permanently removed from a [[Collection (artwork)|museum’s collection]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Report from the AAMD Task Force on Deaccessioning. 2010. ''AAMD Policy on Deaccessioning''. The Association of American Museum Directors, June 9, 2010. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803191723/https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }} Accessed November 14th 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; Deaccessioning is a practical and constructive tool of collections care that, if practiced thoughtfully supports the long-term preservation of a collection and can help a [[museum]] refine the scope of its collection in order to better serve its mission and community.

==Deaccession policy==
The process undertaken by a museum to deaccession a work involves several steps that are usually laid out in a museum`s [[Collections policy|Collection Management Policy]]. The terms under which an object may be considered for removal, as well as the individuals with the authority to approve the process are outlined in the "Deaccession" section of this document.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, this section lays out the legal restrictions and ethic considerations associated with removal of the object and the types of disposal that are appropriate based on the reason for the deaccession.

==Decision process==
Each museum establishes its own method and workflow for the deaccession process according to its organizational structure. However all object deaccessioning involves the two processing steps of deaccession and disposal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last = Buck|first = Rebecca A.|last2 = Gilmore|first2 = Jean Allman|title = Museum Registration Methods|place = Washington, D.C.|publisher = The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year = 2010|edition = 5|chapter = 3I: Deaccessioning|pages = 100–107|isbn = 978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Park Service - Museum Management Program|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/handbook.html|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process begins with the [[curator]] creating a document called a "Statement of Justification," which outlines their decision criteria and reasoning for presenting the work as a possible deaccession. In order to determine if a work should be deaccessioned from a museum`s collection, a [[curator]] or [[Registrar (museum)|registrar]] completes and documents a series of justification steps and then present their findings to the museum director and governing board for final approval.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Deaccession criteria===
There are a number of reasons why deaccessioning might be considered. The following is a typical list of criteria for deaccession and disposal:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The work is no longer consistent with the mission or collecting goals of the museum. 
* The work is of poor quality and lacks value for exhibition or study purposes. 
* The physical condition of the work is so poor that restoration is not practicable or would compromise the work’s integrity or the artist’s intent. Works damaged beyond reasonable repair that are not of use for study or teaching purposes may be destroyed.  
* The museum is unable to care adequately for the work because of the work’s particular requirements for storage or display or its continuing need for special treatment for proper and long term conservation.  
* The work is being sold as part of the museum’s effort to refine and improve its collections, in keeping with the collecting goals reviewed and approved by the museum’s Board of Trustees or governing body.  
* The authenticity or attribution of the work is determined to be false or fraudulent and the object lacks sufficient aesthetic merit or art historical importance to warrant retention.  
* The work is a duplicate that has no value as part of a series.  
* The work may have been stolen or illegally imported in violation of applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the museum is located or the work may be subject to other legal claims, including but not limited to repatriation under [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA (]]The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) and art found to have been plundered during WWII by the [[Nazi plunder|Nazis]].

===Deaccession justification steps===
The typical steps that need to be taken in order to justify the deaccession and disposal of the work include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* Verification of Legal Status: Staff verifies that the museum possesses official legal title of the work and check their records in order to ascertain if there are any restrictions that exist in the original gift, bequest, or purchase which may hinder or limit disposal options, including transfer of copyright or trademark.
** The need to establish clear and unrestricted title is important because it ensures the museum can dispose of the work the via legal sale without risk of improper title transfer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Malaro, M. and I.P. DeAngelis (2012). A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections. Chp. 5: The Disposal of Objects. pp.248-272.  Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See:[[Tangible personal property]]
** Donor restrictions are also uncovered at this stage of the process. Some donor restrictions determined at the gifting or bequest of the work or works may hinder the deaccession and/or the disposal process. 
*** For example, the museum is looking to deaccession one piece of a set that was gifted and the donor`s "Deed of Gift or Bequest" included a request that the set remain together. In this case, the museum might need to seek legal counsel and take the documents to a judge to gain release from the Deed of Gift or Bequest restrictions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
** In the process of determining clear title, [[provenance]] research should ideally be conducted, especially if the deaccession process was instigated by a claim of illicit title, such as in the case of a Nazi Looted work or stolen work of antiquity. 
*** See [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|UNESCO]] Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property and AAM Statement on the "Standards Regarding the Unlawful Appropriation of Objects During the Nazi Era"[http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/collections-stewardship/objects-during-the-nazi-era]
*Physical Examination: A conservator conducts an assessment of the work to determine its current  condition, future maintenance needs, and viable disposal options, such as possible sale or destruction. 
*Object Evaluation: Acquiring through one or more appraisers reasonable evaluations of the work would be helpful especially if the work is to be disposed of via sale, auction, transfer or exchange for value in kind with another institution.
*Director and/ or Governing Board approval: Following an internal review by all relevant staff, all documentation is presented to the Governing Board and/or the CEO/ Museum Director for final approval. The workflow and final decision on deaccession is subject to the collection policies workflow and charters for each museum.   
*Notification of Donor and/or External Stakeholders: Once the Governing Board and/ or the CEO/ Museum Director approves the deaccession the last step before beginning disposal is the notification of donor and external stakeholders of the deaccession. Although the museum holds clear title of the work and is not obliged by law to contact the donor of intent to deaccession, many museums contact donors or relatives out of courtesy. Museums may also confer with local community advisory groups, such as museum members, local collectors, other local museums, and volunteers about the deaccession to inform and gain community perspective on the work and its value to the collection.

===Disposal===
Disposal is defined as the transfer of ownership by the museum after a work has been deaccessioned. Following approval of deaccession from the Governing Board and/or the CEO/Museum Director, the work is disposed of and the title of ownership is completely transferred away from the museum or terminated. The method chosen is determined by the physical condition of the work, the intrinsic value or cultural value of the work and extrinsic value or monetary value of the work. With all methods of disposal, museums are charged to maintain and retain all records of the object, its deaccession and disposal.

The process of disposal is completed through the following methods:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

*Donation of the object to another museum, library, or archive for educational purposes 
**This is the ideal disposal choice for museums as it assures that the object will remain accessible to the public. Museums seek out possible institutions where the object might a useful addition to the collection or is better equipped to maintain the object.[[File:Antonio Molinari - Adamo ed Eva.jpg|thumb|Antonio Molinari - Adamo ed Eva, An example of a Deaccessioned work: Deaccessioned in 1988 from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Purchased by Ball State University Museum of Art, Muncie, Indiana from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1989.]]
*Exchange of the object for another object with another museum or non-profit institution
**This is another viable method for assuring that the object remains accessible to the public in some way.  Exchanges are made in such a way that there is relatively equal value of the items involved, not just monetarily but historically.
***Museum should be able to justify the trade, including any exceptional circumstances that would favor one party over another. This is why obtaining an appraisal of the object from more than one appraiser is a mandatory step in the deaccession process. See &lt;u&gt;Object Evaluation&lt;/u&gt; above.   
*Educational and Research programs 
**Often works deaccession from the collection can be reallocated into educational programs, to be used for hands-on demonstrations, school outreach programs, or testing for conservation research. In this case it is understood that the work will be subject to physical destruction over time.  In this case, the work would be re-accessioned into a study or educational collection that is not as closely monitored as that of the main collection. See link for one example of an outreach school program that utilizes deaccessioned works [http://www.historyisfun.org/learn/virginia-outreach/].   
*Physical Destruction 
**Objects that may have deteriorated due to an [[Inherent vice (library and archival science)|inherent vice]], natural disaster, vandalism, accident, or other causes as well as works that made be considered hazardous, such as those containing drugs, chemicals, explosives, or asbestos should be disposed of via physical destruction. If dealing with hazardous materials, the proper authorities should be consulted in order to determine the best method of destruction.  The method of destruction will depend on the type of material and completed in such a ways as to be irreversible. This is also the best method for works that are found to be fakes or [[Forgery|forgeries]]. See &lt;u&gt;Physical Examination&lt;/u&gt; above.   
**Human remains or certain items of religious or cultural sensitivity might need to be handled in a prescribed way in order to meet legal requirements or cultural standards. See [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA]] from more information.    
*Repatriation. 
**Repatriation is the process of returning an object to their place of origin or proper owner.  This is method of disposal is used for objects found to be illicitly held by the museum, such as [[Nazi plunder|Nazi Looted Art]] and objects requested for return according to [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA]]. The illicit status of an object would be determined upon claim of repatriation via NAGPRA or claim by proper owner, in the case of Nazi Looted or other stolen works. In either case, clear title and provenance would be determined during the Verification of Legal Status step of deaccession. See &lt;u&gt;Verification of Legal Status&lt;/u&gt; above.    
*Return to Donor.
**Similar to the process of repatriation, if the work was donated to the museum and the donor or legal heir can be located at time of deaccession processing, the museum may elect to return the object to the donor. This is not the best option for museums for a few reasons. First, it removes the work from public accessibility and second, it can cause tax complications, as a deduction can be given for a portion of the work`s value upon donation and the return of the work to the donor may result in an audit or at least IRS claim on the deduction value previously received.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:Crosby Garrett Helmet on auction at Christies.jpg|thumb|An auction at [[Christie's]].]]
*Private Sale and Public Auction.
**Another method of disposal that is not the best option for museums. Museums hold collections in the public trust for public access. Though the best manner in which to generate funds from disposal for future accessions and care of current collection, disposal of works via sale or auction takes the work away from public access and places it into the hands of private citizens.

==Deaccession and museum ethics==
Several professional museum associations have drafted codes of ethics governing the practice of deaccession.nTwo majors areas of ethical concern that are common in these codes of ethics are the prohibition of sale or transfer of collection items to museum trustees, staff, board members, or their relatives and the need to restrict the use of proceeds from any works disposed of via sale or auction.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Stephen E. ''A Deaccession Reader.'' Washington, DC: American Association of Museums, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these ethical concerns is rather straightforward. The second has become a point of contention in recent years since museums and cities, like Detroit, have been struggling with financial shortfalls.

According to the [https://www.aamd.org/ AAMD] (The Association of Art Museum Directors): "Funds received from the disposal of a deaccessioned work shall not be used for operations or capital expenses. Such funds, including any earnings and appreciation thereon, may be used only for the acquisition of works in a manner consistent with the museum’s policy on the use of restricted acquisition funds."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the [http://www.aam-us.org/home AAM] (the American Association of Museums): "Proceeds from the sale of nonliving collections are to be used consistent with the established standards of the museum`s discipline, but in no event shall they be used for anything other than acquisition or direct care of collections."&lt;ref&gt;''Code of Ethics for Museums'', AAM. Washington DC. 1994, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Association for State and Local History|AASLH]] (the American Association for State and Local History): "Collections shall not be deaccessioned or disposed of in order to provide financial support for institutional operations, facilities maintenance, or any reason other than the preservation or acquisition of collections."&lt;ref&gt;A Statement of Professional Ethics, American Association for State and Local History, Nashville, Tennessee, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [http://icom.museum/ ICOM] (the International Council of Museums): Proceeds should be applied solely to the purchase of additions to museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/ICOM_News/2003-1/ENG/p3_2003-1.pdf|title = Deaccessioning and ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums|date = Jan 2003|accessdate = |website = ICOM News|publisher = ICOM News|last = Lewis|first = Geoffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These associations have each determined to their own degree that all proceeds from sale or auction should be restricted to the future acquisition of collection objects and/ or to the ongoing maintenance of current collection holdings. Their decision and perspective on the practice of deaccession reflects a long-term view of museum collections as items held in public trust and preserved for access, appreciation, education, and enjoyment of not only today`s public but the future public. See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/public_trust_doctrine Public trust doctrine]

==Views on deaccessioning==
Deaccessioning is a controversial topic and activity, with diverging opinions from artists, arts professionals and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Museums Draw Scrutiny When They Sell Artworks|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/arts/design/27sell.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2011-01-26|access-date = 2015-12-12|issn = 0362-4331|first = Robin|last = Pogrebin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators, such as Donn Zaretsky of The Art Law Blog critique the notion of "the public trust" and argue that deaccessioning rules should probably be thrown out altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AAMD Rules Need to be Deaccessioned - News - Art in America|url = http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/aamd-rules-need-to-be-deaccessioned/|website = www.artinamericamagazine.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Susan Taylor, director of the New Orleans Museum of Art and the AAMD's current president, believes that proceeds from the sale or funds from the deaccession can only be used to buy other works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = As Museums Try To Make Ends Meet, 'Deaccession' Is The Art World's Dirty Word|url = https://www.npr.org/2014/08/11/339532879/as-museums-try-to-make-ends-meet-deaccession-is-the-art-worlds-dirty-word|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

      <comment>the comparative measurement of the detonation velocity with a calibrated detcord is called the Dautriche method after its inventor, Henri Joseph Dautriche.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2654">'''Explosive velocity''', also known as '''detonation velocity''' or '''velocity of detonation''' (VoD), is the [[velocity]] at which the [[shock wave]] front travels through a [[detonation|detonated]] [[explosive]]. The data listed for a specific substance is usually a rough prediction based upon [[Gas laws|gas behavior theory]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} (see [[Chapman-Jouguet condition]]), as in practice it is difficult to measure{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.  Explosive velocities are always faster than the local [[speed of sound]] in the material.

If the explosive is confined before detonation, such as in an [[Shell (projectile)|artillery shell]], the [[force]] produced is focused on a much smaller area, and the [[pressure]] is massively intensified. This results in explosive velocity that is higher than if the explosive had been detonated in open air. Unconfined velocities are often approximately 70 to 80 percent of confined velocities.&lt;ref name="GlobalSecurity.org"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/explosives.htm GlobalSecurity.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Explosive velocity is increased with smaller particle size (''i.e.'' increased spatial density), increased charge diameter, and increased confinement (''i.e.'' higher pressure).&lt;ref name="GlobalSecurity.org"/&gt;

Typical [[Table of explosive detonation velocities|detonation velocities]] in gases range from 1800&amp;nbsp;[[Metre per second|m/s]] to 3000&amp;nbsp;m/s. Typical velocities in solid explosives often range beyond 4000&amp;nbsp;m/s to 10300&amp;nbsp;m/s.

Detonation velocity can be measured by the Dautriche method.  In essence, this method relies on the time lag between the initiation of two ends of a [[detcord|detonating fuse]] of a known detonation velocity,
inserted radially at two points into the explosive charge at a known distance apart.
When the explosive charge is detonated, it triggers one end of the fuse, then the second end. This causes two 
detonation fronts travelling in opposite direction along the length of the 
detonating fuse, which meet at a specific point away from the centre of the 
fuse. Knowing the distance along the detonation charge between the two ends of the fuse,
the position of the collision of the detonation fronts, and the detonation velocity of 
the detonating fuse, the detonation velocity of the explosive is calculated and is expressed in km/s.

In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''drag coefficient''' (commonly denoted as: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm x\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm w\,&lt;/math&gt;) is a [[dimensionless quantity]] that is used to quantify the [[drag (physics)|drag]] or resistance of an object in a fluid environment, such as air or water. It is used in the [[drag equation]] in which a lower drag coefficient indicates the object will have less [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] or [[Hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] drag. The drag coefficient is always associated with a particular surface area.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W. (1979): ''Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, and Flight Mechanics''. p. 24, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, {{ISBN|0-471-03032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drag coefficient of any object comprises the effects of the two basic contributors to [[Fluid dynamics|fluid dynamic]] drag: [[skin friction]] and [[form drag]]. The drag coefficient of a lifting [[airfoil]] or [[hydrofoil]] also includes the effects of [[lift-induced drag]].&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 5.18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ira H. Abbott|Abbott, Ira H.]], and Von Doenhoff, Albert E.: ''Theory of Wing Sections''. Sections 1.2 and 1.3&lt;/ref&gt; The drag coefficient of a complete structure such as an aircraft also includes the effects of [[interference drag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wright.nasa.gov/airplane/drageq.html |title=NASA’s Modern Drag Equation |publisher=Wright.nasa.gov |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2010-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302020853/http://wright.nasa.gov/airplane/drageq.html |archivedate=2011-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 11.17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm d = \dfrac{ 2F_\mathrm d}{ \rho u^2 A}\, &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[drag (physics)|drag force]], which is by definition the force component in the direction of the [[flow velocity]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[lift force]] and [[vortex induced vibration]] for a possible force components transverse to the flow direction.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass density]] of the fluid,&lt;ref&gt;Note that for the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the air density can be found using the [[barometric formula]]. Air is 1.293 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[flow speed]] of the object relative to the fluid,
:&lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; is the reference [[area]].

The reference area depends on what type of drag coefficient is being measured. For automobiles and many other objects, the reference area is the projected frontal area of the vehicle. This may not necessarily be the cross sectional area of the vehicle, depending on where the cross section is taken. For example, for a sphere &lt;math&gt;A = \pi r^2\,&lt;/math&gt; (note this is not the surface area = &lt;math&gt;\!\ 4 \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;).

For [[airfoil]]s, the reference area is the nominal wing area. Since this tends to be large compared to the frontal area, the resulting drag coefficients tend to be low, much lower than for a car with the same drag, frontal area, and speed.

[[Airship]]s and some [[Solid of revolution|bodies of revolution]] use the volumetric drag coefficient, in which the reference area is the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[cube root]] of the airship volume (volume to the two-thirds power). Submerged streamlined bodies use the wetted surface area.

Two objects having the same reference area moving at the same speed through a fluid will experience a drag force proportional to their respective drag coefficients. Coefficients for unstreamlined objects can be 1 or more, for streamlined objects much less.

==Background==

{{Main|Drag equation}}

The drag equation

:&lt;math&gt;F_d\, =\, \tfrac12\, \rho\, u^2\, c_d\, A&lt;/math&gt;

is essentially a statement that the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] [[force]] on any object is proportional to the density of the fluid and proportional to the square of the relative [[flow speed]] between the object and the fluid.

''C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not a constant but varies as a function of flow speed, flow direction, object position, object size, fluid density and fluid [[viscosity]]. Speed, [[kinematic viscosity]] and a characteristic [[length scale]] of the object are incorporated into a dimensionless quantity called the [[Reynolds number]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Re&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is thus a function of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Re&lt;/math&gt;. In a compressible flow, the speed of sound is relevant, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is also a function of [[Mach number]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Ma&lt;/math&gt;.

For certain body shapes, the drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; only depends on the Reynolds number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Re\,&lt;/math&gt;, Mach number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Ma\,&lt;/math&gt; and the direction of the flow. For low Mach number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Ma&lt;/math&gt;, the drag coefficient is independent of Mach number. Also, the variation with Reynolds number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Re\,&lt;/math&gt; within a practical range of interest is usually small, while for cars at highway speed and aircraft at cruising speed, the incoming flow direction is also more-or-less the same. Therefore, the drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; can often be treated as a constant.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Sections 4.15 and 5.4&lt;/ref&gt;

For a streamlined body to achieve a low drag coefficient, the [[boundary layer]] around the body must remain attached to the surface of the body for as long as possible, causing the [[wake]] to be narrow. A high ''form drag'' results in a broad wake. The boundary layer will transition from laminar to turbulent if Reynolds number of the flow around the body is sufficiently great. Larger velocities, larger objects, and lower [[viscosity|viscosities]] contribute to larger Reynolds numbers.&lt;ref name=Clancy_4.17&gt;Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 4.17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drag coefficient on a sphere vs. Reynolds number - main trends.svg|thumb|Drag coefficient ''C''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; for a sphere as a function of [[Reynolds number]] ''Re'', as obtained from laboratory experiments. The dark line is for a sphere with a smooth surface, while the lighter line is for the case of a rough surface. The numbers along the line indicate several flow regimes and associated changes in the drag coefficient:&lt;br&gt;
•2: attached flow ([[Stokes flow]]) and [[steady flow|steady]] [[flow separation|separated flow]],&lt;br&gt;
•3: separated unsteady flow, having a [[laminar flow]] [[boundary layer]] upstream of the separation, and producing a [[vortex street]],&lt;br&gt;
•4: separated unsteady flow with a laminar boundary layer at the upstream side, before flow separation, with downstream of the sphere a chaotic [[turbulence|turbulent]] wake,&lt;br&gt;
•5: post-critical separated flow, with a turbulent boundary layer.]]
For other objects, such as small particles, one can no longer consider that the drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is constant, but certainly is a function of Reynolds number.&lt;ref&gt;Clift R., Grace J. R., Weber M. E.: ''Bubbles, drops, and particles''. Academic Press NY (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briens C. L.: ''Powder Technology''. 67, 1991, 87-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haider A., Levenspiel O.: ''Powder Technology''. 58, 1989, 63-70.&lt;/ref&gt;
At a low Reynolds number, the flow around the object does not transition to turbulent but remains laminar, even up to the point at which it separates from the surface of the object. At very low Reynolds numbers, without flow separation, the drag force &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v\,&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v^2\,&lt;/math&gt;; for a sphere this is known as [[Stokes' law|Stokes law]]. The Reynolds number will be low for small objects, low velocities, and high viscosity fluids.&lt;ref name=Clancy_4.17/&gt;

A &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; equal to 1 would be obtained in a case where all of the fluid approaching the object is brought to rest, building up [[stagnation pressure]] over the whole front surface. The top figure shows a flat plate with the fluid coming from the right and stopping at the plate. The graph to the left of it shows equal pressure across the surface. In a real flat plate, the fluid must turn around the sides, and full stagnation pressure is found only at the center, dropping off toward the edges as in the lower figure and graph. Only considering the front side, the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; of a real flat plate would be less than 1; except that there will be suction on the back side: a negative pressure (relative to ambient). The overall &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; of a real square flat plate perpendicular to the flow is often given as 1.17.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Flow patterns and therefore &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; for some shapes can change with the Reynolds number and the roughness of the surfaces.
&lt;!-- and there should be examples of other simple shapes --&gt;

==Drag coefficient ''c''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; examples==

===General===
In general, &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is not an absolute constant for a given body shape. It varies with the speed of airflow (or more generally with [[Reynolds number]] &lt;math&gt;Re&lt;/math&gt;). A smooth sphere, for example, has a &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; that varies from high values for [[laminar flow]] to 0.47 for [[turbulent flow]].  Although the drag coefficient decreases with increasing &lt;math&gt;Re&lt;/math&gt;, the drag force increases.

==Aircraft==
As noted above, aircraft use their wing area as the reference area when computing &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt;, while automobiles (and many other objects) use frontal cross sectional area; thus, coefficients are '''not''' directly comparable between these classes of vehicles. In the aerospace industry, the drag coefficient is sometimes expressed in drag counts where 1 [[drag count]] = 0.0001 of a &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Basha, W. A. and Ghaly, W.

==Blunt and streamlined body flows==

===Concept===

Drag, in the context of [[fluid dynamics]], refers to forces that act on a solid object in the direction of the relative flow velocity (note that the diagram below shows the drag in the opposite direction to the flow). The aerodynamic forces on a body come primarily from differences in pressure and viscous shearing stresses. Thereby, the drag force on a body could be divided into two components, namely frictional drag (viscous drag) and pressure drag (form drag). The net drag force could be decomposed as follows:
[[File:Aerodynamics of Airfoil.jpg|thumb|Flow across an airfoil showing the relative impact of drag force to the direction of motion of fluid over the body. This drag force gets divided into frictional drag and pressure drag. The same airfoil is considered as a streamlined body if friction drag (viscous drag) dominates pressure drag and is considered a blunt body when pressure drag (form drag) dominates friction drag.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
c_\mathrm d &amp;= \dfrac{2 F_\mathrm d}{\rho v^2 A}\ \\
&amp;= c_\mathrm p + c_\mathrm f \\
&amp;= \underbrace{ \dfrac{1}{\rho v^2 A}\ \displaystyle \int\limits_{S} \mathrm{d}A \, (p-p_o) \left(\hat{\mathbf{n}} \sdot \hat{\mathbf{i}}\right) }_{ c_\mathrm p }+ \underbrace{ \dfrac{1}{\rho v^2 A}\ \displaystyle \int\limits_{S} \mathrm{d}A \, \left(\hat{\mathbf{t}} \sdot \hat{\mathbf{i}}\right) T_w }_{ c_\mathrm f} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm p\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]] drag coefficient, 
:&lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction]] drag coefficient,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat \mathbf{t} &lt;/math&gt; = Tangential direction to the surface with area dA,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat \mathbf{n} &lt;/math&gt; = Normal direction to the surface with area dA,
:&lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm w\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear Stress]] acting on the surface dA,
:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm o\,&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure far away from the surface dA,
:&lt;math&gt;p\,&lt;/math&gt; is pressure at surface dA,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{i}}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in direction of free stream flow

Therefore, when the drag is dominated by a frictional component, the body is called a '''streamlined body'''; whereas in the case of dominant pressure drag, the body is called a '''blunt body'''. Thus, the shape of the body and the angle of attack determine the type of drag. For example, an airfoil is considered as a body with a small angle of attack by the fluid flowing across it. This means that it has attached [[boundary layer]]s, which produce much less pressure drag.
[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|Trade-off relationship between zero-lift drag and lift induced drag]]
The [[wake]] produced is very small and drag is dominated by the friction component. Therefore, such a body (here an airfoil) is described as streamlined, whereas for bodies with fluid flow at high angles of attack, boundary layer separation takes place. This mainly occurs due to adverse [[pressure gradient]]s at the top and rear parts of an [[airfoil]].

Due to this, wake formation takes place, which consequently leads to eddy formation and pressure loss due to pressure drag. In such situations, the airfoil is [[Stall (flight)|stalled]] and has higher pressure drag than friction drag. In this case, the body is described as a blunt body.

A streamlined body looks like a fish ([[Tuna]], [[Oropesa (minesweeping)|Oropesa]], etc.) or an airfoil with small angle of attack, whereas a blunt body looks like a brick, a cylinder or an airfoil with high angle of attack. For a given frontal area and velocity, a streamlined body will have lower resistance than a blunt body. Cylinders and spheres are taken as blunt bodies because the drag is dominated by the pressure component in the wake region at high [[Reynolds number]].

To reduce this drag, either the flow separation could be reduced or the surface area in contact with the fluid could be reduced (to reduce friction drag). This reduction is necessary in devices like cars, bicycle, etc. to avoid vibration and noise production.

====Practical example====
The [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] design of cars has evolved from the 1920s to the end of the 20th century. This change in design from a blunt body to a more streamlined body reduced the drag coefficient from about 0.95 to 0.30.

'''Engineering''' is the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and [[empirical evidence]] to the [[innovation]], [[design]], [[construction]], operation and [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]] of [[structure]]s, [[machine]]s, [[material]]s, devices, [[system]]s, [[process]]es, and [[organization]]s for the benefit of humankind. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized [[List of engineering branches|fields of engineering]], each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of [[applied mathematics]], [[applied science]], and types of application. See [[glossary of engineering]].

The term ''engineering'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'', meaning "cleverness" and  ''ingeniare'', meaning "to contrive, devise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IAENG|url=http://www.iaeng.org/about_IAENG.html|website=iaeng.org|publisher=International Association of Engineers|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of engineering}}
[[File:Grondplan citadel Lille.JPG|thumb|Relief map of the [[Citadel of Lille]], designed in 1668 by [[Vauban]], the foremost military engineer of his age.]]

Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley.

The term ''engineering''  is derived from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to 1390 when an ''engine'er'' (literally, one who operates an ''engine'') referred to "a constructor of military engines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|engineer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, ''i.e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, ''e.g.'', the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].

The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'' (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1250–1300; ME engin &lt; AF, OF &lt; L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term [[civil engineering]]&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of [[military engineering]].

===Ancient era===
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Romans built [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] to bring a steady supply of clean and fresh water to cities and towns in the empire.]]
The [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in [[Egypt]], the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and the [[Parthenon]] in [[Greece]], the [[Roman aqueduct]]s, [[Via Appia]] and the [[Colosseum]], [[Teotihuacán]], the [[Great Wall of China]], the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] of [[Thanjavur]], among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], and the [[Pharos of Alexandria]] were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

The earliest civil engineer known by name is [[Imhotep]].&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; As one of the officials of the [[Pharaoh]], [[Djoser|Djosèr]], he probably designed and supervised the construction of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] (the [[Step Pyramid]]) at [[Saqqara]] in [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around [[27th century BC|2630]]–[[27th century BC|2611 BC]].&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J.

[[Ancient Greece]] developed machines in both civilian and military domains.

Some of Archimedes' inventions as well as the Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential gearing]] or [[epicyclic gearing]], two key principles in machine theory that helped design the [[gear train]]s of the Industrial Revolution, and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as [[robotics]] and [[automotive engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hungarian armies employed military machines and inventions such as [[artillery]] which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244231/ancient-Greece/261062/Military-technology Britannica on Greek civilization in the 5th century Military technology] Quote: "The 7th century, by contrast, had witnessed rapid innovations, such as the introduction of the hoplite and the trireme, which still were the basic instruments of war in the 5th." and "But it was the development of artillery that opened an epoch, and this invention did not predate the 4th century. It was first heard of in the context of Sicilian warfare against Carthage in the time of Dionysius I of Syracuse."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[trireme]], the [[ballista]] and the [[catapult]]. In the Middle Ages, the [[trebuchet]] was developed.

===Renaissance era===
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|right|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]
Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

===Modern era===
The science of [[classical mechanics]], sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution |last=Musson |author2=Robinso|year=1969 |publisher =University of Toronto Press|location= |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the rise of engineering as a [[profession]] in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the [[mechanic arts]] became incorporated into engineering.

Canal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book|title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815-1860 |last=Taylor|first= George Rogers|year=1969 |publisher =|location=

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smeaton]] was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the "father" of [[civil engineering]]. He was an English [[civil engineer]] responsible for the design of [[bridge]]s, [[canal]]s, [[harbour]]s, and [[lighthouse]]s. He was also a capable [[mechanical engineer]] and an eminent [[physicist]]. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}   Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|69}} Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomn steam engine]]. Smeaton designed the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of '[[hydraulic lime]]' (a form of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern [[cement]], because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain "hydraulicity" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of [[Portland cement]].

Applied science lead to the development of the steam engine.  The sequence of events began with the invention the [[barometer]] and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by [[Otto von Guericke]] using the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] in 1656, laboratory experiments by [[Denis Papin]], who  built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston, which he published in 1707.  [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a [[coffee percolator]].  [[Samuel Morland]], a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that [[Thomas Savery]] read. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called “The Miner’s Friend.” It employed both vacuum and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Rhys | authorlink = | title = Links in the History of Engineering and Technology from Tudor Times| publisher = Ayer Publishing| year = 1936 | location =| page = 66 | isbn = 978-0-8369-2167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron merchant [[Thomas Newcomen]], who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712, was not known to have any scientific training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}}

The application of steam powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for [[blast furnace]]s lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century.  The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in [[blast furnace]]s, which enabled the transition from charcoal to [[coke (fuel)|coke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making [[Wagonway|horse railways]] and iron bridges practical.  The [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]], patented by [[Henry Cort]] in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron.  [[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron.  With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New steel making processes, such as the [[Bessemer process]] and the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.

[[File:The world's first iron bridge.jpg|thumb|253px|The application of the steam engine allowed coke to be substituted for charcoal in iron making, lowering the cost of iron, which provided engineers with a new material for building bridges.  This bridge was made of [[cast iron]], which was soon displaced by less brittle [[wrought iron]] as a structural material]]

One of the most famous engineers of the mid 19th century was [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several [[machine tools]]. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented his [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)#Boring machine for steam engines|boring machine]], which is considered the  first [[machine tool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other machine tools included the [[screw cutting lathe]], [[milling machine]], [[turret lathe]] and the [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]].  Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century.  These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position.  Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing [[interchangeable parts]] lead to [[Mass production|large scale factory production]] by the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States census of 1850 listed the occupation of "engineer" for the first time with a count of 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cowan |first=Ruth Schwartz |title=A Social History of American Technology |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-504605-2|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the U.S. before 1865. In 1870 there were a dozen U.S. mechanical engineering graduates, with that number increasing to 43 per year in 1875.  In 1890, there were 6,000 engineers in civil, [[mining]], mechanical and electrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charlottesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until 1875, and no chair of engineering at Oxford until 1907.  Germany established technical universities earlier.&lt;ref&gt;

The foundations of [[electrical engineering]] in the 1800s included the experiments of [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]] and others and the invention of the [[electrical telegraph|electric telegraph]] in 1816 and the [[electric motor]] in 1872. The theoretical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] (see: [[Maxwell's equations]]) and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[electronics]]. The later inventions of the [[vacuum tube]] and the [[transistor]] further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;
[[Chemical engineering]] developed in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;

Aeronautical engineering deals with [[aircraft design process]] design while [[aerospace engineering]] is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including [[spacecraft]] design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of [[Sir George Cayley]] has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Van Every, Kermit E. | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Americana | title = Aeronautical engineering| edition =| year = 1986| publisher = Grolier Incorporated| volume =1| pages = 226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in engineering (technically, ''applied science and engineering'') awarded in the United States went to [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] at [[Yale University]] in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;

Only a decade after the successful flights by the [[Wright brothers]], there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in [[World War I]]. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining [[theoretical physics]] with experiments.

Engineering is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, he or she may become multi-disciplined through experience. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hy9WAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;dq=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2UkYTff0MZL-ngfesbGMDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA Journal of the British Nuclear Energy Society: Volume 1 British Nuclear Energy Society – 1962 – Snippet view] Quote: In most universities it should be possible to cover the main branches of engineering, i.e. civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering in this way.

It is traditionally considered to be separate from [[military engineering]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Britannica|url =https://www.britannica.com/technology/civil-engineering|title = Civil Engineering|last = Watson|first = J.

===Electrical engineering===
{{Main|Electrical engineering}}
[[Electrical engineering]] is the design, study, and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems, such as [[Broadcast engineering]], [[electrical circuit]]s, [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[Electric motor|motors]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]/[[electromechanical]] devices, [[electronic devices]], [[electronic circuits]], [[optical fiber]]s, [[optoelectronic device]]s, [[computer]] systems, [[telecommunications]], instrumentation, controls, and [[electronics]].

===Mechanical engineering===
{{Main|Mechanical engineering}}
[[Mechanical engineering]] is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and [[energy]] systems, [[aerospace]]/[[aircraft]] products, [[weapon systems]], [[transportation]] products, [[Internal combustion engine|engines]], [[gas compressor|compressors]], [[powertrain]]s, [[kinematic chain]]s, vacuum technology, [[vibration isolation]] equipment, [[manufacturing]], and [[mechatronics]].

===Other branches===
{{Main|List of engineering branches}}
Beyond these "Big 4", a number of other branches are recognized, though many can be thought of as sub-disciplines of the four major branches, or as cross-curricular disciplines among multiple.  Historically, [[naval architecture|naval engineering]] and [[mining engineering]] were major branches.  Other engineering fields are [[manufacturing engineering]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[corrosion engineering]], [[instrumentation and control]], [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[Automotive engineering|automotive]], [[computer engineering|computer]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[petroleum engineering|petroleum]], [[Environmental engineering|environmental]], [[systems engineering|systems]], [[audio engineering|audio]], [[software engineering|software]], [[architectural engineering|architectural]], [[agricultural engineering|agricultural]], [[biosystems engineering|biosystems]], [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]],&lt;ref&gt;Bronzino JD, ed., The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8493-2121-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geological engineering|geological]], [[Textile manufacturing|textile]], [[industrial engineering|industrial]], [[materials science|materials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bensaude-Vincent|first1=Bernadette|title=The construction of a discipline: Materials science in the United States|journal=Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences|date=March 2001|volume=31|issue=2|pages=223–48|doi=10.1525/hsps.2001.31.2.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nuclear engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929162436/http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK [[Engineering Council]].

New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, [[Earth systems engineering and management]] involves a wide range of subject areas including [[engineering studies]], [[environmental science]], [[engineering ethics]] and [[philosophy of engineering]].

==Practice==
One who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]], [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]], [[European Engineer]], or [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]].

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|right|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]

In the [[engineering design]] process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. More than ever, engineers are now required to have a proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.

If multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.

Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.

A general methodology and [[epistemology]] of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by Walter Vincenti.&lt;ref&gt;Vincenti, Walter G. (1993-02-01). What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History. The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-4588-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Vincenti's case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering, his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering, too.

According to Billy Vaughn Koen, the "''engineering method'' is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources." Koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what he produces, but rather how he goes about it.&lt;ref name="Discussion of The Method"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koen|first1=Billy Vaughn|title=Discussion of The Method|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-515599-0|page=8|edition=1|url=https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/discussion-of-the-method-9780195155990|accessdate=23 July 2015|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem solving===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]
Engineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.

Usually, multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of "[[level of invention|low-level]]" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.

Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.{{Citation needed|reason=Kindly provide citation. Usually safety factor is considered to be a part of an efficient design.|date=October 2017}}

The study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]] and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.

===Computer use===
[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier–Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]

As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.

One of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software like [[CATIA]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], DSS [[SolidWorks]] or [[Pro Engineer]] which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software to generate [[CNC]] machining instructions; [[manufacturing process management]] software for production engineering; [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and circuit [[schematic]]s for electronic engineers; [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.

In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Kismet robot 20051016.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Robotic]] [[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] can produce a range of facial expressions.]]
The engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.

By its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.

Engineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.

Engineering is a key driver of innovation and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The attainment of many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.&lt;ref name="MDG"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054029/http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archivedate=2006-10-06|deadurl =yes|title = Engineering Civilisation from the Shadows|last = Jowitt|first = Paul W.|date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElementBlack2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Radar, [[GPS]], [[lidar]], ... are all combined to provide proper navigation and [[obstacle avoidance]] (vehicle developed for 2007 [[DARPA Urban Challenge]])]]

All overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:
* [[Engineers Without Borders]]
* [[Engineers Against Poverty]]
* Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
* [[Engineers for a Sustainable World]]
* [[Engineering for Change]]
* Engineering Ministries International&lt;ref name="EMI"&gt;[http://www.emiusa.org/index.html Home page for EMI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414014038/http://emiusa.org/index.html |date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained, compared with the number retiring.  This problem is very prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|title=engineeringuk.com/About_us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530210132/http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|archivedate=2014-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140619142335/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |archivedate=2014-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an "image crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103241/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career.  Much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the UK and other western economies.

===Code of ethics===
{{Main|Engineering ethics}}
Many [[Engineering society|engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and [[engineering ethics|codes of ethics]] to guide members and inform the public at large.  The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] code of ethics states:
{{quote| Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|title=Code of Ethics|publisher=National Society of Professional Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Canada, many engineers wear the [[Iron Ring]] as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironring.ca Origin of the Iron Ring concept]&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena.  Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely "engineering scientists".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

First, it often deals with areas in which the basic [[physics]] or [[chemistry]] are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.

An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of [[Fatigue (material)|Miner's rule]] to calculate fatigue damage. Second, engineering research employs many semi-[[empirical methods]] that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As stated by Fung ''et al.'' in the revision to the classic engineering text ''Foundations of Solid Mechanics'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.&lt;ref name="Fung"&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P. Tong|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Medicine and biology===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], seen here in a self-portrait, has been described as the epitome of the artist/engineer.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"/&gt; He is also known for his studies on [[human anatomy]] and [[physiology]].]]

The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. [[Medicine]] aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the [[human body]], if necessary, through the use of [[technology]].

[[File:GFP Mice 01.jpg|thumb|right|Genetically engineered mice expressing [[green fluorescent protein]], which glows green under blue light. The central mouse is [[wild-type]].]]
Modern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, [[brain implant]]s and [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]].&lt;ref name="Boston U"&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Bioe/BioeMcGe.htm Ethical Assessment of Implantable Brain Chips.

Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing [[biology]] with technology. This has led to fields such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neural networks]], [[fuzzy logic]], and [[robot]]ics.  There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.&lt;ref name="IME"&gt;[http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html Institute of Medicine and Engineering: Mission statement The mission of the Institute for Medicine and Engineering (IME) is to stimulate fundamental research at the interface between biomedicine and engineering/physical/computational sciences leading to innovative applications in biomedical research and clinical practice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317145554/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=51 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology: Both general and technical articles on current technologies and methods used in biomedical and clinical engineering&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and [[empirical]] knowledge is an integral part of both.

Newly emerging branches of science, such as [[systems biology]], are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"/&gt;

===Art===

There are connections between engineering and art, for example, [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]] and [[industrial design]] (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's [[Faculty (division)|Faculty]] of Engineering).&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=107990&amp;org=NSF National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering: Professor uses the fine arts to broaden students' engineering perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT World:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ MIT World:The Art of Engineering: Inventor James Dyson on the Art of Engineering: quote: A member of the British Design Council, James Dyson has been designing products since graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1970.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705232213/http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ |date=2006-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Texas at Dallas"&gt;[http://iiae.utdallas.edu/ University of Texas at Dallas:  The Institute for Interactive Arts and Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], for instance, held an exhibition about the art of [[NASA]]'s aerospace design.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/nasa/overview.html Aerospace Design: The Art of Engineering from NASA's Aeronautical Research]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Maillart]]'s bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic.&lt;ref name="Princeton U"&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/137.html Princeton U: Robert Maillart's Bridges: The Art of Engineering: quote: no doubt that Maillart was fully conscious of the aesthetic implications&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[University of South Florida]], an engineering professor, through a grant with the [[National Science Foundation]], has developed a course that connects art and engineering.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chief engineer"&gt;[http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/2697.htm quote:..the tools of artists and the perspective of engineers..] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180822/http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/2697.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among famous historical figures, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"&gt;Bjerklie, David.  "The Art of Renaissance Engineering."  ''MIT's Technology Review'' Jan./Feb.1998: 54–59.  Article explores the concept of the "artist-engineer", an individual who used his artistic talent in engineering. Quote from article: Da Vinci reached the pinnacle of "artist-engineer"-dom, Quote2: "It was Leonardo da Vinci who initiated the most ambitious expansion in the role of artist-engineer, progressing from astute observer to inventor to theoretician." (Bjerklie 58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drew U"&gt;[http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm Drew U: user website: cites Bjerklie paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419194433/http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm |date=2007-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===

[[Business Engineering]] deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and [[change management]]. [[Engineering management]] or "Management engineering" is a specialized field of [[management]] concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.  The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical &amp; electronics, power distribution &amp; generation, utilities and transportation systems.  This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.

===Other fields===
In [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles. [[Financial engineering]] has similarly borrowed the term.

[[File:Lindos1.svg|thumb|400px|right|alt=Equal-loudness contours from ISO 226:2003 shown with original ISO standard.|''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] equal-loudness contours with frequency in Hz.'']]

An '''equal-loudness contour''' is a measure of sound pressure ([[decibel|dB]] [[Sound pressure level|SPL]]), over the [[frequency]] spectrum, for which a listener perceives a constant [[loudness]] when presented with pure steady tones. The unit of measurement for loudness levels is the [[phon]], and is arrived at by reference to equal-loudness contours. By definition, two sine waves of differing frequencies are said to have equal-loudness level measured in phons if they are perceived as equally loud by the average young person without significant hearing impairment.

Equal-loudness contours are often referred to as "Fletcher-Munson" curves, after the earliest researchers, but those studies have been superseded and incorporated into newer standards. The definitive curves are those defined in the international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 226:2003, which are based on a review of modern determinations made in various countries.

==Experimental determination==
The [[human]] auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from about 20 [[Hertz|Hz]] to a maximum of around 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, although the upper hearing limit decreases with age. Within this range, the [[human ear]] is most sensitive between 2 and 5 [[kHz]], largely due to the resonance of the [[ear canal]] and the [[transfer function]] of the [[ossicles]] of the middle ear.

Fletcher and Munson first measured equal-loudness contours using headphones (1933). In their study, test subjects listened to pure tones at various frequencies and over 10 dB increments in stimulus intensity. For each frequency and intensity, the listener also listened to a reference tone at 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz. Fletcher and Munson adjusted the reference tone until the listener perceived that it was the same loudness as the test tone. Loudness, being a psychological quantity, is difficult to measure, so [[Fletcher–Munson curves|Fletcher and Munson]] averaged their results over many test subjects to derive reasonable averages. The lowest equal-loudness contour represents the quietest audible tone—the ''[[absolute threshold of hearing]]''. The highest contour is the ''[[threshold of pain]]''.

Churcher and King carried out a second determination in 1937, but their results and Fletcher and Munson's showed considerable discrepancies over parts of the auditory diagram.&lt;ref&gt;D W Robinson et al., [http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0508-3443/7/5/302 "A re-determination of the equal-loudness relations for pure tones"], ''Br. J. Appl. Phys. '' '''7''' (1956), pp.166–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 [[Robinson–Dadson curves|Robinson and Dadson]] produced a new experimental determination that they believed was more accurate. It became the basis for a standard ([[ISO 226]]) that was considered definitive until 2003, when ISO revised the standard on the basis of recent assessments by research groups worldwide.

==Recent revision aimed at more precise determination – ISO 226:2003==
Perceived discrepancies between early and more recent determinations led the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) to revise the standard curves in ISO 226. They did this in response to recommendations in a study coordinated by the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Japan. The study produced new curves by combining the results of several studies—by researchers in Japan, Germany, Denmark, UK, and USA. (Japan was the greatest contributor with about 40% of the data.) 

This has resulted in the recent acceptance of a new set of curves standardized as ISO 226:2003. The report comments on the surprisingly large differences, and the fact that the original Fletcher-Munson contours are in better agreement with recent results than the Robinson-Dadson, which appear to differ by as much as 10–15 dB especially in the low-frequency region, for reasons not explained.&lt;ref&gt;Yôiti Suzuki, et al., [http://www.nedo.go.jp/itd/grant-e/report/00pdf/is-01e.pdf "Precise and Full-range Determination of Two-dimensional Equal Loudness Contours"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210848/http://www.nedo.go.jp/itd/grant-e/report/00pdf/is-01e.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side versus frontal presentation==
Equal-loudness curves derived using headphones are valid only for the special case of what is called ''side-presentation'', which is not how we normally hear. Real-life sounds arrive as planar wavefronts, if from a reasonably distant source. If the source of sound is directly in front of the listener, then both ears receive equal intensity, but at frequencies above about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz the sound that enters the ear canal is partially reduced by the [[head shadow|masking effect of the head]], and also highly dependent on reflection off the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] (outer ear). Off-centre sounds result in increased head masking at one ear, and subtle changes in the effect of the pinna, especially at the other ear. This combined effect of head-masking and pinna reflection is quantified in a set of curves in three-dimensional space referred to as [[head-related transfer function]]s (HRTFs). Frontal presentation is now regarded as preferable when deriving equal-loudness contours, and the latest ISO standard is specifically based on frontal and central presentation.

The Robinson-Dadson determination used loudspeakers, and for a long time the difference from the [[Fletcher-Munson curves]] was explained partly on the basis that the latter used headphones. However, the ISO report actually lists the latter as using "compensated" [[headphones]], though it doesn't make clear how Robinson-Dadson achieved "compensation".

==Headphones versus loudspeaker testing==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2015}}
Good headphones, well sealed to the ear, provide a flat low-frequency pressure response to the ear canal, with low distortion even at high intensities. At low frequencies the ear is purely pressure-sensitive, and the cavity formed between headphones and ear is too small to introduce modifying resonances. Headphone testing is therefore a good way to derive equal-loudness contours below about 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, though reservations have been expressed about the validity of headphone measurements when determining the actual threshold of hearing, based on observation that closing off the ear canal produces increased sensitivity to the sound of blood flow within the ear, which the brain appears to mask in normal listening conditions {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. At high frequencies, headphone measurement gets unreliable, and the various resonances of pinnae (outer ears) and ear canals are severely affected by proximity to the headphone cavity.

With speakers, the opposite is true. A flat low-frequency response is hard to obtain—except in free space high above ground, or in a very large and [[anechoic chamber]] that is free from reflections down to 20&amp;nbsp;Hz. Until recently,{{when|date=May 2015}} it was not possible to achieve high levels at frequencies down to 20&amp;nbsp;Hz without high levels of [[total harmonic distortion|harmonic distortion]]. Even today, the best speakers are likely to generate around 1 to 3% of total harmonic distortion, corresponding to 30 to 40 dB below fundamental. This is not good enough, given the steep rise in loudness (rising to as much as 24 dB per octave) with frequency revealed by the equal-loudness curves below about 100&amp;nbsp;Hz. A good experimenter must ensure that trial subjects really hear the fundamental and not harmonics—especially the third harmonic, which is especially strong as a speaker cone's travel becomes limited as its suspension reaches the limit of compliance. A possible way around the problem is to use acoustic filtering, such as by resonant cavity, in the speaker setup. A flat free-field high-frequency response up to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, on the other hand, is comparatively easy to achieve with modern speakers on-axis. These effects must be considered when comparing results of various attempts to measure equal-loudness contours.

==Relevance to sound level measurement and noise measurement==
The [[A-weighting]] curve—in widespread use for [[noise measurement]]—is said to have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curve. However, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, B., Torick, E., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1161864&amp;isnumber=26056 "Researches in loudness measurement"], ''IEEE Transactions on Audio and Electroacoustics'', Vol. 14:3 (Sep 1966), pp.141–151.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyzes sounds in terms of spectral content, each "hair-cell" responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a [[critical band]]. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore "collect" proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the signals to the brain add  the various bands to produce the impressions of loudness. For these reasons Equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz and a downward tilt below 1&amp;nbsp;kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.

Various weighting curves were derived in the 1960s, in particular as part of the [[DIN]] 4550 standard for [[audio quality measurement]], which differed from the A-weighting curve, showing more of a peak around 6&amp;nbsp;kHz. These gave a more meaningful subjective measure of noise on audio equipment, especially on the newly invented [[compact cassette]] tape recorders with [[Dolby]] noise reduction, which were characterised by a noise spectrum dominated by the higher frequencies.

[[BBC Research]] conducted listening trials in an attempt to find the best weighting curve and rectifier combination for use when measuring noise in broadcast equipment, examining the various new weighting curves in the context of noise rather than tones, confirming that they were much more valid than A-weighting when attempting to measure the subjective loudness of noise. This work also investigated the response of human hearing to tone-bursts, clicks, [[pink noise]] and a variety of other sounds that, because of their brief impulsive nature, do not give the ear and brain sufficient time to respond. The results were reported in BBC Research Report EL-17 1968/8 entitled ''The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits''.

The [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] curve, originally proposed in [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] recommendation 468, but later adopted by numerous standards bodies ([[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]], [[British Standards Institution|BSI]], [[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]) was based on the research, and incorporates a special [[Quasi-peak detector]] to account for our reduced sensitivity to short bursts and clicks.&lt;ref&gt;Ken’ichiro Masaoka, Kazuho Ono, and Setsu Komiyama, [http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ast/22/1/22_35/_article/-char/en "A measurement of equal-loudness level contours for tone burst"], ''Acoustical Science and Technology'', Vol. 22 (2001) , No. 1 pp.35–39.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used by Broadcasters and audio professionals when they measure noise on broadcast paths and audio equipment, so they can subjectively compare equipment types with different noise spectra and characteristics.

The staff of the new Finnish Institute of International Affairs consists of around 50 members. The Director of the Institute is Dr. [[Teija Tiilikainen]]. The work of the FIIA is directed by a nine-member board, appointed by the Parliament and chaired by Minister [[Antti Tanskanen]]. The Institute also has an advisory council. The Institute was set up at the centennial session of the Finnish Parliament in June 2006 and started to function 1 January 2007 under the auspices of the Parliament of Finland. Previously, the Finnish Institute of International Affairs functioned as a private research organization that was founded by the Paasikivi Society in 1961 and maintained by the Foundation for Foreign Policy Research. The core of the Institute's funding comes from the [[Parliament of Finland]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The '''historiography of science''' is the study of the history and methodology of the sub-discipline of history, known as the [[history of science]], including its disciplinary aspects and practices (methods, theories, schools) and to the study of its own historical development ("History of History of Science", i.e., the history of the discipline called History of Science).

Since historiographical debates regarding the proper method for the study of the history of science are sometimes difficult to demarcate from historical controversies regarding the very course of science, it is often (and rightly) the case that the early controversies of the latter kind are considered the inception of the sub-discipline. For example, such discussions permeate the historical writings of the great historian and philosopher of science [[William Whewell]]. He is thus often (and rightly) viewed as the grandfather of this discipline; other such distinguished grandfathers are [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Alexandre Koyré]].

As to the explicit presentation of the Historiography of Science it is usually dated in the early Sixties of the 20th century. Thus for example, in 1965 we find [[Gerd Buchdahl]] reporting "A Revolution in Historiography of Science" referring to the innovative studies of [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Joseph Agassi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Buchdahl Gerd |title= A Revolution in Historiography of Science|journal= History of Science|year= 1965 |pages=55–69|volume=4|bibcode = 1965HisSc...4...55B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that these two writers had inaugurated the sub discipline by distinguishing clearly between the history and the historiography of science, as they argued that historiographical views greatly influence the writing of the history of science.

== The origins of the discipline ==
Though scholars and scientists had been chronicling the results of scientific endeavors for centuries (such as [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' from 1837, and the popular and historical accounts which accompanied the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century), the development of the distinct [[academia|academic]] discipline of the history of science and technology did not occur until the early 20th century, and was intimately bound to the changing role of science during the same time period. The history of science was once exclusively the domain of retired researchers &amp;mdash; former scientists whose days in the [[laboratory]] had expired but still with a hearty interest in the field &amp;mdash; and the rare specialist. However, in the decades since the end of World War II the field has evolved into a full academic discipline, with [[graduate school]]s, research institutes, public and private patronage, [[peer-review]]ed [[academic journal|journals]], and professional societies.

The study of the history of science has had great effects on the [[philosophy of science]], conceptions of the role of science in society, and [[Public policy#Science Policy|scientific policy]].

The founding figure of the discipline in the [[United States]] was [[George Sarton]], later the founding editor of the journal ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]''. Sarton and his family fled [[Belgium]] after the [[Germany|German]] invasion in World War I, and after a brief stay in [[England]], he arrived in the United States penniless and unemployed. Sarton began lecturing part-time at several academic institutions, and in 1916 began a two-year appointment at [[Harvard University]]. When his appointment did not look like it would be renewed, he appealed to [[Robert S. Woodward]], president of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], for patronage. Woodward gave Sarton a two-year position and in 1920 extended it to a permanent tenured appointment as a Research Associate in the Institution's Department of History.

Though modern scholars do not usually share Sarton's motivations &amp;mdash; Sarton saw the history of science as the only genuine example of human progress &amp;mdash; the tools he left to the field, the journal ''Isis'' and the annual volume ''[[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]]'' (both still in print today), provided the foundation of the discipline in the United States.

== The Hessen thesis and the birth of externalism  ==

Just as the 1930s were a seminal decade for the development of our modern understanding of science, they were a seminal decade for the history and [[historiography]] of science as well. While Sarton taught the first American doctoral students in the discipline, in Europe some of the most influential historians and philosophers of science were first coming into the picture, and the setting of the philosophical battle which is now known as "the [[Science Wars]]" was being set.

In 1931, the Second International Congress of the History of Science was convened in London. The papers delivered by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegation, led by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin|N.I. Bukharin]], quickly invigorated the discipline. [[Boris Hessen]] in particular delivered a paper entitled "The Social and Economic Roots of Newton's ''Principia''," in which he asserted that [[Isaac Newton]]'s most famous work was created to cater to the goals and desires of 17th century industry and [[Economic system|economy]]. Hessen asserted that Newton's work was inspired by his economic status and context, that the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was little more than the solution of technical problems of the [[bourgeoisie]].

Present scholarship has revealed that Hessen's motives were not completely academic. At that time in the Soviet Union, the work of [[Albert Einstein]] was under attack by [[Communist Party]] [[philosophers]]; being supposedly motivated by bourgeois values, it was "[[bourgeois science]]" {{Harvcol|Graham|1985|p=&amp;nbsp;711}},  and should henceforth be banned. (In many ways this attack was similar to the ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' movement in Germany which occurred only a few years later.) Hessen's paper was a lobbying tactic: Party philosophers would not challenge the accuracy of Newton's theories, and to show them as being motivated by bourgeois concerns would, in Hessen's eyes, show that scientific validity could exist whatever the motivations were for undertaking it. However, there is little evidence that his paper had any effect in the internal Soviet philosophical battles over Einstein's work.

Despite its lack of effect in his home country, Hessen's thesis had a wide effect in Western history of science. Though Hessen’s work is now easily dismissed as "vulgar [[Marxism]]" {{Harvcol|Shaffer|1984|p=&amp;nbsp;26}}, its focus on the relationship between society and science was, in its time, seen as novel and inspiring. It was a challenge to the notion that the history of science was the history of individual [[genius]] in action, the dominant view at least since [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' in 1837.

Few contemporary Western readers of Hessen took his paper at face value. His rigid connection between economy and [[knowledge]] was not accepted by a majority of historians. However, his assertion that a connection existed between the growth of knowledge and the art of war, and that [[ballistics]] played a central part of physics and Newton's world, was viewed with keen interest. In the shadow of the first war to employ [[chemical weapons]], and as the war machines were again gearing up in preparation for another world war, the role between science, [[technology]], and warfare was becoming more interesting to scholars and scientists. Previous views of science as separate from the mundane or vulgar aspects of practical life &amp;mdash; the disembodiment of the scientific mind from its context &amp;mdash; were becoming less attractive than a view that science and scientists were increasingly embedded in the world in which they worked.

This became reflective in the scholarship of the time as well, with dissertations written on such subjects as "Science and War in the Old Regime," which examined the ways in which military engineering influenced pre-[[French Revolution|Revolution]] [[France|French]] scientists.

This method of doing the history of science became known as ''[[externalism]]'', looking at the manner in which science and scientists are affected, and guided by, their context and the world in which they exist. It is an approach which eschews the notion that the history of science is the development of pure thought over time, one idea leading to another in a contextual bubble which could exist at any place, at any time, if only given the right geniuses.

The contrast to this approach, the method of doing history of science which preceded externalism, became known as ''[[Internalism#Historiography of science|internalism]]''. Internalist histories of science often focus on the [[rational reconstruction]] of scientific ideas and consider the development of these ideas wholly within the scientific world. Although internalist histories of modern science tend to emphasize the norms of modern science, internalist histories can also consider the different systems of thought underlying the development of [[History of astronomy#Mesopotamia|Babylonian astronomy]] or Medieval [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] theory

In practice, the line between [[internalism and externalism]] can be incredibly fuzzy. Few historians then, or now, would insist that either of these approaches in their extremes paint a wholly complete picture, nor would it necessarily be possible to practice one fully over the other. However, at their heart they contain a basic question about the nature of science: what is the relationship between the producers and consumers of scientific knowledge? The answer to this question must, in some form, inform the method in which the history of science and technology is conducted; conversely, how the history of science and technology is conducted, and what it concludes, can inform the answer to the question. The question itself contains an entire host of philosophical questions: what is the nature of scientific truth? What does [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] mean in a scientific context? How does change in scientific theories occur?

The historian/sociologist of science [[Robert K. Merton]] produced many famous works following Hessen's thesis, which can be seen as reactions to and refinements of Hessen's argument. In his work on science, technology, and society in the 17th century [[England]], Merton sought to introduce an additional category &amp;mdash; [[Puritan]]ism &amp;mdash; to explain the growth of science in this period. Merton worked to split Hessen's crude category of economics into smaller subcategories of influence, including transportation, mining, and military technique. Merton also tried to develop [[empirical]], [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] approaches to showing the influence of external factors on science. Despite these changes, Merton was quick to note his indebtedness to Hessen. Even with his emphasis on external factors, though, Merton differed from Hessen in his interpretation: Merton maintained that while researchers may be inspired and interested by problems which were suggested by extra-scientific factors, ultimately the researcher's interests were driven by "the internal history of the science in question.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}" Merton attempted to delineate externalism and internalism along disciplinary boundaries, with ''context'' studied by the [[sociology of science|sociologist of science]], and ''content'' by the historian.

== Ludwik Fleck ==

Around the same period, in 1935, [[Ludwik Fleck]], a Polish medical microbiologist published his [[Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact]] which used a case study in the field of medicine (of the development of the disease concept of Syphilis) to present a thesis about the social nature of knowledge, and in particular science and scientific 'thought styles' (Denkstil) which are the epistemological, conceptual and linguistic styles of scientific (but also non-scientific) 'thought collectives' (Denkkollektiv). This work's importance was not noticed, as [Thaddeus J. Trenn] editor of the English edition published in 1979 writes, 'Fleck's pioneering monograph was published at almost the same time as [[Karl Popper]]'s [[Logik der Forschung]]. But, developed in very different cognitive styles, the books met with contrasting response. In Popper's own words, his book "was surprisingly successful, far beyond Vienna. [...]" [...] It is perhaps most diagnostic that the book received no review notice at all in [[George Sarton]]'s [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'']], by then the leading international journal of the [[history of science]].' [pp. xvii-xviii].

As evident from Fleck's book's title, it revolves around the notion that epistemologically, there is nothing stable or realistically true or false about any scientific fact. A fact has a 'genesis' which is grounded in certain theoretic grounds and many times other obscure and fuzzy notions, and it 'develops' as it is subject to dispute and additional research by other scientists. Fleck's work, unlike Hessen's work focuses more on the epistemological and linguistic factors that affect scientific discovery, innovation and progress or development, while Hessen's work focuses on socio-political factors.

Fleck's work was one of the major influences noted by [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] which led to the writing his ''[[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. Kuhn also wrote the foreword to Fleck's English translation.

== Vannevar Bush and World War II ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

The study of the history of science continued to be a small effort until the rise of [[Big Science]] after World War II. The influential bureaucrat [[Vannevar Bush]], and the president of Harvard, [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], both encouraged the study of the history of science as a way of improving general knowledge about how science worked, and why it was essential to maintain a large scientific workforce.

== Thomas Kuhn and the 1960s ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
From the 1940s through the early 1960s, most histories of science were different forms of a "march of progress" {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, showing science as a triumphant movement towards truth. Many philosophers and historians did of course paint a more nuanced picture, but it was not until the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' that this approach became seriously suspected as being misleading {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Kuhn's argument that scientific revolutions worked by [[paradigm shift]]s seemed to imply that truth was not the ultimate criterion for science, and the book was extremely influential outside of academia as well {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Corresponding with the rise of the [[environmentalism]] movement and a general loss of optimism of the power of science and technology unfettered to solve the problems of the world, this new history encouraged many critics to pronounce the preeminence of science to be overthrown {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

== The discipline today ==

The '''Hurrian songs''' are a collection of music inscribed in [[cuneiform]] on clay tablets excavated from the ancient [[Amorite]]&lt;ref name=Pardee&gt;Dennis Pardee, "Ugaritic", in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vTrT-bZyuPcC&amp;pg=PA5 The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia]'', edited by Roger D.

(1998), "Canaanites" (British Museum People of the Past)&lt;/ref&gt; city of [[Ugarit]], a headland in northern Syria, which date to approximately 1400 BC. One of these tablets, which is nearly complete, contains the '''[[Hurrians|Hurrian]] hymn to [[Nikkal]]''' (also known as the '''Hurrian cult hymn''' or '''A Zaluzi to the Gods''', or simply '''h.6'''), making it the oldest surviving substantially complete work of [[Musical notation|notated music]] in the world. While the composers' names of some of the fragmentary pieces are known, '''h.6''' is an [[anonymous work]].

==History==
[[File:Ugarit mapa.jpg|thumb|150px|Ugarit, where the Hurrian songs were found]]

The complete song is one of about 36 such hymns in [[cuneiform]] writing, found on fragments of [[clay tablet]]s excavated in the 1950s from the [[Royal Palace of Ugarit|Royal Palace]] at [[Ugarit]] (present day [[Ras Shamra]], [[Syria]]),&lt;ref&gt;K. Marie Stolba, ''The Development of Western Music: A History'', brief second edition (Madison: Brown &amp; Benchmark Publishers, 1995), p. 2.; M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 171.&lt;/ref&gt; in a stratum dating from the fourteenth century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin, "Sur la restitution de la musique hourrite", ''Revue de Musicologie'' 66, no. 1 (1980): 5–26, citation on p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; but is the only one surviving in substantially complete form.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Kilmer, "Mesopotamia §8(ii)", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; An account of the group of shards was first published in 1955 and 1968 by [[Emmanuel Laroche]], who identified as parts of a single clay tablet the three fragments catalogued by the field archaeologists as RS 15.30, 15.49, and 17.387. In Laroche's catalogue the hymns are designated '''h.''' (for "Hurrian") 2–17, 19–23, 25–6, 28, 30, along with smaller fragments RS. 19.164 ''g'', ''j'', ''n'', ''o'', ''p'', ''r'', ''t'', ''w'', ''x'', ''y'', ''aa'', and ''gg''. The complete hymn is h.6 in this list.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Laroche, ''Le palais royal d' Ugarit'' 3: Textes accadiens et hourrites des archives Est, Ouest et centrales, 2 vols., edited by Jean Nougayrol, Georges Boyer, Emmanuel Laroche, and Claude-Frédéric-Armand Schaeffer, 1:327–35 and 2: plates cviii–cix (Paris: C. Klincksieck, 1955):; "Documents en langue houritte provenent de Ras Shamra", in ''Ugaritica 5: Nouveaux textes accadiens, hourrites et ugaritiques des archives et bibliothèques privées d'Ugarit'', edited by Claude-Frédéric-Armand Schaeffer and  Jean Nougayrol, 462–96. Bibliothèque archéologique et historique / Institut français d'archéologie de Beyrouth 80; Mission de Ras Shamra 16 (Paris: Imprimerie nationale P. Geuthner; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1968). In the latter, the transcribed text of h.6 is on p. 463, with the cuneiform text reproduced on p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; A revised text of h.6 was published in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Manfried Dietrich and Oswald Loretz, "Kollationen zum Musiktext aus Ugarit", ''Ugarit-Forschungen'' 7 (1975): 521–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tablet h.6 contains the lyrics for a hymn to Nikkal, a [[Ancient Semitic religion|Semitic]] goddess of [[orchard]]s, and instructions for a singer accompanied by a nine-stringed ''sammûm'', a type of [[harp]] or, much more likely, a [[lyre]].&lt;ref&gt;M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 166.&lt;/ref&gt; One or more of the tablets also contains instructions for [[Musical tuning|tuning the harp]].&lt;ref&gt;Anon., "[http://www.amaranthpublishing.com/hurrian.htm The Oldest Song in the World]" (Amaranth Publishing, 2006). (Accessed 12 January 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hurrian hymn pre-dates several other surviving early works of music, e.g., the [[Seikilos epitaph]] and the [[Delphic Hymns]], by a millennium, but its transcription remains controversial. A reconstruction by Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin may be heard at the Urkesh webpage,&lt;ref name=Urkesh/&gt; though this is only one of at least five "rival decipherments of the notation, each yielding entirely different results".&lt;ref&gt;M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 161.

The tablet is in the collection of the [[National Museum of Damascus]].

==Notation==
[[File:Ugarit Corbel.jpg|right|thumbnail|The Entrance to the royal palace at Ugarit, where the Hurrian songs were found.]]

The arrangement of the tablet h.6 places the [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] words of the hymn at the top, under which is a double division line. The hymn text is written in a continuous spiral, alternating recto-verso sides of the tablet—a layout not found in Babylonian texts.&lt;ref&gt;Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin, "Sur la restitution de la musique hourrite", ''Revue de Musicologie'' 66, no. 1 (1980): 5–26, citation on pp. 10, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Below this is found the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] musical instructions, consisting of interval names followed by number signs.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Kilmer, "Mesopotamia §8(ii)", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in transcriptions hinge on interpretation of the meaning of these paired signs, and the relationship to the hymn text. Below the musical instructions there is another dividing line—single this time—underneath which is a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] in Akkadian reading "This [is] a song [in the] ''nitkibli'' [i.e., the ''nid qabli'' tuning], a ''zaluzi'' … written down by Ammurabi".&lt;ref&gt;David Wulstan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/734711 "The Earliest Musical Notation"], ''Music and Letters'' 52 (1971): 365–82. Citation on 372. {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name and another scribe's name found on one of the other tablets, Ipsali, are both Semitic. There is no composer named for the complete hymn, but four composers' names are found for five of the fragmentary pieces: Tapšiẖuni, Puẖiya(na), Urẖiya (two hymns: h.8 and h.12), and Ammiya. These are all Hurrian names.&lt;ref&gt;M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akkadian cuneiform music notation refers to a [[Heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] [[diatonic scale]] on a nine-stringed lyre, in a tuning system described on three Akkadian tablets, two from the Late Babylonian and one from the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period (approximately the 18th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;O. R. Gurney, "An Old Babylonian Treatise on the Tuning of the Harp", ''Iraq'' 30 (1968): 229–33. Citations on pp. 229 and 233. Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin, ""Sur la restitution de la musique hourrite", ''Revue de Musicologie'' 66, no. 1 (1980): 5–26, citation on pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Babylonian theory describes [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of [[Interval (music)#Number|third]]s, [[Perfect fourth|fourth]]s, [[Perfect fifth|fifth]]s, and [[Interval (music)#Number|sixth]]s, but only with specific terms for the various groups of strings that may be spanned by the hand over that distance, within the purely theoretical range of a seven-string lyre (even though the actual instrument described has nine strings). Babylonian theory had no term for the abstract distance of a fifth or a fourth—only for fifths and fourths between specific pairs of strings. As a result, there are fourteen terms in all, describing two groups of six strings, three groups of five, four groups of four, and five different groups of three strings. There are no known terms corresponding to a single note, or to intervals of a [[Interval (music)|seventh]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin, ""Sur la restitution de la musique hourrite", ''Revue de Musicologie'' 66, no. 1 (1980): 5–26, citation on pp. 6–8. M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The names of these fourteen pairs of strings form the basis of the theoretical system and are arranged by twos in the ancient sources (string-number pairs first, then the regularized Old Babylonian names and translations):&lt;ref&gt;M[artin] L[itchfield] West, "The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts", ''Music and Letters'' 75, no. 2 (May 1994): 161–79, citation on 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

::1–5 ''nīš gab(a)rîm'' (raising of the counterpart)
:::7–5 ''šērum'' (song?)
::2–6 ''išartum'' (straight/in proper condition)
:::1–6 ''šalšatum'' (third)
::3–7 ''embūbum'' (reed-pipe)
:::2–7 ''rebûttum'' (fourth)
::4–1 ''nīd qablim'' (casting down of the middle)
:::1–3 ''isqum'' (lot/portion)
::5–2 ''qablītum'' (middle)
:::2–4 ''titur qablītim'' (bridge of the middle)
::6–3 ''kitmum'' (covering/closing)
:::3–5 ''titur išartim'' (bridge of the ''išartum'')
::7–4 ''pītum'' (opening)
:::4–6 ''ṣ/zerdum'' (?)

The name of the first item of each pair is also used as the name of a tuning. These are all fifths (''nīš gab(a)rîm'', ''išartum', ''embūbum') or fourths (''nīd qablim'', ''qablītum'', ''kitmum'', and ''pītum''), and have been called by one modern scholar the "primary" intervals—the other seven (which are not used as names of tunings) being the "secondary" intervals: thirds and sixths.&lt;ref&gt;David Wulstan, "The Tuning of the Babylonian Harp", ''Iraq'' 30 (1968): 215–28. Citation on pp. 216 n. 3 and 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

A transcription of the first two lines of the notation on h.6 reads:
:''qáb-li-te 3 [[ir (cuneiform)|ir]]-bu-[[te (cuneiform)|te]] 1 qáb-li-te 3 ša-aḫ-ri 1 i-šar-te 10 uš-ta-ma-a-ri''
:''ti-ti-mi-šar-te 2 zi-ir-te 1 ša-[a]ḫ-ri 2 ša-aš-ša-te 2 ir-bu-te 2''.&lt;ref&gt;Manfried Dietrich and Oswald Loretz, "Kollationen zum Musiktext aus Ugarit", ''Ugarit-Forschungen'' 7 (1975): 521–22. Citation on p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the unsystematic succession of the interval names, their location below apparently lyric texts, and the regular interpolation of numerals that led to the conclusion that these were notated musical compositions. Some of the terms differ to varying degrees from the Akkadian forms found in the older theoretical text, which is not surprising since they were foreign terms. For example, ''irbute'' in the hymn notation corresponds to ''rebûttum'' in the theory text, ''šaḫri'' = ''šērum'', ''zirte'' = ''ṣ/zerdum'', ''šaššate'' = ''šalšatum'', and ''titim išarte'' = ''titur išartim''. There are also a few rarer, additional words, some of them apparently Hurrian rather than Akkadian. Because these interrupt the interval-numeral pattern, they may be modifiers of the preceding or following named interval. The first line of h.6, for example, ends with ''ušta mari'', and this word-pair is also found on several of the other, fragmentary hymn tablets, usually following but not preceding a numeral.&lt;ref&gt;David Wulstan, "The Earliest Musical Notation", ''Music and Letters'' 52 (1971): 365–82. Citations on pp. 371 and 373–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The text of h.6 is difficult, in part because the Hurrian language itself is imperfectly understood, and in part because of small [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] due to missing flakes of the clay tablet. In addition, however, it appears that the language is a local Ugarit dialect, which differs significantly from the dialects known from other sources. It is also possible that the pronunciation of some words was altered from normal speech because of the music.&lt;ref&gt;Theo J. H. Krispijn, "Musik in Keilschrift: Beiträge zur altorientalischen Musikforschung 2", in ''Archäologie früher Klangerzeugung und Tonordnung: Musikarchäologie in der Ägäis und Anatolien''/''The Archaeology of Sound Origin and Organization: Music Archaeology in the Aegean and Anatolia'', edited by Ellen Hickmann, Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and Ricardo Eichmann, 465–79 (Orient-Archäologie 10; Studien zur Musikarchäologie 3) (Rahden: Leidorf, 2001) {{ISBN|3-89646-640-2}}. Citation on p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the many difficulties, it is clearly a religious text concerning offerings to the goddess Nikkal, wife of the moon god. The text is presented in four lines, with the peculiarity that the seven final syllables of each of the first three lines on the verso of the tablet are repeated at the beginning of the next line on the recto. While Laroche saw in this a procedure similar to one employed by Babylonian scribes in longer texts to provide continuity at the transition from one tablet to another, Güterbock and Kilmer took the position that this device is never found within the text on a single tablet, and so these repeated syllables must constitute [[refrain]]s dividing the text into regular sections. To this, Duchesne-Guillemin retorts that the recto-verso-recto spiral path of the text—an arrangement unknown in Babylon—is ample reason for the use of such guides.&lt;ref&gt;Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin, "Sur la restitution de la musique hourrite", ''Revue de Musicologie'' 66, no. 1 (1980): 5–26, citation on pp. 13, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published attempt to interpret the text of h.6 was made in 1977 by Hans-Jochen Thiel,&lt;ref&gt;"Der Text und die Notenfolgen des Musiktextes aus Ugarit", ''Studi Micenei ed Egeo-Anatolici'' 18 (=''Incunabula Graeca'' 67) (1977): 109–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and his work formed the basis for a new but still very provisional attempt made 24 years later by Theo J. H. Krispijn, after Hurritology had made significant progress thanks to archaeological discoveries made in the meantime at a site near [[Boğazkale]].&lt;ref&gt;Theo J. H. Krispijn, "Musik in Keilschrift: Beiträge zur altorientalischen Musikforschung 2", in ''Archäologie früher Klangerzeugung und Tonordnung: Musikarchäologie in der Ägäis und Anatolien''/''The Archaeology of Sound Origin and Organization: Music Archaeology in the Aegean and Anatolia'', edited by Ellen Hickmann, Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and Ricardo Eichmann, 465–79 (Orient-Archäologie 10; Studien zur Musikarchäologie 3) (Rahden: Leidorf, 2001) {{ISBN|3-89646-640-2}}.

[[File:Dopplereffectsourcemovingrightatmach5.0.gif|thumb|Simulation of hypersonic speed (Mach 5)]]
In [[aerodynamics]], a '''hypersonic speed''' is one that greatly exceeds the [[speed of sound]], particularly [[speed of sound|Mach]] 5 and above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Atmospheric Flight in the Twentieth Century | editor=Galison, P.; Roland, A. | publisher=Springer | year=2000 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfrOBgAAQBAJ | isbn=978-94-011-4379-0 | page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise [[Mach number]] at which a craft can be said to be flying at hypersonic speed varies, since individual physical changes in the airflow (like molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]]) occur at different speeds; these effects collectively become important around Mach 5. The hypersonic regime is often alternatively defined as speeds where [[ramjet]]s do not produce net [[thrust]].

==Characteristics of flow==
While the definition of hypersonic flow can be quite vague and is generally debatable (especially due to the absence of discontinuity between supersonic and hypersonic flows), a hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain physical phenomena that can no longer be analytically discounted as in supersonic flow. The peculiarity in hypersonic flows are as follows:
# Shock layer
# [[Aerodynamic heating]]
# Entropy layer
# Real gas effects
# Low density effects
# Independence of aerodynamic coefficients with Mach number.

===Small shock stand-off distance===
As a body's Mach number increases, the density behind a [[Shock wave#Bow shocks|bow shock]] generated by the body also increases, which corresponds to a decrease in volume behind the shock due to [[conservation of mass]]. Consequently, the distance between the bow shock and the body decreases at higher Mach numbers.

===Entropy layer===
As Mach numbers increase, the [[entropy]] change across the shock also increases, which results in a strong [[entropy gradient]] and highly [[vortical]] flow that mixes with the [[boundary layer]].

===Viscous interaction===
A portion of the large [[kinetic energy]] associated with flow at high Mach numbers transforms into [[internal energy]] in the fluid due to viscous effects. The increase in internal energy is realized as an increase in temperature. Since the pressure gradient normal to the flow within a boundary layer is approximately zero for low to moderate hypersonic Mach numbers, the increase of temperature through the boundary layer coincides with a decrease in density. This causes the bottom of the boundary layer to expand, so that the boundary layer over the body grows thicker and can often merge with the shock wave near the body leading edge.

===High-temperature flow===
High temperatures due to a manifestation of viscous dissipation cause non-equilibrium chemical flow properties such as vibrational excitation and [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]] of molecules resulting in [[convection|convective]] and [[Atmospheric reentry#Real (non-equilibrium) gas model|radiative heat-flux]].

== Classification of Mach regimes ==
Although "subsonic" and "supersonic" usually refer to speeds below and above the local [[speed of sound]] respectively, aerodynamicists often use these terms to refer to particular ranges of Mach values. This occurs because a "[[transonic]] regime" exists around M=1 where approximations of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] used for subsonic design no longer apply, partly because the flow locally exceeds M=1 even when the freestream{{clarify|date=March 2018}} Mach number is below this value.

The "supersonic regime" usually refers to the set of Mach numbers for which linearised theory may be used; for example, where the ([[air]]) flow is not chemically reacting and where [[heat transfer]] between air and vehicle may be reasonably neglected in calculations.

Generally, [[NASA]] defines "high" hypersonic as any Mach number from 10 to 25, and re-entry speeds as anything greater than Mach 25. Among the aircraft operating in this regime are the [[Space Shuttle]] and (theoretically) various developing [[spaceplane]]s.

In the following table, the "regimes" or "ranges of Mach values" are referenced instead of the usual meanings of "subsonic" and "supersonic".

| Aircraft designed to fly at supersonic speeds show large differences in their aerodynamic design because of the radical differences in the behaviour of [[fluid flow]]s above Mach 1. Sharp edges, thin [[airfoil]]-sections, and all-moving [[tailplane]]/[[canard (aeronautics)|canards]] are common. Modern [[combat aircraft]] must compromise in order to maintain low-speed handling; "true" supersonic designs include the [[F-104 Starfighter]] and BAC/Aérospatiale [[Concorde]].

==Similarity parameters==
The categorization of airflow relies on a number of [[Dimensionless numbers|similarity parameters]], which allow the simplification of a nearly infinite number of test cases into groups of similarity. For transonic and [[compressible flow]], the [[Mach number|Mach]] and [[Reynolds number]]s alone allow good categorization of many flow cases.

Hypersonic flows, however, require other similarity parameters. First, the [[analytic equation]]s for the [[shock wave|oblique shock angle]] become nearly independent of Mach number at high (~&gt;10) Mach numbers. Second, the formation of strong shocks around aerodynamic bodies means that the freestream [[Reynolds number]] is less useful as an estimate of the behavior of the [[boundary layer]] over a body (although it is still important). Finally, the increased temperature of hypersonic flows mean that [[real gas]] effects become important. For this reason, research in hypersonics is often referred to as [[aerothermodynamics]], rather than [[aerodynamics]].

The introduction of real gas effects means that more variables are required to describe the full state of a gas. Whereas a stationary gas can be described by three variables ([[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[adiabatic index]]), and a moving gas by four ([[flow velocity]]), a hot gas in chemical equilibrium also requires state equations for the chemical components of the gas, and a gas in nonequilibrium solves those state equations using time as an extra variable. This means that for a nonequilibrium flow, something between 10 and 100 variables may be required to describe the state of the gas at any given time. Additionally, rarefied hypersonic flows (usually defined as those with a [[Knudsen number]] above 0.1) do not follow the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].

Hypersonic flows are typically categorized by their total energy, expressed as total [[enthalpy]] (MJ/kg), total pressure (kPa-MPa), stagnation pressure (kPa-MPa), [[stagnation temperature]] (K), or flow velocity (km/s).

[[Wallace D. Hayes]] developed a similarity parameter, similar to the [[area rule|Whitcomb area rule]], which allowed similar configurations to be compared.

==Regimes==
Hypersonic flow can be approximately separated into a number of regimes. The selection of these regimes is rough, due to the blurring of the boundaries where a particular effect can be found.

===Perfect gas===
In this regime, the gas can be regarded as an [[ideal gas]]. Flow in this regime is still Mach number dependent. Simulations start to depend on the use of a constant-temperature wall, rather than the adiabatic wall typically used at lower speeds. The lower border of this region is around Mach 5, where [[ramjet]]s become inefficient, and the upper border around Mach 10-12.

===Two-temperature ideal gas===
This is a subset of the perfect gas regime, where the gas can be considered chemically perfect, but the rotational and vibrational temperatures of the gas must be considered separately, leading to two temperature models. See particularly the modeling of supersonic nozzles, where vibrational freezing becomes important.

===Dissociated gas===
In this regime, diatomic or polyatomic gases (the gases found in most atmospheres) begin to [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] as they come into contact with the [[Shock wave|bow shock]] generated by the body. [[catalysis|Surface catalysis]] plays a role in the calculation of surface heating, meaning that the type of surface material also has an effect on the flow. The lower border of this regime is where any component of a gas mixture first begins to dissociate in the stagnation point of a flow (which for nitrogen is around 2000 K). At the upper border of this regime, the effects of [[ionization]] start to have an effect on the flow.

===Ionized gas===
In this regime the [[ionization|ionized]] electron population of the stagnated flow becomes significant, and the electrons must be modeled separately. Often the electron temperature is handled separately from the temperature of the remaining gas components. This region occurs for freestream flow velocities around 10–12&amp;nbsp;km/s. Gases in this region are modeled as non-radiating [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].

===Radiation-dominated regime===
Above around 12&amp;nbsp;km/s, the heat transfer to a vehicle changes from being conductively dominated to radiatively dominated. The modeling of gases in this regime is split into two classes:
#[[Optical depth|Optically thin]]: where the gas does not re-absorb radiation emitted from other parts of the gas
#Optically thick: where the radiation must be considered a separate source of energy.
The modeling of optically thick gases is extremely difficult, since, due to the calculation of the radiation at each point, the computation load theoretically expands exponentially as the number of points considered increases.

'''Language delay''' is a failure in [[children]] to develop [[language]] abilities on the usual [[age-appropriate]] for their [[developmental timetable]]. It is most common during the ages of 2 to 7 years and can sometimes continue into late childhood.  Language delay is distinct from [[speech delay]], in which the development of the [[Manner of articulation|mechanical and motor aspects of speech production]] is delayed.

Communication is a two-stage process.  The first stage is to encode the message into a set of words (or signs in the case of Sign Languages) and sentence structures that convey the required meaning, i.e. into language. In the second stage, language is translated into motor commands that control the articulators (hands, face, body, lungs, vocal cords, mouth, tongue, teeth, etc.), thereby creating language.

Because language and speech are independent, they may be individually delayed. For example, a child may be delayed in speech
(i.e., unable to produce intelligible speech sounds), but not delayed in language because they use a Sign Language or other means of communication.

{{anchor|receptive|expressive}}Language delay is commonly divided into ''receptive'' and ''expressive'' categories. [[Receptive language]] refers to the process of understanding language.  [[Expressive language]] refers to the use of sentences (made of words or signs) to communicate messages to others.  Both categories are essential to effective communication.

==Presentation==
===Complications===
Language delay is a [[risk factor]] for other types of developmental delay, including social, emotional, and cognitive delay. Even though speech and language delays may affect a smaller portion of the population in children, it still can have an incredible impact on their life and their accomplishments in the future. Some of these include problems with behavior, difficulty with reading, and other issues related to spelling and low IQ scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Screening for speech and language delay in preschool children: Recommendation statement|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/speech-and-language-delay-in-preschool-children-screening|journal=Pediatrics|volume=117|issue=2|pages=497-501|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children may grow out of these deficits, even coming to excel where they once lagged, while others do not. One particularly common result of language delay is delayed or inadequate acquisition of [[reading (activity)|reading]] skills. Reading depends upon an ability to code and decode script (i.e., match speech sounds with symbols, and vice versa). If a child is still struggling to master language and speech, it is very difficult to learn another level of complexity (writing). Thus, it is crucial that children have facility with language to be successful readers.

Neuroscientist [[Steven Pinker]] postulates that a certain form of language delay may be associated with exceptional and innate analytical prowess in some individuals, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Steven| last=Pinker| title=His Brain Measured Up| url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=24 June 1999| accessdate=2006-12-04| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211085927/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html| archivedate=11 December 2006| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Language delays are the most frequent [[developmental delay]]s, and can occur for many reasons. A delay can be due to being a “[[late bloomer]]”, “[[late talker]]”, or a more serious problem. The most common causes of speech delay include
* Hearing loss
* Slow development
* [[Intellectual disability]]

Such delays can occur in conjunction with a lack of mirroring of [[facial response]]s, unresponsiveness or unawareness of certain [[noise]]s, a lack of interest in playing with other children or toys, or no pain response to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toplanguageguide.com/language-acquisition.php |title=Language Learning Styles |date=August 2013 |publisher=TLG |accessdate=22 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823095038/http://www.toplanguageguide.com/language-acquisition.php |archivedate=23 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Frequently Asked Questions| url=http://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Resource_Centers/Autism_Resource_Center/FAQ.aspx| publisher=American Academy of Children &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry| accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes include:
* [[Psychosocial deprivation]] - The child doesn't spend enough time communicating with adults, such as babbling and joint attention. Research on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct interactions with parents and other significant care givers for healthy brain growth and the development of appropriate social, emotional, and cognitive skills.&lt;ref name="American Academy of Pediatrics"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Committee on Public Education |title=Media education |journal=Pediatrics |volume=104 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=341–3 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10429023 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/104/2/341.long |doi=10.1542/peds.104.2.341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Television]] viewing is associated with delayed language development. Children who watched television alone were 8.47 times more likely to have language delay when compared to children who interacted with their caregivers during television viewing.&lt;ref name="Chonchaiya 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chonchaiya| first1=W| last2=Pruksananonda| first2=C |title=Television viewing associates with delayed language development |journal=[[Acta Paediatrica]] |volume=97 |issue=7 |pages=977–82 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18460044 |doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00831.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some educational television shows, such as Blue's Clues, have been found to enhance a child's language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bavelier, |first1=Daphne |last2=Green |first2=Shawn |last3=Dye |first3=Matthew |title=Children, wired – for better and for worse |journal=Neuron |date=2010 |pages=692–701. |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.08.035 |pmid=20826302 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170902/}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, as recommended by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], children under the age of 2 should watch no television at all, and after age 2 watch no more than one to two hours of quality programming a day. Therefore, exposing such young children to television programs should be discouraged, especially television shows with no educational value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bavelier, |first1=Daphne |last2=Green |first2=Shawn |last3=Dye |first3=Matthew |title=Children, wired – for better and for worse |journal=Neuron |date=2010 |pages=692–701. |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.08.035 |pmid=20826302 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170902/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents should engage children in more conversational activities to avoid television-related delays to their children language development, which could impair their intellectual performance. However, in a study conducted by Dr. Birken of the Hospital for Sick Children, it was found that watching television while interacting with a parent of caregiver is actually beneficial for children who are bilingual. The study spanned four years, from 2011 to 2015, and was based on parent report and clinician observation. Over the four years it was found that if a bilingual child had interaction with an adult while watching television they did not suffer language delay and it in fact helped them develop English, their second language. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Akpan |first1=N |title=Toddler's Screen Time Linked to Slower Speech Development |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/toddlers-screen-time-linked-slower-speech-development-study-finds |website=PBS |publisher=PBS |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gender and how each gender uses technology can also impact a child's language development. The use of handheld electronics in addition to television differs between boys and girls. A survey done in 2014 in the UK by Ofcom showed that 21% of girls ages 3-4 used handheld electronics whereas 30% of boys ages 3-4 used handheld electronics. From this study, the results show that gender provides a gap between the usage of electronics when comparing boys and girls, even though they are the same age. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kucirkova|first=Natalia|last2=Littleton|first2=Karen|last3=Kyparissiadis|first3=Antonios|date=2017-01-03|title=The influence of children's gender and age on children's use of digital media at home|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12543|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=49|issue=3|pages=545–559|doi=10.1111/bjet.12543|issn=0007-1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stress during pregnancy is associated with language delay.&lt;ref name="pmid17355398"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Talge| first1=NM| last2=Neal| first2=C| last3=Glover| first3=V |title=Antenatal maternal stress and long-term effects on child neurodevelopment: how and why? |journal=[[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] |volume=48 |issue=3-4 |pages=245–61 |year=2007 |pmid=17355398 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01714.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Being a twin or a younger sibling increases the chance of speech and language delays. Reasons for this are thought to include less one-on-one time with parents, premature birth with twins, and the companionship of their twin sibling reducing their motivation to talk to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twinpickle.com/2017/11/07/do-twins-talk-to-each-other/|title=Do Twins Talk to Each Other in a Secret Language?|date=2017-11-07|work=Twin Pickle|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With being a younger sibling, it can also be linked to less one on one time with their parents or guardians. Older siblings also tend to talk for their younger siblings, giving them less opportunities to grow their language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turnbull |first1=Khara |last2=Justice |first2=Laura |title=Language Development from Theory to Practice |date=2017 |publisher=Pearson |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]{{fact|date=December 2016}}
* [[Autism]] (a developmental disorder) - There is strong evidence that autism is commonly associated with language delay.&lt;ref name="pmid16608544"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miniscalco| first1=C| last2=Nygren| first2=G| last3=Hagberg| first3=B| last4=Kadesjö| first4=B| last5=Gillberg| first5=C |title=Neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental outcome of children at age 6 and 7 years who screened positive for language problems at 30 months |journal=[[Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology]] |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=361–6 |date=May 2006 |doi=10.1017/S0012162206000788| pmid=16608544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19713073"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hagberg BS, Miniscalco C, Gillberg C |title=Clinic attenders with autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: cognitive profile at school age and its relationship to preschool indicators of language delay |journal=[[Research in Developmental Disabilities]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2010 |pmid=19713073 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2009.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asperger syndrome]], which is on the autistic spectrum, however, is not associated with language delay.&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00&gt;{{cite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |edition=4 |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc=768475353 |url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Selective mutism]] (an anxiety disorder that is expressed by loss of speech)
* [[Cerebral palsy]] (a movement disorder caused by brain damage)
* Genetic abnormalities - In 2005, researchers found a connection between expressive language delay and a genetic abnormality: a duplicate set of the same genes that are missing in sufferers of [[Williams-Beuren syndrome]]. Also so called [[XYY syndrome]] can often cause speech delay.&lt;ref&gt;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/47xyy-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt;
* Correlation with male sex, previous family history, and maternal education has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell| first1=T F| last2=Dollaghan| first2=C A| last3=Rockette| first3=H E| last4=Paradise| first4=J L| last5=Feldman| first5=H M| last6=Shriberg| first6=L D| last7=Sabo| first7=D L| last8=Kurs-Lasky| first8=M| title=Risk factors for speech delay of unknown origin in 3-year-old children| journal=[[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]]| date=2002| volume=74| issue=2| pages=346–57| pmid=12705559| url=http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/phonology/pubs/PUB18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Studies have failed to find clear evidence that a language delay can be prevented by training or educating health care professionals in the subject. Overall, some of the reviews show positive results regarding interventions in language delay, but are not curative.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary - Early Identification of Language Delays, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
To treat an already existing language delay a child would need Speech and Language Therapy to correct any deficits. These therapists can be found in schools, clinics, through home care agencies, and also colleges where Communication Sciences and Disorders are studied. Aside from these, it is still encouraged for the child's parent to get involved. A few ways that a parent could get involved with helping to  improve a child’s language and speech skills includes speaking to their child with enthusiasm, engaging in conversations revolving what the child is focusing on, and reading to their child frequently. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespec.com/|title=When to worry if a child has too few words|last1=Klass|first1=Perri|date=2010|website=The Hamilton Spectator|publisher=The Hamilton Spectator|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social and play skills appear to be more difficult for children with language delays due to their decreased experience in conversation. [[Speech pathologist|Speech Pathologists]] utilize methods such as prompting to improve a child's social skills through play intervention. While recent studies have consistently found play intervention to be helpful, further research is required in order to determine the effectiveness of this form of therapy. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sualy|first=Abbey|last2=Yount|first2=Sara|last3=Kelly-Vance|first3=Lisa|last4=Ryalls|first4=Brigette|date=2011|title=Using a play intervention to improve the play skills of children with a language delay|url=https://web-a-ebscohost-com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=d05a7084-3661-4cd4-bbde-065956fef94a%40sessionmgr4009|journal=International Journal of Psychology|volume=|pages=105-122|via=PsychINFO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7454">A '''magnetorheological damper''' or '''magnetorheological shock absorber''' is a [[shock absorber|damper]] filled with [[magnetorheological fluid]], which is controlled by a [[magnetic field]], usually using an [[electromagnet]].&lt;ref name="Innovative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writing.engr.psu.edu/me5984/poynor.pdf |title=Innovative Designs for Magneto-Rheological Dampers |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/Applications/PrimarySuspension/tabid/3329/Default.aspx Primary Suspension] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014053750/http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/Applications/PrimarySuspension/tabid/3329/Default.aspx |date=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/MRFluidTechnology/tabid/3318/Default.aspx MR Fluid Technology {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013211354/http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/MRFluidTechnology/tabid/3318/Default.aspx |date=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the damping characteristics of the [[shock absorber]] to be continuously controlled by varying the power of the [[electromagnet]]. Fluid [[viscosity]] increases within the damper as [[electromagnet]] intensity increases. This type of shock absorber has several applications, most notably in [[active suspension|semi-active]] [[vehicle suspension]]s which may adapt to road conditions, as they are monitored through sensors in the vehicle, and in [[prosthetic]] [[artificial limbs|limbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/MRFluidTechnology/TechnologyCompared/tabid/3773/Default.aspx Technology Compared] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017011256/http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/MRFluidTechnology/TechnologyCompared/tabid/3773/Default.aspx |date=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

*[[Twin tube]]

*[[VIP MR damper]]

==Commercial applications==
Many applications have been proposed using magnetorheological (MR) dampers. While vehicle applications are the most common use of MR dampers, useful medical applications have risen as well, including implants and rehabilitation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=J.D.|last2=Matthis|first2=W.|last3=Toscano|first3=J.R.|title=Smart Prosthetics Based on MR Fluids|journal=Proc. 8th annual symposium On Smart Structure And Material SPIE|date=March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since MR dampers are not yet perfect, they are limited in terms of application. Disadvantages do exist when using a large scale MR damper, for example, particle settling within the carrier fluid may occur that inhibits some possible application.

===History===
The technology was originally developed by General Motors Delphi Automotive Division based in the USA and then developed further by BeijingWest Industries in China after BeijingWest Industries bought the technology from General Motors. BeijingWest Industries has subsequently introduced improvements including a redesigned ECU and the introduction of a dual coil system.

=== Automotive ===
These types of systems are available from OEMs for several vehicles, including the [[Acura MDX]], [[Audi TT]] and [[Audi R8|R8]], [[Buick Lucerne]], [[Cadillac ATS]], [[Cadillac CTS-V|CTS-V]], [[Cadillac DTS|DTS]], [[Cadillac XLR|XLR]], [[Cadillac SRX|SRX]], [[Cadillac STS|STS]], [[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro ZL1]], [[Ferrari 458 Italia]], [[Ferrari 599GTB|599GTB]], [[Ferrari F12berlinetta|F12 Berlinetta]], [[Shelby GT350]], [[HSV Clubsport#E Series (2006–present)|Holden HSV E-Series]] and [[Lamborghini Huracán]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; These systems were produced by the [[Delphi Corporation]] and now by [[Beijing West Industries|BWI Group]] under the proprietary name [[MagneRide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delphi.com/news/pressReleases/pressReleases_2006/pr_2006_11_30_001/ |title=Press Release: Audi R8 Features Delphi's Revolutionary MagneRide Semi-Active Suspension |publisher=Delphi.com |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ferrari F12 Berlinetta news and pictures new Ferrari supercar |url=http://www.evo.co.uk/news/evonews/279502/new_ferrari_f12_berlinetta_revealed.html |publisher=[[Evo (magazine)|evo]] |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MRF-based dampers are excellent candidates for stability augmentation of the lead-lag (in-plane bending) mode of rotor blades in helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;

==Control==
A magnetorheological damper is controlled by algorithms specifically designed for the purpose. There are plenty of alternatives, such as skyhook or groundhook algorithms.&lt;ref name="MRD"&gt;[http://www.magnetorheologicaldamper.com/controlling-semi-active-viscous-damper-with-groundhook-algorithm Magnetorheological Damper Laboratory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425064345/http://www.magnetorheologicaldamper.com/controlling-semi-active-viscous-damper-with-groundhook-algorithm |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the algorithms is to control the [[yield point shear stress]] of the magnetorheological fluid with [[electric current]]. When the fluid is in the presence of an applied [[magnetic field]], the suspended metal particles align according to the [[field line]]s. [[Viscosity]] of the fluid increases according to the intensity of the magnetic field. When this occurs at the right instant, the properties of the damper change helps in attenuating an undesired shock or vibration. The relative efficacy of magnetorheological dampers to active and passive control strategies is usually comparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=ALY|first=Aly Mousaad|author2=Richard Christenson|title=On the evaluation of the efficacy of a smart damper: a new equivalent energy-based probabilistic approach|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2008|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0964-1726/17/4/045008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minimally invasive education''' ('''MIE''') is a form of [[learn]]ing in which children operate in unsupervised environments. The methodology arose from an experiment done by [[Sugata Mitra]] while at [[NIIT]] in 1999, often called ''The Hole in the Wall'',&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=test /&gt; which has since gone on to become a significant project with the formation of Hole in the Wall Education Limited (HiWEL), a cooperative effort between NIIT and the [[International Finance Corporation]], employed in some 300 'learning stations', covering some 300,000 children in [[India]] and several African countries.

The programme has been feted with the digital opportunity award by [[WITSA]],&lt;ref name=test /&gt; and been extensively covered in the media.

==History==

===Background===
Professor Mitra, Chief Scientist at NIIT, is credited with proposing and initiating the Hole-in-the-Wall programme. As early as 1982, he had been toying with the idea of unsupervised learning and [[computer]]s. Finally, in 1999, he decided to test his ideas in the field.

===The experiment===
On 26 January 1999, Mitra's team carved a "hole in the wall" that separated the NIIT premises from the adjoining slum in Kalkaji, New Delhi. Through this hole, a freely accessible computer was put up for use. This computer proved to be popular among the slum children. With no prior experience, the children learned to use the computer on their own. This prompted  Mitra to propose the following hypothesis:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/docs/Paper01.pdf PDF of Dr. Mitra's Hypothesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530050350/http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/docs/Paper01.pdf |date=2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of basic computing skills by any set of children can be achieved through incidental learning provided the learners are given access to a suitable computing facility, with entertaining and motivating content and some minimal (human) guidance.

In the following comment on the TED website Mitra explains how they saw to it that the computer in this experiment was accessible to children only:
:: ''"... We placed the computers 3 feet off the ground and put a shade on top, so if you are tall, you hit your head on it. Then we put a protective plastic cowl over the keyboard which had an opening such that small hands would go in. Then we put a seating rod in front that was close to the wall so that, if you are of adult height, your legs would splay when you sit. Then we painted the whole thing in bright colours and put a sign saying 'for children under 15'. Those design factors prevented adult access to a very large extent."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ted.com/profiles/136558|title=Sugata Mitra comments|date=|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results===
Mitra has summarised the results of his experiment as follows. Given free and public access to computers and the Internet, a group of children can
*Become computer literate on their own, that is, they can learn to use computers and the Internet for most of the tasks done by lay users.
*Teach themselves enough [[English language|English]] to use email, chat and search engines.
*Learn to search the Internet for answers to questions in a few months time.
*Improve their English [[pronunciation]] on their own.
*Improve their mathematics and science scores in school.
*Answer examination questions several years ahead of time.
*Change their social interaction skills and value systems.
*Form independent opinions and detect indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;http://sugatam.wikispaces.com/file/view/Method+ELSE+for+schools+where+children+teach+themselves.docx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status and expansion outside India==
The first adopter of the idea was the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. In 2000, the Government of Delhi set up 30 Learning Stations in a resettlement colony. This project is ongoing and said to be achieving significant results.

Encouraged by the initial success of the Kalkaji experiment, freely accessible computers were set up in Shivpuri (a town in Madhya Pradesh) and in Madantusi (a village in Uttar Pradesh).  These experiments came to be known as Hole-in-the-Wall experiments. The findings from Shivpuri and Madantusi confirmed the results of Kalkaji experiments.  It appeared that the children in these two places picked up computer skills on their own. Dr. Mitra defined this as a new way of learning "Minimally Invasive Education".

At this point in time, International Finance Corporation joined hands with NIIT to set up Hole-in-the-Wall Education Ltd (HiWEL). The idea was to broaden the scope of the experiments and conduct research to prove and streamline Hole-in-the-Wall. The results,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/Findings.html | title = Findings | publisher = HiWEL | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090711114940/http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/findings.html | archivedate = 2009-07-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; show that children learn to operate as well as play with the computer with minimum intervention. They picked up skills and tasks by constructing their own learning environment.

Today, more than 300,000 children have benefited from 300 Hole-in-the-Wall stations over last 8 years. In India Suhotra Banerjee (Head-Government Relations) has increased the reach of HiWEL learning stations in Nagaland, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh... and is slowly expanding their numbers.&lt;ref name=tests /&gt;

Besides India, HiWEL also has projects abroad.  The first such project was established in Cambodia in 2004.  The project currently operates in Botswana, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Swaziland, Uganda, and Zambia, besides Cambodia.&lt;ref name=tests /&gt; The idea, also called [[Open learning]], is even being applied in Britain, albeit inside the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | place = UK | url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/mar/16/slumdog-millionaire-education-online-independent |title= Slumdog reveals learning treasures | first = Lucy |last=Tobin |publisher=The Guardian |date=16 March 2010 |accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HiWEL==
Hole-in-the-Wall Education Ltd. (HiWEL) is a joint venture between [[NIIT]] and the [[International Finance Corporation]]. Established in 2001, HiWEL was set up to research and propagate the idea of Hole-in-the-Wall, a path-breaking learning methodology created by Mitra, Chief Scientist of NIIT.&lt;ref name=test&gt;[http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/abouthiwel.html Official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729225909/http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/abouthiwel.html |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In school==

Minimally Invasive Education in school adduces there are many reasons why children may have difficulty learning, especially when the learning is imposed and the subject is something the student is not interested in, a frequent occurrence in modern schools. Schools also label children as "learning disabled" and place them in special education even if the child does not have a learning disability, because the schools have failed to teach the children basic skills.&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Lisa. (2002), [http://reason.com/archives/2002/12/01/special-education-confidential/ "Special education confidential: how schools use the 'learning disability' label to cover up their failures,"] Reason December 1, 2002. Retrieved August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimally Invasive Education in school asserts there are many ways to study and learn. It argues that learning is a process you do, not a process that is done to you.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) The Sudbury Valley School Experience [http://www.sudval.com/05_underlyingideas.html#09 ''Back to Basics''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511175026/http://www.sudval.com/05_underlyingideas.html#09 |date=2011-05-11 }}. Retrieved August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of schools holding this approach shows that [[Traditional education#Criticism of the concept of teaching in traditional education|there are many ways to learn without the intervention of teaching]], to say, without the intervention of a teacher being imperative. In the case of reading for instance in these schools some children learn from being read to, memorizing the stories and then ultimately reading them. Others learn from cereal boxes, others from games instructions, others from street signs. Some teach themselves letter sounds, others syllables, others whole words. They adduce that in their schools no one child has ever been forced, pushed, urged, cajoled, or bribed into learning how to read or write, and they have had no dyslexia. None of their graduates are real or functional illiterates, and no one who meets their older students could ever guess the age at which they first learned to read or write.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) Free at Last, The Sudbury Valley School, [https://books.google.com/books?id=es2nOuZE0rAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Free+at+Last+The+Sudbury+Valley+School+The+Other+%27R%27s&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Chapter 5, ''The Other 'R's'']. Retrieved August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar form students learn all the subjects, techniques and skills in these schools. Every person, children and youth included, has a different learning style and pace and each person, is unique, not only capable of learning but also capable of succeeding. These schools assert that applying the [[Medical model|medical model of problem-solving]] to individual children who are pupils in the school system, and labeling these children as disabled—referring to a whole generation of non-standard children that have been labeled as dysfunctional, even though they suffer from nothing more than the disease of responding differently in the classroom than the average manageable student—systematically prevents the students' success and the improvement of the current educational system, thus requiring the prevention of academic failure through intervention. This, they clarify, does not refer to people who have a specific disability that affects their drives; nor is anything they say and write about education meant to apply to people who have specific mental impairments, which may need to be dealt with in special, clinical ways.

Describing current instructional methods as [[Homogeneity|homogenization]] and [[lockstep]] standardization, alternative approaches are proposed, such as the [[Sudbury model|Sudbury model schools]], an alternative approach in which children, by [[Sudbury Valley School#Educational philosophy|enjoying personal freedom]] thus [[School discipline#Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools|encouraged to exercise personal responsibility for their actions]], [[Literacy#Learning without the intervention of teaching|learn at their own pace]] rather than following a chronologically-based curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

As long as children do no harm to others, they can do whatever they want with their time in school. The adults in other schools plan a curriculum of study, teach the students the material and then test and grade their learning. The adults at Sudbury schools are ''"the guardians of the children's freedom to pursue their own interests and to learn what they wish,"'' creating and maintaining a nurturing environment, in which children feel that they are cared for, and that does not rob children of their time to explore and discover their inner selves. They also are there to answer questions and to impart specific skills or knowledge when asked to by students.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, H. (1987).

:"If learning is an emergent phenomenon, then the teacher needs to provide stimulus — lots of it – in the form of “big” questions. These must include questions to which the teacher, or perhaps anyone, does not have the answer. These should be the sorts of questions that will occupy children’s minds perpetually. The teacher needs to help each child cultivate a vision of the future. Thus, a new primary curriculum needs to teach only three skills: 1. Reading comprehension: This is perhaps the most crucial skill a child needs to acquire while growing up. 2. Information search and analysis: First articulated at the National Institute of Technology in India by professor J.R. Isaac in the early 1990s — decades ahead of its time — this skill set is vital for children searching for answers in an infinite cyberspace. 3. A rational system of belief: If children know how to search, and if they know how to read, then they must learn how to believe. Each one of us has a belief system. How soon can a child acquire one? A rational belief system will be our children’s protection against doctrine. Children who have these skills scarcely need schools as we define them today. They need a learning environment and a source of rich, big questions. Computers can give out answers, but they cannot, as of yet, make questions. Hence, the teacher’s role becomes bigger and stranger than ever before: She must ask her “learners” about things she does not know herself. Then she can stand back and watch as learning emerges."&lt;ref&gt;Mitra, S. 2012. ''Beyond the Hole in the Wall: Discover the Power of Self-Organized Learning''. TED Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first coined by [[Alfred A.

The concept of the "Mozart effect" was described by French researcher [[Alfred A. Tomatis|Dr. Alfred A. Tomatis]] in his 1991 book ''Pourquoi Mozart?'' (''Why Mozart?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~biglars/Mozart.html|title=Mozart on the Brain|first=Lars|last=Sorensen|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the music of Mozart in his efforts to "retrain" the ear, and believed that listening to the music presented at differing frequencies helped the ear, and promoted healing and the development of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Billie M.|last2=Andrews|first2=Susan R.|title=An historical commentary on the physiological effects of music: Tomatis, Mozart and neuropsychology|journal=Integrative Physiological and Behavioral Science|volume=35|issue=3|pages=174–188|doi=10.1007/BF02688778|pmid=11286370|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rauscher ''et al.'' 1993 study==
Frances Rauscher, Gordon Shaw, and Catherine Ky (1993) investigated the effect of listening to music by Mozart on [[spatial-temporal reasoning|spatial reasoning]], and the results were published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. They gave research participants one of three standard tests of abstract spatial reasoning after they had experienced each of three listening conditions: the [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448]]  by Mozart, verbal relaxation instructions, and silence. They found a temporary enhancement of spatial-reasoning, as measured by spatial-reasoning sub tasks of the Stanford-Binet IQ test. Rauscher et al. show that the enhancing effect of the music condition is only temporary: no student had effects extending beyond the 15-minute period in which they were tested. The study makes no statement of an increase in IQ in general (because IQ was never measured).&lt;ref name="Rauscher-Shaw-Ky-1993"/&gt;

==Popularization==
While Rauscher et al. only showed an increase in "spatial intelligence", the results were popularly interpreted as an increase in general IQ. This misconception, and the fact that the music used in the study was by Mozart, had an obvious appeal to those who valued this music; the Mozart effect was thus widely reported. In 1994, ''[[New York Times]]'' music columnist [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] wrote in a light-hearted article, "researchers [Rauscher and Shaw] have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter", and presented this as the final piece of evidence that Mozart has dethroned [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as "the world's greatest composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Alex|title=CLASSICAL VIEW; Listening To Prozac . . . Er, Mozart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/arts/classical-view-listening-to-prozac-er-mozart.html|publisher=New York Times|date=August 28, 1994|accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; " A 1997 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article mentioned some of the Rauscher and Shaw results. It described one study in which three- and four-year-olds who were given eight months of private piano lessons scored 30% higher on tests of spatio-temporal reasoning than control groups given computer lessons, singing lessons, and no training. 

The 1997 book by Don Campbell, ''The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit'', discusses the theory that listening to [[Mozart]] (especially the piano concertos) may temporarily increase one's [[IQ]] and produce many other beneficial effects on mental function. Campbell recommends playing specially selected classical music to infants, in the expectation that it will benefit their [[neural development|mental development]].

After ''The Mozart Effect'', Campbell wrote a follow-up book, ''The Mozart Effect For Children'', and created related products. Among these are collections of music that he states harness the Mozart effect to enhance "deep rest and rejuvenation", "intelligence and learning", and "creativity and imagination". Campbell defines the term as "an inclusive term signifying the transformational powers of music in health, education, and well-being. It represents the general use of music to reduce stress, depression, or anxiety; induce relaxation or sleep; activate the body; and improve [[memory]] or [[awareness]]. Innovative and experimental uses of music and sound can improve listening disorders, [[dyslexia]], [[ADHD predominantly inattentive|attention deficit disorder]], [[autism]], and other mental and physical disorders and diseases".&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Don |title=The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit |year=1997 |isbn=0-380-97418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are controversial. The relationship of sound and music (both played and listened to) for cognitive function and various physiological metrics has been explored in studies with no definitive results.

==Political impact==
The political impact of the theory was demonstrated on January 13, 1998, when [[Zell Miller]], governor of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], announced that his proposed state budget would include $105,000 a year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. Miller stated "No one questions that listening to music at a very early age affects the spatial-temporal reasoning that underlies math and engineering and even chess." Miller played legislators some of Beethoven's "[[Ode to Joy]]" on a tape recorder and asked "Now, don't you feel smarter already?" Miller asked [[Yoel Levi]], music director of the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra|Atlanta Symphony]], to compile a collection of classical pieces that should be included. State representative [[Buddy DeLoach|Homer DeLoach]] said "I asked about the possibility of including some [[Charlie Daniels]] or something like that, but they said they thought the classical music has a greater positive impact. Having never studied those impacts too much, I guess I'll just have to take their word for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Sack |title=Georgia's Governor Seeks Musical Start for Babies |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |page=A12 |date=1998-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent research and meta-analyses ==
While some supportive reports have been published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson, T., Brown, T. |title=Reexamination of the effect of Mozart's music on spatial task performance|journal=The Journal of Psychology|volume=131|issue=4|pages=365|doi=10.1080/00223989709603522|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies with positive results have tended to be associated with any form of music that has energetic and positive emotional qualities.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thompson, W.F., Schellenberg, E.G. &amp; Husain, G. |title=Arousal, mood, and the Mozart effect|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=3|pages=248–51|pmid=11437309|year=2001|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Husain"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Husain, G., Thompson, W.F. &amp; Schellenberg, E.G. |title=Effects of musical tempo and mode on arousal, mood, and spatial abilities: Re-examination of the "Mozart effect"|journal=Music Perception|volume=20|issue=2|pages=151|doi=10.1525/mp.2002.20.2.151|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the intellectual benefits of enhanced mood and arousal are not restricted to spatial-temporal reasoning, but extend to speed of processing and creative problem solving.&lt;ref name="Ilie"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ilie, G., &amp; Thompson, W.F. |year=2011|title= Experiential and cognitive changes following seven minutes exposure to music and speech|journal= Music Perception|volume= 28|issue=3|pages= 247–264|doi=10.1525/mp.2011.28.3.247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among children, some studies suggest no effect on IQ or spatial ability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|doi=10.1348/026151002166433|title=Listening to Mozart does not improve children's spatial ability: Final curtains for the Mozart effect|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=241|last1 = McKelvie|first1 = Pippa|last2=Low|first2=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others suggest that the effect can be elicited with energetic popular music that the children enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schellenberg, E.G., &amp; Hallam, S. |title=Music listening and cognitive abilities in 10 and 11 year olds: The Blur effect|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1060|pages=202–9|pmid=16597767|year=2005|doi=10.1196/annals.1360.013|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1507375/1/SchellenbergHallam2006Music202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of subsequent evidence supports either a null effect, or short-term effects related to increases in mood and arousal, with mixed results published after the initial report in ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="bridgett"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of listening to Mozart and Bach on the performance of a mathematical test|pmid=10939064|last=Bridgett |first=D.J.|author2=Cuevas, J.|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=90|issue=3 Pt 2|year=2000 |pages=1171–1175|doi=10.2466/pms.2000.90.3c.1171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999  a major challenge was raised to the existence of the Mozart effect by two teams of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chabris | first1 = Christopher F.| title = Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'? | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 400 | issue = 6747 | pages = 826–827| year = 1999 | doi = 10.1038/23608 | pmid =  10476958| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = K.

Chabris reported a  [[meta-analysis]] demonstrating that "any cognitive enhancement is small and does not reflect any change in IQ or reasoning ability in general, but instead derives entirely from performance on one specific type of cognitive task and has a simple neuropsychological explanation", called "enjoyment arousal". For example, he cites a study that found that "listening either to Mozart or to a passage from a [[Stephen King]] story enhanced subjects' performance in paper folding and cutting (one of the tests frequently employed by Rauscher and Shaw) but only for those who enjoyed what they heard". Steele et. al. found that "listening to Mozart produced a 3-point increase relative to silence in one experiment and a 4-point decrease in the other experiment".&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;{{cite web |last=Steele |first=M |title=Papers by Steele casting doubt on the Mozart effect |publisher=appstate.edu |url=http://www.acs.appstate.edu/~kms/research/Steele.htm |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, the effect was replicated with the original Mozart music, but eliminated when the tempo was slowed down and major chords were replaced by minor chords.&lt;ref name="Husain"/&gt;

Another meta-analysis by Pietschnig, Voracek, and Formann (2010) combined results of 39 studies to answer the question as to whether or not the Mozart Effect exists. They concluded that there is little evidence to support the Mozart effect, as shown by small effect sizes. However, the most striking finding in this meta-analysis is the significantly larger effects published in studies affiliated with Rauscher or Rideout, with effect sizes more than three times higher for published studies affiliated with these founding members of the Mozart Effect. These systematic moderating effects due to lab affiliation call into question the existence of a Mozart Effect. In addition, this study also found strong evidence supporting a confounding [[publication bias]] when effect sizes of samples who listened to Mozart are compared to samples not exposed to a stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pietschnig|first1=Jakob|last2=Voracek|first2=Martin|last3=Formann|first3=Anton K.|title=Mozart effect–Shmozart effect: A meta-analysis|journal=Intelligence|volume=38|issue=3|year=2010|pages=314–323|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2010.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite implementing Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky's (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauscher|first1=Frances H.|last2=Shaw|first2=Gordon L.|last3=Ky|first3=Katherine N.|title=Listening to Mozart enhances spatial-temporal reasoning: towards a neurophysiological basis|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=185|issue=1|year=1995|pages=44–47|pmid=7731551|doi=10.1016/0304-3940(94)11221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggestions of three key components that must be present to replicate the Mozart Effect, McCutcheon (2000) still failed to reproduce the Mozart Effect in a study with 36 adults. These conditions were: to ensure a task that taps into spatial components of mental imagery; a research design that does not include a pretest to avoid ceiling effects; a musical composition that is complex rather than repetitive and simple. Regardless of listening to classical music, jazz or silence, the study did not yield a significant effect on spatial reasoning performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCutcheon|first1=Lynn E.|title=Another failure to generalize the Mozart effect|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=87|issue=5|year=2000|pages=325–30|pmid=11026433|doi=10.2466/pr0.2000.87.1.325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mozart Effect is likely just an artifact of arousal and heightened mood.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Martin H.|last2=West|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Estell|first3=David B.|title=The Mozart effect: Arousal, preference, and spatial performance.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|volume=S|issue=1|year=2006|pages=26–32|doi=10.1037/1931-3896.S.1.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Kenneth M.|title=Arousal and mood factors in the "Mozart effect"|pmid=11011888|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=91|issue=1|year=2000|pages=188–190|url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms//documents/Arousal.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.2466/pms.2000.91.1.188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arousal is the confounding variable that mediates the relationship between spatial ability and music that defines the Mozart Effect.&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"/&gt; The "neural resonance" theory of Rauscher and colleagues which contends that Mozart's music primes the neural pathways of spatial reasoning has been widely criticized.&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2000"/&gt;

Government bodies also became involved in analysing the wealth (some 300+ articles as of 2005) of reports. A German report concluded, for instance, that "... passively listening to Mozart — or indeed any other music you enjoy — does not make you smarter. But more studies should be done to find out whether music lessons could raise your child's IQ in the long term".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Abbott |title=Mozart doesn't make you clever |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070413/full/news070409-13.html |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate= 2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ralph |last=Schumacher |title=Macht Mozart schlau? |url=http://www.bmbf.de/pub/macht_mozart_schlau.pdf |publisher=Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung |page=183 |accessdate=2009-05-22 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172239/http://www.bmbf.de/pub/macht_mozart_schlau.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular presentations of the "Mozart effect", including Alex Ross's comment that "listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter" and Zell Miller's "don't you feel smarter" query to the Georgia legislature, almost always tie it to "intelligence." Rauscher, one of the original researchers, has disclaimed this idea. In a 1999 reply to an article challenging the effect,&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt; published along with the article, she wrote (emphasis added):
{{quote|Our results on the effects of listening to ''Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major K. 448'' on spatial–temporal task performance have generated much interest but several misconceptions, many of which are reflected in attempts to replicate the research. The comments by Chabris and Steele et al. echo the most common of these: that listening to Mozart enhances intelligence. ''We made no such claim.'' The effect is limited to spatial–temporal tasks involving mental imagery and temporal ordering.}}

On efforts like Miller's budget proposal, and the press attention surrounding the effect, Rauscher has said, "I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on music education programs."&lt;ref name="rauschernyt"&gt;Goode, Erica (1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/03/science/mozart-for-baby-some-say-maybe-not.html "Mozart For Baby? Some Say, Maybe Not"]. ''The New York Times'', 1999-08-03 p. f1: Rauscher, "the money could be better spent on music education programs."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars in the psychological community now view the claim that playing classical music to children can boost their intelligence to be a "myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology |isbn=1405131128|author1=Lilienfeld, Scott O. |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |author2=Lynn, Steven Jay |author3=Ruscio, John |author4=Beyerstein, Barry L. |year=2009|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Emory University]] psychologist [[Scott Lilienfeld]] ranks Mozart Effect as number six in his book ''[[50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=University of Vienna|authorlink1=University of Vienna|title=Mozart's music does not make you smarter, study finds|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100510075415.htm|website=www.sciencedaily.com|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health benefits===
Music has been evaluated to see if it has other properties. The April 2001 edition of ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' assessed the possible health benefits of the music of Mozart.&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/mozart.html |title=The Mozart Effect |publisher=epilepsy.org |accessdate= 2007-08-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109052504/http://epilepsy.org.uk/info/treatment/mozart-effect|archivedate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Jenkins played Sonata K.448 to patients with epilepsy and found a decrease in epileptiform activity. According to the British Epilepsy Organization, research has suggested that apart from Mozart's [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|K.448]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 23 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 23 (K. 488)]], only one other piece of music has been found to have a similar effect; a song by the Greek composer [[Yanni]], entitled "Acroyali/Standing in Motion" (version from ''[[Yanni Live at the Acropolis]] performed at the [[Acropolis]]'').&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt; It was determined to have the "Mozart effect", by the ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' because it was similar to Mozart's K.448 in [[tempo]], structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability.&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yanni in Words67"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yanni |author2=Rensin, David |title=Yanni in Words |publisher=[[Miramax Books]] |year=2002 |isbn=1-4013-5194-8|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of Mozart's music==
While it is clear that exposure to Mozart does not raise IQ, studies of the effects of music have explored as diverse areas as its links to [[seizure]] onset&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=J. R.|last2=Daaboul|first2=Y.|last3=Fino|first3=J. J.|last4=Shaw|first4=G. L.|title=The "Mozart Effect" on Epileptiform Activity|journal=Clinical EEG and Neuroscience|volume=29|issue=3|year=1998|pages=109–119|doi=10.1177/155005949802900301}}&lt;/ref&gt; or research in animals suggesting that even exposure in-utero in rats improves their [[maze]] learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Improved maze learning through early music exposure in rats |pmid=9664590 |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information | volume=20 |issue=5 |date=July 1998 |journal=Neurol.

J. |doi=10.1080/01616412.1998.11740543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original claim continues to influence public life. For instance a German [[sewage treatment]] plant plays Mozart music to break down the waste faster, reports the UK ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]''.  Anton Stucki, chief operator of the [[Treuenbrietzen]] plant was quoted as saying, "We think the secret is in the vibrations of the music, which penetrate everything—including the water, the sewage and the cells."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title=Sewage plant plays Mozart to stimulate microbes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/sewage-mozart-germany|accessdate=8 April 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wea02616 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|right|The National Data Buoy Center just after Hurricane Katrina]] 

The '''National Data Buoy Center''' ('''NDBC''') is a part of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s (NOAA) [[National Weather Service]] (NWS). NDBC designs, develops, operates, and maintains a network of data collecting [[buoys]] and coastal stations. The NBDC is located in southern Mississippi as a tenant at the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]], a [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) facility.

== Operations ==
NDBC employs [[engineer]]s, [[meteorologist]]s, [[oceanographer]]s, [[computer scientist]]s, and other professionals. 

NDBC provides hourly observations from a network of about 90 buoys and 60 [[Coastal Marine Automated Network]] (C-MAN) stations to help meet these needs. All stations measure [[wind]] speed, direction, and gust; [[atmospheric pressure]]; and air [[temperature]]. In addition, all [[weather buoy|buoy]] stations, and some C-MAN stations, measure [[sea surface temperature]] and [[Ocean surface wave|wave]] height and period. Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations.

A new task is the operation of the '''DART''' ([[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis]]) buoys.  DART is a fleet of tsunami detecting buoys.

Another task adopted in 2005 is '''TAO''' ([[Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project]]) buoys. TAO is a fleet of over 50 buoys moored in the Pacific Ocean.  These buoys are designed to help detect and predict [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] and [[La Niña]]. 

All buoys and many C-MAN stations located in offshore areas operate on marine batteries which are charged by [[solar cell]]s. Sensors are calibrated in wind tunnels or environmental chambers, and later tested with the onboard station microprocessors, called payloads, on test stands at the outside sensor test facility. Final calibration and testing of the completed buoy systems are accomplished in the onsite canal. All buoys are serviced about every two years for routine maintenance and to install newly calibrated sensors. 
[[Image:Discus buoy 42001.jpg|thumb|right|A typical deep-sea NDBC discus buoy in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]

The observations from moored buoys and C-MAN stations are transmitted hourly through NOAA [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]]s (GOES) to a ground receiving facility at [[Wallops Island, Virginia]], operated by the NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). Additionally, some buoys and C-MAN stations may use the [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium satellite system]] to transmit data. The data is recorded and processed by the [[National Oceanographic Data Center]].

Through a Memorandum of Agreement, the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG) remains a critically important partner to NDBC, supplying transportation for buoy deployments, retrievals, and other maintenance.

== History ==
The National Data Buoy Development Program (NDBDP), created in 1967, was placed under the control of the USCG.

In 1970, NOAA was formed and the NOAA Data Buoy Office (NDBO) was created within the National Ocean Service (NOS) and located in Mississippi. In 1982, the NDBO was renamed NDBC and was placed under NOAA's NWS.

The first buoys deployed by NDBC were the large 12-m discus hulls constructed of steel. These were generally deployed in deep water off the U.S. East Coast and in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. 

By 1979, 16 stations were deployed in the Pacific, 7 in the Atlantic, and 3 in the Gulf of Mexico. Eight more stations were deployed in the Great Lakes after 1979.

In 1995, development of the [[Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis]] (DART) system began, with deployment beginning in 2000. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its subsequent tsunamis, additional dart buoys were deployed.

== Location ==
NDBC's main office is located in southern Mississippi at the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]], a [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) facility. This site was chosen because it contains an excellent pre-existing industrial facility which is adjacent to a canal with deep-water access to the Gulf of Mexico. Other offices are located in Sterling, Virginia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8403">'''Neo-Dada''' was a movement with [[audio art|audio]], [[visual art|visual]] and literary manifestations that had similarities in method or intent with earlier [[Dada]] artwork. In the United States the term was popularized by [[Barbara Rose]] in the 1960s and refers primarily, although not exclusively, to work created in that and the preceding decade. There was also an international dimension to the movement, [[Neo-Dada Organizers|particularly in Japan]] and in Europe, serving as the foundation of [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]] and [[Nouveau réalisme]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada was exemplified by its use of modern materials, popular imagery, and [[Absurdism|absurd]]ist contrast. It was a reaction to the personal emotionalism of [[Abstract Expressionism]] and, taking a lead from the practice of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]], denied traditional concepts of [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Craft, pp.10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in Dada followed in the wake of documentary publications, such as [[Robert Motherwell]]'s ''The Dada Painters and Poets'' (1951)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yzchnw4YUlcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and German language publications from 1957 and later, to which some former Dadaists contributed.&lt;ref&gt;Brill, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; However, several of the original Dadaists denounced the label Neo-Dada, especially in its U.S. manifestations, on the grounds that the work was derivative rather than making fresh discoveries; that aesthetic pleasure was found in what were originally protests against [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] aesthetic concepts; and because it pandered to commercialism.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Young, ''Dada and After: Extremist Modernism and English Literature'', Manchester University 1983, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-RXpAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=RA4-PT96&amp;dq=neo-dada&amp;pg=RA4-PT96#v=onepage&amp;q=neo-dada&amp;f=false pp.201–3] and Brill, pp.104–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the artists who identified with the trend subsequently moved on to other specialities or identified with different art movements and in many cases only certain aspects of their early work can be identified with it. For example, [[Piero Manzoni]]'s  ''Consacrazione dell'arte dell'uovo sodo'' (Artistic consecration of the hard-boiled egg, 1959), which he signed with an imprint of his thumb, or his cans of shit (1961) whose price was pegged to the value of their weight in gold, satirizing the concept of the artist's personal creation and art as commodity. 

[[File:Basel Fasnachtsbrunnen Jean Tinguely.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|A Jean Tingueley fountain in Basel]]
An allied approach is found in the creation of [[collage]] and [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], as in the junk sculptures of the American [[Richard Stankiewicz]], whose works created from scrap have been compared with Schwitters' practice. These objects are "so treated that they become less discarded than found, ''objets trouvés''."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater in ''A Dictionary of Modern Sculpture'', London 1962, pp.277–8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Tinguely]]'s fantastic machines, notoriously the self-destructing ''Homage to New York'' (1960), were another approach to the subversion of the mechanical.

Although such techniques as collage and assemblage may have served as inspiration, different terms were found for the objects produced, both in the U.S. and in Europe. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] labeled as "combines" such works as "Bed" (1955), which consisted of a framed quilt and pillow covered in paint and mounted on the wall. [[Arman]] labeled as "accumulations" his collections of dice and bottle tops, and as "''poubelles''" the contents of trash-bins encased in plastic. [[Daniel Spoerri]] created "snare pictures" (''tableaux piège''), of which the earliest was "Kichka's Breakfast" (1960), and in which the remains of a meal were glued to the cloth and mounted on the table-top affixed to the wall.

==Poems==
In the Netherlands the poets associated with the 'magazine for texts', ''Barbarber'' (1958–71), particularly [[J. Bernlef]] and [[K. Schippers]], extended the concept of the [[readymade]] into poetry, discovering poetic suggestiveness in such everyday items as a newspaper advert about a lost tortoise and a typewriter test sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Mourits, ''The Conceptual Poetic of K. Schippers: the aesthetic implications of literary readymades'', Dutch Crossing 21.1, pp.119–34&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of Dutch poets infiltrated the Belgian experimentalist magazine ''Gard Sivik'' and began to fill it with seemingly inconsequential fragments of conversation and demonstrations of verbal procedures. The writers included C.B. Vaandrager (1935–92), [[Hans Verhagen]] and the artist [[Armando (artist)|Armando]]. On this approach the critic Hugo Brems has commented that "the poet's role in this kind of poetry was not to discourse on reality, but to highlight particular fragments of it which are normally perceived as non-poetic. These poets were not creators of art, but discoverers."&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Brems, ''Contemporary Poetry of the Low Countries'', Flemish Netherlands Foundation, 1995, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The impersonality that such artists aspired to was best expressed by Jan Schoonhoven (1914–94), the theorist of the [[Zero (art)|Dutch Nul group]] of artists, to which Armando also belonged: "Zero is first and foremost a new conception of reality, in which the individual role of the artist is kept to a minimum. The Zero artist merely selects, isolates parts of reality (materials as well as ideas stemming from reality) and exhibits them in the most neutral way. The avoidance of personal feelings is essential to Zero."&lt;ref&gt;Translation in ''Dutch Interior: Postwar Poetry of the Netherlands and Flanders'', Columbia University 1984, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cPOqoSriyY0C&amp;lpg=PR36&amp;ots=BobxbkKkkC&amp;dq=%22Zero%20is%20first%20and%20foremost%20a%20new%20conception%22&amp;pg=PR35#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Zero%20is%20first%20and%20foremost%20a%20new%20conception%22&amp;f=false pp.36–7]&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn links it with some aspects of Pop Art and Nouveau Réaliste practice and underlines the rejection of Expressionism.

The beginnings of [[Concrete Poetry]] and text montage in the [[Wiener Gruppe]] have also been referred back to the example of [[Raoul Hausmann]]'s letter poems.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Katharina Schaffner, "How the Letters Learned to Dance: on language dissection in Dadaist, Digital and Concrete Poetry", in  Avant-garde/Neo-avant-garde, Amsterdam 2005, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7CttwTdwx04C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.149–165]&lt;/ref&gt; Such techniques may also owe something to [[H.N. Werkman]]'s typographical experiments in the Netherlands which had first been put on display in the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in 1945.

The '''New Orleans Jazz Museum''' is a music museum in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States|U.S.]], dedicated to preserving and celebrating the history of [[jazz]] music. Originally a separate museum, the collection is now affiliated with the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. The New Orleans Jazz Museum is located in the [[New Orleans Mint|Old U.S. Mint]] building on 400 [[Esplanade Avenue, New Orleans|Esplanade Avenue]], bordering the historic [[French Quarter]] neighborhood.

== History ==
Plans for a museum commemorating New Orleans jazz began in the 1950s by a collaborative group of New Orleans [[jazz]] collectors and enthusiasts of the New Orleans Jazz Club, which was founded in 1949.  Key movers were [[Doc Souchon|Edmond "Doc" Souchon]], Myra Menville, and Helen Arlt. The museum opened in 1961, at 1017 Dumaine Street in the [[French Quarter]], with Clay Watson as curator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Collier's Encyclopedia, with Bibliography and Index|last=Halsey|first=William Darach|publisher=P.F. Collier|year=1986|isbn=|page=439|doi=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the collection has since moved, the original location is maintained today as part of the [[Hotel St. Pierre]], including [[Commemorative plaque|commemorative plaques]] on the property.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1969, the museum relocated to the Royal Sonesta Hotel. In the early 1970s, however, the Sonesta changed ownership, and the museum subsequently relocated to 833 Conti Street in 1973. Soon after its relocation, the museum closed again due to [[bankruptcy]]. On September 15, 1977, the entire collection of the New Orleans Jazz Museum was donated to the people of Louisiana and became The New Orleans Jazz Club Collections of the Louisiana State Museum.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bush, Tori. "The New Orleans Jazz Museum." 12 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, the Louisiana State Museum's Jazz Collection exhibit opened on the second floor of the [[New Orleans Mint|Old U.S. Mint]] building under the curatorship of Don Marquis. The New Orleans Jazz Museum now resides permanently at the Old U.S. Mint.[[File:New_Orleans_Jazz_Museum_at_Old_U.S._Mint.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DNMaurer/File:New_Orleans_Jazz_Museum_at_Old_U.S._Mint.jpg|thumb|The facade of the [[New Orleans Mint|Old U.S. Mint]] building as viewed from Esplanade Avenue. This is the current location of the New Orleans Jazz Museum.]]
[[File:20111102 MG 9967 (1).jpg|thumb|Interior of New Orleans Jazz Museum.]]
In 2005, both the U.S. Mint and the jazz collection sustained damage during [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The New Orleans Jazz Museum collections have been displayed in a number of exhibits since the Mint reopened in 2008. In 2015, efforts were underway to transform most of the Mint building into the New Orleans Jazz Museum.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://louisianastatemuseum.org/museums/the-old-us-mint/ Old U.S. Mint museum] Accessed 28 Apr 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''only child''' is a person with no [[sibling]]s, either [[biological]] or [[adoption|adopted]]. The term ''only child'' is generally applied only to those individuals who don't have siblings. 

Some children may have half-siblings or step-siblings, either living at the same house or a different house - especially those who were born considerably later - may have a similar family environment to only children, as may children who have younger siblings from both of the same parents (generally ten or more years).

== Overview ==
Throughout history, only children were relatively uncommon. From around the middle of the 20th century, [[birth rate]]s and average family sizes fell sharply, for a number of reasons including increasing costs of raising children and more women having their first child later in life. The proportion of families in the U.S. with only children increased during the [[Great Depression]] but fell during the [[Post–World War II baby boom]].&lt;ref name=onlies&gt;[http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/family/features/10290/ "The Onlies"]. ''New York Magazine''. May 21, 2005. Retrieved February 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Korean War]] ended in 1953, the South Korean government suggested citizens each have one or two children to boost economic prosperity, which resulted in significantly lowered birth rates and a larger number of only children to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecolocalizer.com/2008/09/27/korean-women-say-birth-control-not-my-job/ |title=Korean Women Say Birth Control is ‘Men’s Responsibility’ |website=Ecolocalizer.com |date=September 27, 2008 |accessdate=December 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002050413/http://ecolocalizer.com/2008/09/27/korean-women-say-birth-control-not-my-job/ |archivedate=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSEO35121820080404 "Illegal abortion, South Korea's open secret"]. ''Reuters''. January 27, 2009. Retrieved December 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1979 to 2015, the [[one-child policy]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] restricted most parents to having only one child, although it was subject to local relaxations and individual circumstances (for instance when twins were conceived).&lt;ref&gt;Rocha da Silva, Pascal (2006). "[http://www.sinoptic.ch/textes/recherche/2006/200608_Rocha.Pascal_memoire.pdf ''La politique de l'enfant unique en République populaire de Chine'']" ("The politics of one child in the People's Republic of China"). Université de Genève ([[University of Geneva]]). p. 22-8. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/Jul/68937.htm "Marriage of the Only Child: Joys and Worries"].

Retrieved January 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Families may have an only child for a variety of reasons, including: personal preference, [[family planning]], financial and emotional or physical health issues, desire to travel, stress in the family, educational advantages, late marriage, stability, focus, time constraints, fears over pregnancy, advanced age, illegitimate birth, [[infertility]], [[divorce]], and death of a sibling or parent. The premature death of one parent also contributed to a small percentage of marriages producing just one child until around the mid 20th century, not to mention the then rare occurrence of divorce. 

Only children are sometimes said to be more likely to develop precocious interests (from spending more time with adults) and to feel [[loneliness|lonely]].&lt;ref name=onlies/&gt; Sometimes they compensate for the aloneness by developing a stronger relationship with themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/only-children-lonely-and-selfish.html |title=Only Children: Lonely and Selfish? |author=Sandler, Lauren |date=8 June 2013 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; or developing an active fantasy life that includes [[imaginary friend]]s. Children whose only siblings are much older than them sometimes report feeling like an only child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/05/wish-my-son-wasnt-an-only-child |author=Bradford, Kelly Rose |date=5 April 2014 |publisher=The Guardian |title=I wish my son wasn't an only child}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages cited of having an only child are the decreased financial burden, the absence of any [[sibling rivalry]], and that it becomes possible to take the child to an event suitable for their age without having to bring along a disinterested sibling. A disadvantage is that it can be harder for an only child to singlehandedly look after their aging parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/387579/The-rise-of-the-only-child-Happier-higher-achievers-or-just-more-lonely |title=The rise of the only child: Happier, higher achievers or just more lonely? |date=28 March 2013 |publisher=Express |author=Edge, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stereotypes ==
In Western countries, only children can be the subject of a stereotype that equates them with "[[spoiled brat]]s". [[G. Stanley Hall]] was one of the first commentators to give only children a bad reputation when he referred to their situation as "a disease in itself". Even today, only children are commonly stereotyped as "spoiled, selfish, and bratty".&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3488411&amp;page=1 The Only Child Myth], By Juju Chang and Sara Holmberg, ABC News, Retrieved on August 25th, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While many only children receive a lot of attention and resources for their development, it is not clear that as a class they are overindulged or differ significantly from children with siblings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2002382,00.html "The Only Child: Debunking the Myths"]. ''Time''. July 8, 2010. Retrieved July 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Newman, a social psychologist at [[Rutgers University]] and the author of ''Parenting an Only Child'', says that this is a myth. "People articulate that only children are spoiled, they're aggressive, they're bossy, they're lonely, they're maladjusted", she said. "There have been hundreds and hundreds of research studies that show that only children are no different from their peers."&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt; However, differences have been found.

In China, perceived behavioral problems in only children has been called the [[Little Emperor Syndrome]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2001/04/22/the-rise-of-the-only-child.html# "The Rise Of The Only Child"].

However, recent studies do not support these claims, and show no significant differences in personality between only children and children in larger families.&lt;ref&gt;Wan, et al.

The popular media often posit that it is more difficult for only children to cooperate in a conventional family environment, as they have no competitors for the attention of their parents and other relatives. It is suggested that confusion arises about the norms of ages and roles and that a similar effect exists in understanding during relationships with other peers and youth, all throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/style/10-tips-for-parenting-only-children/ "10 Tips for Parenting Only Children"].

A 1987 [[meta-analysis|quantitative review]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Polit |first=D. F. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Falbo |first2=T. |year=1987 |title=Only children and personality development: A quantitative review |journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family |volume=49 |issue= |pages=309–325 |doi=10.2307/352302 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; of 141 studies on 16 different personality traits failed to support the opinion, held by theorists including [[Alfred Adler]], that only children are more likely to be maladjusted due to pampering.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, A. (1964). ''Problems of neurosis''. New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found no evidence of any greater prevalence of maladjustment in only children. The only statistically significant difference discovered was that only children possessed a higher achievement motivation, which Polit and Falbo attributed to their greater share of parental resources, expectations, and scrutiny exposing them to a greater degree of reward, and greater likelihood of punishment for falling short. A second analysis by the authors revealed that only children, children with only one sibling, and first-borns in general, score higher on tests of verbal ability than later-borns and children with multiple siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Polit |first=D. F. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Falbo |first2=T. |year=1988 |title=The intellectual achievement of only children |journal=Journal of Biosocial Science |volume=20 |issue= |pages=275–285 |doi=10.1017/S0021932000006611 |pmid=3063715}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Resource Dilution Model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Downey |first=D. B. |year=2001 |title=Number of siblings and intellectual development: The resource dilution explanation |journal=American Psychologist |volume=56 |issue= |pages=497–504 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.56.6-7.497 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; parental resources (e.g. time to read to the child) are important in development. Because these resources are finite, children with many siblings are thought to receive fewer resources.  However, the Confluence Model&lt;ref name="confluence"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zajonc |first=R. B. |last2=Markus |first2=Gregory B. |year=1975 |title=Birth Order and Intellectual Development |journal=Psychological Review |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=74–88 |doi=10.1037/h0076229 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests there is an opposing effect from the benefits to the non-youngest children of tutoring younger siblings, though being tutored does not make up the reduced share of parental resources. This provides one explanation for the poorer performance on tests of ability of only children compared to first-borns, commonly seen in the literature,&lt;ref name="confluence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tutoring"&gt;{{Citation |last=Falbo |first=Toni |year=1978 |title=Sibling Tutoring and Other Explanations for Intelligence Discontinuities of Only and Last Borns |journal=Journal of Population |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=349–363 |doi=10.2307/27507586}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though explanations such as the increased and earlier likelihood of experiencing parental separation or loss for last-born and only children have also been suggested, as this may be the cause of their very status.&lt;ref name="tutoring"/&gt;

In his book ''Maybe One'',&lt;ref name=McKibben&gt;{{Citation |last=McKibben |first=B. |year=1998 |title=Maybe one: A personal and environmental argument for single-child families |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-684-85281-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the environmental campaigner [[Bill McKibben]] argues in favor of a voluntary one child policy on the grounds of climate change and overpopulation. He reassures the reader with a narrative constructed from interviews with researchers and writers on only children, combined with snippets from the research literature, that this would not be harmful to child development. He argues that most cultural stereotypes are false, that there are not many differences between only children and other children, and where there are differences, they are favorable to the only child.

Most research on only children has been [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and focused on the behaviour of only-children and on how others, for example teachers, assess that behaviour. Bernice Sorensen, in contrast, used [[qualitative methods]] in order to elicit meaning and to discover what only-children themselves understand, feel or sense about their lives that are lived without siblings. Her research showed that during their life span only children often become more aware of their only child status and are very much affected by society's stereotype of the only-child whether or not the stereotype is true or false. She argues in her book, ''Only Child Experience and Adulthood'', that growing up in a predominantly sibling society affects only children and that their lack of sibling relationships can have an important effect on both the way they see themselves and others and how they interact with the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sorensen |first=B. |year=2008 |title=Only Child Experience and Adulthood |location=Hampshire |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |pages=164–195 |isbn=0-230-52101-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest research by Cameron et al. (2011) controls for endogeneity associated with being only children. Parents that choose to have only one child could differ systematically in their characteristics from parents who choose to have more than one child. The paper concludes that "those who grew up as only children as a consequence of the (one-child) policy (in China) are found to be less trusting, less trustworthy, less likely to take risks, and less competitive than if they had had siblings. They are also less optimistic, less conscientious, and more prone to neuroticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cameron |first=Lisa |last2=Erkal |first2=N. |last3=Gangadharan |first3=L. |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Meng |first4=Xin |year=2011 |title=Little Emperors—Behavioral Impacts of China’s One-Child Policy (University of Melbourne)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Professor Cameron, it was found that "greater exposure to other children in childhood – for example, frequent interactions with cousins and/or attending childcare – was not a substitute for having siblings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=January 10, 2013|title=Effects of China's One Child Policy on its children |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130110142131.htm|newspaper=Science Daily |location= |access-date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Born to Rebel'', [[Frank Sulloway]] provides evidence that [[birth order]] influences the development of the "[[big five personality traits]]" (also known as the Five Factor Model). Sulloway suggests that firstborns and only children are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to laterborns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sulloway |first=F. J. |year=1996 |title=Born to rebel: Birth order, family dynamics and creative lives |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |isbn=0-679-44232-4 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his conclusions have been challenged by other researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harris |first=J. R. |year=2006 |title=No two alike: Human nature and human individuality |location=New York |publisher=WW Norton &amp; Company |isbn=0-393-05948-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that birth order effects are weak and inconsistent. In one of the largest studies conducted on the effect of birth order on the Big Five, data from a national sample of 9,664 subjects found no association between birth order and scores on the [[NEO PI-R]] personality test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jefferson |first=T. |last2=Herbst |first2=J.

It had two expansion slots, one on the side and one on the bottom.''" (July 3, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apple IIe]] have an open architecture supporting plug-in cards, whereas the [[Apple IIc]] computer has a '''closed architecture'''. Open architecture systems may use a standardized [[system bus]] such as [[S-100 bus|S-100]], [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] or [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] or they may incorporate a proprietary bus standard such as that used on the [[Apple II]], with up to a dozen slots that allow multiple hardware manufacturers to produce add-ons, and for the user to freely install them. By contrast, closed architectures, if they are expandable at all, have one or two "expansion ports" using a proprietary connector design that may require a license fee from the manufacturer, or enhancements may only be installable by technicians with specialized tools or training.

[[Computer platform]]s may include systems with both open and closed architectures. The [[Mac mini]] and [[Compact Macintosh]] are closed; the [[Macintosh II]] and [[Power Macintosh G5]] are open. Most [[desktop PC]]s are open architecture, but [[nettop]]s are typically closed.

Similarly, an open software architecture is one in which additional software modules can be added to the basic framework provided by the architecture. Open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to major software products are the way in which the basic functionality of such products can be modified or extended.  The [[Google APIs]] are examples. A second type of open software architecture consists of the messages that can flow between computer systems. These messages have a standard structure that can be modified or extended per agreements between the computer systems. An example is IBM's [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]].

Open architecture allows potential users to see inside all or parts of the architecture without any proprietary constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zk2qCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP6&amp;lpg=PP6 |title=TRON Project 1987 Open-Architecture Computer Systems: Proceedings of the Third TRON Project Symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, an open architecture publishes all or parts of its architecture that the developer or integrator wants to share. The [[open business]] processes involved with an open architecture may require some license agreements between entities sharing the architecture information. Open architectures have been successfully implemented in many diverse fields, including the [[US Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/spring08/HowAndWhy.html|title=The HOW and WHY of OPEN ARCHITECTURE|work=[[navy.mil]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[programming language theory]], the '''POPLmark challenge''' (from "Principles of Programming Languages benchmark", formerly '''Mechanized Metatheory for the Masses!''') (Aydemir, 2005) is a set of [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] designed to evaluate the state of [[automated reasoning]] (or mechanization) in the [[metatheory]] of programming languages, and to stimulate discussion and collaboration among a diverse cross section of the [[formal methods]] community. Very loosely speaking, the challenge is about measurement of how well programs may be proven to match a specification of how they are intended to behave (and the many complex issues that this involves). The challenge was initially proposed by the members of the ''PL club'' at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], in association with collaborators around the world. The ''Workshop on Mechanized Metatheory'' is the main meeting of researchers participating in the challenge.

The design of the POPLmark benchmark is guided by features common to reasoning about programming languages. The challenge problems do not require the formalisation of large programming languages, but they do require sophistication in reasoning about:

; [[Name binding|Binding]] : Most programming languages have some form of binding, ranging in complexity from the simple binders of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] to complex, potentially infinite binders needed in the treatment of [[record (computer science)|record]] [[pattern matching|pattern]]s.
; [[Mathematical induction|Induction]] : Properties such as [[subject reduction]] and [[strong normalisation]] often require complex induction arguments.
; Reuse : Furthering collaboration being a key aim of the challenge, the solutions are expected to contain reusable components that would allow researchers to share language features and designs without requiring them to start from scratch every time.

== The problems ==

{{As of|2007}}, the POPLmark challenge is composed of three parts. Part 1 concerns solely the types of [[system F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[System F]] with [[subtyping]]), and has problems such as:
# Checking that the type system admits [[transitive relation|transitivity]] of subtyping.
# Checking the transitivity of subtyping in the presence of [[record (computer science)|record]]s

Part 2 concerns the syntax and semantics of System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;. It concerns proofs of
# [[Type safety]] for the pure fragment
# Type safety in the presence of [[pattern matching]]

Part 3 concerns the usability of the formalisation of System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, the challenge asks for:
# Simulating and animating the [[operational semantics]]
# Extracting useful algorithms from the formalisations

Several solutions have been proposed for parts of the POPLmark challenge, using following tools: [[Isabelle theorem prover|Isabelle/HOL]], [[Twelf]], [[Coq]], [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/programs/aprolog/ αProlog], [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [http://abella.cs.umn.edu/ Abella] and [[Matita proof assistant|Matita]].

'''Plant senescence''' is the process of aging in plants. Plants have both stress-induced and age-related developmental aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schippers|first=Jos H. M.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Romy|last3=Wagstaff|first3=Carol|last4=Jing|first4=Hai-Chun|date=2015-10-01|title=Living to Die and Dying to Live: The Survival Strategy behind Leaf Senescence|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/169/2/914|journal=Plant Physiology|language=en|volume=169|issue=2|pages=914–930|doi=10.1104/pp.15.00498|issn=1532-2548|pmc=4587445|pmid=26276844}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence reveals the [[carotenoid]]s, and is the cause of  [[autumn leaf color]] in deciduous trees. Leaf senescence has the important function of recycling nutrients, mostly nitrogen, to growing and storage organs of the plant. Unlike animals, plants continually form new organs and older organs undergo a highly regulated senescence program to maximize nutrient export.

[[Image:Oregongrapeleaves.jpg|thumb|252px|right|The autumn senescence of [[Oregon grape]] leaves is an example of programmed plant senescence.]]

==Hormonal regulation of senescence==
Programmed senescence seems to be heavily influenced by [[plant hormone]]s. The hormones [[abscisic acid]], [[ethylene]], [[jasmonic acid]] and salicylic acid are accepted by most scientists as promoters of senescence, but at least one source lists [[gibberellin]]s, [[brassinosteroids]] and [[strigolactone]] as also being involved.&lt;ref name="sketch 8 part"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planthormones.info/ |title=A Sketch of an 8 Part Plant Hormone Theory |publisher=Planthormones.info |date=2004-07-01 |accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cytokinin]]s help to maintain the plant cell and expression of cytokinin biosynthesis genes late in development prevents leaf senescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gan|first=Susheng|last2=Amasino|first2=Richard M.|date=1995-12-22|title=Inhibition of Leaf Senescence by Autoregulated Production of Cytokinin|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/270/5244/1986|journal=Science|language=en|volume=270|issue=5244|pages=1986–1988|doi=10.1126/science.270.5244.1986|issn=0036-8075|pmid=8592746}}&lt;/ref&gt; A withdrawal of or inability of the cell to perceive cytokinin may cause it to undergo apoptosis or senescence.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanova M., and Rost T.

===Annual versus perennial benefits===
Some plants have evolved into [[Annual plant|annuals]] which die off at the end of each season and leave seeds for the next, whereas closely related plants in the same family have evolved to live as [[Perennial plant|perennials]]. This may be a programmed "strategy"{{clarify|date=August 2012}} for the plants.

The benefit of an annual strategy may be genetic diversity, as one set of genes does continue year after year, but a new mix is produced each year. Secondly, being annual may allow the plants a better survival strategy, since the plant can put most of its accumulated energy and resources into [[seed]] production rather than saving some for the plant to overwinter, which would limit seed production.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Conversely, the perennial strategy may sometimes be the more effective survival strategy, because the plant has a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] every spring with growing points, roots, and stored energy that have survived through the winter. In trees for example, the structure can be built on year after year so that the tree and root structure can become larger, stronger, and capable of producing more fruit and seed than the year before, out-competing other plants for light, water, nutrients, and space. This strategy will fail when environmental conditions change rapidly. If a certain bug quickly takes advantage and kills all of the nearly identical perennials, then there will be a far lesser chance that a random mutation will slow the bug compared to more diverse annuals.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Plant self-pruning===
There is a speculative [[hypothesis]] on how and why a plant induces part of itself to die off.&lt;ref name="sketch 8 part"/&gt; The theory holds that leaves and roots are routinely pruned off during the growing season whether they are annual or perennial. This is done mainly to mature leaves and roots and is for one of two reasons; either both the leaves and roots that are pruned are no longer efficient enough nutrient acquisition-wise or that energy and resources are needed in another part of the plant because that part of the plant is faltering in its resource acquisition.
* Poor productivity reasons for plant self pruning – the plant rarely prunes young dividing [[meristem]]atic cells, but if a fully grown mature cell is no longer acquiring nutrients that it should acquire, then it is pruned.
** Shoot efficiency self pruning reasons – for instance, presumably a mature shoot cell must on average produce enough sugar, and acquire enough oxygen and carbon dioxide to support both it and a similar sized root cell. Actually, since plants are obviously interested in growing it is arguable, that the "directive" of the average shoot cell, is to "show a profit" and produce or acquire more than enough sugar and gases than is necessary to support both it and a similar sized root cell. If this "profit" isn't shown, the shoot cell is killed off and resources are redistributed to "promising" other young shoots or leaves in the hope that they will be more productive.
** Root efficiency self pruning reasons – similarly a mature root cell must acquire on average, more than enough minerals and water needed to support both it and a similar sized shoot cell that does not acquire water and minerals. If this does not happen, the root is killed off and resources sent to new young root candidates.
* Shortage/need-based reason for plant self pruning – this is the other side of efficiency problems.
**Shoot shortages – if a shoot is not getting enough root derived minerals and water, the idea is that it will kill part of itself off, and send the resources to the root to make more roots.
**Root shortages – the idea here is that if the root is not getting enough shoot derived sugar and gases it will kill part of itself off and send resources to the shoot, to allow more shoot growth.

This is an oversimplification, in that it is arguable that some shoot and root cells serve other functions than to acquire nutrients. In these cases, whether they are pruned or not would be "calculated" by the plant using some other criteria. It is also arguable that, for example, mature nutrient-acquiring shoot cells would have to acquire more than enough shoot nutrients to support both it and its share of both shoot and root cells that do not acquire sugar and gases whether they are of a structural, reproductive, immature, or just plain, root nature.

The idea that a plant does not impose efficiency demands on immature cells is that most immature cells are part of so-called dormant buds in plants. These are kept small and non-dividing until the plant needs them. They are found in buds, for instance in the base of every lateral stem.

===Theory of hormonal induction of senescence===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
There is little theory on how plants induce themselves to senesce, although it is reasonably widely accepted that some of it is done hormonally. Plant scientists generally concentrate on ethylene and abscisic acid as culprits in senescence, but neglect gibberellin and brassinosteroid which inhibits root growth if not causing actual root pruning. This is perhaps because roots are below the ground and thus harder to study.
#Shoot pruning – it is now known that ethylene induces the shedding of leaves much more than abscisic acid. ABA originally received its name because it was discovered to have a role in leaf abscission. Its role is now seen to be minor and only occurring in special cases.
#*Hormonal shoot pruning theory – a new simple theory says that even though ethylene may be responsible for the final act of leaf shedding, it is ABA and strigolactones that induces senescence in leaves due to a run away [[positive feedback]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="sketch 8 part"/&gt; What supposedly happens is that ABA and strigolactones are released by mostly mature leaves under water and or mineral shortages. The ABA and strigolactones act in mature leaf cells however, by pushing out minerals, water, sugar, gases and even the growth hormones auxin and cytokinin (and possibly jasmonic and salicylic acid in addition). This causes even more ABA and strigolactones to be made until the leaf is drained of all nutrients. When conditions get particularly bad in the emptying mature leaf cell, it will experience sugar and oxygen deficiencies and so lead to gibberellin and finally ethylene emanation. When the leaf senses ethylene it knows its time to excise.
#Root pruning – the concept that plants prune the roots in the same kind of way as they abscise leaves, is not a well discussed topic among plant scientists, although the phenomena undoubtedly exists. If gibberellin,  brassinosteroid and ethylene are known to inhibit root growth it takes just a little imagination to assume they perform the same role as ethylene does in the shoot, that is to prune the roots too.
#*Hormonal root pruning theory – in the new theory just like ethylene, GA, BA and Eth are seen both to be induced by sugar (GA/BA) and oxygen (ETH) shortages (as well as maybe excess levels of carbon dioxide for Eth) in the roots, and to push sugar and oxygen, as well as minerals, water and the growth hormones out of the root cell causing a positive feedback loop resulting the emptying and death of the root cell. The final death knell for a root might be strigolactone or most probably ABA as these are indicators of substances that should be abundant in the root and if they cannot even support themselves with these nutrients then they should be senesced.
#Parallels to cell division – the theory, perhaps even more controversially, asserts that just as both auxin and cytokinin seem to be needed before a plant cell divides, in the same way perhaps ethylene and GA/BA (and ABA and strigolactones) are needed before a cell would senesce.

==Seed senescence==

[[Seed]] [[germination]] performance is a major determinant of crop yield.  Deterioration of seed quality with age is associated with accumulation of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]].&lt;ref name="pmid25750428"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterworth WM, Bray CM, West CE |title=The importance of safeguarding genome integrity in germination and seed longevity |journal=J.

'''Problem analysis''' or the '''problem frames approach''' is an approach to software [[requirements analysis]]. It was developed by British software consultant [[Michael A. Jackson]] in the 1990s.

== History ==
The problem frames approach was first sketched by Jackson in his book ''Software Requirements &amp; Specifications'' (1995) and in a number of articles in various journals devoted to software engineering.  It has received its fullest description in his ''Problem Frames: Analysing and Structuring Software Development Problems'' (2001).

A session on problem frames was part of the 9th International Workshop on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ)] held in Klagenfurt/Velden, Austria in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050126191532/http://www.sse.uni-essen.de/refsq/downloads/summary-refsq03.pdf 9th International Workshop on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ)] held in Klagenfurt/Velden, Austria in 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The First International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~karlc/ProblemFramesWorkshop.htm First International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames]&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of ICSE’04 held in Edinburgh, Scotland.  One outcome of that workshop was a 2005 special issue on problem frames in the ''International Journal of Information and Software Technology''.

The Second International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/jon_hall/Academic/IWAAPF06/index.html Second International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819174609/http://homepage.mac.com/jon_hall/Academic/IWAAPF06/index.html |date=2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of ICSE 2006 in Shanghai, China. The Third International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames (IWAAPF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://icse08.upb.de/program/workshops.html Third International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames]&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of ICSE 2008 in Leipzig, Germany.  In 2010, the IWAAPF workshops were replaced by the International Workshop on Applications and Advances of Problem-Orientation (IWAAPO).  IWAAPO broadens the focus of the workshops to include alternative and complementary approaches to software development that share an emphasis on problem analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwaapo.org/ International Workshop on Applications and Advances of Problem-Orientation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111084248/http://www.iwaapo.org/ |date=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IWAAPO-2010 was held as part of ICSE 2010 in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.co.za/ICSE2010/3-EVENTS/WORKSHOPS/W23.html IWAAPO-2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today research on the problem frames approach is being conducted at a number of universities, most notably at the [[Open University]] in the United Kingdom  as part of its ''Relating Problem &amp; Solution Structures'' research theme&lt;ref&gt;[http://computing-research.open.ac.uk/read/index.php?page=topic&amp;group=RPSS&amp;theme=READ ''Relating Problem &amp; Solution Structures'' research theme]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example: "Relating software requirements and architectures using problem frames" by Hall, J.G.; Jackson, M.; Laney, R.C.; Nuseibeh, B.; Rapanotti, L., in ''Proceedings of the IEEE Joint International Conference on Requirements Engineering'' (2002), pp. 137–144&lt;/ref&gt; Interesting work is being done by Professors Lavazza and del Bianco on using problem frames with UML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaria.org/conferences2007/filesICSEA07/UMLreqs.pdf |title=Using problem frames with UML |author1=Lavazza, Luigi |author2=Del Bianco, Vieri }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas in the problem frames approach have been generalized into the concepts of [[problem-oriented development]] (POD) and problem-oriented engineering (POE), of which [[problem-oriented software engineering]] (POSE) is a particular sub-category.  The first [http://poc-workshop.eu International Workshop on Problem-Oriented Development] was held in June 2009.

== Overview ==

=== Fundamental philosophy ===
''Problem analysis'' or the ''problem frames approach'' is an approach — a set of concepts — to be used when gathering requirements and creating specifications for computer software. Its basic philosophy is strikingly different from other software requirements methods in insisting that:

* The best way to approach requirements analysis is through a process of parallel — not hierarchical — decomposition of user requirements.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news
  |last=Jackson 
  |first=Michael   
  |title=Problem Decomposition for Reuse
  |year=1995  
  |pages=1, 2
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* User requirements are about relationships in the real world—the ''application domain'' – not about the software system or even the interface with the software system.

It is more helpful ... to recognize that the solution is located in the computer and
its software, and the problem is in the world outside.
... The computers can provide solutions to these problems because they
are connected to the world outside.

&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

{{quote|
The moral is clear:
to study and analyse a problem you must focus on studying and analysing the problem world
in some depth,
and in your investigations you must be willing to
travel some distance away from the computer. ... ''[In a call forwarding problem...]'' You need to describe what's there – people and offices and holidays
and moving office and delegating responsibility – and what effects ''[in the problem world]''
you would like the system to achieve – 
calls to A's number must reach A, and 
''[when B is on vacation, and C is temporarily working at D's desk]'' 
calls to B's or C's number must reach C.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach uses three sets of conceptual tools.

=== Tools for describing specific problems ===

Concepts used for describing specific problems include: 
''phenomena'' (of various kinds, including ''events''), 
''problem context'', 
''problem domain'',
''solution domain'' (aka the ''machine''), 
''shared phenomena'' (which exist in ''domain interfaces''), 
''domain requirements'' (which exist in the problem domains) and 
''specifications'' (which exist at the problem domain:machine interface).

The graphical tools for describing problems are the ''context diagram'' and the 
''problem diagram''.

=== Tools for describing classes of problems (problem frames) ===

The Problem Frames Approach includes concepts for describing classes of problems.  A recognized class of problems is called a ''problem frame'' (roughly analogous to a '''design pattern''').

In a problem frame, domains are given general names and described in terms of their important characteristics. A domain, for example, may be classified as ''causal'' (reacts in a deterministic, predictable way to events) or ''biddable'' (can be bid, or asked, to respond to events, but cannot be expected always to react to events in any predictable, deterministic way).  (A biddable domain usually consists of people.)

The graphical tool for representing a problem frame is a ''frame diagram''.  A frame diagram looks generally like a problem diagram except for a few minor differences—domains have general, rather than specific, names; and rectangles representing domains are annotated to indicate the type (causal or biddable) of the domain.

=== A list of recognized classes of problems (problem frames) ===

The first group of problem frames identified by Jackson included:
# required behavior
# commanded behavior
# information display
# simple workpieces
# transformation

Subsequently, other researchers have described or proposed additional problem frames.

== Describing problems ==

=== The problem context ===
Problem analysis considers a software application to be a kind of software ''machine''. A software development project aims to change the problem context by creating a software machine and adding it to the problem context, where it will bring about certain desired effects.

The particular portion of the problem context that is of interest in connection with a particular problem — the particular portion of the problem context that forms the context of the problem — is called the ''application domain''.

After the software development project has been finished, and the software machine has been inserted into the problem context, the problem context will contain both the application domain and the machine. At that point, the situation will look like this:

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemContext1.svg|220px|center]]

The problem context contains the machine and the application domain. The ''machine interface'' is where the Machine and the application domain meet and interact.

The same situation can be shown in a different kind of diagram, a ''context diagram'', this way:

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemContext2.png|center|]]

=== The context diagram ===
The problem analyst's first task is to truly understand the problem.  That means understanding the context in which the problem is set.  And that means drawing a ''context diagram.''

Here is Jackson's description of examining the problem context, in this case the context for a bridge to be built:

: You're an engineer planning to build a bridge across a river. So you visit the site. Standing on one bank of the river, you look at the surrounding land, and at the river traffic. You feel how exposed the place is, and how hard the wind is blowing and how fast the river is running. You look at the bank and wonder what faults a geological survey will show up in the rocky terrain. You picture to yourself the bridge that you are going to build. (''Software Requirements &amp; Specifications'': "The Problem Context")

An analyst trying to understand a software development problem must go through the same process as the bridge engineer. He starts by examining the various problem domains in the application domain. These domains form the context into which the planned Machine must fit. Then he imagines how the Machine will fit into this context. And then he constructs a context diagram showing his vision of the problem context with the Machine installed in it.

The context diagram shows the various ''problem domains'' in the application domain, their connections, and the Machine and its connections to (some of) the problem domains. Here is what a context diagram looks like.

[[Image:ProblemFramesContextDiagram1.svg|center|]]

This diagram shows:

* the ''machine'' to be built. The dark border helps to identify the box that represents the Machine.
* the ''problem domains'' that are relevant to the problem.
* the solid lines represent ''domain interfaces'' — areas where domains overlap and share phenomena in common.

A domain is simply a part of the world that we are interested in.  It consists of ''phenomena'' — individuals, events, states of affairs, relationships, and behaviors.

A domain interface is an area where domains connect and communicate.  Domain interfaces are not data flows or messages.  An interface is a place where domains partially overlap, so that the phenomena in the interface are ''shared phenomena'' — they exist in both of the overlapping domains.

You can imagine domains as being like primitive one-celled organisms (like amoebas).  They are able to extend parts of themselves into pseudopods. Imagine that two such organisms extend pseudopods toward each other in a sort of handshake, and that the cellular material in the area where they are shaking hands is mixing, so that it belongs to both of them.  That's an interface.

In the following diagram, X is the interface between domains A and B.  Individuals that exist or events that occur in X, exist or occur in both A and B.  
 
[[Image:ProblemFramesInterfaces.svg|center|]]

Shared individuals, states and events may look differently to the domains that share them.  Consider for example an interface between a computer and a keyboard. When the keyboard domain sees an event ''Keyboard operator presses the spacebar'' the computer will see the same event as ''Byte hex("20") appears in the input buffer.''

=== Problem diagrams ===
The problem analyst's basic tool for describing a problem is a ''problem diagram''. Here is a generic problem diagram.

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemDiagram1.svg|center|]]

In addition to the kinds of things shown on a context diagram, a problem diagram shows:

* a dotted oval representing the ''requirement'' to bring about certain effects in the problem domains.
* dotted lines representing ''requirement references'' — references in the requirement to phenomena in the problem domains.

An interface that connects a problem domain to the machine is called a ''specification interface'' and the phenomena in the specification interface are called ''specification phenomena''. The  goal of the requirements analyst is to develop a specification for the behavior that the Machine must exhibit at the Machine interface in order to satisfy the requirement.

Here is an example of a real, if simple, problem diagram.

[[Image:ProblemFramesProblemDiagram2.png|center|]]

This problem might be part of a computer system in a hospital. In the hospital, patients are connected to sensors that can detect and measure their temperature and blood pressure. The requirement is to construct a Machine that can display information about patient conditions on a panel in the nurses station.

The name of the requirement is "Display ~ Patient Condition".  The tilde (~) indicates that the requirement is about a relationship or correspondence between the panel display and patient conditions. The arrowhead indicates that the requirement reference connected to the Panel Display domain is also a requirement constraint. That means that the requirement contains some kind of stipulation that the Panel display must meet. In short, the requirement is that ''The panel display must display information that matches and accurately reports the condition of the patients.''

== Describing classes of problems ==

=== Problem frames ===
A ''problem frame'' is a description of a recognizable class of problems, where the class of problems has a known solution.  In a sense, problem frames are problem patterns.

Each problem frame has its own ''frame diagram''.  A frame diagram looks essentially like a problem diagram, but instead of showing specific domains and requirements, it shows types of domains and types of requirements; domains have general, rather than specific, names; and rectangles representing domains are annotated to indicate the type (causal or biddable) of the domain.

=== Variant frames ===
In ''Problem Frames'' Jackson discussed variants of the five basic problem
frames that he had identified.  A variant typically adds a domain to the problem context.

* a ''description variant'' introduces a description lexical domain 
* an ''operator variant'' introduces an operator
* a ''connection variant'' introduces a connection domain between the machine and the central domain with which it interfaces
* a ''control variant'' introduces no new domain; it changes the control characteristics of interface phenomena

=== Problem concerns ===
Jackson also discusses certain kinds of concerns that arise when working with problem frames.

Particular concerns 
* overrun
* initialization
* reliability
* identities
* completeness

Composition concerns 
* commensurable descriptions  
* consistency  
* precedence  
* interference  
* synchronization

== Recognized problem frames ==

The first problem frames identified by Jackson included:
# required behavior
# commanded behavior
# information display
# simple workpieces
# transformation

Subsequently, other researchers have described or proposed additional problem frames.

=== Required-behavior problem frame ===
The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There is some part of the physical world whose behavior is to be controlled so that it satisfies certain conditions.  The problem is to build a machine that will impose that control.''

=== Commanded-behavior problem frame ===
The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There is some part of the physical world whose behavior is to be controlled in accordance with commands issued by an operator.  The problem is to build a machine that will accept the operator's commands and impose the control accordingly.''

=== Information display problem frame ===
The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There is some part of the physical world about whose states and behavior certain information is continually needed.  The problem is to build a machine that will obtain this information from the world and present it at the required place in the required form.''

=== Simple workpieces problem frame ===

The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''A tool is needed to allow a user to create and edit a certain class of computer-processible text or graphic objects, or similar structures, so that they can be subsequently copied, printed, analyzed or used in other ways.  The problem is to build a machine that can act as this tool.''

=== Transformation problem frame ===

The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is:
* ''There are some given computer-readable input files whose data must be transformed to give certain required output files.  The output data must be in a particular format, and it must be derived from the input data according to certain rules.  The problem is to build a machine that will produce the required outputs from the inputs.''

== Problem analysis and the software development process ==
When problem analysis is incorporated into the [[software development process]], the software development lifecycle starts with the problem analyst, who studies the situation and:
* creates a context diagram
* gathers a list of requirements and adds a requirements oval to the context diagram, creating a grand "all-in-one" problem diagram.  (However, in many cases actually creating an all-in-one problem diagram may be impractical or unhelpful: there will be too many requirements references criss-crossing the diagram to make it very useful.)
* decomposes the all-in-one problem and problem diagram into simpler problems and simpler problem diagrams.  These problems are ''projections'', not subsets, of the all-in-one diagram.
* continues to decompose problems until each problem is simple enough that it can be seen to be an instance of a recognized problem frame.  Each subproblem description includes a description of the specification interfaces for the machine to be built.

At this point, problem analysis — ''problem decomposition'' — is complete.  The next step is to reverse the process and to build the desired software system though a process of ''solution composition''.

The solution composition process is not yet well understood, and is still very much a research topic. Extrapolating from hints in ''Software Requirements &amp; Specifications'', we can guess that the software development process would continue with the developers, who would:

* compose the multiple subproblem machine specifications into the specification for a single all-in-one machine: a specification for a software machine that satisfies all of the customer's requirements.  This is a non-trivial activity — the composition process may very well raise ''composition problems'' that need to be solved.
* implement the all-in-one machine by going through the traditional code/test/deploy process.

== Similar approaches ==
There are a few other software development ideas that are similar in some ways to problem analysis.

* The notion of a [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]] is similar to Jackson's notion of a problem frame.  It differs in that a design pattern is used for recognizing and handling design issues (often design issues in specific object-oriented programming languages such as C++ or Java) rather than for recognizing and handling requirements issues. Furthermore, one difference is that design patterns cover ''solutions'' while in problem frames ''problems'' are represented. However, the design patterns also tend to account for semantic outcomes that are not native to the programming language they are to be implemented in.  So, another difference is that problem frames is a native meta-notation for the domain of problems, whereas design patterns are a catalogue of technical debt left behind by the language implementers.
* ''Aspect-oriented programming'', AOP (also known as [[aspect-oriented software development]], AOSD) is similarly interested in parallel decomposition, which addresses what AOP proponents call ''cross-cutting concerns'' or ''aspects''. AOP addresses concerns that are much closer to the design and code-generation phase than to the requirements analysis phase. 
* AOP has moved into requirement engineering notations such as ITU-T Z.151 User Requirements Notation (URN).  In URN the AOP is over the all the intentional elements. AOP can also be applied over requirement modelling that uses problem frames as a heuristic.  URN models driven with problem frame thinking, and interleaved with aspects, allows for inclusion of architectural tactics into the requirement model.
* Martin Fowler's book '''Analysis Patterns''' is very similar to problem analysis in its search for patterns.  It doesn't really present a new requirements analysis method, however.  And the notion of parallel decomposition — which is so important for problem analysis — is not a part of Fowler's analysis patterns.
* Jon G. Hall, Lucia Rapanotti, together with Jackson, have developed the Problem Oriented Software Engineering (POSE) framework&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Hall, L. Rapanotti, and M. Jackson. Problem-oriented software engineering: solving the package router control problem. IEEE Trans. Software Eng., 2008. {{doi|10.1109/TSE.2007.70769}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which shares the problem frames foundations. Since, 2005, Hall and Rapanotti have extended POSE to Problem Oriented Engineering (POE), which provides a framework for engineering design, including a development process model and assurance-driven design,&lt;ref&gt;J.

The balanced growth theory is an [[economic theory]] pioneered by the economist [[Ragnar Nurkse]] (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises that the government of any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;&lt;ref name="godo"/&gt; This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.

Nurkse was in favour of attaining balanced growth in both the industrial and agricultural sectors of the economy.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; He recognised that the expansion and inter-sectoral balance between agriculture and manufacturing is necessary so that each of these sectors provides a market for the products of the other and in turn, supplies the necessary raw materials for the development and growth of the other.

Nurkse and [[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]] were the pioneers of balanced growth theory and much of how it is understood today dates back to their work.&lt;ref name="handbook1"/&gt;

Nurkse's theory discusses how the poor size of the market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state.&lt;ref name="kd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="debraj"/&gt; Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity.&lt;ref name = "case"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory.&lt;ref name = "james"/&gt; No importance should be given to promoting exports.&lt;ref name="working"/&gt;

== Size of market and inducement to invest ==

The size of a market assumes primary importance in the study of what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of [[Allyn A. Young]] to assert that inducement to invest is limited by the size of the market.&lt;ref name = "allyn"/&gt; The original idea behind this was put forward by [[Adam Smith]], who stated that [[division of labour]] (as against inducement to invest) is limited by the extent of the market.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt;

According to Nurkse, underdeveloped countries lack adequate [[purchasing power]].&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; ''Low purchasing power'' means that the [[real wage|real income]] of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the [[money supply]]; however, since the meaning in this context is real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate [[inflationary]] pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic [[demand]] for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for [[capital (economics)|capital]] as well.

The size of the market determines the incentive to invest irrespective of the nature of the economy.&lt;ref name="debraj"/&gt; This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in [[underdeveloped countries]], the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.

Private entrepreneurs sometimes resort to heavy [[advertising]] as a means of attracting buyers for their products. Although this may lead to a rise in demand for that entrepreneur's good or service, it does not actually raise the [[aggregate demand]] in the economy. The demand merely shifts from one provider to another.&lt;ref name ="kd"/&gt; Clearly, this is not a long-term solution.

Ragnar Nurkse concluded,

{{quote|''"The limited size of the domestic market in a low income country can thus constitute an obstacle to the application of capital by any individual firm or industry working for the market. In this sense the small domestic market is an obstacle to development generally."''&lt;ref name = "case"/&gt; |}}

== Determinants of size of market ==
According to Nurkse, expanding the size of the market is crucial to increasing the inducement to invest. Only then can the vicious circle of poverty be broken. He mentioned the following pertinent points about how the size of the market is determined:

[[File:Determinants of Size of Market in Ragnar Nurkse's Balanced Growth Theory.svg|thumb|right|500px|450px|alt=Determinants of size of market|Determinants of size of market]]

=== Money supply ===
{{Main|Money supply}}

Nurkse emphasised that [[Keynesian theory]] shouldn't be applied to underdeveloped countries because they don't face a lack of [[effective demand]] in the way that [[developed countries]] do.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; Their problem is to do with a lack of real [[purchasing power]] due to low productivity levels. Thus, merely increasing the supply of money will not expand the market but will in fact cause ''inflationary pressure''.

=== Population ===
Nurkse argued against the notion that a large population implies a large market.&lt;ref name="kd" /&gt; Though underdeveloped countries have a large population, their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.

=== Geographical area ===
Nurkse also refuted the claim that if a country's geographical area is large, the size of its market also ought to be large.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; A country may be extremely small in area but still have a large effective demand. For example, Japan. In contrast, a country may cover a huge geographical area but its market may still be small. This may occur if a large part of the country is uninhabitable, or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low [[National Income]].

=== Transport cost and trade barriers ===
The notion that transport costs and trade barriers hinder the expansion of the market is age-old. Nurkse emphasised that [[tariff]] duties, exchange controls, [[import quotas]] and other [[non-tariff barriers to trade]] are major obstacles to promoting international cooperation in exporting and importing.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; More specifically, due to high transport costs between nations, producers do not have an incentive to export their commodities. As a result, the amount of [[capital accumulation]] remains small. To address this problem, the United Nations produced a report in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Measures for the Economic Development of Underdeveloped Countries, Report by a Group of Experts appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations|date=May 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; with solutions for underdeveloped countries. They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries. Also, they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether. The logic was that once customs duties are removed, transport costs will fall. Consequently, prices will fall and thus the demand will rise. However, Nurkse, as an export pessimist, did not agree with this view.&lt;ref name="working"/&gt; Export pessimism is a trade theory which is governed by the idea of "inward looking growth" as opposed to "outward looking growth". (See [[Import substitution industrialization]])

=== Sales promotion ===
Often, it is true that a company's private endeavour to increase the demand for its products succeeds due to the extensive use of advertisement and other sales promotion technique. However, Nurkse argues that such activities cannot succeed at the macro level to increase a country's aggregate demand level.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; He calls this the ''"macroeconomic paradox"''.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt;

=== Productivity ===
{{Main|Productivity}}

Nurkse stressed productivity as the ''primary determinant of the size of the market''. An increase in productivity (defined as the output per unit input) increases the flow of goods and services in the economy. As a response, consumption also rises. Hence, underdeveloped economies should aim to raise their productivity levels in all sectors of the economy, in particular agriculture and industry.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

[[File:How increased productivity leads to economic development and growth.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Productivity|The process of how increased productivity leads to economic development and growth]]

For example, in most underdeveloped economies, the ''technology'' used to carry out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while a large proportion of the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; This points to the need to increase output per unit input and ''output per head''. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, [[high-yielding variety]] seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.

Nurkse is of the opinion that [[Say's Law]] of markets operates in underdeveloped countries. Thus, if the money incomes of the people rise while the price level in the economy stays the same, the size of the market will still not expand till the real income and productivity levels rise. To quote Nurkse,

{{quote|''"In underdeveloped areas there is generally no '[[deflationary gap]]' through excessive savings. Production creates its own demand, and the size of the market depends on the volume of production. In the last analysis, the market can be enlarged only through all-round increase in productivity. Capacity to buy means capacity to produce."''&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;|}}
{{Clear}}

== Export pessimism ==
Citing the limited size of the market as the main impediment in economic growth, Nurkse reasons that an increase in productivity can create a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|virtuous circle of growth]].&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; Thus, a large scale investment programme in a wide array of industries simultaneously is the answer. The increase in demand for one industry will lead to an increase in demand for another industry due to ''complementarity of demands''. As Say's Law states, ''supply creates its own demand''.&lt;ref name="gulati"/&gt;

However, Nurkse clarified that the finance for this development must arise to as large an extent as possible from the underdeveloped country itself i.e. domestically.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; He stated that financing through increased trade or [[foreign investments]] was a strategy used in the past - the 19th century - and its success was limited to the case of the United States of America. In reality, the so-called "new countries" of the United States of America (which separated from the British empire) were high income countries to begin with.&lt;ref name="working"/&gt; They were already endowed with efficient producers, effective markets and a high purchasing power. The point Nurkse was trying to make was that USA was rich in resource endowment as well as labour force. The labour force had merely migrated from Britain to USA, and thus their level of skills were advanced to begin with. This situation of outward led growth was therefore unique and not replicable by underdeveloped countries.

In fact, if such a strategy of financing development from outside the home country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse the resources of the underdeveloped country. This would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure.&lt;ref name="working"/&gt; Apart from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a [[balance of payments crisis]] may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.

Another reason exports cannot be promoted is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country may only be skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; However, since such commodities face [[inelastic demand]], the extent to which they will sell in the market is limited.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the [[replacement rate]] of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;

Thus, for a large-scale development to be feasible, the requisite capital must be generated from within the country itself, and not through export surplus or foreign investment.&lt;ref name="debraj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; Only then can productivity increase and lead to increasing returns to scale and eventually create virtuous circles of growth.&lt;ref name="working"/&gt;&lt;ref name="social"/&gt;

== Role of state ==
After [[World War II]], a debate about whether a country should introduce ''[[financial planning]]'' to develop itself or rely on ''private entrepreneurs'' emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who ''should'' promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; The crucial idea was that a large amount of well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; However, it should be noted that most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.&lt;ref name="kd"/&gt;

== Reactions ==
Ragnar Nurkse's balanced growth theory too has been criticised on a number of grounds. His main critic was [[Albert O. Hirschman]], the pioneer of the [[strategy of unbalanced growth]]. [[Hans W. Singer]] also criticised certain aspects of the theory.

Hirschman stressed the fact that underdeveloped economies are called underdeveloped because they face a ''lack of resources'', maybe not natural resources, but resources such as skilled labour and technology.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; Thus, to hypothesise that an underdeveloped nation can undertake large scale investment in many industries of its economy simultaneously is unrealistic due to the paucity of resources.&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt; To quote Hirschman,

{{quote|''"If a country were ready to apply the doctrine of balanced growth, then it would not be underdeveloped in the first place."''&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt;|}}

Hans Singer asserted that the balanced growth theory is more applicable to cure an economy facing a [[business cycle|cyclical]] downswing.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; Cyclical downswing is a feature of an advanced stage of sustained growth rather than of the [[vicious cycle of poverty]].
Hirschman also stated that during conditions of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous investment in a large number of sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt;

Another contention was Nurkse's approval of [[Say's Law]], which theorises that there is no [[overproduction]] or glut in the economy.&lt;ref name="gulati"/&gt; Supply (production of goods and services) creates a matching demand for the output and this results in the entire output being sold and consumed. However, Keynes stated that Say's Law is not operational in any country because people do not spend their entire income - a fraction of it is saved for future consumption.&lt;ref name="gulati"/&gt; Thus, according to Nurkse's critics, his assumption of Say's Law being operational in underdeveloped countries needs greater justification.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; Even if the section of savers is few, the  tenet of  putting emphasis on supply rather than demand has been widely discredited.&lt;ref name="gulati"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;

Nurkse states that if demand for the output of one sector rises, due to the complementary nature of demand, the demand for the output of other industries will also experience a rise.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; Paul Rosenstein-Rodan spoke of a similar concept called "indivisibility of demand" which hypothesises that if large investments are made in a large number of industries simultaneously, an underdeveloped economy can become developed due to the phenomenon of complementary demand.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; However, both Nurkse and Rosenstein-Rodan only took into consideration the situation of industries that produce [[complementary goods]].&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; There are [[substitute good]]s too, which are in competition with each other. Thus if the state pumps in large investments into the car industry, for example, it will naturally lead to a rise in the demand for petrol. But if the state makes large scale investments in the coffee sector of a country, the tea sector will suffer.

Hans Singer suggested that Nurkse's theory makes dubious assumptions about the underdeveloped economy.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; For example, Nurkse assumes that the economy starts with nothing at hand.&lt;ref name="kd"/&gt; However, an economy usually starts at a position which reflects the previous investment decisions undertaken in the country,&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; and at any given moment, an imbalance already exists. So the logical step would be to take on those investment programmes which compliment the existing imbalance in the economy. Clearly, such an investment cannot be a balanced one. If an economy makes the mistake of setting out to make a balanced investment, a new imbalance is likely to appear which will require still another "balancing investment" to bring equilibrium, and so on and so forth.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt;

Hirschman believed that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't in fact a theory of growth.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; However, the balanced growth theory involves the creation of a brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation.&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt; In reality, a [[dual economy]] will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt;

[[File:Agulhas chla.png|thumb|right|[[NASA]] map of the [[Agulhas Current]] showing the levels of [[primary production]] during 2009. This is a measure of how much food was available for the spawning sardines.]]

The '''sardine run''' of southern Africa occurs from May through July when billions of [[sardine]]s – or more specifically the Southern African [[pilchard]] ''[[Sardinops sagax]]'' – spawn in the cool waters of the [[Agulhas Bank]] and move northward along the east coast of [[South Africa]]. Their sheer numbers create a [[feeding frenzy]] along the [[coastline]].
The run, containing millions of individual sardines, occurs when a current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to [[Mozambique]] where it then leaves the coastline and goes further east into the [[Indian Ocean]].

In terms of [[biomass]], researchers estimate the sardine run could rival East Africa's great [[wildebeest]] migration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/marine-scientists-scratch-heads-over-sardines-1.220684?ot=inmsa.ArticlePrintPageLayout.ot Marine Scientists Scratch Heads Over Sardines]. Reuters. August 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, little is known of the phenomenon. It is believed that the water temperature has to drop below 21&amp;nbsp;°C in order for the migration to take place. In 2003, the sardines failed to 'run' for the third time in 23 years. While 2005 saw a good run, 2006 marked another non-run.&lt;ref name="Run"&gt;[http://www.divethebig5.com/html/sardine_run.html Sardine Run] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827194553/http://www.divethebig5.com/html/sardine_run.html |date=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shoals are often more than 7&amp;nbsp;km long, 1.5&amp;nbsp;km wide and 30 metres deep and are clearly visible from spotter planes or from the surface.

Sardines group together when they are threatened. This instinctual behaviour is a defence mechanism, as lone individuals are more likely to be eaten than large groups.

==Causes==
[[File:Sardine Shoal Amanzimtoti 23 07 2010.JPG|thumb|Netting a shoal of sardines (dark patch in the water)]]
The sardine run is still poorly understood from an ecological point of view.
There have been various hypotheses, sometimes contradictory, that try to explain why and how the run occurs.

A recent interpretation of the causes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P Fréon |url=http://www.nisc.co.za/oneAbstract?absId=3728 |title=A review and tests of hypotheses about causes of the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run |journal=African Journal of Marine Science |year=2010 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=449–479 |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=1 |doi=10.2989/1814232X.2010.519451 |last2=Coetzee |first2=J C |last3=Van Der Lingen |first3=C D |last4=Connell |first4=A D |last5=o’Donoghue |first5=S H |last6=Roberts |first6=M J |last7=Demarcq |first7=H |last8=Attwood |first8=C G |last9=Lamberth |first9=S J |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420094105/http://www.nisc.co.za/oneAbstract?absId=3728 |archivedate=2012-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the sardine run is most likely a seasonal reproductive migration of a genetically distinct subpopulation of sardine that moves along the coast from the eastern Agulhas Bank to the coast of [[KwaZulu-Natal]] in most years if not in every year.

The migration is restricted to the inshore waters by the preference of sardine for cooler water and the strong and warm offshore Agulhas Current, which flows in the opposite direction to the migration, and is strongest just off the continental shelf.
A band of cooler coastal water and the occurrence of Natal Pulses and break-away eddies make it possible for sardine shoals to overcome their habitat constraints. The importance of these enabling factors is greatest where the continental shelf is narrowest.

The presence of eggs off the KwaZulu-Natal coast suggests that sardine stay there for several months and their return migration during late winter to spring is nearly always unnoticeable because it probably occurs at depths where the water is cooler than at the surface.

In some years there does not appear to be a sardine run. This may be because it is not detected by coastal observers either because it actually does not occur due to high water temperatures and/or other hydrographic barriers, or the migration may occur farther offshore and possibly deeper due to unusual conditions.

==Oceanographic influences==
Sardine prefer water temperatures between 14 and 20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barange M|author2=Hampton I|year=1997|title=Spatial structure of co-occurring anchovy and sardine populations from acoustic data: implications for survey design|journal=Fisheries Oceanography|volume=6|pages=94–108|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2419.1997.00032.x|url=ftp://ftp.imarpe.pe/Curso_Modelos/Biblio%20Arnaud%201/Barange-Hampton-1997.pdf|issue=2}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each southern winter the nearshore sea temperature along the South African south east coast drops to within this range. Along the KwaZulu-Natal coast, sardine may be found in water warmer than 20&amp;nbsp;°C.
It was hypothesized that factors beside temperature may influence the movement of sardine along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline, One of these factors may be predation pressure.

===Oceanographic regions of the KwaZulu-Natal coast===
The KwaZulu-Natal coast includes varied oceanographic regions, each influenced by distinct environmental forces.&lt;ref name="Shoal distribution"/&gt;
*The continental shelf waters of the KwaZulu-Natal Mid to Lower South coasts are dominated by the warm Agulhas Current which flows toward the south west. This water has a mean winter temperature of 23&amp;nbsp;°C and the current speed is often more than 1&amp;nbsp;m/s within 5&amp;nbsp;km of the coast.
*The Agulhas Current follows a very constant path. The main stream is just offshore of the continental shelf break most of the time, which suggests that conditions are normally unsuitable for sardines along that part of the coast.
*Local winds do not appear to have much effect on the currents.
*Sardine move closer to shore as they travel northwards along the coast, but it is not known whether this is due to environmental conditions or biological conditions.
*There is a persistent cyclonic gyre known as the Durban Eddy, where warm Agulhas Current water flows onto the shelf and the resulting inshore current direction is from south to north. This section of coast may be considered a transition from the wind-dominated section of the continental shelf to the north, to the Agulhas Current dominated section of shelf to the south.
*The North Coast section of continental shelf is considerably wider (&gt;40&amp;nbsp;km) than that of the south coast (roughly 15&amp;nbsp;km). This causes the Agulhas Current to flow farther offshore, and current conditions over the shelf are more variable. Wind appears to be a dominant influence in the region. Longshore north-easterly or south-westerly winds precede currents of similar direction by roughly 18 hours. Sea temperature is often lower and nutrients higher than along the South Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lutjeharms JRE |author2=Valentine HR |author3=van Ballegooyen RC |year= 2000|title=The hydrography and water masses of the Natal Bight, South Africa|journal= Continental Shelf Research |volume=20|pages=1907–1939|doi=10.1016/S0278-4343(00)00053-4 |url=http://www.bcre.org.za/seaatlas/papers/natal_bight.pdf|issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The North Coast would seem to be more suitable habitat for sardine, but it is not known to what extent they use it.

These distinct regions may affect sardine distribution and movement.

===Oceanographic variables and sardine presence===
Some oceanographic variables have been found useful for describing conditions influencing sardine presence.&lt;ref name="Shoal distribution"&gt;{{cite journal|author=SH O’Donoghue, L Drapeau, SFJ Dudley and VM Peddemors|title=The KwaZulu-Natal sardine run: shoal distribution in relation to nearshore environmental conditions, 1997–2007|journal=African Journal of Marine Science |year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=293–307|doi=10.2989/1814232X.2010.501587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Water temperature has an inverse and highly significant influence. This is consistent with the preferred temperature range of sardine.
*Sea currents have a significant effect, with calm current conditions most favourable for sardine presence and moderate current speeds from north to south most detrimental. As sardine movement during the run is northwards, this counter-current effect is expected.
Other conditions associated with sardine presence are:&lt;ref name="Shoal distribution"/&gt;
*Increasing atmospheric pressure: sardine presence appears to be higher during periods between the cold fronts along the KwaZulu-Natal coast. These periods have calm atmospheric conditions and slow nearshore currents.
*Large swells and low water clarity associated with cold fronts have a negative effect on sardine presence.
*Wind direction, wind speed, current direction, air temperature and rainfall all significantly affect sea surface temperature and consequently sardine presence. *Current and wind direction effects dominated, with north-easterly wind and currents from north to south resulting in cooler sea surface temperatures.
*North-easterly winds cause the surface water layer to move away from shore (Ekman veering), allowing the cool water to reach the surface, and south-westerly winds push warm Agulhas Current surface water towards the shore causing inshore temperatures to increase, which would negatively impact upon sardine presence.
*Increasing maximum air temperature, south-easterly (onshore) winds, wind speeds in excess of 6&amp;nbsp;m/s, and rainfall, all result in warmer sea surface temperatures.
*Strong south-easterly winds and rainfall are associated with the passage of frontal systems, which would push warm surface waters shoreward resulting in warmer sea surface temperatures.
*Frequent light north-westerly land breezes: When north-westerly land breezes are the strongest winds of the day they have a cooling effect on sea surface temperature. This cooling should be greatest in the vicinity of the surf zone where mixing is most effective. Sardine are often sighted close inshore during early mornings, suggesting that they could be attracted by cooler conditions found there.

====Summary: Oceanographic predictors of sardine presence====
Favourable:
*Decreasing sea surface temperature
*Calm current conditions
*Light north-westerly land breezes
*Stable atmospheric conditions.
Unfavourable:
*Increasing sea surface temperature
*Moderate north to south currents
*Large swells
*Turbid water
North-easterly and north-westerly winds and north to south currents have a cooling effect upon nearshore sea surface temperatures, but south-easterly winds and increasing air temperatures cause nearshore sea surface temperature warming.

Dolphins (estimated as being up to 18,000 in number, mostly the [[common dolphin]] (''Delphinus capensis'')) are largely responsible for rounding up the sardines into bait balls. These [[bait ball]]s can be 10–20 metres in diameter and extend to a depth of 10 metres. The bait balls are short lived and seldom last longer than 10 minutes. Once the sardines are rounded up, sharks (primarily the [[bronze whaler]]), and birds (like the [[Cape gannet]]), and [[Bryde's whale]]s take advantage of the opportunity. Other whale species, regardless of whether do or not join the run, may appear in the vicinity such as [[humpback whale|humpback]], [[southern right whale|southern right]], and [[minke whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Smith D..

===Predators as predictors of sardine presence===
The Cape gannet is the predator species most closely associated with sardine presence along the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal coastline and is the most useful indicator of sardine run activity.

Sharks and large gamefish presence is also strongly associated with sardine presence during the run, but as they are not as easily observed from the surface they are not as useful a predictor of sardine presence.

The presence of common dolphins inshore along the east coast during winter is significantly associated with sardine presence and common dolphin can be considered the third most useful species for predicting sardine presence.

The resident population of [[bottlenose dolphin]] does not appear to associate with the sardine run, whereas the migrant stock does. This may explain why the bottlenose dolphin is less likely to predict sardine presence.&lt;ref name="Shoal distribution"/&gt;

===Record of predators===
'''2005 records''':
In June and July 2005 the avian and mammal predators included Bryde’s whale (''[[Balaenoptera edeni]]''), African penguin (''[[Spheniscus demersus]]''), Cape cormorant (''[[Phalacrocorax capensis]]'') which were predominantly found in the cooler southern part of the region.
Peak sardine run activity occurred within 4&amp;nbsp;km of shore at the northward limit of a strip of cool water (&lt;21&amp;nbsp;°C) stretching along the East Coast. The principal predators at this stage were common dolphins (''Delphinus capensis'') and Cape gannets (''Morus capensis'').&lt;ref name="Predators bird and mammal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=SH O’Donoghue, PA Whittington, BM Dyer and VM Peddemors|title=Abundance and distribution of avian and marine mammal predators of sardine observed during the 2005 KwaZulu-Natal sardine run survey|journal=African Journal of Marine Science |year=2010|volume= 32|issue=2|pages= 361–374|doi=10.2989/1814232X.2010.502640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic importance==
[[File:Sardines Amanzimtoti 17-06-07 1056.JPG|thumb|Sardines caught off [[Amanzimtoti]], South Africa]]

===Tourism===
The recent interest in the sardine run has had significant impact on the local economy. International and domestic divers join local tour operators on sardine run diving expeditions. Such expeditions run from Eastern Cape towns, including [https://web.archive.org/web/20160706203947/http://bluewilderness.co.za/durban-shark-dives/sardine-run-south-africa/ East London], Port Saint Johns, and Port Elizabeth. The run has become important to tourism and is considered to be one of the main attractions in KwaZulu-Natal during the winter holiday period. Both local and international tourists are attracted to the spectacle and are provided with opportunities to participate in activities such as dive charters and boat based predator viewing tours.
The [[KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board]] and East Coast Radio, facilitate a ‘Sardine Run Hotline’, which provides information on the position and movement of sardine shoals. Information is also provided on the internet.&lt;ref name="Overview of sardine run" /&gt;

The Sardine Run Association (www.thesardinerunassociation.org) has been formed to provide a link between [https://web.archive.org/web/20160706203947/http://bluewilderness.co.za/durban-shark-dives/sardine-run-south-africa/ tour operator] s, tourists, non-governmental organisations,
scientists, and local and national governments.

===Fishery===
The sardine run also supports a small-scale, seasonal beach [[seine net|seine]] fishery.

==History==
The oldest known record of the run is a mention in the Natal Mercury newspaper of 4 August 1853.
More recently, the run has been the subject of natural history documentaries (e.g. the BBC’s [[Nature's Great Events#4. .22The Great Tide.22|Nature's Great Events]]) and printed popular media
(e.g. [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]).&lt;ref name="Overview of sardine run"&gt;{{cite journal|author=CD van der Lingen, JC Coetzee and L Hutchings |title=Overview of the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run |journal=African Journal of Marine Science |year=2010 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=271–277 |url=http://www.nisc.co.za/oneAbstract?absId=3715 |doi=10.2989/1814232X.2010.501581 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420094114/http://www.nisc.co.za/oneAbstract?absId=3715 |archivedate=2012-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 2011 run ===
Pilot shoals were netted at [[Hibberdene, KwaZulu-Natal|Hibberdene]] on 20 June 2011, while the main shoal was sighted near [[Port St. Johns, Eastern Cape|Port St. Johns]]. Small pockets of sardines were seen between [[Mfazazana]] and [[Margate, KwaZulu-Natal|Margate]]. About 25 crates of sardines were hauled out from the first netting at Hibberdene.&lt;ref name="Mercury21June"/&gt; A further 33 crates of sardines were netted, and were sold at R700 per crate or R30 per dozen sardines. The 58 crates were sold "within minutes".&lt;ref name="UpperCoastFeverJune24"&gt;Krishna, C. Upper Coast Fever: ''The sardines are finally here! Early arrivals netted on local beaches'', June 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt was also made to net sardines at [[Banana Beach]]. About 500 [[common dolphin]]s and numerous sharks were noted near Margate. [[Shark nets]] had been removed between [[Umgababa]] and [[Port Edward, KwaZulu-Natal|Port Edward]].&lt;ref name="Mercury21June"&gt;Padayachee, K. The Mercury: ''First Trickle of Sardines Netted'', June 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sardines were netted at [[Park Rynie, KwaZulu-Natal|Park Rynie]] on 21 June 2011. Some large nets of 200–300 baskets of sardines were taken. The baskets sold at R600 each. A large gathering of sardine predators was seen off [[Port Grosvenor]] on the [[Wild Coast Region, Eastern Cape|Wild Coast]]. Thousands of [[Cape gannet]]s and dolphins were seen in a continuous line of about 6&amp;nbsp;km between [[Brazen Head]] and just north of the [[Umtata River]]. It is suspected that this year's shoal is "massive", and will produce a "bumper run". Shark nets have been removed to the south of [[Durban]]. The first shoals were expected to reach [[Amanzimtoti]] on 23 June 2011.&lt;ref name="Mercury22June"&gt;Langa, L. The Mercury: [http://m.iol.co.za/article/view/s/11/a/73405 ''Bumper sardine run could be just around the corner''], June 22, 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425052324/http://m.iol.co.za/article/view/s/11/a/73405 |date=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main shoal was still near Port St Johns.&lt;ref name="DailyNewsJune22"&gt;Medley, L. Daily News: ''Sardines head for Amanzimtoti'', June 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2011, a "few" baskets were netted at Umgababa beach, and a "handful" of baskets were netted at [[Warner Beach]] in the afternoon. Sardines were also netted at [[Isipingo]], where 14 baskets were hauled out. The sardines therefore reached the Amanzimtoti area a day earlier than predicted.&lt;ref name="SunJune24"&gt;South Coast Sun: [http://www.looklocal.co.za/looklocal/content/en/amanzimtoti/amanzimtoti-news-general?oid=4494191&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=4197458&amp;Early-sardine--surprise-on-Upper-South-Coast ''Early sardine surprise on Upper South Coast''], June 24, 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130421234317/http://www.looklocal.co.za/looklocal/content/en/amanzimtoti/amanzimtoti-news-general?oid=4494191&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=4197458&amp;Early-sardine--surprise-on-Upper-South-Coast |date=April 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rough seas (with waves up to 4.7 m) caused by strong winds associated with a [[cold front]] kept the sardines from the shore on 23 June 2011. Pockets of sardines were seen far out to sea off the [[Bluff, KwaZulu-Natal|Bluff]]. The rough water and far distance of the sardines from shore made it impossible for the fish to be netted. No dolphin or bird activity was seen in the Durban area associated with the sardines. The main shoal was still suspected to be off the [[Eastern Cape]] coastline,&lt;ref name=DailyNewsJune23&gt;Daily News: ''Feeling Swell'', June 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; with a report of some sardines still seen near Port St Johns on 22 and 23 June 2011.&lt;ref name="Shane"&gt;Shane's Fishing Blog: [http://www.shanesfishing.co.za/sardine-run-2011/ ''Sardine Run 2011''], retrieved 24 June 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619024516/http://www.shanesfishing.co.za/sardine-run-2011/ |date=June 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durban beaches were the scene of most netting activity on 27 June 2011. "Hundreds of baskets" of sardines were hauled onto the beaches in 13 nets. The price per basket was R350 in the morning, but later in the afternoon the price had dropped to R120 per basket.&lt;ref name="MercuryJune28"&gt;The Mercury: ''Rich Bounty'', June 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Each net contained in excess of 300 baskets of sardines, with one net containing around 500 baskets.&lt;ref name="TheCitizen29June"&gt;The Citizen: ''Sardine run at fever pitch off South Coast'', 29 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Sardines were also netted at [[Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|Umhlanga]], [[Port Shepstone, KwaZulu-Natal|Port Shepstone]], Margate, Umgababa, and [[Port Edward, KwaZulu-Natal|Port Edward]]. Cape gannets and other seabirds were seen "plunging from considerable heights" to catch the sardines, especially on the South Coast.&lt;ref name="DailyNews27June"&gt;Daily News: ''Sardines all along the coastline'', June 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the sardines were netted along the Durban beaches as this was the area of calmest waters; swells along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline were around 2.5 m.&lt;ref name="DailyNewsJune28"&gt;Daily News: ''Swells drop and sardines are there!'', June 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Shark nets had been removed from [[Salt Rock, KwaZulu-Natal|Salt Rock]] to Port Edward, and bathers were requested to consult with lifeguards before entering the water.&lt;ref name="TheCitizen29June"/&gt; Meanwhile, a baby dolphin washed up on the beach at [[Scottburgh, KwaZulu-Natal|Scottburgh]], with a gash behind its "flipper" (the photo showed a gash between the dorsal fin and the tail) that exposed the spine. The "weeks old" dolphin was taken to a nearby paddling pool, but authorities later [[euthanasia|euthanased]] it due to the severity of the injuries.&lt;ref name="UpperCoastFeverJuly1"&gt;Upper Coast Fever: ''Little Lost Stranger'', July 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation was that the dolphin had been injured by a shark, or by a boat propeller; possibly related to the sardine run.

[[Swell (ocean)|Swells]] dropped to 1–1.5 m on 28 June 2011, allowing more netting of sardines. Sardines were netted at Amanzimtoti; on the main beach and at [[Chain Rocks, Amanzimtoti|Chain Rocks]].&lt;ref name="DailyNewsJune28"/&gt; A 22-year-old American marine biology student (research diver) named Paulo Edward Stanchi was attacked by a large [[dusky shark]] while diving at [[Aliwal Shoal|Aliwal Shoal Marine Protected Area]]. The group of divers had encountered a pocket of sardines when a 3&amp;nbsp;m long dusky shark bit Mr Stanchi on his left leg and hands. Mr Stanchi managed to free himself from the shark, and was treated on the diving boat before being transported to [[Rocky Bay, KwaZulu-Natal|Rocky Bay]], where medics stabilised him. He was then airlifted to [[Nkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital]], where he underwent surgery. Dusky sharks generally live offshore, but come closer to the shore during the sardine run. The annual sardine run allowed more dusky sharks in the Aliwal Shoal MPA than usual, but there was no reason for them to show any more interest in divers than usual. Mr Stanchi had been wearing split fins with black and grey stripes, and this may have looked like a small shoal of fish to the shark.&lt;ref name=SouthCoastSunJuly1&gt;South Coast Sun: ''Shark attacks diver off Aliwal Shoal'', July 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheCitizen30June"&gt;Sampson, B. The Citizen: ''Family to visit US shark Attack victim'', 30 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a woman in her 40s broke her leg in the frenzy at Amanzimtoti when the sardines were netted. The woman is believed to have been trying to get some of the sardines when she "stepped wrong" and fractured her leg. Paramedics stabilized her before transporting her to hospital.&lt;ref name="SouthCoastSunJuly1p3"&gt;South Coast Sun: Sardine frenzy sees woman break her leg'', July 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

5 July 2011 was a "quiet day" for the sardine run. "Plenty of birds" were seen diving at Karridene close to the shore. 50 crates of sardines were taken at Umgababa in the early afternoon, while a net of sardines pulled in at Karridene contained some [[Lichia amia|Garrick]]. More Garrick were caught by fishermen at Karridene, but in general there was little other [[game fish]] activity. There was reported to be a "massive shoal" of sardines off [[Coffee Bay]] in the Eastern Cape.&lt;ref name="DailyNewsJuly6"&gt;Daily News: ''Quiet Day disappoints anglers, but main shoal on its way'', July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 2011, 100 baskets were netted at [[Pennington, KwaZulu-Natal|Pennington]]. It was difficult to predict the sardines' movements as they were staying offshore.&lt;ref name="Independent16July"&gt;Waterworth, T. The Independent on Saturday: ''Fishing Tragedy Averted'', 16 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2011, 300 baskets of sardines were netted at Pennington in the morning. There were lots of gannets off [[Ballito, KwaZulu-Natal|Ballito]], and "quite a bit of fish" between Park Rynie and Mtwalume.&lt;ref name="DailyNewsJuly20"&gt;Medley, L. Daily News: ''Sardine surges almost at an end'', July 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong [[cold front]] hit South Africa towards the end of July, causing land surface temperatures to drop below 10&amp;nbsp;°C over much of the country.&lt;ref name="IOL"&gt;IOL News: ''Cold front hits SA'': http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/cold-front-hits-sa-1.1108277, retrieved 23 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy [[snow]] falls were experienced in high lying areas, including [[Nottingham Road]], [[Mooi River (town)|Mooi River]] and [[Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal|Newcastle]] in the Midlands, while [[Van Reenen’s Pass]] was snowed in.&lt;ref name="TheRidge"&gt;The Ridge Online: [http://theridgeonline.co.za/cold-front-hits-durban/ ''Cold front hits Durban''], retrieved 23 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The cold front caused swells of up to 4 meters on the KwaZulu-Natal coast and a 25 to 30 knot wind with rough sea conditions.&lt;ref name="GeorgeHerald"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgeherald.com/news/News/National/9445/NSRI-on-standby-throughout-the-night-for-ship-run-aground--Ballito |title=NSRI on stand-by throughout the night for ship run aground – Ballito |accessdate=2017-10-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217164710/http://www.georgeherald.com/news/News/National/9445/NSRI-on-standby-throughout-the-night-for-ship-run-aground--Ballito |archivedate=2017-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ship called the [[Phoenix (Ship)|Phoenix]] ran aground at Salt Rock, Ballito on 26 July 2011 because of the rough conditions.&lt;ref name="GeorgeHerald"/&gt; This cold front may have put an end to the 2011 Sardine Run.

'''Subsurface Utility Engineering''' (SUE) refers to a branch of [[engineering]] that involves managing certain risks associated with utility mapping at appropriate quality levels, utility coordination, utility relocation design and coordination, utility condition assessment, communication of utility data to concerned parties, utility relocation cost estimates, implementation of utility accommodation policies, and utility design.&lt;ref&gt;[Standard Guideline for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data, CI/ASCE 38-02, American Society of Civil Engineers, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The SUE process begins with a work plan that outlines the scope of work, project schedule, levels of service vs. risk allocation and desired delivery method. Non-destructive surface [[geophysical]] methods are then leveraged to determine the presence of subsurface utilities and to mark their horizontal position on the ground surface. [[Vacuum excavation]] techniques are employed to expose and record the precise horizontal and vertical position of the assets. This information is then typically presented in [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] format or a [[GIS]]-compatible map. A conflict matrix is also created to evaluate and compare collected utility information with project plans, identify conflicts and propose solutions. The concept of SUE is gaining popularity worldwide as a framework to mitigate costs associated with project redesign and construction delays and to avoid risk and liability that can result from damaged underground utilities.

== History ==

The practice of collecting, recording and managing subsurface data has historically been widely unregulated. In response to this challenge, in 2003, The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) developed standard 38-02: Guideline for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data, which defined the practice of SUE. Many countries followed the U.S. lead by creating similar standards including Malaysia, Canada, Australia, Great Britain and most recently, Ecuador. Developed and refined over the last 20 years, SUE classifies information according to quality levels with an objective to vastly improve data reliability. This provides project owners and engineers with a benchmark to determine the integrity of utility data at the outset of an infrastructure project.

== Standards that Govern SUE ==

A number of standards for care have been developed to maintain the use of SUE.

=== ASCE Standard 38-02 ===

In 2003, the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) published Standard 38-02 titled [http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?ID=2147487569&amp;ProductID=181370041 Standard Guideline for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data]. The standard defined SUE and set guidance for the collection and depiction of subsurface utility information. The ASCE standard presents a system to classify the quality of existing subsurface utility data, in accordance with four quality levels:
* Quality Level D. QL-D is the most basic level of information for utility locations. It comes from existing utility records or verbal recollections. QL-D is useful primarily for project planning and route selection activities.
* Quality Level C. QL-C involves surveying visible above ground utility facilities (e.g., manholes, valve boxes, etc.) and correlating this information with existing utility records (QL-D information).
* Quality Level B. QL-B involves the application of appropriate surface geophysical methods to determine the existence and horizontal position of virtually all subsurface utilities within a project’s limits.
* Quality Level A. QL-A, also known as "daylighting", is the highest level of accuracy presently available. It provides information for the precise plan and profile mapping of underground utilities through the actual exposure of underground utilities (usually at a specific point), and also provides the type, size, condition, material and other characteristics of underground features. Exposure is typically achieved through hand digging or Hydro-Vacuuming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/sueindex.cfm Leuderalbert, Ken. “Subsurface Utility Engineering (SUE),” (http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/sueindex.cfm), U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highways, Utilities, April 07, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia Standard Guideline for Underground Utility Mapping ===

The Standard Guideline for Underground Utility Mapping in Malaysia was launched in 2006 to create, populate and maintain the national underground utility database.
This standard addresses issues such as roles of stakeholders and how utility information can be obtained, and was a call to action from the Malaysian government due to increasing demands for improvements on basic infrastructure facilities including utilities.
The Standard is similar to ASCE 38-02, using quality levels D-A as its basis. Although it does not classify utility definition, colours or symbols, the Malaysian standard does specify an accuracy ±10&amp;nbsp;cm for both horizontal and vertical readings. The Standard is supported by the Malaysian government but is not backed by an Association or governing body.&lt;ref name="t2ue"&gt;[http://www.t2ue.com/downloads/Nov2012_CES_SUE.pdf Zembillas, Nick. “The Development of Subsurface Utility Engineering Standards,” Global Ambitions, Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors, September, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CSA Standard S250 ===

In 2011, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) released [http://www.digsafe.ca/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=0606roJFQ88%3D&amp;tabid=66 Standard S250 Mapping of Underground Utility Infrastructure]. The Standard is described as a collective framework for best practices to map, depict and manage records across Canada.&lt;ref name="t2ue" /&gt;
CSA S250 compliments and extends ASCE Standard 38-02 by setting out requirements for generating, storing, distributing, and using mapping records to ensure that underground utilities are readily identifiable and locatable. Accuracy levels expand upon ASCE 38-02 Quality Level A, prescribing a finer level of detail to define the positional location of the infrastructure.

=== Standards Australia Committee AS 5488-2013 ===

In June, 2013, the Standards Australia Committee IT-036 on Subsurface Utility Engineering Information launched Standard 5488-2013 Classification of Subsurface Utility Information to provide utility owners, operators and locators with a framework for the consistent classification of information concerning subsurface utilities. The standard also provides guidance on how subsurface utility information can be obtained and conveyed to users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/news/new-australian-standard-underground-utilities Davy, Nicholas. “New Australian Standard for underground utilities,” Engineers Australia, June, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British Standards Institute PAS 128 ===

An industry consultation event in January 2012 kicked off the development of a British SUE standard. The first technical draft was reviewed by the committee in December 2012 and it was released for public/general industry review in March 2013. PAS 128 applies to the detection, verification and location of active, abandoned, redundant or unknown underground utilities and associated surface features that facilitate the location and identification of underground utility infrastructure. It sets out the accuracy to which the data is captured for specific purposes, the quality expected of that data and a means by which to assess and indicate the confidence that can be placed in the data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ice.org.uk/News-Public-Affairs/ICE-News/Draft-PAS-128-on-underground-utility-detection “Draft PAS 128 on underground utility detection, verification and location – call for feedback,” Institution of Civil Engineers, July 1, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecuadorian Institute for Standardization NTE INEN 2873 ===
In March, 2015 the Ecuadorian Institute for Standardization ([http://www.normalizacion.gob.ec/ INEN]) have published the [http://www.normalizacion.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2015/2015/ACO/28042015/nte_inen_2873.pdf Standard NTE INEN 2873 for the Detection and Mapping of Utilities and Underground Infrastructure]. This Standard establishes procedures for the mapping of utilities for the purposes of reducing the uncertainties created by existing underground utilities. Its systematic use can provide both a means for continual improvement in the reliability, accuracy, and precision of future utility records; and immediate value during project development. It combines two basic concepts. The first concept is the means of classifying the reliability of the existence and location of utilities already installed and hidden in the ground. It is used during project development and is a major component of '''Subsurface Utility Engineering''' (SUE). The second concept is how to specify the recording of utilities exposed during their installation or during maintenance/repair operations so that future records are reliable. It is used primarily during utility installation. It is fundamentally a traditional survey and documentation function. Combining these concepts will lead to a continual reduction in the risks created by underground utilities during future projects involving excavation of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normalizacion.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2015/2015/ACO/28042015/nte_inen_2873.pdf SUBSURFACE UTILITY ENGINEERING. DETECTION AND MAPPING OF UTILITIES AND UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE, NTE INEN 2873, Servicio Ecuatoriano de Normalización, Quito-Ecuador, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of SUE ==

SUE is mainly used at the design stage of a capital works project and when information is being collected for asset management purposes. In both situations, a similar process is followed but the scope of the work and presentation of the information may vary.
When a SUE investigation is carried out for a capital works project prior to construction, the objective is generally to collect accurate utility information within the project area to avoid conflict at later stages of the project.

For initiatives involving asset management, project owners may be missing information about their underground utilities or have inaccurate data. In this situation a SUE provider would collect the required information and add it to the asset management database, according to the four quality levels prescribed by ASCE Standard 38-02.

'''Typesetting''' is the composition of [[Written language|text]] by means of arranging physical [[Sort (typesetting)|types]]&lt;ref name="typesetting random house dictionary definition"&gt;Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 23 December 2009. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/typeset Dictionary.reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called [[sort (typesetting)|sorts]] in mechanical systems and [[glyphs]] in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered according to a language's [[orthography]] for visual display. Typesetting requires one or more [[font]]s (which are widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for [[typeface]]s). One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily, making it difficult for copiers who have not gained permission.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A., ''The Library: An Illustrated History'', ALA edition, Skyhorse, 2009, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-digital era==

===Manual typesetting===
{{Main|Movable type}}
During much of the [[Letterpress printing|letterpress era]], movable type was composed by hand for each [[page (paper)|page]]. Cast metal ''[[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]]'' were composed into words, then lines, then paragraphs, then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a ''form'', with all letter faces exactly the same "height to paper", creating an even surface of type. The form was placed in a press, inked, and an impression made on paper.

During typesetting, individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand, and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right, and as viewed by the setter upside down. As seen in the photo of the composing stick, a lower case 'q' looks like a 'd', a lower case 'b' looks like a 'p', a lower case 'p' looks like a 'b' and a lower case 'd' looks like a 'q'. This is reputed to be the origin of the expression "mind your p's and q's". It might just as easily have been "mind your b's and d's".

The diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort: '''a''' face, '''b''' body or shank, '''c''' point size, '''1''' shoulder, '''2''' nick, '''3''' groove, '''4''' foot. Wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type. Not shown, and more the concern of the casterman, is the “set”, or width of each sort. Set width, like body size, is measured in points.

In order to extend the working life of type, and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type, copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text, freeing the costly type for other work. This was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press. In this process, called [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotyping]], the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as [[plaster of Paris]] or [[papier mâché]] called a [[flong]] to create a positive, from which the stereotype form was electrotyped, cast of [[type metal]].

Advances such as the [[typewriter]] and [[computer]] would push the state of the art even farther ahead. Still, hand composition and [[letterpress]] printing have not fallen completely out of use, and since the introduction of digital typesetting, it has seen a revival as an [[artisanal]] pursuit. However, it is a very small niche within the larger typesetting market.

===Hot metal typesetting===
{{main|Hot metal typesetting}}
The time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the 19th century to produce mechanical typesetting. While some, such as the [[Paige compositor]], met with limited success, by the end of the 19th century, several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text. Most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used, hence are termed "hot metal" typesetting. The [[Linotype machine]], invented in 1884, used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices, and cast an entire line of type at a time (hence its name). In the [[Monotype System]], a keyboard was used to [[Punched tape|punch a paper tape]], which was then fed to control a casting machine. The [[Ludlow Typograph]] involved hand-set matrices, but otherwise used hot metal. By the early 20th century, the various systems were nearly universal in large newspapers and publishing houses.

===Phototypesetting===
{{Main|Phototypesetting}}
[[Image:Linotype CRTronic 360.jpg|thumb|200px|Linotype CRTronic 360 phototypesetting terminal]]
[[Phototypesetting|Phototypesetting or "cold type"]] systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines. These devices consisted of glass or film disks or strips (one per font) that spun in front of a light source to selectively expose characters onto light-sensitive paper. Originally they were driven by pre-punched paper tapes. Later they were connected to computer front ends.

One of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display. To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time. If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a [[punched tape|punched paper tape]] corresponding to the text. With the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative [[film]]. Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film, resulting in a column of black type on white paper, or a [[Galley proof|galley]].  The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or [[paste up]] of a whole page.  A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make [[Printing plate|plate]]s for [[offset printing]].

==Digital era==

The next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a [[cathode ray tube]]. Typical of the type were the Alphanumeric APS2 (1963),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6a2tSuOoq8C&amp;pg=PA351 Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology], 1976&lt;/ref&gt; IBM 2680 (1967), [[Information International, Inc.|I.I.I.]] VideoComp (1973?), Autologic APS5 (1975),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6a2tSuOoq8C&amp;pg=PA352 Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; and Linotron 202 (1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linotype.com/en/49-14026/19731989.html Linotype History]&lt;/ref&gt; These machines were the mainstay of phototypesetting for much of the 1970s and 1980s. Such machines could be "driven online" by a computer front-end system or took their data from magnetic tape. Type fonts were stored digitally on conventional magnetic disk drives.

&lt;/ref&gt; Character-by-character, computer-aided [[phototypesetting]] was, in turn, rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a [[raster image processor]] to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] an entire page to a single high-resolution [[digital image]], now known as imagesetting.

The first commercially successful laser imagesetter, able to make use of a raster image processor was the Monotype Lasercomp. ECRM, [[Compugraphic]] (later purchased by [[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa]]) and others rapidly followed suit with machines of their own.

Early [[minicomputer]]-based typesetting software introduced in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as [[Datalogics]] Pager, Penta, [[Atex (software)|Atex]], Miles 33, Xyvision, troff from [[Bell Labs]], and IBM's [[IBM SCRIPT|Script]] product with CRT terminals, were better able to drive these electromechanical devices, and used text [[markup language]]s to describe [[typeface|type]] and other page formatting information. The descendants of these text markup languages include [[SGML]], [[XML]] and [[HTML]].

The minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste-up and eventually produced entire pages and [[signature]]s of 4, 8, 16 or more pages using [[imposition]] software on devices such as the Israeli-made [[Scitex]] Dolev. The data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters, often proprietary or specific to a manufacturer or device, drove development of generalized printer control languages, such as [[Adobe Systems]]' [[PostScript]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[Printer Command Language|PCL]].

[[Image:Oscar wilde english renaissance of art 2.png|thumb|right|200px|Text sample (an extract of the essay ''The Renaissance of English Art'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]) typeset in [[Iowan Old Style]] roman, italics and small caps, adjusted to approximately 10 [[Line length|words per line]], with the typeface sized at 14 [[point (typography)|points]] on 1.4 x [[leading]], with 0.2 points extra [[tracking (typography)|tracking]].]]

Computerized typesetting was so rare that ''[[BYTE]]'' (comparing itself to "the proverbial shoemaker's children who went barefoot") did not use any computers in production until its August 1979 issue used a Compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout. The magazine did not yet accept articles on floppy disks, but hoped to do so "as matters progress".&lt;ref name="helmers197908"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Helmers |first=Carl |date=August 1979 |title=Notes on the Appearance of BYTE... |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1979-08/1979_08_BYTE_04-08_LISP#page/n157/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1980s, practically all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was performed by specialist typesetting companies. These companies performed keyboarding, editing and production of paper or film output, and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry. In the United States, these companies were located in rural Pennsylvania, New England or the Midwest, where labor was cheap and paper was produced nearby, but still within a few hours' travel time of the major publishing centers.

In 1985, [[desktop publishing]] became available, starting with the [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] (and later [[QuarkXPress]]) and [[PostScript]]. Improvements in software and hardware, and rapidly lowering costs, popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results much less expensively than the minicomputer dedicated systems. At the same time, word processing systems, such as [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] and [[WordPerfect]], revolutionized office documents. They did not, however, have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complicated book layout, graphics, mathematics, or advanced hyphenation and justification rules (''H and J'').

By the year 2000, this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in-house computers. Many found the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to outsource to freelancers and graphic design specialists.

The availability of cheap or free [[font]]s made the conversion to do-it-yourself easier, but also opened up a gap between skilled designers and amateurs. The advent of [[PostScript]], supplemented by the [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file format, provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts, readable on major computers and operating systems.

===SCRIPT variants===
{{Main|SCRIPT (markup)}}
[[Image:John A Prior Health Sciences Library Mural Typesetter.jpg|thumb|Mural mosaic "Typesetter" at John A. Prior Health Sciences Library in Ohio]]
IBM created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word "SCRIPT". Later versions of SCRIPT included advanced features, such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index, [[Column (typography)|multicolumn]] page layout, footnotes, boxes, automatic hyphenation and spelling verification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.utk.edu/~mnewman/ibmguide07.html U01-0547, "Introduction to SCRIPT,"] is available through PRTDOC.&lt;/ref&gt;

NSCRIPT was a port of SCRIPT to OS and TSO from CP-67/CMS SCRIPT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/sdtp/watscr.html SCRIPT 90.1 Implementation Guide], June 6, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterloo Script was created at the University of Waterloo later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/sdtp/watscr.html CSG.uwaterloo.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; One version of SCRIPT was created at MIT and the AA/CS at UW took over project development in 1974. The program was first used at UW in 1975. In the 1970s, SCRIPT was the only practical way to word process and format documents using a computer. By the late 1980s, the SCRIPT system had been extended to incorporate various upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/40th/Chronology/1974.shtml A Chronology of Computing at The University of Waterloo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial implementation of SCRIPT at UW was documented in the May 1975 issue of the Computing Centre Newsletter, which noted some the advantages of using SCRIPT:

a) It easily handles footnotes.

b) Page numbers can be in Arabic or Roman numerals, and can appear at the top or bottom of the page, in the centre, on the left or on the right, or on the left for even-numbered pages and on the right for odd-numbered pages.

c) Underscoring or overstriking can be made a function of SCRIPT, thus uncomplicating editor functions.

d) SCRIPT files are regular OS datasets or CMS files.

e) Output can be obtained on the printer, or at the terminal…" 
The article also pointed out SCRIPT had over 100 commands to assist in formatting documents, though 8 to 10 of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs.  Thus, SCRIPT had many of the capabilities computer users generally associate with contemporary word processors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/40th/Chronology/ChronologyGlossary.pdf Glossary of University of Waterloo Computing Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SCRIPT/VS]] was a SCRIPT variant developed at IBM in the 1980s.

DWScript is a version of SCRIPT for MS-DOS, called after its author, D. D. Williams,&lt;ref&gt;DWScript – Document Composition Facility for the IBM Personal Computer Version 4.6 Updates, DW-04167, Nov 8th, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; but was never released to the public and only used internally by IBM.

Script is still available from IBM as part of the [[Document Composition Facility]] for the [[z/OS]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/printsoftware/dcfhome_z_ww.html IBM Document Composition Facility (DCF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===SGML and XML systems===
The standard generalized markup language ([[SGML]]) was based upon IBM [[Generalized Markup Language]] (GML). GML was a set of macros on top of IBM Script. [[Document Style Semantics and Specification Language|DSSSL]] is an international standard developed to provide a stylesheets for SGML documents.

[[XML]] is a successor of SGML. [[XSL Formatting Objects|XSL-FO]] is most often used to generate PDF files from XML files.

The arrival of [[SGML]]/[[XML]] as the document model made other typesetting engines popular.

Such engines include Datalogics Pager, Penta, Miles 33's OASYS, Xyvision's [[XML Professional Publisher (XPP)]], [[FrameMaker]], [[Arbortext]]. XSL-FO compatible engines include [[Apache FOP]], [[Antenna House Formatter]], [[RenderX]]'s [[XEP (software)|XEP]].
These products allow users to program their SGML/XML typesetting process with the help of scripting languages.

YesLogic's [[Prince XML|Prince]] is another one, which is based on CSS Paged Media.

===Troff and successors===
{{Main|Troff}}
During the mid-1970s, [[Joseph Ossanna]], working at [[Bell Laboratories]], wrote the troff typesetting program to drive a Wang C/A/T [[phototypesetter]] owned by the Labs; it was later enhanced by [[Brian Kernighan]] to support output to different equipment, such as [[laser printer]]s. While its use has fallen off, it is still included with a number of [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and has been used to typeset a number of high-profile technical and computer books. Some versions, as well as a [[GNU]] work-alike called [[groff (software)|groff]], are now [[open source]].

===TeX and LaTeX===
[[Image:AMS Euler sample.png|right|200px|thumb|Mathematical text typeset using TeX and the AMS [[Euler font]].]]
{{Main|TeX}}
The [[TeX]] system, developed by [[Donald E. Knuth]] at the end of the 1970s, is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system that has set high standards, especially for typesetting mathematics. [[LuaTeX]] and LuaLaTeX are variants of [[TeX]] and of [[LaTeX]] scriptable in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].  TeX is considered fairly difficult to learn on its own, and deals more with appearance than structure. The [[LaTeX]] macro package written by [[Leslie Lamport]] at the beginning of the 1980s offered a simpler interface, and an easier way to systematically encode the structure of a document. LaTeX markup is very widely used in academic circles for published papers and even books. Although standard TeX does not provide an interface of any sort, there are programs that do. These programs include [[Scientific Workplace]], [[Texmacs|TeXmacs]], [[MiKTeX]] and [[LyX]], which are graphical/interactive editors.

==Other text formatters==
Several other text formatting software exist, but are not widely used. Notably  [[Lout (software)|Lout]], [http://patoline.org/ Patoline], [http://sile-typesetter.org Sile], [https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/ Pollen], [http://mirror.hmc.edu/ctan/systems/ant/ Ant]

By the end of 2009, [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis of [[DNA sequence]]s had revealed the [[Phylogenetic tree|relationships]] of most of these [[Taxon|taxa]], and all but three of them had been placed in some [[Clade|group]] within the angiosperms. In October 2009, APG II was superseded by the [[APG III system]].&lt;ref name="apgiii"&gt;Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (2009). [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122630309/abstract An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III]. ''Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''161'''(2): 105-121.&lt;/ref&gt; In APG III, 11 of the genera listed above were placed in families, or else became families whose position within their orders was approximately or exactly known. The family Rafflesiaceae was placed in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Malpighiales]], close to [[Euphorbiaceae]] and possibly within it. ''Mitrastema'' became a [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] family, Mitrastemonaceae. This family and Balanophoraceae were placed ''incertae sedis'' into orders, that is, their positions within these orders remained completely unknown. ''Metteniusa'' was found to belong to a [[Taxonomic rank|supraordinal]] group known as the [[lamiids]], which has not been satisfactorily divided into orders. ''Cynomorium'' was raised to familial status as Cynomoriaceae, and along with Apodanthaceae and ''Gumillea'', remained unplaced in APG III. Five taxa were unplaced among the angiosperms in APG III because ''[[Nicobariodendron]]'' and ''[[Petenaea]]'' were added to the list.

==''Leptaulus''==
There is no apparent reason for the inclusion of ''Leptaulus'' in the list of unplaced taxa, other than the time lag between submission and publication. In 2001, in a phylogenetic [[Research|study]] based on [[Plant morphology|morphological]] and [[DNA]] data, ''Leptaulus'' was found to belong to a group of six genera that most authors now consider to be the family [[Cardiopteridaceae]].&lt;ref name="karehed2001"&gt;Jesper Kårehed. 2001. "Multiple origin of the tropical forest tree family Icacinaceae". ''American Journal of Botany'' '''88'''(12):2259-2274.&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed in a study of [[wood]] [[Plant anatomy|anatomy]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="lens2008"&gt;Frederick Lens, Jesper Kårehed, Pieter Baas, Steven Jansen, David Rabaey, Suzy Huysmans, Thomas Hamann, and Eric Smets. 2008. "The wood anatomy of the polyphyletic Icacinaceae s.l. and their relationships within asterids". ''Taxon'' '''57'''(2):525-552.&lt;/ref&gt; The genus is placed in the Cardiopteridaceae in the [[APG III system]] of 2009.&lt;ref name=apgii/&gt; Before 2001, ''Leptaulus'' and the rest of Cardiopteridaceae had usually been placed in a broadly [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribed]] [[Icacinaceae]], which turned out to be [[polyphyletic]].

Some botanists do not recognize Cardiopteridaceae as a family of six genera. Instead, they [[Segregate (taxonomy)|segregate]] ''[[Cardiopteris]]'' into a [[Monotypic taxon|monogeneric]] Cardiopteridaceae [[sensu stricto]] and place the other five genera in the family Leptaulaceae.&lt;ref name="utteridgeleptaulaceae"&gt;Timothy M.A. Utteridge and Richard K. Brummitt. 2007. "Leptaulaceae" pages 191-192. In: Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. ''Flowering Plant Families of the World''. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[monophyly]] of Leptaulaceae has never been tested with molecular data.

==''Pottingeria''==
{{main|Pottingeria}}
It had long been thought, at least by some, that the small [[Southeast Asia]]n tree ''Pottingeria'' might belong in the order [[Celastrales]].&lt;ref name="airy-shaw1973"&gt;Herbert K. Airy-Shaw, David F. Cutler, and Siwert Nilsson. 1973. "''Pottingeria'', its taxonomic position, anatomy, and palynology". ''Kew Bulletin'' '''28'''(1):97-104.&lt;/ref&gt; In a phylogenetic study of that order in 2006, ''Pottingeria'' was found to be a member of the order, but not of any of its families. It was in an unresolved [[Polytomy|pentatomy]] consisting of [[Parnassiaceae]], ''[[Pottingeria]]'', ''[[Mortonia (plant)|Mortonia]]'', the pair (''[[Quetzalia]]'' + ''[[Zinowiewia]]''), and the other genera of [[Celastraceae]].&lt;ref name="zhang2006"&gt;{{citation | author = Li-Bing Zhang and Mark P.

==''Dipentodon''==
''Dipentodon'' has one species ''Dipentodon sinicus''.&lt;ref name="ma2008"&gt;Jinshuang Ma and Bruce Bartholomew. 2008. "Dipentodontaceae" pages 494-495. In: Zhengyi Wu, Peter H.

(2007). {{ISBN|978-1-55407-206-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, in a molecular phylogenetic study of the order [[Huerteales]], it was shown that ''[[Dipentodon]]'' and ''[[Perrottetia]]'' belong together as the two genera of the family [[Dipentodontaceae]].&lt;ref name="worberg2009"&gt;Andreas Worberg, Mac H. Alford, Dietmar Quandt, and Thomas Borsch. 2009. "Huerteales sister to Brassicales plus Malvales, and newly circumscribed to include ''Dipentodon, Gerrardina, Huertea, Perrottetia,'' and ''Tapiscia''". ''Taxon'' '''58'''(2):468-478.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Medusandra'' and ''Soyauxia''==
In 2009, in a molecular phylogenetic study of [[Malpighiales]], Kenneth Wurdack and Charles Davis sampled five genera and one family that had been unplaced in APG II. They placed some of these for the first time and confirmed the previous placement of others with strong [[Resampling (statistics)|statistical support]].&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"&gt;{{citation|author=Kenneth J. Wurdack and Charles C. Davis|year=2009|title=Malpighiales phylogenetics: Gaining ground on one of the most recalcitrant clades in the angiosperm tree of life|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=96|issue=8|pages=1551–1570| doi = 10.3732/ajb.0800207|pmid=21628300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]], they included four genera from [[Saxifragales]]. These were ''[[Daphniphyllum]], [[Medusandra]], [[Soyauxia]]'', and ''[[Peridiscus]]''. In their phylogeny, ''Medusandra'' and ''Soyauxia'' formed a strongly supported [[clade]] with ''Peridiscus'', a member of the family [[Peridiscaceae]], the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] clade in Saxifragales. Wurdack and Davis recommended that ''Medusandra'' and ''Soyauxia'' both be transferred to Peridiscaceae. Thus the monogeneric family Medusandraceae is subsumed into Peridiscaceae. ''Soyauxia'' had been found to be close to ''Peridiscus'' in another study two years before.&lt;ref name="soltis2007"&gt;Douglas E. Soltis, Joshua W. Clayton, Charles C. Davis, Matthew A. Gitzendanner, Martin Cheek, Vincent Savolainen, André M. Amorim, and Pamela S. Soltis. 2007. "Monophyly and relationships of the enigmatic family Peridiscaceae". ''Taxon'' '''56'''(1):65-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Wurdack and Davis also found that the family Rafflesiaceae and the genera ''[[Aneulophus]]'', ''[[Centroplacus]]'', and ''[[Trichostephanus]]'' belong in the order Malpighiales.&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"/&gt;

==''Aneulophus''==
''Aneulophus'' consists of two species of [[woody plant]]s from [[tropical]] [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="mabberley2008"&gt;David J. Mabberley. 2008. ''Mabberley's Plant-Book'' third edition (2008). Cambridge University Press: UK. {{ISBN|978-0-521-82071-4}} (see ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; Wurdack and Davis found the traditional placement of ''Aneulophus'' in [[Erythroxylaceae]] to be correct.&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"/&gt; Its position within the family remains uncertain.

Erythroxylaceae is a family of four genera. ''[[Erythroxylum]]'' has about 230 species. ''[[Nectaropetalum]]'' has eight species and ''[[Pinacopodium]]'' has two. No one has yet produced a molecular phylogeny of the family.

==''Centroplacus''==
''Centroplacus'' has a single species, ''Centroplacus glaucinus'', a tree from West Africa. It was found to be close to ''[[Bhesa]]'', a genus that had only recently been removed from Celastrales.&lt;ref name="zhang2006"/&gt; ''Bhesa'' was grouped with ''Centroplacus'' to become the second genus in Centroplacaceae.&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"/&gt; ''Bhesa'' consists of five species of trees from [[India]] and [[Malesia]].

==''Trichostephanus''==
''Trichostephanus'' has two species, both in tropical West Africa. It had usually been assigned to [[Achariaceae]], but it was found to be deeply embedded in [[Samydaceae]].&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alford2007"&gt;Mac H. Alford. 2007. [http://www.tolweb.org/Samydaceae/68361 Samydaceae]. Version 6 February 2007. At [http://www.tolweb.org The Tree of Life Project].&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] do not recognize Samydaceae as a separate family from [[Salicaceae]].

==Rafflesiaceae==
{{see also|Rafflesiaceae}}
Several genera have been removed from Rafflesiaceae, so that it now consists of only three genera: ''[[Sapria]]'', ''[[Rhizanthes]]'', and ''[[Rafflesia]]''. All of these are [[Parasitic plant|holoparasites]] and, as discussed below, finding their relationships by molecular phylogenetics has presented special challenges. ''Rafflesia'' and its relatives were the subject of several papers from 2004 to 2009, and as the world's largest flower, ''Rafflesia'' has attracted special interest. In 2009, Wurdack and Davis confirmed earlier work in which it was found that Rafflesiaceae is nested within [[Euphorbiaceae]] [[sensu stricto]], a circumscription of Euphorbiaceae that excludes [[Phyllanthaceae]], [[Picrodendraceae]], [[Putranjivaceae]], [[Pandaceae]], and a few other very small groups that had been included in it until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="davis2007"&gt;Charles C. Davis, Maribeth Latvis, Daniel L. Nickrent, Kenneth J. Wurdack, and David A. Baum. 2007. "Floral Gigantism in Rafflesiaceae". ''Science'' '''315'''(5820):1812.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preserve Rafflesiaceae, Wurdack and Davis split Euphorbiaceae sensu stricto into Euphorbiaceae [[sensu strictissimo]] and [[Peraceae]], a new family comprising [[Pera (genus)|''Pera'']] and four other genera.&lt;ref name="wurdack2009"/&gt;

==Parasites==
Four of the unplaced genera, and all three of the unplaced families of APG II consist of [[Chlorophyll|achlorophyllous]] [[Parasitic plant|holoparasites]]. In these, the [[chloroplast]] [[gene]]s that are usually used in phylogenetic studies of angiosperms have become nonfunctional [[pseudogene]]s. If these [[Mutation rate|evolve rapidly]], they may be saturated with repeated [[mutation]]s at the same site and consequently not be useful for phylogenetic reconstruction.

The relationships of some parasitic taxa have been elucidated in studies of [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial]] DNA sequences. But these sequences sometimes produce [[Artifact (error)|artifactual]] [[topologies]] in the [[phylogenetic tree]], because [[horizontal gene transfer]] often occurs between parasites and their [[Host (biology)|hosts]].&lt;ref name="nickrent2004"&gt;Daniel L. Nickrent, Albert Blarer, Yin-Long Qiu, Romina Vidal-Russell, and Frank E. Anderson. 2004. "Phylogenetic inference in Rafflesiales: the influence of rate heterogeneity and horizontal gene transfer". ''BMC Evolutionary Biology'' '''4''':40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Bdallophyton'' and ''Cytinus''==
{{main|Cytinaceae}}
The parasitic genera ''Bdallophyton'' and ''Cytinus'' have been found to be closely related and have been placed together as the family [[Cytinaceae]]. On the basis of mitochondrial DNA, Cytinaceae has been placed in [[Malvales]], as [[Cladistics#Subtrees are clades|sister]] to [[Muntingiaceae]].&lt;ref name="nickrent2007"&gt;Daniel L. Nickrent. 2007. "Cytinaceae are sister to Muntingiaceae (Malvales)". ''Taxon'' '''56'''(4):1129-1135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mitrastemon''==
The parasitic family Mitrastemonaceae has one genus, known either as ''Mitrastemon'' or ''Mitrastema''. The genus name and the corresponding family name have been a source of much confusion.&lt;ref name="ppc"&gt;[http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/Mitrastemonaceae/index.html Mitrastemonaceae] at [http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/index.html Parasitic Plant Connection website]&lt;/ref&gt; A phylogeny based on mitochondrial genes places ''Mitrastemon'' in the order [[Ericales]], but this result had only 76% [[maximum likelihood]] [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] support.&lt;ref name="barkman2007"&gt;Todd J. Barkman, Joel R. McNeal, Seok-Hong Lim, Gwen Coat, Henrietta B. Croom, Nelson D. Young, and Claude W. de Pamphilis. 2007. "Mitochondrial DNA suggests at least 11 origins of parasitism in angiosperms and reveals genomic chimerism in parasitic plants". ''BMC Evolutionary Biology'' '''7''':248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hoplestigma''==
''Hoplestigma'' consists of two species of [[Africa]]n trees, notable for their large leaves, up to 55&amp;nbsp;cm long and 25&amp;nbsp;cm wide.&lt;ref name="brummitt2007"&gt;Richard K. Brummitt and Martin R. Cheek. 2007. "Hoplestigmataceae" page 167. In: Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. ''Flowering Plant Families of the World''. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually placed by itself in the family Hoplestigmataceae which is thought to be related to [[Boraginaceae]].&lt;ref name="nowicke1989"&gt;Joan W. Nowicke and James S. Miller. 1989. "Pollen morphology and the relationships of Hoplestigmataceae". ''Taxon'' '''38'''(1):12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a phylogeny of Boraginaceae was [[Academic publishing|published]] in a [[scientific journal]] called ''[[Cladistics (journal)|Cladistics]]''.&lt;ref name=weigend2014&gt;Maximilian Weigend, Federico Luebert, Marc Gottschling, Thomas L.P. Couvreur, Hartmut H. Hilger and James S. Miller. 2014. "From capsules to nutlets — phylogenetic relationships in the Boraginales". ''Cladistics'' '''30'''(5):508-518. {{doi|10.1111/cla.12061}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing the [[DNA sequence]]s of selected [[gene]]s, the authors of that [[Research|study]] showed that ''Hoplestigma'' is related to members of Boraginaceae [[subfamily]] [[Cordioideae]], and they recommended that ''Hoplestigma'' be placed in that subfamily. Other authors have suggested that, while ''Hoplestigma'' is the [[Sister taxon|closest relative]] of Cordioideae, it should perhaps not be placed within it.&lt;ref name="apweb"&gt;Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards), Missouri Botanical Garden. [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/welcome.html Angiosperm Phylogeny].&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Metteniusa''==
''Metteniusa'' consists of seven species of trees in [[Central America]] and northwestern [[South America]]. Ever since [[Gustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten|Hermann Karsten]] proposed the name Metteniusaceae in 1859, some authors have placed ''Metteniusa'' by itself, in that family.&lt;ref name="lozano1988"&gt;Gustavo Lozano-Contreras and Nubia B. de Lozano. 1988. "Metteniusaceae". Monograph 11. In: Polidoro Pinto and Gustavo Lozano-Contreras. (editors). "Flora de Colombia". Instituto de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Nacional de Colombia: Bogota, Colombia.&lt;/ref&gt; Most authors, however, placed it in [[Icacinaceae]] until that family was shown to be polyphyletic in 2001.&lt;ref name="karehed2001"/&gt;

In 2007, in a comparison of DNA sequences for three genes, it was found that ''Metteniusa'' is one of the [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] clades of the [[lamiids]]. The authors recommended that the family Metteniusaceae be recognized.&lt;ref name="gonzalez2007"&gt;Favio Gonzalez, Julio Betancur, Olivier Maurin, John V. Freudenstein, and Mark W. Chase. 2007. "Metteniusaceae: an early-diverging family in the lamiid clade". ''Taxon'' '''56'''(3):795-800.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is yet known about relationships among the groups of basal lamiids. The [[Clade|groups]] in this [[polytomy]] include the order [[Garryales]], the families [[Icacinaceae]], [[Oncothecaceae]], and [[Metteniusaceae]], as well as some unplaced genera, including ''[[Apodytes]]'', ''[[Emmotum]]'', and ''[[Cassinopsis]]''.&lt;ref name="apweb"/&gt;

No phylogenetic study has focused on the lamiids, but phylogenies have been inferred for the [[asterids]], a group composed of [[Cornales]], [[Ericales]], the [[lamiids]], and the [[campanulids]].&lt;ref name="albach2001"&gt;Dirk C. Albach, Pamela S. Soltis, Douglas E. Soltis, and Richard G. Olmstead. 2001. "Phylogenetic analysis of Asterids based on sequences of four genes". ''Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden'' '''88'''(2):163-212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bremer2002"&gt;Birgitta Bremer, Kåre Bremer, Nahid Heidari, Per Erixon, Richard G. Olmstead, Arne A. Anderberg, Mari Kallersjö, and Edit Barkhordarian. 2002. "Phylogenetics of Asterids based on 3 coding and 3 non-coding chloroplast DNA markers and the utility of non-coding DNA at higher taxonomic levels". ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''24'''(2):274-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Balanophoraceae==
Balanophoraceae is a family of holoparasites with 44 species in 17 genera.&lt;ref name="apweb"/&gt; For a long time, ''Cynomorium'' was usually included in this family, but it is now known to be unrelated.&lt;ref name="barkman2007"/&gt; In 2005, Balanophoraceae was shown to be in the order [[Santalales]], but its position within that order has not been determined.&lt;ref name="nickrent2005"&gt;Daniel L. Nickrent, Joshua P. Der, and Frank E. Anderson. 2005. "Discovery of the photosynthetic relatives of the "Maltese Mushroom" Cynomorium". ''BMC Evolutionary Biology'' '''5''':38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two researchers in [[Taiwan]] announced on the internet in 2009 that they have results supporting the placement of Balanophoraceae in Santalales.&lt;ref name="su&amp;hu"&gt;Huei-Jiun Su and Jer-Ming Hu. "The phylogenetic relationships of Balanophoraceae and related Santalales inferred from floral B homeotic genes and nuclear 18S rDNA sequences". no date. no publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; They have yet to publish anything in a [[scientific journal]].

==''Cynomorium''==
Many names have been published in ''[[Cynomorium]]'',&lt;ref name="ipnicynomorium"&gt;[http://www.ipni.org/ipni/advPlantNameSearch.do;jsessionid=C0D8F049F38DCDCD83A51C4B89389301?find_family=&amp;find_genus=Cynomorium&amp;find_species=&amp;find_infrafamily=&amp;find_infragenus=&amp;find_infraspecies=&amp;find_authorAbbrev=&amp;find_includePublicationAuthors=on&amp;find_includePublicationAuthors=off&amp;find_includeBasionymAuthors=on&amp;find_includeBasionymAuthors=off&amp;find_publicationTitle=&amp;find_isAPNIRecord=on&amp;find_isAPNIRecord=false&amp;find_isGCIRecord=on&amp;find_isGCIRecord=false&amp;find_isIKRecord=on&amp;find_isIKRecord=false&amp;find_rankToReturn=all&amp;output_format=normal&amp;find_sortByFamily=on&amp;find_sortByFamily=off&amp;query_type=by_query&amp;back_page=plantsearch Cynomorium at International Plant Names Index]&lt;/ref&gt; but there are probably only [[Cynomorium coccineum|two species]].&lt;ref name="ppccynomorium"&gt;[http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/Cynomoriaceae/index.html Cynomorium] At: [http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/ListParasites.html List of Genera]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not closely related to anything else, so it is placed in the monogeneric family Cynomoriaceae.&lt;ref name="barkman2007"/&gt;

Attempts to find its closest relatives have demonstrated with special clarity that molecular phylogenetics is not a sure-fire, problem-free method of determining [[Plant systematics|systematic]] relationships. One study placed it in Saxifragales, but not at any particular position within that order.&lt;ref name="nickrent2005"/&gt; Doubts have been expressed about the results of this study. Another study placed ''Cynomorium'' in [[Rosales]] based on analysis of the two [[inverted repeat|invert repeat]] regions of the chloroplast [[genome]], which evolve at one fifth the [[Mutation rate|rate]] of the two [[single copy regions]].&lt;ref name="zhang2009"&gt;Zhi-Hong Zhang, Chun-Qi Li, and Jianhua Li. 2009. "Phylogenetic placement of ''Cynomorium'' in Rosales inferred from sequences of the invert repeat region of the chloroplast genome". ''Journal of Systematics and Evolution'' '''47'''(4):297-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Gumillea''==
''Gumillea'' has a single species, ''Gumillea auriculata'',&lt;ref name="engler1930"&gt;H.G. Adolf Engler. 1930. "Cunoniaceae" pages 229-262. In: H.G. Adolf Engler and Karl Prantl (editors). ''Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien'' volume 18a. Verlag von Wilhelm Engelmann: Leipzig, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; and is known from only one [[Biological specimen|specimen]] which was collected in the late 18th century in [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="gentry1996"&gt;Alwyn H. Gentry. 1996. ''A Field Guide to Woody Plants of Northwest South America''. University of Chicago Press Edition (1996). The University of Chicago Press. Chicago, IL, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; It was named by [[Hipólito Ruiz López]] and [[José Antonio Pavón Jiménez]].&lt;ref name="ruiz1789"&gt;Hipólito Ruiz-López and José Antonio Pavón y Jiménez. 1789-1802. ''[http://www.botanicus.org/title/b12851358 Flora Peruviana et Chilensis]''.

[[George Bentham]] and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] placed it in [[Cunoniaceae]],&lt;ref name="bentham1865"&gt;George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker. 1865. ''Genera Plantarum'' volume 1, part 2, page 651. Lovell Reeve &amp; Co.; Williams and Norgate: London, England.&lt;/ref&gt;  and this treatment was followed by [[Adolf Engler]] and most others.&lt;ref name="engler1930"/&gt; The last comprehensive treatment of Cunoniaceae, however, excludes it from the family.&lt;ref name="bradford2004"&gt;Jason C. Bradford, Helen C. Fortune-Hopkins, and Richard W. Barnes. 2004. "Cunoniaceae". pages 91-111. In: Klaus Kubitski (editor). ''The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants'' volume VI. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Armen Takhtajan]] placed ''Gumillea'' in [[Simaroubaceae]].&lt;ref name="takhtajan2009"&gt;Armen L. Takhtajan (Takhtadzhian). ''Flowering Plants'' second edition (2009). Springer Science+Business Media. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-9608-2}}. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-9609-9}} {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4020-9609-9}} (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 article on Simaroubaceae contains a list of the genera in the family. ''Gumillea'' is not on that list, but the authors do not provide a list or section on excluded genera.&lt;ref name="clayton2007"&gt;Joshua W. Clayton, Edwino S. Fernando, Pamela S. Soltis, and Douglas E. Soltis. 2007. "Molecular phylogeny of the tree-of-heaven family (Simaroubaceae) based on chloroplast and nuclear markers". ''International Journal of Plant Sciences'' '''168'''(9):1325-1339.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gumillea'' has also been called a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''[[Picramnia]]'',&lt;ref name="mabberley2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brako1993"&gt;Lois Brako and James L. Zarucchi. 1993. "Catalogue of the flowering plants and gymnosperms of Peru". ''Monographs in Systematic Botany from the Missouri Botanical Garden''. monograph number 45.&lt;/ref&gt; but the ultimate source of this information is obscure and it is not mentioned in either of the recent treatments of ''Picramnia''.&lt;ref name="quinn1995"&gt;Edwino S. Fernando and Christopher J. Quinn. 1995. "Picramniaceae, a new family, and a recircumscription of Simaroubaceae". ''Taxon'' '''44'''(2):177-181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kubitzki2007"&gt;Klaus Kubitzki. 2007. "Picramniaceae" pages 301-303. In:  Klaus Kubitski (editor). ''The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants'' volume IX. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that on their [[Lithography|plate]] for ''Gumillea'', Ruiz and Pavón showed 11 [[ovule]]s or immature [[seed]]s that had been extracted from a 2-[[Locule|locular]] [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]]. But the ovary in ''Picramnia'' has (sometimes 2), usually 3 to 4 locules and there are always two ovules in each locule.&lt;ref name="kubitzki2007"/&gt;

It might be possible to determine the affinities of ''Gumillea'' if DNA could be extracted from the existing specimen. DNA has been successfully [[DNA replication|amplified]] from specimens of similar age.&lt;ref name="andreasen2009"&gt;Katarina Andreasen, Mariette Manktelow, and Sylvain G. Razafimandimbison. 2009. "Successful DNA amplification of a more than 200-year-old herbarium specimen: recovering genetic material from the Linnean era". ''Taxon'' '''58'''(3):959-962.&lt;/ref&gt; Any material used in such research, however, will never be replaced.

==Apodanthaceae==
{{main|Apodanthaceae}}
The family Apodanthaceae comprises 22 to 30 species of [[Parasitism|endoparasitic]] [[Herbaceous plant|herbs]]. These are distributed into three genera: ''[[Pilostyles]]'', ''[[Apodanthes]]'', and ''[[Berlinianche]]''.&lt;ref name="blarer2004"&gt;Albert Blarer, Daniel L. Nickrent, and Peter K. Endress. 2004.

'''Volker Helmut Manfred Zotz''' (born October 28, 1956) is an eminent [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]], [[religious studies]] scholar, [[Buddhologist]] and a prolific author.&lt;ref&gt;"Volker Zotz," in ''[[Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender]]'',  Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter 2011, 23rd edition ({{ISBN|978-3-598-23630-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
The Zotz family originated in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and spread to [[Germany]]. Volker Zotz was born in [[Landau in der Pfalz]], [[Germany]], where he attended elementary school and high school.

His interest in [[spirituality]] led him to an early study of [[Christianity]] as well as of [[Indian religions|Indian]] and [[Chinese religions]]. What impressed him most was Buddhist philosophy and meditation. When Zotz was sixteen he became a major disciple of [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]], with whom he was close until his death in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arya-maitreya-mandala.org/#amsterdam Major disciples of Lama Anagarika Govinda]&lt;/ref&gt; During his high school days, Zotz also met the author [[Oscar Kiss Maerth]], whose ideas he did not completely agree with, but with whom he had an intense exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donna Kossy]]: ''Strange creations: aberrant ideas of human origins.'' Feral House 2001, {{ISBN|9780922915651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Max Slevogt]] High School in Landau in the 1970s, he published his first poems in two volumes&lt;ref&gt;''Transformation.'' Scheden: Verlagsedition Dittmer 1978 ({{ISBN|3-88297-031-6}}) und ''Geraunt.'' Scheden und Hannoversch Münden 1979 ({{ISBN|3-88297-039-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; and a novel.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Projekt Adytum.'' Scheden und Hannoversch Münden 1979 ({{ISBN|3-88297-041-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[conscientious objector]] Zotz had to perform eighteen months of [[alternative civilian service]] in a nursing home. From 1978 he studied Buddhism under Ernst Steinkellner and [[philosophy]] under [[Kurt Rudolf Fischer]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. He repeatedly interrupted his studies in Vienna to conduct research and fieldwork in [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Afghanistan]] and to receive spiritual training from Lama Anagarika Govinda.

== Career ==
In 1986 Zotz received a Ph. D. from the University of Vienna for his [[thesis|doctoral thesis]] ''Zur Rezeption, Interpretation und Kritik des Buddhismus im deutschen Sprachraum.'' This dissertation investigates the influence of Buddhism on German philosophy, literature and culture during the [[Fin de siècle]].&lt;ref&gt;''International Bibliography of Austrian Philosophy 1986/87''. Amsterdam 1996, p.171 ({{ISBN|90-420-0036-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Zotz has been a [[lecturer]] of Buddhist philosophy at the University of Vienna. 1989 he moved to [[Japan]] where he was a [[professor]] and researcher at [[Ryukoku University]] and [[Otani University]] in [[Kyoto]] and at [[Rissho University]] in [[Tokyo]] for ten years. During the period in Japan he was influenced considerably by the Buddhologist [[Takamaro Shigaraki]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction by Volker Zotz to Takamaro Shigaraki: ''Sogar der Gute wird erlöst, um wie viel mehr der Böse. Der Weg des buddhistischen Meisters Shinran.'' Luxembourg 2004 ({{ISBN|2-9599829-2-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Zotz was appointed [[professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of Luxembourg]]. At that time he was also teaching at [[Saarland University]].

Besides his scholarly work, Volker Zotz’s European audience knows him as author and publicist. The volume, ''Buddha'', is the most popular book on its topic in German language, regularly reprinted and translated into several languages. Zotz is a leading member of the [[Arya Maitreya Mandala]], founded by Lama Anagarika Govinda in 1933. In the early 1990s Zotz initiated a study centre called ''Komyoji'' in Austria which is an attempt at describing a cross-cultural philosophy of religion. Since 1994 Zotz has been the driving force behind many of Komyoji’s educational programs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komyoji.at Komyoji Website]&lt;/ref&gt; such as workshops explaining various philosophical and theological topics. Volker Zotz is married to the Austrian writer and anthropologist [[Birgit Zotz]].

In fall of 2018, a CBS News investigation of Woz U cast some doubts on the professionalism of the expensive curriculum. CBS interviewed two dozen current and former students and employees, who shared their dissatisfaction with the content quality, such as documentation typos leading to confusing program errors, while some promised live lectures were actually recorded and out-of-date. One student described the 33-week online program as "a $13,000 e-book". A former "enrollment counselor" described a high-pressure sales environment, which the company denied. In a prepared statement, Woz U president Chris Coleman admitted the documentation errors and said quality control efforts were being implemented, and said curriculum was reviewed by Wozniak. The founder declined interview requests, then dodged a reporter's unannounced appearance at a conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/woz-u-steve-wozniak-former-students-employees-raise-concerns/|title=Some former students, employees say Apple co-founder's Woz U doesn't live up to promises|last=|first=|date=2018-10-01|work=CBS News|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/steve-wozniaks-woz-u-is-a-13000-e-book-former-students-say/|title=Steve Wozniak’s Woz U is 'a $13,000 e-book,' former students say|last=Zhou|first=Marrian|date=2018-10-01|work=CNET|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
