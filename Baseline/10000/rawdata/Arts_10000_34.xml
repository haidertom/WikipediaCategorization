'''''Allegory of Chastity''''' is a c.1505 oil on panel painting by [[Lorenzo Lotto]].

== History ==
It was first recorded in the 19th century, when it was in the Castelbarco collection in Milan. It was then sold to [[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|Sir William Martin Conway]] in 1887 and moved to his home at [[Allington Castle]] in Kent. Its next owner was [[Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi]], who on 4 October 1934 sold it to [[Samuel H. Kress]], who took it to the USA and gave it to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1939, where it still hangs.

[[File:Lorenzo Lotto - Portrait of a Woman - WGA13654.jpg|left|thumb|''Portrait of a Woman'']]
Its dating is based on stylistic similarities to Lotto's ''[[Allegory of Virtue and Vice (Lotto)|Allegory of Virtue and Vice]]'', a cover Lotto had produced for his own ''[[Portrait of Bishop Bernardo de' Rossi|Portrait of Bernardo de' Rossi]]''. It was probably a cover itself, possibly for ''Portrait of a Woman'' ([[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]]). Lotto was then a young protege of de' Rossi, who had gathered a small circle of writers and artists around him. Radiography has shown a partial under-drawing for a different image, probably a ''Hercules at the Crossroads'', another theme on the choice between vice and virtue.
== Description ==
The background landscape recalls [[Dürer]]'s watercolours and [[Giorgione]]'s landscape paintings. A young woman in white and gold leans against a laurel tree in the centre, possibly referring to [[Daphne (mythology)|Daphne]], and ignores two satyrs (one female, one male), symbolising intoxication and lust. A putto pours a cascade of white flowers over her.

'''''American Psycho'''''  is a novel by [[Bret Easton Ellis]], published in 1991. The story is told in the [[first person narrative|first person]] by [[Patrick Bateman]], a [[serial killer]] and [[Manhattan]] businessman. Alison Kelly of ''[[The Observer]]'' notes that while "some countries [deem it] so potentially disturbing that it can only be sold shrink-wrapped", "critics rave about it" and "academics revel in its [[transgressive fiction|transgressive]] and [[postmodern literature|postmodern]] qualities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/27/imperial-bedrooms-bret-easton-ellis-book-review |title=Imperial Bedrooms by Bret Easton Ellis |work=The Guardian |last=Kelly |first=Alison |date=27 June 2010|accessdate=28 July 2010 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630110116/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jun/27/imperial-bedrooms-bret-easton-ellis-book-review| archivedate= 30 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[American Psycho (film)|film adaptation]] starring [[Christian Bale]] as Bateman was released in 2000 to generally favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/americanpsycho?q=american%20psycho |title=Metacritic reviews for American Psycho |publisher=Metacritic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, it was confirmed that producers David Johnson and Jesse Singer were developing a [[American Psycho (musical)|musical adaptation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/theater/american-psycho-as-a-musical.html | work=The New York Times | first=Adam W. | last=Kepler | title=‘American Psycho' as a Musical | date=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the novel to appear on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The [[American Psycho (musical)|musical]] premiered at the [[Almeida Theatre]], London in December 2013.

==Development==
Ellis researched murders at the [[New York Public Library]]. His first draft of ''American Psycho'' left all the grisly scenes until last, to be added in later. In 2010, in conversation with Jeff Baker, Ellis commented: {{quote|[Bateman] was crazy the same way [I was]. He did not come out of me sitting down and wanting to write a grand sweeping indictment of [[yuppie]] culture. It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a [[consumerism|consumerist]] kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself. That is where the tension of ''American Psycho'' came from. It wasn't that I was going to make up this serial killer on [[Wall Street]]. [[High concept]]. Fantastic. It came from a much more personal place, and that's something that I've only been admitting in the last year or so. I was so on the defensive because of the reaction to that book that I wasn't able to talk about it on that level.&lt;ref name=oregonlive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2010/07/qa_bret_easton_ellis_talks_abo.html|title=Q&amp;A: Bret Easton Ellis talks about writing novels, making movies|last=Baker|first=Jeff|work=OregonLive|accessdate=2010-07-09|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; |Bret Easton Ellis}}

==Plot==
Set in [[Manhattan]] during the [[Wall Street]] boom of the late 1980s, ''American Psycho'' follows the life of wealthy young [[investment banker]] Patrick Bateman. Bateman, in his mid-20s when the story begins, narrates his everyday activities, from his recreational life among the Wall Street elite of [[New York City|New York]] to his forays into murder by night. Through [[present tense]] [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] narrative, Bateman describes his daily life, ranging from a series of Friday nights spent at nightclubs with his colleagues—where they snort [[cocaine]], critique fellow club-goers' clothing, trade fashion advice, and question one another on proper [[etiquette]]—to his loveless engagement to fellow yuppie Evelyn and his contentious relationship with his brother and senile mother. Bateman's stream of consciousness is occasionally broken up by chapters in which he directly addresses the reader in order to critique the work of 1980s [[pop music]] artists. The novel maintains a high level of ambiguity through mistaken identity and contradictions that introduce the possibility that Bateman is an [[unreliable narrator]]. Characters are consistently introduced as people other than themselves, and people argue over the identities of others they can see in restaurants or at parties. Deeply concerned with his [[vanity|personal appearance]], Bateman gives extensive descriptions of his daily beauty regimen. The question of whether any of the crimes depicted in the novel actually happened or whether they were simply the fantasies of a [[delusion]]al [[psychosis|psychotic]] is only perpetuated further by the cinematic adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors/|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors|author=Kyle Buchanan|work=Movieline|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After killing Paul &lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE TO ALLEN; ALLEN IS MOVIE NAME, OWEN IS BOOK NAME! --&gt;Owen, one of his colleagues, Bateman appropriates his apartment as a place to host and kill more victims. Bateman's control over his violent urges deteriorates. His murders become increasingly [[sadomasochism|sadistic]] and complex, progressing from simple stabbings to drawn-out sequences of [[rape]], [[torture]], [[mutilation]], [[cannibalism]], and [[necrophilia]], and his grasp on sanity begins to slip. He introduces stories about serial killers into casual conversations and on several occasions openly confesses his murderous activities to his coworkers, who never take him seriously, do not hear what he says, or misunderstand him completely—for example, hearing the words "murders and executions" as "mergers and acquisitions." These incidents culminate in a shooting spree during which he kills several random people in the street, resulting in a [[SWAT]] team being dispatched in a helicopter. This narrative episode sees the first-person perspective shift to third-person and the subsequent events are, although not for the first time in the novel, described in terms pertaining to cinematic portrayal. Bateman flees on foot and hides in his office, where he phones his attorney, Harold Carnes, and confesses all his crimes to the answering machine.

Later, Bateman revisits Paul Owen's apartment, where he had earlier killed and mutilated two prostitutes, carrying a surgical mask in anticipation of the decomposing bodies he expects to encounter. He enters the perfectly clean, refurbished apartment, however, filled with strong-smelling flowers meant, perhaps, to conceal a bad odor. The real estate agent, who sees his surgical mask, fools him into stating he was attending the apartment viewing because he saw an "ad in the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]''" (when there was no such advertisement). She tells him to leave and never return.

Bateman's mental state continues to deteriorate, and he begins to experience bizarre hallucinations such as seeing a [[Cheerios|Cheerio]] interviewed on a talk show, being [[stalking|stalked]] by an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] park bench, and finding a bone in his [[Dove Bar]]. At the end of the story, Bateman confronts Carnes about the message he left on his machine, only to find the attorney amused at what he considers a hilarious joke. Mistaking Bateman for another colleague, Carnes claims that the Patrick Bateman he knows is too much of a coward to have committed such acts. In the dialogue-laden climax, Carnes stands up to a defiant Bateman and tells him his claim of having murdered Owen is impossible, because he had dinner with him twice in [[London]] just a few days prior.

The book ends as it began, with Bateman and his colleagues at a new club on a Friday night, engaging in banal conversation.  The sign seen at the end of the book simply reads "This is not an exit."

==Themes==
According to literary critic Jeffrey W. Hunter, ''American Psycho ''is largely a critique of the "shallow and vicious aspects of [[capitalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Jeffrey W. Hunter (ed.). ''Vol. 229''. Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2007, pp. 228–294. From ''Literature Criticism Online.''&lt;/ref&gt; The characters are predominantly concerned with material gain and superficial appearances, traits indicative of a [[postmodern]] world in which the 'surface' reigns supreme. This leads Patrick Bateman to act as if "everything is a [[commodity]], including people",&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Literary Criticism''.&lt;/ref&gt; an attitude that is further evident in the rampant objectification and brutalization of women that occurs in the novel. This distancing allows Bateman to rationalize his actions;&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Leigh. "Distancing in Bret Easton Ellis' ''American Psycho''. ''Notes on Contemporary Literature'' 24, no. 1 (January 1994): 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; in one [[Cannibalism|anthropophagic]] scene, Bateman remarks "though it does sporadically penetrate how unacceptable some of what I'm doing actually is, I just remind myself that this thing, this girl, this meat, is nothing&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Bret Easton. ''American Psycho''. New York: Vintage Books, 1991. Page 345&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Bateman's consumption of what he views as nothing more than a piece of meat is an almost parodically literal interpretation of a monster created by consumer culture. This, combined with sex, violence, drugs, and other desires of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], is how Bateman enacts his sociopathic violence in a superficial world.&lt;ref&gt;Heyler, Ruth. "Parodied to Death: The Postmodern Gothic of ''American Psycho''". ''Modern Fiction Studies'' 46, no. 3 (fall 2000): 725–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The book was originally to have been published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in March 1991, but the company withdrew from the project because of "aesthetic differences". [[Vintage (publisher)|Vintage Books]] purchased the rights to the novel and published the book after the customary editing process. The book was not published in hardcover in the United States until 2012, when a limited hardcover edition was published by [[Centipede Press]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centipedepress.com/horror/americanpsycho.html|title=American Psycho|work=centipedepress.com|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a deluxe paperback was offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318714,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Giselle | last=Benatar | title=American Psychodrama – EW.com | date=1990-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis received numerous death threats and hate mail after the publication of ''American Psycho''.&lt;ref name="messier"&gt;{{cite journal

== Adaptations ==

===2000 film===
{{Main article|American Psycho (film)}}
In 2000, writer [[Guinevere Turner]] and writer/director [[Mary Harron]] adapted ''American Psycho'' into a dark, comic [[American Psycho (film)|film]] released by [[Lions Gate Films]]. This screenplay was selected over three others, including one by Ellis himself. Bateman is played by [[Christian Bale]] with [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]] in supporting roles. As a promotion for the film, one could register to receive e-mails "from" Patrick Bateman, supposedly to his therapist.&lt;ref name="Howell"&gt;{{cite news | last= Howell | first= Peter | url= | title=''American Psycho''s Web Promo Sickens Star | work=[[Toronto Star]] | date=March 8, 2000 | accessdate= | location=Toronto }}&lt;/ref&gt; The e-mails, written by a writer attached to the film and approved by Ellis, follow Bateman's life since the events of the film. ''American Psycho'' premiered at the 2000 [[Sundance Film Festival]] where it was touted as the next ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]''.&lt;ref name=guardian3&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=''American Psycho'' hits Sundance |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2000-01-26 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jan/26/sundancefilmfestival2000.festivals |accessdate=2010-07-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) gave the film an [[NC-17]] rating for a scene featuring Bateman having a [[threesome]] with two prostitutes. The producers excised approximately 18 seconds of footage to obtain an [[MPAA film rating system|R-rating]] for the film.&lt;ref name=guardian4&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=''American Psycho'' cut to appease censors|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2000-02-29 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/feb/29/news |accessdate=2010-07-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It polarized audiences and critics with some showering praise, others scorn.&lt;ref name="corliss2"&gt;{{cite news | last= Corliss | first= Richard | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,995904,00.html | title=Sundance Sorority | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=January 24, 2000 | accessdate=2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its theatrical release, however, the film received positive reviews in crucial publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'' which called it a "mean and lean horror comedy classic".&lt;ref name="holden"&gt;{{cite news | last= Holden | first= Stephen | url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/041400psycho-film-review.html | title=Murderer!

A [[direct-to-video]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''[[American Psycho 2]]'' was released and directed by [[Morgan J. Freeman]]. This spin-off was not based on the novel or the original film, as its only connection with the original is the death of Patrick Bateman (played by Michael Kremko wearing a face mask), briefly shown in a flashback.

===Other adaptations===
In 2009, [[Audible.com]] produced an audio version of ''American Psycho'', narrated by [[Pablo Schreiber]], as part of its ''Modern Vanguard'' line of audiobooks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710063219/http://markets.ibtimes.com/ibtimes/?Page=MediaViewer&amp;GUID=9742903&amp;Ticker=AMZN Audible Announces New ''Modern Vanguard'' Line of Audiobooks]. International Business Times&lt;/ref&gt; A Hungarian version of the novel was written by [[Attila Hazai]] (1967–2012) called ''Budapesti skizo'' ("Budapest Psycho", 1997); it was Hazai's best known work but as of his death never translated into English.&lt;ref name=cr&gt;[http://www.complete-review.com/saloon/archive/201204a.htm#bf3 Hazai Attila (1967–2012)], ''[[complete review]]'', "The Literary Saloon", April 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a Kickstarter campaign was launched by Ellis and others to get a [[American Psycho (musical)|musical stage adaptation]] made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1798121016/american-psycho|title=AMERICAN PSYCHO|work=Kickstarter|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere of the [[American Psycho (musical)|musical]], with music and lyrics by [[Duncan Sheik]] opened at the [[Almeida Theatre]], London in December 2013.

'''''The Apocalypse of Lorvão''''' is an [[illuminated manuscript]] from [[Lorvão]], Portugal containing the ''[[Commentary on the Apocalypse]]'' of [[Beatus of Liébana|Beatus]] of [[Santo Toribio de Liébana|Liébana Monastery]], Spain. 

It is currently kept at the [[Torre do Tombo National Archive]] in [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063606/POR_280_004.html|title=Apocalipsis of Lorvao|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
This is a well-dated manuscript whose origin is identified through its [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], which indicates that it was completed in 1189 in the [[scriptorium]] of the Lorvão monastery in the present municipality of [[Penacova]], near [[Coimbra]]. It was signed by the scribe Egeas, who might also be the author of illustrations. It remained preserved in the abbey until the nineteenth century, including while the monastery changed denomination in 1205 and hosted a [[Cistercian]] community.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt; 

The historian [[Alexandre Herculano]] discovered the manuscript in the library of the monastery in 1853 and transferred it to the national archives of Portugal in Lisbon to be part of the corpus of documents and texts in the history of Portugal (''Portugalliae Monumenta Historica''). The manuscript is still preserved there.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of eleven manuscripts of Beatus in the Iberian record of the [[Memory of the World Register]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/fr/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/the-manuscripts-of-the-commentary-to-the-apocalypse-beatus-of-liebana-in-the-iberian-tradition/ Présentation sur le site de l'UNESCO]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
This is the only manuscript of the Beatus Commentary on the Apocalypse of Liébana, also called Beatus, produced in Portugal during the [[Middle Ages]]. This is a relatively primitive version of the text, probably copied from a ninth century original. It is written in a [[Carolingian minuscule]] style that made the transition to the [[Blackletter|Gothic]]. His miniatures are at number 70, including 18 full-page, 20 of the half-page and the other smaller and variable dimensions.

&lt;/gallery&gt;These illustrations were considered archaic for the time, marked by a thick stroke and colors dominated by orange and yellow. They may have been copied from an older model, perhaps close to the original manuscript written by [[Beatus of Liebana]]. There are also repeatedly scenes of everyday life at the time of [[Sancho I of Portugal]]. Finally, [[Beatus map]] belonging to the manuscript has been preserved but only half of it. It was reunited with the manuscript after being separated from it.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hudson Wolves Kemeys.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2| ''Hudson Bay Wolves'' by Edward Kemeys]]
Chartered by the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] in 1872, the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) was founded by a group of concerned citizens in the late nineteenth century who wanted to beautify Philadelphia's urban landscape with public art to counter the city's encroaching industrialism. The Association initially focused on enhancing Fairmount Park with outdoor sculpture, but the organization's mission expanded in 1906 to include the rest of the city as a whole: to "promote and foster the beautiful in Philadelphia, in its architecture, improvements, and the city plan."&lt;ref name="New Land Marks: public art, community, and the meaning of place"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bach|first=Penny|title=New Land Marks: public art, community, and the meaning of place |publisher=Grayson Publishing | location = Washington, DC | year = 2001| isbn = 0-9679143-4-5|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends Charles H. Howell and Henry K. Fox conceived of the Fairmount Park Art Association, and the organization's first president was [[Anthony Joseph Drexel|Anthony J. Drexel]], founder of [[Drexel University]].&lt;ref name="White 1975 94"/&gt; The Association's first official venture was purchasing ''Hudson Bay Wolves Quarreling Over the Carcass of a Deer'' (1872) by [[Edward Kemeys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fairmount Park Art Association|first=|title=Sculpture of a City|publisher=Walker Publishing Co., Inc| location = New York, NY | year = 1974| isbn = 978-0-8027-0459-7|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its first major undertaking was commissioning [[Alexander Milne Calder]] for an equestrian statue of Major General George Meade in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fairmount Park Art Association|first=|title=Sculpture of a City|publisher=Walker Publishing Co., Inc| location = New York, NY | year = 1974| isbn = 978-0-8027-0459-7|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change==

In May 2012, the Fairmount Park Art Association changed its name to the Association for Public Art (aPA). The change was made to more clearly communicate the nature and scope of the organization's work, and to distinguish itself from other local and national public art agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://associationforpublicart.org/name-change/&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's first major project under its new name was ''Open Air'' (2012), a world-premiere interactive light installation for the Benjamin Franklin Parkway by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/the-feed/item/38159-name-change-for-fairmount-park-art-association&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caribbean Bird Vendor''' is a painting by [[Ellis Wilson]] in 1953. It is now part of [[Hampton University]]’s permanent exhibition.

== Description ==
The painting is [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and is roughly {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} wide and {{convert|2|ft|m|1}} tall. The work is an [[Expressionism|expressionistic]] [[portrait]] of a dark skinned, shirtless, adult [[Caribbean]] male holding three birds. The man and his three birds are all looking straight out of the painting at the viewer. Hazy, neutral yellow leaves are in the background, while the man and his other two birds are dark. The [[parrot]] sitting on the man’s shoulder is calm and his beak is closed. The second bird is sitting on the man’s cupped palm and resting, his beak is also closed. The man is wrapping one arm around the biggest bird. This bird is bright lilac and very elaborate, contrasting with the rest of the painting. The bird’s beak is open and its wings are spread as if it is about to break free of the man’s arm and take flight.

==Work==

===Overview===
''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' consists of a website that hosts a video, an introductory text and an open comments section.&lt;ref name=Rubin9June2015/&gt; Its existence was made public by a [[Facebook]] post from the video's director, [[Ted Lawson]].&lt;ref name=Munro4June2015/&gt; Sulkowicz says they had the idea for the piece in December 2014, and that performance artist [[Marina Abramović]] put them in touch with Lawson to direct it.&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; Lawson told ''ArtNet'' that he thought the piece was "super risky" and courageous.&lt;ref name=Munro4June2015/&gt; Sulkowicz stressed that it was a separate piece from ''Mattress Performance''.&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz4June2015/&gt;

Sulkowicz wrote the script and introductory text, chose the position of the cameras, the lighting and the appearance of it having been filmed by security cameras. The scene was filmed in one continuous take three times during the Columbia spring break in March 2015.&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; According to Lawson, Sulkowicz had "insisted on it being completely real.&amp;nbsp;... That's what makes it a performance art piece."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt; Sulkowicz told the ''Guardian'' that making the video had been traumatizing, and had left them in a "very scared, emotional state for days."&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; They said elsewhere that vulnerability is part of what makes performance art good.&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz4June2015/&gt;

===Text===
The introductory text said that the video was not an enactment of Sulkowicz's rape allegation. Rather, "''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol''&amp;nbsp;... [is] about your decisions, starting now." Sulkowicz gives only provisional consent to view the video:&lt;ref name=Munro4June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alter5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015/&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 5px #ccc;padding:1.2em"&gt;Do not watch this video if your motives would upset me, my desires are unclear to you, or my nuances are indecipherable.{{paragraph break}} You might be wondering why I've made myself this vulnerable. Look—I want to change the world, and that begins with you, seeing yourself. If you watch this video without my consent, then I hope you reflect on your reasons for objectifying me and participating in my rape, for, in that case, you were the one who couldn't resist the urge to make ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' about what you wanted to make it about: rape.{{paragraph break}} Please, don't participate in my rape. Watch kindly.&lt;ref name=Gambino5June2015&gt;Lauren Gambino, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/05/columbia-graduate-mattress-emma-sulkowicz-video/ "Columbia graduate who carried mattress releases video depicting 'rape'"], ''The Guargian'', 5 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They then ask a series of questions: "Are you searching for ways to either hurt or help me?&amp;nbsp;... Do you think I'm the perfect victim or the world's worst victim?&amp;nbsp;... Do you hate me? If so, how does it feel to hate me?"&lt;ref name=Gambino5June2015/&gt;

===Video===
The scene is shown on a split screen from four angles, with a [[timestamp]] in each corner, beginning 02:10 and ending 02:18. Lawson said the security-camera perspective "removes the wall between the viewer and the action."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015&gt;Teo Armus, [http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2015/06/05/sulkowicz-films-herself-violent-sex-scene-newest-art-project "Sulkowicz films herself in a violent sex scene for newest art project"], ''Columbia Spectator'', 5 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt; The video begins with Sulkowicz and the actor, whose face is blurred, entering the room, undressing each other, then kissing and engaging in [[Oral sex|oral]] and [[vaginal sex]], the latter with a condom. Three minutes into the video, the actor hits Sulkowicz several times, then removes the condom, pushes his hands and their legs against their neck or throat, and penetrates them anally. They scream, tells him to stop, and put their hand over their face. After a short time, the actor stops abruptly and leaves the room with his clothes in his hands. Sulkowicz is left curled on the bed in the [[fetal position]], with their back to the camera. After wrapping themselves in a towel, they briefly leave the room, return and make their bed, then appears to fall asleep.&lt;ref name=Frank5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt;

Lawson told the ''Columbia Spectator'' that Sulkowicz and the actor had captured the shift from the consensual to non-consensual: "I think the video expresses the possibility that you don't forfeit that [consensuality] ever."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt;

===Public comments===
Lawson said ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' explores the relationship between art and social media, "this giant, polluted ocean."&lt;ref name=Armus5June2015/&gt; A key part of the work was the online reaction, particularly in the website's comments section. The 2,700 comments within the first five days were mostly critical or ridiculing. They included sexual, sexist and racist insults and threats. There were remarks about Sulkowicz's physical appearance, ethnicity, mental health, and that the scene did not depict rape.&lt;ref name=Rubin9June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seltzer9June2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015&gt;[[Suzannah Weiss]], [http://www.bustle.com/articles/88974-emma-sulkowiczs-ceci-nest-pas-un-viol-site-was-temporarily-disabled-by-cyberattacks-but-her-opponents "Emma Sulkowicz's 'Ceci N’est Pas Un Viol' Site Was Temporarily Disabled By Cyberattacks, But Her Opponents Are Missing The Point"], ''Bustle'', 9 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monro9June2015&gt;[https://news.artnet.com/in-brief/hackers-disable-emma-sulkowicz-website-censor-new-artwork-306593 "Hackers Disable Emma Sulkowicz Website to Censor New Artwork"], ''ArtNet'', 9 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Chan, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/anti-rape-activist-emma-sulkowicz-releases-sex-video-art-article-1.2247676 "Columbia University anti-rape activist Emma Sulkowicz releases sex video as newest art piece"], ''New York Daily News'', 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Someone posted the video on a porn site.&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015/&gt; Comments on other sites were both positive and negative.&lt;ref name=Seltzer9June2015/&gt; The video was the victim of a denial-of-service attack by hackers on 4 June, according to [[DigitalOcean]], which hosts the site, and on 5 June there were technical problems caused by the numbers attempting to access it.&lt;ref name=Gambino9June2015/&gt;

==Analysis==
''Newsweek'' called the video a "harrowing document," while Priscilla Frank in ''The Huffington Post'' described it as "simple yet stinging, providing imagery that lingers like a nightmare, never quite comprehensible but impossible to forget."&lt;ref name=Frank5June2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mejia, [http://www.newsweek.com/columbia-university-mattress-protester-releases-video-addressing-rape-340372 "Columbia University Mattress Protester Releases Video Addressing Rape"], ''Newsweek'', 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the German edition of ''The Huffington Post'', Benjamin Prüfer was less positive, calling it an "art video that can only be described as pornography."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Prüfer, [http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2015/06/10/emma-sulkowicz-vergewalti_n_7558522.html "Kunst oder krank? Angebliches Vergewaltigungsopfer dreht verstörendes Sex-Video"]. ''The Huffington Post'', 11 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah Rubin, writing in ''The Forward'', called it "sophisticated and brilliant," and despaired of the lack of empathy on display in the website's comments section.&lt;ref name=Rubin9June2015/&gt; According to [[Julie Zeilinger]], the video was "unsettling" for Sulkowicz's supporters, and several questioned their approach.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Zeilinger, [http://mic.com/articles/120302/emma-sulkowicz-isn-t-the-only-artist-taking-on-sexual-assault-here-are-5-others "Emma Sulkowicz Isn't the Only Artist Taking on Sexual Assault. Here Are 5 Others"], 'Identities.Mic'', 8 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On ''Slate's'' DoubleX Gabfest podcast, [[Hanna Rosin]] argued that the split-screen forces the viewer to embrace the subjective, in terms of choosing whether and how to watch, and how to interpret, which is the opposite of activism because it is too nuanced. The broadcast noted that Sandra Leong, Sulkowicz's mother, had written on Facebook in support of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Rosin, Noreen Malone and June Thomas, [http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/doublex_gabfest/2015/06/doublex_gabfest_on_emma_sulkowicz_radical_feminism_versus_caitlyn_jenner.html "DoubleX Gabfest: The Triple X Edition"], ''Slate'', 11 June 2015, from c. 09:00 mins; c 18:00 for Sandra Leong.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suzannah Weiss]] wrote in ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' that Sulkowicz's provisional consent to watch the video is a metaphor for sexual consent. The video is there to watch, but the viewer has a decision to make. No one has consent to watch with hostility or if they are unsure of the artist's desires. No one has consent to post it to a porn site.&lt;ref name=Weiss9June2015/&gt; If the artist's terms are disregarded, the viewing is non-consensual. Rebecca Brink argued in ''[[The Frisky (website)|The Frisky]]'' that, as well as illustrating the nature of sexual consent, ''Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol'' challenges the position that art, once made public, is removed from the artist's control and is for the viewer alone to interpret.&lt;ref name=Brink5June2015&gt;Rebecca Brink, [http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-06-05/emma-sulkowiczs-ceci-nest-pas-un-viol-an-explainer "Emma Sulkowicz's “Ceci N’est Pas Un Viol”: An Explainer"], ''The Frisky'', 5 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cookie Bear''', otherwise known as '''CB''', is a familiar character in [[New Zealand]] originally associated with Hudsons and now Griffins biscuits. Cookie Bear's popularity grew with New Zealand children through the '''Cookie Bear Club''', their shared love of '''Chocolate Chippies''' and his famous catchphrase '''Dum-de-doo'''.

==Early years==
The New Zealand biscuit company Hudson was bought by [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury]] in the 1930s. In the early 1970s Don Donovan, a director of advertising agency Carlton-Carruthers du Chateau Ltd., suggested developing the Cookie Bear character for a couple of television advertisements. The black and white advertisements featured Cookie Bear (a man dressed in a bear suit) as a lover of biscuits who thought Hudson's brand was the best.&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://don-donovan.blogspot.com/2009/08/i-admit-it-i-am-cookie-bears-father.html|title=Don Donovan creates Cookie Bear|accessdate=2009-08-29|work=Don Donovan's World: I Admit It, I Am Cookie Bear’s Father}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cookie Bear Brand==
Cookie Bear's immediate popularity resulted in an increase in his use as a mascot for Hudson's biscuits, with eventual heavy use of his image in advertisements, on packaging and on a growing number of promotional items.&lt;ref name="Last Century"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itssolastcentury.co.uk/truck/Cookie_Bear|title=The Cookie Bear Brand|date=12 May 2011|accessdate=2011-02-13|work=It's So Last Century: Cookie Bear}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cookie Bear became particularly associated with '''Chocolate Chippies''', a hard round biscuit with chocolate chips.&lt;ref name="chippies"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com/biscuits/previous.php3?item=43|title='''Chocolate Chippies''' are biscuit of the week|accessdate=2008-02-22|work=Biscuit of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of Cookie Bear's popularity in 1975, John Berry wrote and published an illustrated children's book called ''The Adventures of Cookie Bear''.

When Hudsons was incorporated into [[Griffin's Foods]] (Hudson's main market rivals) in 1989,&lt;ref name="Griffin's"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.griffins.co.nz/about-griffins/the-griffins-story/1970s|title=Hudsons incorporated into Griffins|accessdate=2008-02-22|work=Griffins Foods Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; the copyright for Cookie Bear was also transferred; however, while Griffins continues to use the Cookie Bear Brand on some of its products and in a few advertisements, Cookie Bear is now a less familiar [[New Zealand]] cultural icon.&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt;

==The Cookie Bear Club==
Cookie Bear's fame and popularity escalated through the '''Cookie Bear Club''', which had a regular monthly page in the ''[[New Zealand Woman's Weekly]]'' magazine. Children throughout New Zealand joined the club, reaching a peak of 180,000 children, or 1 in 4 New Zealand children under the age of 12.&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt;  Members of the club received postcards on their birthday. Today's Cookie Bear Club has moved online to the official Cookie Bear Club website.&lt;ref name="Website"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cookiebear.co.nz/|title=The Cookie Bear Club|accessdate=2008-02-22|work=Griffin's Cookie Bear Club House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5906">[[File:The Cross of Justin II.jpg|thumb|Front side of the Cross of Justin II]]
The '''''Cross of Justin II''''' (also known as '''''Crux Vaticana''''', [[Latin]] for "Vatican Cross") is a [[processional cross]] dating from the sixth century that is kept in the Treasury in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], in Vatican City. It is also a one of the oldest surviving claimed [[reliquary|reliquaries]] of the [[True Cross]], if not the oldest.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;Vatican/Associated Press, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} It is a ''[[crux gemmata]]'' or jewelled cross, [[silver-gilt]] and adorned with jewels in gold settings, given to the people of Rome by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Justin II]], who reigned from 565 to 578, and his co-ruler and wife, the Empress [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]]. 

The cross bears a Latin inscription reading: ''ligno quo Christus humanum subdidit hostem dat Romae Iustinus opem et socia decorem'' which is commonly mistranslated as "For the wood [of the cross] with which human Christ was overcome by the enemy, Justin [and his consort?] give Rome this wealth and decoration"&lt;ref&gt;McClanan, 166&lt;/ref&gt;  A more accurate reading is: "With the wood with which Christ conquered man's enemy, Justin gives his help to Rome and his wife offers the ornamentation." &lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;  To mark the end of restoration and conservation work on the cross, it was placed on display in the main [[Basilica of Saint Peter's]] from November 2009 to April 12, 2010.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Crocetta d'oro longobarda con moneta di giustino II, da novara, VI-VIII sec..JPG|thumb|A different, and far humbler, small cross of gold foil, with rubbings of coins of [[Justin II]] and holes for nails or thread, Italian, 6th century]] 
The original portion of the cross, which is now mounted on a much later stand, is 15.75&amp;nbsp;inches high and 11.81&amp;nbsp;inches wide, excluding the spike at the bottom for fitting into its stand.  The cross was restored in 2009; it has been altered and restored at several points in its history, including reducing its size.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

The front of the cross has no figurative images: in the centre is a medallion containing the relic, which is itself displayed as cross-shaped.  The centres of the arms carry the inscriptions, and the edges of the arms jewels in set in gold, with four jewels hanging from the arms as [[pendilia]].  The reverse side is decorated in [[repoussé]] silver, and shows an interesting transitional stage in the decoration of the cross.  At the period the church was starting to encourage representation of the human figure of [[Christ]] on the cross, making a [[crucifix]], which [[Crucifixion in the arts|had previously not been usual]].  The central medallion shows the [[Lamb of God]], a common older formula.  Above and below this are images in medallions of Christ (the lower one may be [[John the Baptist]] instead).  The upper one shows Christ holding a book,&lt;ref&gt;Vatican Museums&lt;/ref&gt; representing the [[Gospel]]s, which was to become a standard feature of the image of [[Christ Pantocrator]]; in the lower one Christ or John has a blessing gesture.  At the ends of the arms, where the [[Virgin Mary]] and Saint [[John the Evangelist]] would often be found in later crucifixes, are instead portraits in medallions of Justin and his empress Sophia.&lt;ref&gt;McClanan, 167-8&lt;/ref&gt;    Between the medallions there are decorative foliage scrolling motifs, on the upright centred on onion-like plants probably intended as palm-trees.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated Cotsonis, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
In 569, Justin and Sophia together reportedly sent a relic of the [[True Cross]] to the [[Franks|Frankish]] princess [[Radegund]], who founded a monastery at [[Poitiers]] to house it. The event was commemorated in ''[[Vexilla Regis]]'' by [[Venantius Fortunatus]]. They are also recorded as sending relics to [[Pope John III]] (reigned 561-574) in an attempt to improve relations – the Crux Vaticana very likely dates from John's reign, perhaps around 568 or 569.&lt;ref&gt;McClanan, 167&lt;/ref&gt;   Older scholars thought, mainly on the basis of imperial head-dress, that [[Justin I]] (r. 518-27) and his empress [[Euphemia (empress)|Euphemia]] were the donors, but this view seems now rejected.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/15A*.html J. B. Bury, ''History of the Later Roman Empire''], Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd., 1923, which still expresses this view, originally from the German scholar Delbrück&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work summary==
Laramee's interest in the history and culture of science has resulted in collaborations with physicists, hydrologists, geologists, biogeographers, and ecologists since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phillip.

In the Making: Creative Options for Artists, New York, NY DAP Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Laramee believes that, "by sharing innovations, art-and-science collaborations can energize action to initiate positive social change and promote awareness of environmental and health issues by directly involving communities, extending ways in which cultures imagine, create and understand." &lt;ref&gt;Hannah, Dehlia.

Six minute video (detail from installation, "Invisible Fire")Uranium Decay (2012), draws attention to the dark, inverse form of alchemy of the [[Atomic Age]]. Responding to the ongoing [[Fukushima meltdown]]s the video illuminates the 4.47 billion-year [[half-life]] decay cycle of [[uranium-238]] superimposed onto thermographs and news footage. As uranium decays over geological time, it transmutes into “uranium daughters” that cascade into other elements and finally to stable Lead-206. As we are learning post-[[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]], when [[climate change]] occurs and vulnerability spectrums shift, nuclear sites and the life forms surrounding them are at increased risk.]]

In her recent creative work, Laramee speculates on how human beings use and misuse the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;Lippard, Lucy R. Weather Report: art and Climate Change, Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Artworks that investigate the environmental and health impacts of [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|atomic legacy sites]] track the invisible radioactive contamination, residues of the nuclear weapons complex and the [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] industry. This multifaceted work cites uranium mining, milling, plutonium production that have resulted in the contamination of surface water, well water and deep aquifer water, soil and air pollution, social injustice, and the consequences upon forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abatemarco|first=Michael|title=Invisible Disasters: Eve Andrée Laramée on our Atomic Zeitgeist|accessdate=|newspaper=The New Mexican, Pasatiemo|date=April 29 – May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her work on atomic legacy issues has been featured in the [[International Uranium Film Festival]]. Other forms of environmental degradation that she addresses are desertification, climate change, and dredging.

The aspects of the history of science that she explores include alchemy, subjectivity in scientific research, such legendary figures as Charles Darwin and Johannes Kepler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crary|first=Jonathan, Barbara Maria Stafford, Jennifer Riddell, Jessica Riskin|title=Eve Andrée Laramée: A Permutational Unfolding|date=1999|publisher=MIT List Center for Visual Art|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryzbilla|first=Carrie|title=Metaphysical Metaphors|date=1994|publisher=The High Museum of Art|location=Atlanta, Georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sozanski|first=Edward|title=Lending Art to Darwin’s Science|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental/ecological issues that appear in her work include [[commodification of nature]], the political and cultural history of the national parks in the USA, and the correlation between human blood and ocean water.

Their projects included artist-designed billboards, television, radio and print interventions, museum exhibitions, lectures, and performance art &lt;ref&gt;Durland, Steven (1986). "'Subersive Acts: ART/MEDIA" for example, introduced a radical alternative to media conventions&lt;/ref&gt; by disseminating political, environmental, and social activist art works to people who were not members of the traditional art audience.

==Major Works==

===Apparatus for the Distillation of Vague Intuitions===
Influenced by alchemy, this installation of hand blown glass vessels engraved with text refers to subjectivity, intuition, and guesswork in scientific inquiry. The art historian Ann Morris Reynolds describes this work as an ''"apparatus": a means by which a "distillation of vague intuitions" concerning art and science is performed. And true to the second meaning of the term, a political organization or an under ground political movement, Apparatus counters the business-as-usual experience of both. Science and art interrogate each other and the results are marvelous... and rare.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Ann Morris|title=Eve Andree Laramee: Histories of Science, Histories of Art|date=1999|publisher=Austin Museum of Art|location=Austin, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halfway to Invisible===
An installation comprising videos, kinetic sculpture, photography, and an archive of government documents, Halfway to the Invisible exposes the environmental legacy of uranium mining in the American Southwest. Between 1949 and 1980, these mines produced more than 225,000,000 tons of uranium ore. Epidemiological studies provide evidence of the effects upon the health of the  predominantly Native American laborers and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tauches|first=Karen|title=Eve Andree Laramee at Emory Visual Arts Gallery|url=http://burnaway.org/eve-andree-laramee-at-emory-visual-arts-gallery/|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slouching Towards Yucca Mountain===

This photo and video installation is a post-atomic science fiction Western featuring twelve time travelers exploring the desert locations of the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]], the [[Nevada Test Site]] (NNSS), and [[Death Valley National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis, editor|first=Peter|title=Slouching Towards Yucca Mountain|journal=/seconds.|date=September 18, 2010|volume=Submission|issue=14|url=http://www.slashseconds.co.uk/eve-andr-eacute-e-laram-eacute-e/14/105/224/submission/slouching-towards-yucca-mountain/|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luminous Darwin: The Lost Notebooks of Charles Darwin===

This installation of [[magic lantern]] styled video sculptures, faux historic devices, and didactic text referencing Darwin's late work on metaphysics. Laramee created three fictional notebooks she attributed to Darwin corresponding to the animal, vegetable, and mineral realms: "Notebook X: The Awareness of the Cells", "Notebook Y: The Dreams of the Plants", and "Notebook Z: The Memories of the Stones". This deviation from conventional scientific/historic exhibitions was installed within an actual historic exhibition, "Dialogues with Darwin" at the Museum of The American Philosophical Society, a repository for original Darwin materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=APS Museum|title=Online Galleries: Luminous Darwin|url=http://www.pachs.net/dialogues-with-darwin/galleries/C6/|publisher=American Philosophical Society|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SugarMud===

This installation, installed in the drawing room of a [[Gilded Age]] mansion consisted of a room-sized mound of golden-colored sugar that referenced two local issues. One was the golden hue associated with the historic [[Hudson River School]] of painters and the accumulated toxic sediment from the sugar factory sludge located on the shore of the Hudson River. Collaborating with environmental scientists, Laramee created [[Sediment Profile Imagery]] using benthic disturbance mapping of the river bottom documenting the channels where 80,000 tons of sludge were dredged and relocated to the ocean floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Princenthal|first=Nancy|title=An Unsettled River: Hudson River Projects|date=2004|publisher=Wave Hill Glyndor Gallery|location=Bronx, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Laramee's art has been exhibited throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. She has participated in exhibitions at the [[Venice Biennale]], Mass MOCA, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]], Chicago; the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]], New York; the High Museum of Art, Atlanta; the Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston; among other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=James|title=Art at the Armory: Occupied Territory|journal=ARTFORUM|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Beryl|title=Art and the Armory: Occupied Territory|date=1992|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
[[File:Courtyard SDSU.jpg|thumb|100 Years 100 Stones, public artwork by Eve Andree Laramee in the courtyard of SDSU]]
Laramee's work is included in the collections of the [[MacArthur Foundation]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]], The [[Fogg Art Museum]] of Harvard University, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the UCLA Armand [[Hammer Museum]], and other public and private collections.

'''Galeyi Beygurt''' ({{lang-az|Qaleyi Bəyqurt}}), also known as '''Galey-Bughurt''' ({{lang-az|Qəley-Buğurt}}) or simply '''Bughurt fortress''' ({{lang-az|Buğurt qalası}}) is a historic monument located 20&amp;nbsp;km north-east of the center of [[Shamakhi]] city.

==Location==
The fortress is located at the summit of the mountain near Galeybughurd village and 1,600 meters above the sea level. The mountain, where the fortress is located is surrounded by Maiden Tower and Cangi mountain from the south, Tana mountain and the Alchalı Pir forest from the east, Mount Ulguc from the north and Galadarasi from the west.&lt;ref&gt;''Ciddi H.''

==History==
It is unknown when the fortress was built.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Ciddi H.'' [http://ebooks.preslib.az/pdfbooks/azbooks/ciddihuseyn_bugrut.pdf Buğurt qalası] / elmi red. R.

It is often referred to in the sources of the XV century.&lt;ref name="triptoazerbaijan"&gt;{{cite web|title= Galeyi Bughurt (11th-13th centuries)|url= http://triptoazerbaijan.com/en/things-to-do/galeyi-bughurt-11th-13th-centuries/|publisher= triptoazerbaijan.com|language= en|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===During Shirvanshahs===
The fortress was a shelter for Shirvanshah during Mongol conquest.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It was also used during the period of Shirvanshah [[Kayqubad I of Shirvan|Kequbad]] and [[Kavus I|Kavus]].&lt;ref&gt;Б.Дорн.

[[Shahrukh of Shirvan|Shahrukh]] and lawyer Hussein Bey, who retreated into the Bughurt fortress, could resist the Safavids for several months.&lt;ref name="triptoazerbaijan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Həsən bəy Rumlu, Əhsən ət-Təvarix, səh. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Also, at that time, the treasury of the Shirvanshahs was kept at the Bughurt fortress.

===During Safavids===
According to [[Iskandar Beg Munshi|Iskandar Munshi]]’s writings, during these wars both Gulustan and Bugurt fortresses was destroyed by the order of [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasp]]. During march of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] to Shirvan, [[Abdollah Khan Ustajlu|Abdollah Khan]] was beylerbey of Shirvan. At this time, the head of the Turkish troops, Gasim Bey used Bugurt fortress as a defensive point. It proves Iskandar Munshi’s claim wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''Ciddi H.''

'''Gustave Achille Guillaumet''' (26 March 1840 – 14 March 1887) was a French artist.  He is best known for his paintings of [[North Africa]].

==Early life==
Gustave Guillaumet was born in 1840 in [[Puteaux]] (now in the [[Hauts-de-Seine]], Paris).

==Career==
[[Image:Gustave Guillaumet- Le Sahara.jpeg|thumb|right|''Le Sahara'']]Guillaumet was initially a student of [[François-Edouard Picot]]&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Guillaumet.  In 'Art Experts, Inc.'.

In 'The National Gallery'. Retrieved 19:13, April 1, 2012, from http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/gustave-guillaumet&lt;/ref&gt; where he became a student of [[Alexandre Abel de Pujol]].&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Guillaumet.

In 'Art Renewal Center Museum'. Retrieved 09:04, April 2, 2012, from http://www.artrenewal.org/pages/artist.php?artistid=293&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 Guillaumet entered the Historical Landscape category of the [[Prix de Rome]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} for a scholarship to study at the [[Academy of France in Rome]].  On failing to win, he instead travelled across the Mediterranean to [[Algeria]], in north Africa.  While there he contracted malaria and had to spend three months at the military hospital in Biskra{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}.

Guillaumet visited Algeria ten times between 1861 and 1867.&lt;ref&gt;''Mountains in North Africa, with a Bedouin Camp''. In National Gallery.  Retrieved 18:45, April 2, 2012, from http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/gustave-guillaumet-mountains-in-north-africa-with-a-bedouin-camp&lt;/ref&gt;  He preferred to travel in the south{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} and many of his works depict the life of the people of the desert.

Whereas [[Orientalism]] generally gave a deliberately idealised or anecdotal picture of north Africa, Guillaumet's work was notable for portraying the harshness of life in a desert region. ''The Sahara'' features the carcass of a camel in the foreground with a caravan - or mirage of one - on the horizon and empty desert in-between. It was first exhibited to considerable success at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Le Sahara also called Le désert.  In 'Musée d'Orsay'.

Between 1879 and 1884 ''[[La Nouvelle Revue]]'' published tableaux of Algerian scenes collected together by Guillaumet.  These were later published as a book, ''Tableaux Algériens''.  It includes twelve echings by Guillaumet, Courtry, [[Paul Edmé Le Rat]], [[Adolphe-Alphonse Géry-Bichard]], [[August Müller (orientalist)|August Müller]] and Toussaint; six photogravures by Dujardin and one hundred and twenty-eight engravings in relief from drawings and sketches by Guillaumet, himself.  The book was published in 1888, after Guillaumet's death and is prefaced by a note on his life by [[Eugène Mouton]].&lt;ref&gt;GUILLAUMET (Gustave).  In 'Librería Anticuaria Comellas'.

==Personal life==
His son [[Gustave Guillaume]] (whose family name was changed), born in 1883, became a famous linguist.

==Death==
Guillaumet died in Paris in 1887. Speculation about the circumstances of his death, supposedly of peritonitis, was published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on April 6.  The article claimed that Guillaumet had left his wife and son to live with "a lady who was his senior by many years" but that a few weeks before his death he had shot himself following an argument with his mistress.  {{quote|"The bullet lodged in his intestines, and he lingered from that moment in the agonies of a painful illness, terminated by death. His last words after the bullet had entered his body were for his wife and son, who, on being informed of the tragical occurrence, came and nursed him until his death.  The painter died in his studio, whither he was carried at his own request. He wanted to see his Oriental sketches for the last time."|unattributed|The New York Times, April 6, 1887&lt;ref&gt;''Painter Guillaumet's tragic death''. ''The New York Times'', April 6, 1887.

Guilaumet is buried in [[Montmartre Cemetery]].  His tomb bears a sculpture by [[Louis-Ernest Barrias]] of a ''Young girl from [[Bou Saâda]]'', dropping flowers onto a portrait of Guillaumet embossed on a medallion.&lt;ref&gt;P1070012 by jimread99.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5112">'''''Guðmundar saga biskups''''' or ''Guðmundar saga Arasonar'' is an [[Iceland]]ic [[Bishops' sagas|bishops' saga]], existing in several different versions, recounting the life of Bishop [[Guðmundur Arason]] (1161-1237). Since the saga survives in different versions, it is common to speak of it in the plural, as ''Guðmundar sögur'' (rather than ''Guðmundar saga'').

The first version, known as the ''Prestssaga Guðmundar byskups'', was composed soon after Guðmundur‘s death in 1237, possibly at the instigation of abbot Lambkárr Þorgilsson (d. 1249). It recounts the bishop‘s life as a young man and priest but stops abruptly during a description of Guðmundr's voyage to Norway for consecration in 1202. It may therefore be unfinished. However, it is preserved only through its integration into the later ''Guðmundar sögur'' and ''[[Sturlunga saga]]''.

A series of four sagas about Bishop Guðmundr, known as ''Guðmundar sögur'' A, B, C, and D, were then written between 1314 and 1344, in what seems to have been a concerted attempt to canonise Guðmundr. Stefán Karlsson has connected the composition of ''Guðmundar sögur'' A, B, and possibly C, to the translation of Guðmundur's relics by Bishop [[Auðunn rauði Þorbergsson]] in 1314, while ''Guðmundar saga'' D was apparently composed by [[Arngrímr Brandsson]] for the second translation of Guðmundur's relics by Bishop Ormr Ásláksson in 1344.

* ''Guðmundar saga A'' (sometimes known as the 'oldest saga') is from the first half of the fourteenth century, most likely 1320-30. It combines the ''Prestssaga'' with other material from ''[[Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar]]'', ''[[Íslendinga saga]]'', ''[[Arons saga Hjörleifssonar]]'', and annals, with little original writing by the compiler. The main manuscript of this version is AM 399 4to (c. 1330×50).
* ''Guðmundar saga B'' (sometimes known as the 'middle saga') probably dates from shortly after 1320. It combines material from ''Prestssaga'', ''[[Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar]]'', ''[[Íslendinga saga]]'', and additional material, with authorial commentary, and aims to write Bishop Guðmundr as a saint. The main manuscript is AM 657c 4to (c. 1350).
* ''Guðmundar saga C'' (which has yet to be edited) was based either on ''B'' or the same sources, around 1320-45.&lt;ref&gt;Sections are presented by Peter Foote, 'Bishop Jörundr Þorsteinsson and the relics of Guðmundr inn góði Arason‘, in Studia Centenalia in Honorem Memoriae Benedikt S. Þórarinsson (Reykjavík: Ísafold, 1961), pp 98-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the earlier versions, written in the spartan, classical saga-style, version C was consistently rewritten in the 'florid style' associated with the [[North Icelandic Benedictine School]] of saga-writing. It may have been made by [[Bergr Sokkason]]. The rearrangements of the source material seem to have been intended to produce the life of a confessor, with a ''vita'' followed by a list of ''post mortem'' miracles. C survives only in incomplete, seventeenth-century manuscripts.
* ''Guðmundar saga D'', based on the C-text, was by a monk called Arngrímr, generally thought to be [[Arngrímr Brandsson]], and can be seen as belonging in style to the [[North Icelandic Benedictine School]] of saga-writing. It was composed after 1343; the oldest manuscript is Stockholm Perg. fol. no. 5 (c. 1350-60); and two different versions seem to have been in circulation early in the version's history. Version D both omits and adds material in its efforts to strengthen Guðmundr's saintly image. This version included praise-poetry of Guðmundr by the author and by another poet, thought to be [[Einarr Gilsson]]. The various explanations of Icelandic customs in the saga suggest that it was intended for a foreign audience, and it has been suggested that D is a translation from Latin. No such Latin text is known, however.

The '''International Association of Empirical Aesthetics''' ('''IAEA''') is a [[psychology|psychological]] [[organization]] founded to scientifically investigate the nature of [[aesthetic experience]] and aesthetic behavior. The group has members in over 25 countries. IAEA was founded at the first international congress in Paris in 1965 by [[Daniel Berlyne]], [[Robert Francés]], [[Carmelo Genovese]], and [[Albert Wellek]]. 

==Background==
Although IAEA has been active for half a century, the domain of experimental aesthetics is much older. It is the second-oldest branch of scientific psychology, traditionally dating from 1876, the year Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887) published his ''Vorschule der Aesthetik'' (Preschool of Aesthetics). Fechner, who also is credited with founding psychophysics, established methods for examining aesthetic response to a variety of visual forms, including an exploration of the venerable Golden Section hypothesis. Since the inception of IAEA in 1965, research on empirical aesthetics has continued to progress, with many pioneers prominent in its membership: witness, for instance, such classic books such as Daniel Berlyne’s (1971) ''Aesthetics and Psychobiology'', Colin Martindale’s (1990) ''The Clockwork Muse: The Predictability of Artistic Change'', or a variety of more recent contributions from IAEA’s current members.

==Current situation==
The International Association of Empirical Aesthetics (IAEA) is an organization of researchers who use scientific methods to investigate aesthetic experience and aesthetic behavior in a wide variety of domains, including encounters with beauty, visual art, music, literature, film, theater, philosophy, and museum behavior. Our membership includes individuals from psychology, neuroscience, sociology, museology, art history, philosophy, musicology, and other domains.

Currently, the officers of IAEA are President [[Helmut Leder]] (Vienna), Secretary Stefano Mastandrea (Rome) and Treasurer Thomas Jacobsen (Hamburg). A list of former officers can be found on the IAEA webpage.

IAEA organizes bi-annual conferences. IAEA is closely associated with the journal ''[[Empirical Studies in the Arts]]''. IAEA gives several awards to recognize excellence in empirical research on aesthetics and creativity:  The [[Gustav Theodor Fechner Award]] for Outstanding Contributions to [[Empirical Aesthetics]].  The Sir Francis Galton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Study of Creativity. The Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten Award for Outstanding Contributions of Young Scientists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7366">The '''inverted spectrum''' is the [[wikt:hypothetical|hypothetical]] concept of two people sharing their [[color]] vocabulary and discriminations, although the colors one sees &amp;mdash; one's [[qualia]] &amp;mdash; are systematically different from the colors the other person sees. 

[[Image:Inverted qualia of colour strawberry.jpg|thumb|250px|Inverted qualia]]

The concept dates back to [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;(In this passage, Locke uses "idea" to mean something like "mental image", rather than its modern meaning. He also uses "texture" to mean the physical property that gives rise to a color-sensation) "Neither would it carry any Imputation of ''Falshood'' to our simple ''Ideas'', if by the different Structure of our Organs, it were so ordered, That ''the same Object should produce in several Men's Minds different'' Ideas at the same time; v.g. if the ''Idea,'' that a ''Violet'' produced in one Man's Mind by his Eyes, were the same that a ''Marigold'' produces in another Man's, and vice versâ. For since this could never be known: because one Man's Mind could not pass into another Man's Body, to perceive, what Appearances were produced by those Organs; neither the ''Ideas'' hereby, nor the Names, would be at all confounded, or any ''Falshood'' be in either. For all Things, that had the Texture of a ''Violet'', producing constantly the ''Idea'', which he called ''Blue'', and those that had the Texture of a ''Marigold'', producing constantly the ''Idea'', which he as constantly called ''Yellow'', whatever those Appearances were in his Mind; he would be able as regularly to distinguish Things for his Use by those Appearances, and understand, and signify those distinctions, marked by the Names ''Blue'' and ''Yellow'', as if the Appearances, or ''Ideas'' in his Mind, received from those two Flowers, were exactly the same, with the Ideas in other Men's Minds." Locke, J., 1689/1975, Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It invites us to imagine that we wake up one morning, and find that for some unknown reason all the colors in the world have been inverted. Furthermore, we discover that no physical changes have occurred in our brains or bodies that would explain this phenomenon. Supporters of the hypothesis of qualia as [[Non-physical entity|non-physical entities]] argue that, since we can imagine this happening without contradiction, it follows that we are imagining a change in a property that determines the way things look to us, but that has no physical basis. In more detail:

#Metaphysical [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] holds of necessity
#[[Modal logic|If something is possibly false, it is not necessary]]
#It is conceivable that qualia could have a different relationship to physical brain-states
#If it is conceivable, then it is [[Logical possibility|possible]]
#Since it is possible for qualia to have a different relationship with physical brain-states, they cannot be identical to brain states (by 1).
#Therefore, qualia are non physical.

The argument thus states that if we find the inverted spectrum plausible, we must admit that qualia exist (and are non physical). Some philosophers find it absurd that an "armchair argument" can prove something to exist, and the detailed argument does involve many assumptions about conceivability and possibility, which are open to criticism. Perhaps it is not possible for a given brain state to produce anything other than a given quale in our universe, and that is all that matters.

The idea that an inverted spectrum would be undetectable is also open to criticism on more scientific grounds:&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-inverted/ ''Inverted Qualia'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, C. L., 1987, “Qualia and Materialism: Closing the Explanatory Gap”, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 48: 281-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|...there are more perceptually distinguishable shades between red and blue than there are between green and yellow, which would make red-green inversion behaviorally detectable. And there are yet further asymmetries. Dark yellow is brown (qualitatively different from yellow), whereas dark blue is blue[..] Similarly, desaturated bluish-red is pink (qualitatively different from saturated bluish-red), whereas desaturated greenish-yellow is similar to saturated greenish-yellow. Again, red is a “warm” color, whereas blue is “cool” — and perhaps this is not a matter of learned associations with temperature.}}

Inverted spectrum arguments have applications to [[behavioralism]], [[physicalism]], [[representationalism]], [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], [[skepticism]] and the [[hard problem of consciousness]].

Vincent Conitzer has illustrated the possibility of an inverted spectrum using the following scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone is observing a [[simulated reality]] through a [[virtual reality|VR]] headset, and is not aware that she is wearing a headset or that what she is observing is a simulation.  Conitzer argues that the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation can be separated from the code that determines ''in which colors'' the simulation is displayed by the headset (as well as determining ''which perspective'' in the simulation to display).  So, it would be possible to change that additional code, inverting the displayed colors, without changing anything about the simulated physics.  Hence, which (real-world) colors are displayed is a [[further facts|further fact]] over and above the facts of the simulated physics.

In his book ''[[I Am A Strange Loop]]'', [[Douglas Hofstadter]] argues that the inverted spectrum argument entails a form of [[solipsism]] in which people can have no idea about what goes on in the minds of others—contrary to the central theme of his work. He presents several variants to demonstrate the absurdity of this idea: the "inverted [[political spectrum]]", in which one person's concept of [[liberty]] is identical to another's concept of [[imprisonment]]; an [[Voice inversion|inverted "sonic spectrum"]] in which low [[musical notes]] sound like "high" ones and vice versa (which he says is impossible because low sounds can be felt physically as vibrations); and a version in which random, complex [[qualia]] such as riding a roller coaster or opening presents are reversed, so that everyone perceives the world in radically different, unknowable ways.

'''Jack of The North''' identifies an otherwise untitled, short dialogue responding to and supporting anti-[[enclosure]] actions in [[Cambridgeshire]] in 1549, the year before [[Kett's Rebellion]]. The text is printed in [[Charles Henry Cooper]]'s ''Annals of Cambridge'', which names the source as "Dr. Lamb's Cambridge Documents". The dialogue participants are Jack of the North beyond the style, Robbyn Clowte, Tom of Trompington, Buntynge on the Hyll, Peter Potter, Pyrse Plowman, Symon Slater, Harry Clowte, Whyp Wylliam, and Hodge Hasteler. The two Clowtes and [[Piers Plowman|Pyrse Plowman]] were established poetic personnae from [[John Skelton]] and [[William Langland]]; both would later appear in the poetry of [[Edmund Spenser]].

{{nihongo|'''Living National Treasure'''|人間国宝|Ningen Kokuhō}} is a Japanese popular term for those individuals certified as {{nihongo|'''Preservers of Important Intangible Cultural Properties'''|重要無形文化財保持者|Jūyō Mukei Bunkazai Hojisha}} by the [[MEXT|Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] as based on Japan's {{nihongo|[[Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties]]|文化財保護法|Bunkazai Hogohō}}. The term "Living National Treasure" is not formally mentioned in the law, but is an informal term referencing the cultural properties designated as the [[National Treasure (Japan)|National Treasures]].

== History ==
Before 1947, a system for {{Nihongo|[[Imperial Household Artist]]s|帝室技芸員|Teishitsu Gigei-in}} was in place. 

Under the 1950 Law for Protection of Cultural Properties, intangible cultural properties are defined as dramatic, musical, artistic, and other intangible cultural artifacts of high value in terms of Japanese history or art (Article 2, Section 1, Part 2).  Those intangible cultural properties of especial importance can be designated as "Important Intangible Cultural Properties" by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Article 71, Section 1). 

In other words, intangible cultural properties are certain artistic skills. Those individuals or groups who have attained high levels of mastery in those certain skills can be designated as preservers of them by the Japanese government for the purpose of ensuring their continuation. Living National Treasure is a term for those designated as keepers of important intangible cultural properties.

== Types of Certification ==
There are three types of certification: 
* {{nihongo|'''Individual Certification'''|各個認定|Kakko Nintei}}:  this designation is for individuals who "have attained high mastery" of an art or craft.
* {{nihongo|'''Collective Certification'''|総合認定|Sōgō Nintei}}: this designation is for groups of 2 or more who as a group working in common have attained high mastery of an art or craft.
* {{nihongo|'''Preservation Group Certification'''|保持団体認定|Hoji Dantai Nintei}}: this designation is for large groups who have mastered an art or craft in which individual character is not emphasized.

Of the three types, generally only those to have received "Individual Certification" are referred to as Living National Treasures. Those working in artistic fields such as drama and music receive Individual and Collective Certifications, while those working in the crafts receive Individual or Preservation Group Certifications.

==Support System==
The [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]], with the goal of preserving important intangible cultural assets, provides a special annual grant of 2 million yen to Living National Treasures. In the case of groups, the government helps defray the costs of public exhibitions and activities necessary to continue the group. The [[National Theater of Japan]] provides training programs to help train successors in such arts as [[Noh]], [[Bunraku]], and [[Kabuki]].

Many of the craft artisans are also members of the [[Japan Kōgei Association]].

==Categories==
To date Living National Treasures have been certified for 16 categories of Intangible Cultural Properties:
* Performing Arts: [[Gagaku]], [[Noh]], [[Bunraku]], [[Kabuki]], [[Kumi Odori]], [[Traditional Japanese Music|Music]], [[Japanese traditional dance|Dance]], and [[Theatre of Japan|Drama]]
* [[Japanese craft]]s: [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|Ceramics]], [[Textiles]], [[Japanese lacquerware|Lacquerware]], [[Metalworking]], [[Japanese traditional dolls|Dollmaking]], [[Woodworking]], [[Papermaking]], and Miscellaneous Crafts

The '''Lydenburg Heads''' refer to seven [[terracotta]] heads that were discovered in association with other pottery artefacts in [[Lydenburg]], [[Mpumalanga]], South Africa. They are among the oldest known African [[Iron Age]] artworks from below the equator.&lt;ref name="LH2" /&gt; Other artefacts found in association with these heads include [[ceramic]] vessels, iron and copper beads, and bone fragments. Charcoal associated with the heads was [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]], and this [[relative dating]] technique places these artefacts and the site at around 1410 [[Before Present|BP]] (approximately 500 A.D.), which constitutes one of the earliest dates for an [[Iron Age]] settlement in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitelaw|first=Gavin|date=1996|title=Lydenburg Revisited: Another Look at The Mpumalanga Early Iron Age Sequence|url=|journal=The South African Archaeological Bulletin|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

== Artifacts ==
[[File:Castle of Good Hope - Lydenburg Head.jpg|left|thumb|One of seven ceramic heads found near Lydenburg]]

The recovered pottery [[Sherd|shard]]s were reconstructed largely at the [[University of Cape Town]], and assembled into two large heads and five smaller heads.  One of the larger heads constitute an incomplete specimen.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inskeep|first=R.R.|date=May 1975|title=Unique Art Objects in the Iron Age of the Transvall, South Africa|url=|journal=South African Archaeological Bulletin|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstructed heads provide a glimpse into the craftsmen's skill and preciseness of artistry, even though they may not look exactly how they looked 1500 years ago. Six of the heads share human characteristics, while a single head has animal-like features. The presence of linear patterned neck rings are postulated to represent a marker of prosperity or wealth, due to their symbolic use throughout time.&lt;ref name="maggs"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Lydenburg Heads|jstor = 3335725|journal = African Arts|date = 1 February 1981|pages = 28–88|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.2307/3335725|first = Tim|last = Maggs|first2 = Patricia|last2 = Davison}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seven, only two are large enough to have been worn, but the size is not the only observable variation between them. The two aforementioned heads constitute the only specimens with small animal figurines, perceived to be lions, mounted on top of them.&lt;ref name="maggs" /&gt; The other five are more similar in size and appearance, with one exception. This head is the only head that seems to resemble something other than a human. It has a long snout instead of regular protruding lips and also has no ears.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/lyde/hd_lyde.htm|title=Lydenburg Heads (ca. 500)|date=October 2003|website=Timeline of Art History|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation of associated artefacts was limited due to the primary significance of the heads; however, we do know that the associated pottery sherds were identified as [[terracotta]].

These heads are speculated to have been covered in white [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]], and glittering [[specularite]] at the time of their use.  The smaller heads, #3–7 have small perforations on their sides.   These perforations may have been some sort of framework to be worn as a headdress, or some part of a significant structure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Head Characteristics==
The heads share a basic pot like formation with subtle differences in the way they were each shaped.  The base formed at the bottom of all the heads was completed like the rim of a pot. Parts of the rim are rounded, however some parts of the base reflects a flat squared shape. While the Basal rings may be incised or moulded the neck rings above these basal rings contain diagonally incised rings that circle the entire neck.  The incised pattern constitutes hatch marks that alternate in direction producing a herringbone pattern.  While the specimens are similar in manufacture, they also have varying characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Some specimens are better preserved than others, as in the case of the ears.  The ears were all manufactured in the same way.  A plate of clay was moulded to the side of the specimen where the ear would be anatomically.  The outer edge of the ears were rounded and sloped down and slightly forward.  Ear lobes are not presented in any of the specimens however there is a small peg of clay placed above the area where the ear attached to the head.  This clay peg is postulated to represent the cartilaginous projection usually found in the a normal human ear.  Each head features similar notched ridges made by applying wet strips of clay and incising lines before the clay had dried.  These notches vary in position and shape along the face.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other similar features include the eyes, mouth and nose; these characteristics are detailed below.

===Head #1===

The basal neck rings are moulded on this head.  The mouth is located directly above the upper neck ring.  Two crescent shaped pieces of clay were joined at the edges to form the lips which then taper into the cheeks.  The lips are open approximately 10mm.  The lips have been cut completely through to the face which constitutes an open mouth that includes no teeth.  The eyes are placed in the middle of the face.  The eyes are made by slits cut through to the wall of the faced.  The left and right ears are intact.  There are three horizontal notched ridges on the face located one above the other.   One notched ridge is found between the eyes running vertical.  Two sets of horizontal notches are located towards the side of the face placed between the outer eye socket and the placement of the ears. The horizontal ridges found below the placement of the eyes are not notched, they constitute smooth raised ridges. This is the only head with smooth ridges. Above the crown outlining the edge of the face are groupings of clay studs. These features are only seen in this head specifically and portions of Head No. 2&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Head #2===

This head is too fragmented for precise characteristic recording. The basal neck rings are moulded.  The mouth is located directly above the upper neck ring.  Two crescent shaped pieces of clay were joined at the edges to form the lips which then taper into the cheeks.  The lips have been cut completely through to the face which constitutes an open mouth that includes no teeth.  The eyes are placed in the middle of the face.  The eyes are made by slits cut through to the wall of the faced.  The left ear is intact.  The ridges on this head are similar to those in Head No. 1 excepet the horizontal ridges below the eyes are incised with notches and not smooth.  There are two vertical ridges with incised notches located between the eyes and extend toward the upper most portion of the forehead. There is a grouping of several applied clay studs on one of the pieces that constitute this head as seen in Head No. 1&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Head #3===

Head # 3 has perforations that measure approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter on both sides of the neck toward the lower portion of the hatched rings.  The basal neck rings are incised.  The mouth is within the upper neck ring. Two crescent shaped pieces of clay were joined at the edges to form the lips which then taper into the cheeks.  The lips are open approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm.  Teeth were made by inserting clay pegs between the lip gaps.  There is a large gap depicted between the two front teeth.  The eyes are placed in the middle of the face. The eyes were made by cutting into applied pieces of clay.  The left ear is intact.  This head has three horizontal ridges with incised lines between the eyes.  A single ridge extending towards the forehead is also notched and curves toward the left side of the face.  There are single notched ridges extending from the eye to the top part of the ear on both sides of the head.  Below these, a notched ridge extends horizontally across the cheek to the bottom of the ear.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Head #4===

This head has perforations that measure approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter on both sides of the neck toward the lower portion of the hatched rings.  The basal neck rings are insiced.  The mouth is within the upper neck ring.  Two crescent shaped pieces of clay were joined at the edges to form the lips which then taper into the cheeks.  The lips are open approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm.   Teeth were made by inserting clay pegs between the lip gaps.  There is a large gap depicted between the two front teeth.  The eyes are placed in the middle of the face.  The eyes were made by cutting into applied pieces of clay.  The left and right ears are intact.  The notched ridges in this specimen are similar to Head # 3 except the ridge on the right side of the face extending across the cheek is not intact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Head #5===

This head has perforations that measure approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter on both sides of the neck toward the lower portion of the hatched rings.  The basal neck rings are incised.  This head has the only example of cross hatching on the neck.  The mouth is within the upper neck ring.  Two crescent shaped pieces of clay were joined at the edges to form the lips which then taper into the cheeks.  The lips are open approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm.  Teeth were made by inserting clay pegs between the lip gaps.  There is a large gap depicted between the two front teeth.  The eyes are placed in the middle of the face.  The eyes were made by cutting into applied pieces of clay.  There are three horizontal notched ridges between the eyes.  The orientation of notched ridges are similar to Heads No. 2, #3, and No. 4.  All Ridges on face are notched.  The vertical notched ridge extends in a straight line from the middle eye ridges across the forehead; unlike the previous mentioned heads whose forehead ridges curve to one side of the head.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Head #6===

This head has perforations that measure approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter on both sides of the neck toward the lower portion of the hatched rings.  The basal neck rings are inciesed.  The mouth is missing in this specimen.  The eyes are placed towards the lower portion of the face. The eyes were made by cutting into applied pieces of clay. The right eye is missing.   The left ear is intact. The ridge patterning on the face is similar to Heads No. 2, #3, and No. 4.  This includes three incised ridges running horizontal between the eyes, one ridge running horizontal from the outer corner of the eye to the top of the ear, on both sides; and one notched ridge extending across the cheek to the bottom of the ear on both sides of the face.  The major difference in this specimen is that the single, vertical, notched-ridge extending from the middle of the eye ridges across the forehead, curves to the right of the face.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Head #7===

This head has perforations that measure approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter on both sides of the neck toward the lower portion of the hatched rings.  The basal neck rings are incised.  The mouth appears as a protruding snout, that has a downward slope which flares out over the upper most neck ring.  Teeth were made by inserting clay pegs between the lip gaps.  There is a large gap depicted between the two left side teeth.  This specimen represents a differing [[Morphology (archaeology)|morphology]] compared to the other six heads.  The face of this specimen was created to bulge outwards and down wards with the nose being set low towards the exaggerated lips.  The positioning of the lips and nose give this head the appearance of an animal snout.  The eyes were made by cutting into applied pieces of clay.  This head does not have ears like the other specimens.  The notched ridges on this head Varies widely from the previous specimens.  Where the other heads share three notched ridges between the eyes, this specimen has a long notched ridge extending from the protruding mouth vertically between the eyes towards the forehead which then curves to the left side of the face.  Like the other heads Head No. 7 had horizontal notched ridges extending from the outer corner of the eyes, but these ridges slope downward to the bottom of where ears would be positioned.  There are no horizontal ridges running across the cheek as in the other specimens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Iziko Lydenburg Heads Pottery fragments.JPG|thumb|Fragments of domestic pottery from the site with similar decoration to the Lydenburg heads]]

The current speculation surrounding the Lydenburg Heads is that they may have been created to serve ritualistic and or ceremonial purposes including initiation rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The two larger specimens could have been worn by a small individual such as young man. If so, these heads may represent a significant point in a boy's life such as becoming a man, or ceremonial purposes like memorialising an ancestor.&lt;ref name="maggs" /&gt; The five smaller heads have holes in their sides which some archaeologists suggest may have been used to connected them to something at the time of their use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The marks across the foreheads and between the eyes are postulated to represent scarification marks, a widely practice behaviour in Africa.  However, no evidence of [[scarification]] is seen practised within the modern descendents of those who manufactured the heads.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Researchers suggest that the heads may not have been just disposed of but purposely buried,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.messagetoeagle.com/lydenburgheads.php#.Vmh-CXarS1t|title=Mysterious Creators of Lydenburg Heads - MessageToEagle.com|website=www.messagetoeagle.com|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or destroyed at the conclusion of a specified ceremony,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which may indicate their significance.  These heads may be a result of ceremonial ritual or aggrandizement of significant ancestors.   The heads show charicteristics of several different groups throughout the continent including; The [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu]], The [[Southern Ndebele people|Ndebele]],and The [[Bini people|Bini]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''''Madonna and Child with Two Angels''''' is a painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]], dating to c. 1468-1469. It is now in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]], in [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was once attributed to [[Filippino Lippi]], master of Botticelli. The composition essentially derives from Botticelli's master (and [[Filippino Lippi]]'s father) [[Filippo Lippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 32&lt;/ref&gt;  The faces and other details suggest around the same period of the ''[[Fortitude (Botticelli)|Fortitude]]'' and the other juvenile Madonnas of the Italian painter. The composition is similar to [[Verrocchio]]'s ''[[The Virgin and Child with Two Angels (Andrea del Verrochio)|Madonna of the Milk]]'', probably dating to a year or two earlier.

'''Marius Alexander Jacques Bauer''' (25 January 1867 &amp;ndash; 18 July 1932) was a Dutch painter, etcher and lithographer, best known for his  [[Orientalism|Oriental]] scenes. His style was largely [[Impressionistic]], although it also derived to some extent from the [[Hague School]]. Many of his works were based on photographs he bought during his travels, some of which were by famous photographers such as [[Félix Bonfils]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[The Hague]]. His father was a stage painter who encouraged his son's early interest in drawing. From 1878 to 1885, he studied at the [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague|Royal Academy of Art]], under the direction of [[Jan Philip Koelman]], but thought his approach was too conservative and left without graduating.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Biography and timeline @ the Marius Bauer website (see external links).&lt;/ref&gt; While there, his works were awarded several medals and he received a stipend from King [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]], which enabled him to study independently.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://www.schilderijen-site.nl/woordenboek/marius-bauer/ Brief biography] @ Schilderijen Site.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bauer-Prayer.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Adhan|Call to Prayer]]]]
In 1888, he made a study trip to [[Istanbul]], financed by the art dealership, Van Wisselingh &amp; Co., and decided to make Orientalism his principal subject.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Later, he made numerous trips to Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, India, Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies, sketching and collecting items for Van Wisselingh. He also worked as an illustrator for the short-lived literary journal, ''{{ill|De Kroniek|nl}}'', attending the coronation of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] on its  behalf.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

In 1894, he won a first-class medal at the [[Exposition Internationale d'Anvers (1894)|Exposition Internationale d'Anvers]]. Two years later, he was awarded the [[Willink van Collenprijs]]. He received the Grand Prix at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]]. In 1902 he married the painter [[Jo Bauer-Stumpff|Jo Stumpff]], one of the [[Amsterdamse Joffers]].&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; This was followed by a successful showing at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]. He would continue to exhibit regularly throughout Europe and North America.

In 1900, he was named a [[Ridder (title)|Ridder]] in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]]. Six years later, he was upgraded to an Officer for his contributions to the [[Rembrandt]] Tri-centennial.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; In 1911, King [[Albert I of Belgium]] awarded him the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] and, in 1927, he became a Ridder in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]]. He was a long-standing member of the [[Pulchri Studio]] and [[Arti et Amicitiae]]. In 1930, he became an honorary member of the [[Senefelder Club]].&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;  Two years later, he died of a stroke. A street is named after him in the neighborhood of streets dedicated to 19th- and 20th-century Dutch painters in [[Overtoomse Veld]], Amsterdam.

In 1996, the "Bauer Documentatie Stichting" (BDS) was established. Its goal is to raise awareness of his works and do more research on the sources of his paintings.

'''Molecular symmetry''' in [[chemistry]] describes the [[symmetry]] present in [[molecule]]s and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry.  Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in chemistry, as it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's [[chemical property|chemical properties]], such as its [[molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] and its allowed [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic transitions]]. Many university level textbooks on [[physical chemistry]], [[quantum chemistry]], and [[inorganic chemistry]] devote a chapter to symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Chemistry'', Third Edition John P. Lowe, Kirk Peterson {{ISBN|0-12-457551-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach'' by Donald A. McQuarrie, John D.

The predominant framework for the study of molecular symmetry is [[group theory]]. Symmetry is useful in the study of [[molecular orbital]]s, with applications such as the [[Hückel method]], [[ligand field theory]], and the [[Woodward-Hoffmann rule]]s. Another framework on a larger scale is the use of [[crystal system]]s to describe [[crystallography|crystallographic]] symmetry in bulk materials.  
 
Many techniques for the practical assessment of molecular symmetry exist, including [[X-ray crystallography]] and various forms of [[spectroscopy]]. [[Spectroscopic notation]] is based on symmetry considerations.

The study of symmetry in molecules makes use of [[group theory]].

=== Elements ===
The point group symmetry of a molecule can be described by 5 types of [[symmetry element]]. 
{{anchor|axis}}
* '''Symmetry axis''': an axis around which a [[rotation]] by &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{360^\circ} {n} &lt;/math&gt; results in a molecule indistinguishable from the original.  This is also called an ''n''-fold '''rotational axis''' and abbreviated C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Examples are the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axis in [[water]] and the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis in [[ammonia]]. A molecule can have more than one symmetry axis; the one with the highest ''n'' is called the '''principal axis''', and by convention is aligned with the z-axis in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].
* '''Plane of symmetry''': a plane of reflection through which an identical copy of the original molecule is generated.  This is also called a [[mirror plane]] and abbreviated [[Sigma|σ]] (sigma = Greek "s", from the German 'Spiegel' meaning mirror).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newton.ex.ac.uk/research/qsystems/people/goss/symmetry/CharacterTables.html |title=Symmetry Operations and Character Tables  |last= |first= |date=2001 |website=University of Exeter |access-date=29 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water has two of them: one in the plane of the molecule itself and one [[perpendicular]] to it. A symmetry plane [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] with the principal axis is dubbed ''vertical'' (σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and one perpendicular to it ''horizontal'' (σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). A third type of symmetry plane exists: If a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisects the angle between two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis, the plane is dubbed [[Dihedral angle|dihedral]] (σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;). A symmetry plane can also be identified by its Cartesian orientation, e.g., (xz) or (yz).
* '''Center of symmetry''' or '''inversion center''', abbreviated ''i''.  A molecule has a center of symmetry when, for any atom in the molecule, an identical atom exists diametrically opposite this center an equal distance from it. In other words, a molecule has a center of symmetry when the points (x,y,z) and (-x,-y,-z) correspond to identical objects. For example, if there is an oxygen atom in some point (x,y,z), then there is an oxygen atom in the point (-x,-y,-z).  There may or may not be an atom at the inversion center itself.  Examples are [[xenon tetrafluoride]]  where the inversion center is at the Xe atom, and [[benzene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) where the inversion center is at the center of the ring.
* '''Rotation-reflection axis''': an axis around which a  rotation by &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{360^\circ} {n} &lt;/math&gt;, followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to it, leaves the molecule unchanged.  Also called  an ''n''-fold '''improper rotation axis''', it is abbreviated S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Examples are present in tetrahedral [[silicon tetrafluoride]], with three S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axes, and the [[staggered conformation]] of [[ethane]] with one S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; axis.
* '''Identity''', abbreviated to E, from the German 'Einheit' meaning unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;lang=de&amp;searchLoc=0&amp;cmpType=relaxed&amp;sectHdr=on&amp;spellToler=on&amp;search=einheit&amp;relink=on LEO Ergebnisse für "einheit"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This symmetry element simply consists of no change: every molecule has this element. While this element seems physically trivial, it must be included in the list of symmetry elements so that they form a mathematical [[group (mathematics)|group]], whose definition requires inclusion of the identity element. It is so called because it is analogous to multiplying by one (unity). In other words, E is a property that any object needs to have regardless of its symmetry properties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|last=Pfenning|first=Brian|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781118859025|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operations ===
[[Image:Xenon-tetrafluoride-3D-vdW.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[xenon tetrafluoride|XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], with square planar geometry, has 1 C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis and 4 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axes orthogonal to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. These five axes plus the mirror plane perpendicular to the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis define the D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry group of the molecule.]]  
The five symmetry elements have associated with them five types of '''[[symmetry operation]]''', which leave the molecule in a state indistinguishable from the starting state. They are sometimes distinguished from symmetry elements by a [[caret]] or [[circumflex]]. Thus, Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the rotation of a molecule around an axis and Ê is the identity operation. A symmetry element can have more than one symmetry operation associated with it. For example, the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; axis of the [[square planar molecular geometry|square]] [[xenon tetrafluoride]] (XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule is associated with two Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotations (90°) in opposite directions and a Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation (180°). Since Ĉ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to Ê, Ŝ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to σ and Ŝ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''î'',  all symmetry operations can be classified as either proper or improper rotations.

== Symmetry groups ==

===Groups===
The symmetry operations of a molecule (or other object) form a ''[[group (mathematics)|group]]'', which is a mathematical structure usually denoted in the form (''G'',*) consisting of a set  ''G''  and a binary combination operation say '*' satisfying certain properties listed below.

In a '''symmetry group''', the group elements are the symmetry operations (''not'' the symmetry elements), and the binary combination consists of applying first one symmetry operation and then the other. An example is the sequence of a C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rotation about the z-axis and a reflection in the xy-plane, denoted σ(xy)C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. By convention the order of operations is from right to left.

A symmetry group obeys the defining properties of any group.

(1) ''closure'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For every pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''G'', the ''product'' ''x''*''y'' is also in ''G''. &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  ( in symbols, for every two elements ''x'', ''y''∈''G'', ''x''*''y'' is also in ''G'' ). &lt;br&gt;This means that the group is ''closed'' so that combining two elements produces no new elements. Symmetry operations have this property because a sequence of two operations will produce a third state indistinguishable from the second and therefore from the first, so that the net effect on the molecule is still a symmetry operation.&lt;br&gt;
(2) ''associative'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For every ''x'' and ''y'' and ''z'' in ''G'', both (''x''*''y'')*''z'' and ''x''*(''y''*''z'')  result with the same element in ''G''.  &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, (''x''*''y'')*''z'' = ''x''*(''y''*''z'' ) for every ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' ∈ ''G'')&lt;br&gt;
(3) ''existence of identity'' property: &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
There must be an element ( say ''e'' ) in  ''G'' such that product any element of ''G'' with ''e'' make no change to the element.  &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, ''x''*''e''=''e''*''x''= ''x'' for every ''x''∈ ''G'' )&lt;br&gt;
(4) ''existence of inverse'' property: &lt;br&gt;   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
For each element ( ''x'' ) in  ''G'', there must be an element ''y'' in  ''G'' such that product  of  ''x'' and ''y'' is the identity element ''e''. &lt;br&gt;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; 
( in symbols, for each  ''x''∈''G''  there is a ''y'' ∈ ''G'' such that ''x''*''y''=''y''*''x''= ''e'' for every ''x''∈''G'' )

The ''order'' of a group is the number of elements in the group. For groups of small orders, the group properties can be easily verified by considering its composition table, a table whose rows and columns correspond to elements of the group and whose entries correspond to their products.

===Point groups and permutation-inversion groups===
[[File:Pt Group chart 2.png|thumb|800px|Chart for determining Point Group]]
The successive application (or ''composition'') of one or more symmetry operations of a molecule has an effect equivalent to that of some single symmetry operation of the molecule. For example, a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation followed by a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reflection is seen to be a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;' symmetry operation: σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;*C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'. (Note that "Operation A followed by B to form C" is written BA = C).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, the set of all symmetry operations (including this composition operation) obeys all the properties of a group, given above. So (''S'',''*'') is a group, where ''S'' is the set of all symmetry operations of some molecule, and * denotes the composition (repeated application) of symmetry operations.

This group is called the [[point group]] of that molecule, because the set of symmetry operations leave at least one point fixed (though for some symmetries an entire axis or an entire plane remains fixed). In other words, a point group is a group that summarizes all symmetry operations that all molecules in that category have.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The symmetry of a crystal, by contrast, is described by a [[space group]] of symmetry operations, which includes [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] in space.

One can determine the symmetry operations of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one USES a point group, the operations in it are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the operations are interpreted as rotating and/or reflecting the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these operations commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. They are "symmetry operations" for that vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]]&lt;ref name=Longuet-Higgins1963&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H.C. | year = 1963 | title = The symmetry groups of non-rigid molecules | url = | journal = Molecular Physics | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 445–460 | doi = 10.1080/00268976300100501 | bibcode = 1963MolPh...6..445L }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relation between point groups and permutation-inversion groups is explained in this pdf file [https://chemphys.ca/pbunker/PointGroupspdffile.html Link] .

===Examples of point groups===
Assigning each molecule a point group classifies molecules into categories with similar symmetry properties. For example, PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, POF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, XeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; all share identical symmetry operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfennig|first1=Brian|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-85910-0|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all can undergo the identity operation E, two different C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rotation operations, and three different σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; plane reflections without altering their identities, so they are placed in one point group, C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;, with order 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=pfennig|first1=Brian|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-85910-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) also share identical symmetry operations. They both undergo the identity operation E, one C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rotation, and two σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reflections without altering their identities, so they are both placed in one point group, C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;, with order 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miessler|first1=Gary|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780321811059}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification system helps scientists to study molecules more efficiently, since chemically related molecules in the same point group tend to exhibit similar bonding schemes, molecular bonding diagrams, and spectroscopic properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Common point groups===
The following table contains a list of point groups labelled using the [[Schoenflies notation]], which is common in chemistry and molecular spectroscopy. The description of structure includes common shapes of molecules, which can be explained by the [[VSEPR theory|VSEPR model]].

=== Representations ===

The symmetry operations can be [[group representation|represented in many ways]]. A convenient representation is by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. For any vector representing a point in Cartesian coordinates, left-multiplying it gives the new location of the point transformed by the symmetry operation. Composition of operations corresponds to matrix multiplication. Within a point group, a multiplication of the matrices of two symmetry operations leads to a matrix of another symmetry operation in the same point group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, in the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; example this is:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \underbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
     -1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
      0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 1 \\
      \end{bmatrix}
   }_{C_{2}} \times
 \underbrace{
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp;  0 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
 }_{\sigma_{v}} = 
 \underbrace{
  \begin{bmatrix}
   -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
 }_{\sigma'_{v}}
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Although an infinite number of such representations exist, the [[irreducible representation]]s (or "irreps") of the group are commonly used, as all other representations of the group can be described as a linear combination of the irreducible representations.

== Character tables ==

{{Main|List of character tables for chemically important 3D point groups}}

For each point group, a '''character table''' summarizes information on its symmetry operations and on its irreducible representations. As there are always equal numbers of irreducible representations and classes of symmetry operations, the tables are square.

The table itself consists of '''characters''' that represent how a particular irreducible representation transforms when a particular symmetry operation is applied.  Any symmetry operation in a molecule's point group acting on the molecule itself will leave it unchanged.  But, for acting on a general entity, such as a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] or an [[Atomic orbital|orbital]], this need not be the case.  The vector could change sign or direction, and the orbital could change type.  For simple point groups, the values are either 1 or &amp;minus;1: 1 means that the sign or phase (of the vector or orbital) is unchanged by the symmetry operation (''symmetric'') and &amp;minus;1 denotes a sign change (''asymmetric'').

The representations are labeled according to a set of conventions:

* A, when rotation around the principal axis is symmetrical
* B, when rotation around the principal axis is asymmetrical
* E and T are doubly and triply degenerate representations, respectively
* when the point group has an inversion center, the subscript g ({{lang-de|gerade}} or even) signals no change in sign, and the subscript u (''ungerade'' or uneven) a change in sign, with respect to inversion.
* with point groups C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt; the symbols are borrowed from [[angular momentum]] description: [[sigma|Σ]], [[Pi (letter)|Π]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]].

The tables also capture information about how the Cartesian basis vectors, rotations about them, and quadratic functions of them transform by the symmetry operations of the group, by noting which irreducible representation transforms in the same way.  These indications are conventionally on the righthand side of the tables.  This information is useful because chemically important orbitals (in particular ''p'' and ''d'' orbitals) have the same symmetries as these entities.

The character table for the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry point group is given below:

{| class="wikitable" 
 ! C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; || E || C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;(xz) || σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'(yz) || || 
 |-
 | A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || ''z'' 
 | ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
 |-
 | A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || &amp;minus;1 || R&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; || ''xy''
 |-
 | B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || ''x'', R&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; || ''xz''
 |-
 | B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 1 || &amp;minus;1 || &amp;minus;1 || 1 || ''y'', R&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; || ''yz''
|}
 
Consider the example of water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which has the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry described above.  The 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; [[atomic orbital|orbital]] of oxygen has B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry as in the fourth row of the character table above, with x in the sixth column). It is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and switches sign with a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'(yz) operation, but remains unchanged with the other two operations (obviously, the character for the identity operation is always +1). This orbital's character set is thus {1, &amp;minus;1, 1, &amp;minus;1}, corresponding to the B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; irreducible representation. Likewise, the 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is seen to have the symmetry of the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; irreducible representation (''i.e''.: none of the symmetry operations change it), 2''p''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the  3''d''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; orbital A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  These assignments and others are noted in the rightmost two columns of the table.

== Historical background ==

[[Hans Bethe]] used characters of point group operations in his study of [[ligand field theory]] in 1929, and [[Eugene Wigner]] used group theory to explain the selection rules of [[atomic spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Group Theory and its application to the quantum mechanics of atomic spectra'', E. P. Wigner, Academic Press Inc. (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; The first character tables were compiled by [[László Tisza]] (1933), in connection to vibrational spectra. [[Robert Mulliken]] was the first to publish character tables in English (1933), and [[E. Bright Wilson]] used them in 1934 to predict the symmetry of vibrational [[normal mode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Correcting Two Long-Standing Errors in Point Group Symmetry Character Tables'' Randall B. Shirts [[J. Chem. Educ.]] 2007, 84, 1882. [http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2007/Nov/abs1882.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The complete set of 32 crystallographic point groups was published in 1936 by Rosenthal and Murphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenthal | first1 = Jenny E. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. M. | year = 1936 | title = Group Theory and the Vibrations of Polyatomic Molecules | url = | journal = Rev. Mod.

==Molecular nonrigidity==
{{See also|Fluxional molecule}}
Point groups are useful for describing ''rigid'' molecules which undergo only small oscillations about a single equilibrium geometry, and for which the distorting effects of molecular rotation can be ignored, so that the symmetry operations all correspond to simple geometrical operations. However [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]] has introduced a more general type of symmetry group suitable not only for rigid molecules but also for ''non-rigid'' molecules that tunnel between equivalent geometries (called ''versions'') and which can also allow for the distorting effects of molecular rotation.&lt;ref name=Longuet-Higgins1963/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Bunker and Per Jensen (2005), ''Fundamentals of Molecular Symmetry'' (Institute of Physics Publishing) {{ISBN|0-7503-0941-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are known as ''permutation-inversion'' groups, because the symmetry operations in them are energetically feasible permutations of identical nuclei, or  inversion  with respect to the center of mass, or a combination of the two.

For example, [[ethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) has three equivalent [[staggered conformation]]s. Tunneling between the conformations occurs at ordinary temperatures by ''internal rotation'' of one [[methyl group]] relative to the other. This is not a rotation of the entire molecule about the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis. Although each conformation has D&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, as in the table above, description of the internal rotation and associated quantum states and energy levels requires the more complete permutation-inversion group G&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;.

Similarly, [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has two equivalent pyramidal (C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;) conformations which are interconverted by the process known as [[nitrogen inversion]]. This is not an inversion in the sense used for point group symmetry operations of rigid molecules (i.e., the inversion of vibrational displacements and electronic coordinates in the center of mass) since NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has no inversion center. Rather it the inversion of all nuclei and electrons in the center of mass (close to the nitrogen atom), which happens to be energetically feasible for this molecule. The appropriate permutation-inversion group to be used in this situation is D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;(M) which is isomorphic with the point group D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;.

Additionally, as examples, the [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; molecules have highly symmetric equilibrium structures with T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; point group symmetries respectively; they lack permanent electric dipole moments but they do have very weak pure rotation spectra because of rotational
centrifugal distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.K.G | year = 1971 | title = Forbidden rotational spectra of polyatomic molecules | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 546-544 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(71)90255-4 | bibcode = 1971JMoSp..40..536W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Oldani | first = M.|display-authors=etal | year = 1985 | title =Pure rotational spectra of methane and methane-d4 in the vibrational ground state observed by microwave Fourier transform spectroscopy| url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy | volume = 110 | issue = 1| pages = 93-105 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2852(85)90215-2 | bibcode = 1985JMoSp.110...93O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permutation-inversion groups required for the complete study of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;(M) and D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;(M), respectively.

A second and less general approach to the symmetry of nonrigid molecules is due to Altmann.&lt;ref&gt;Altmann S.L. (1977) ''Induced Representations in Crystals and Molecules'', Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flurry&gt;Flurry, R.L. (1980) ''Symmetry Groups'', Prentice-Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-880013-8}}, pp.115-127&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach the symmetry groups are known as ''Schrödinger supergroups'' and consist of two types of operations (and their combinations): (1) the geometric symmetry operations (rotations, reflections, inversions) of rigid molecules, and (2) ''isodynamic operations'', which take a nonrigid molecule into an energetically equivalent form by a physically  reasonable process such as rotation about a single bond (as in ethane) or a molecular inversion (as in ammonia).&lt;ref name=Flurry/&gt;

'''[[Music theory]]''' has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern [[mathematics]], yet the basis of musical [[sound]] can be described mathematically (in [[acoustics]]) and exhibits "a remarkable array of number properties".&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Smith Brindle]], ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, pp 42-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elements of music]] such as its [[Musical form|form]], [[rhythm]] and [[Meter (music)|metre]], the [[pitch (music)|pitches]] of its [[Musical note|notes]] and the [[Tempo (music)|tempo]] of its [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] can be related to the [[Chronometry|measurement of time]] and [[frequency]], offering ready [[Analogical models|analogies]] in [[geometry]].   

The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Smith Brindle, ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, Chapter 6 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eric - Math and Music: Harmonious Connections |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED388615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Though ancient Chinese, Indians, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Smith Brindle, ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, p 42&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]])&lt;ref name="purwins"&gt;{{cite book|title=Profiles of Pitch Classes Circularity of Relative Pitch and Key-Experiments, Models, Computational Music Analysis, and Perspectives|pages=22-24|year=2005|url=http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~purwins/purwinsPhD.pdf|last1=Purwins | first1=Hendrik}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Plato (trans. Desmond Lee) ''The Republic'', Harmondsworth Penguin 1974, page 340, note.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the ratios of small integers. Their central doctrine was that "all nature consists of [[harmony]] arising out of numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''Science and Music'', Dover 1968, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Plato]], harmony was considered a fundamental branch of [[physics]], now known as [[musical acoustics]]. Early [[Indian music scale|Indian]] and [[Chinese musicology|Chinese]] theorists show similar approaches: all sought to show that the mathematical laws of [[harmonic]]s and [[rhythm]]s were fundamental not only to our understanding of the world but to human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Danielou, ''Introduction to the Study of Musical Scales'', Mushiram Manoharlal 1999, Chapter 1 ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confucius]], like Pythagoras, regarded the small numbers 1,2,3,4 as the source of all perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''Science and Music'', Dover 1968, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time, rhythm and meter==

Without the boundaries of rhythmic structure – a fundamental equal and regular arrangement of [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] [[Repetition (music)|repetition]], [[Beat (music)|accent]], [[Phrase (music)|phrase]] and duration – music would not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Whittall, in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP, 2002, Article: ''Rhythm''&lt;/ref&gt; Modern musical use of terms like [[Meter (music)|meter]] and [[bar (music)|measure]] also reflects the historical importance of music, along with astronomy, in the development of counting, arithmetic and the exact measurement of time and [[Frequency|periodicity]] that is fundamental to physics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The elements of musical form often build strict proportions or hypermetric structures (powers of the numbers 2 and 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Александр Виноград, Многообразие проявлений музыкального метра (LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, 2013)|url=https://www.morebooks.de/store/gb/book/%D0%9C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0/isbn/978-3-659-48005-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical form==
{{Main|Musical form}}
Musical form is the plan by which a short piece of music is extended. The term "plan" is also used in architecture, to which musical form is often compared. Like the architect, the composer must take into account the function for which the work is intended and the means available, practicing economy and making use of repetition and order.&lt;ref&gt;Imogen Holst, ''The ABC of Music'', Oxford 1963, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; The common types of form known as [[Binary form|binary]] and [[Ternary form|ternary]] ("twofold" and "threefold") once again demonstrate the importance of small integral values to the intelligibility and appeal of music.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Frequency and harmony==
[[Image:Chladini.Diagrams.for.Quadratic.Plates.svg|thumb|220px|Chladni figures produced by sound vibrations in fine powder on a square plate. ([[Ernst Chladni]], ''Acoustics'', 1802)]]
A [[musical scale]] is a discrete set of [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es used in making or describing music. The most important scale in the Western tradition is the [[diatonic scale]] but many others have been used and proposed in various historical eras and parts of the world. Each pitch corresponds to a particular frequency, expressed in hertz (Hz), sometimes referred to as cycles per second (c.p.s.). A scale has an interval of repetition, normally the [[octave]]. The [[octave]] of any pitch refers to a frequency exactly twice that of the given pitch.

Succeeding superoctaves are pitches found at frequencies four, eight, sixteen times, and so on, of the fundamental frequency. Pitches at frequencies of half, a quarter, an eighth and so on of the fundamental are called suboctaves. There is no case in musical harmony where, if a given pitch be considered accordant, that its octaves are considered otherwise. Therefore, any note and its octaves will generally be found similarly named in musical systems (e.g. all will be called '''doh''' or '''A''' or '''Sa''', as the case may be).

When expressed as a frequency bandwidth an octave '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' spans from 110&amp;nbsp;Hz to 220&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=110&amp;nbsp;Hz). The next octave will span from 220&amp;nbsp;Hz to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=220&amp;nbsp;Hz). The third octave spans from 440&amp;nbsp;Hz to 880&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=440&amp;nbsp;Hz) and so on. Each successive octave spans twice the frequency range of the previous octave.

[[Image:4Octaves.and.Frequencies.svg|thumb|500px|center|The exponential nature of octaves when measured on a linear frequency scale.]]
[[Image:4Octaves.and.Frequencies.Ears.svg|thumb|500px|center|This diagram presents octaves as they appear in the sense of musical intervals, equally spaced.]]

Because we are often interested in the relations or [[ratio]]s between the pitches (known as [[Interval (music)|intervals]]) rather than the precise pitches themselves in describing a scale, it is usual to refer to all the scale pitches in terms of their ratio from a particular pitch, which is given the value of one (often written '''1/1'''), generally a note which functions as the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the scale. For interval size comparison, [[cent (music)|cent]]s are often used.

==Tuning systems==
{{Main|Musical tuning|Musical temperament}}

There are two main families of tuning systems: [[equal temperament]] and [[just tuning]]. Equal temperament scales are built by dividing an octave into intervals which are equal on a [[logarithmic scale]], which results in perfectly evenly divided scales, but with ratios of frequencies which are [[irrational number]]s. Just scales are built by multiplying frequencies by [[rational number]]s, which results in simple ratios between frequencies, but with scale divisions that are uneven.

One major difference between equal temperament tunings and just tunings is differences in [[Beat (acoustics)|acoustical beat]] when two notes are sounded together, which affects the subjective experience of [[consonance and dissonance]]. Both of these systems, and the vast majority of music in general, have scales that repeat on the interval of every [[octave]], which is defined as frequency ratio of 2:1. In other words, every time the frequency is doubled, the given scale repeats.

Below are [[Ogg Vorbis]] files demonstrating the difference between just intonation and equal temperament. You may need to play the samples several times before you can pick the difference.
*[[Media:Comparison 550Hz - 554Hz.ogg|Two sine waves played consecutively]] – this sample has half-step at 550&amp;nbsp;Hz (C{{music|#}} in the just intonation scale), followed by a half-step at 554.37&amp;nbsp;Hz (C{{music|#}} in the equal temperament scale).
*[[Media:Major third comparison.ogg|Same two notes, set against an A440 pedal]] – this sample consists of a "[[Dyad (music)|dyad]]". The lower note is a constant A (440&amp;nbsp;Hz in either scale), the upper note is a C{{music|#}} in the equal-tempered scale for the first 1", and a C{{music|#}} in the just intonation scale for the last 1". [[Beat (acoustics)|Phase]] differences make it easier to pick the transition than in the previous sample.

===Just tunings===
[[5-limit tuning]], the most common form of [[just intonation]], is a system of tuning using tones that are [[regular number]] [[harmonic]]s of a single [[fundamental frequency]]. This was one of the scales [[Johannes Kepler]] presented in his [[Harmonices Mundi]] (1619) in connection with planetary motion. The same scale was given in transposed form by Scottish mathematician and musical theorist, Alexander Malcolm, in 1721 in his 'Treatise of Musick: Speculative, Practical and Historical',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/treatiseofmusick00malc|title=A treatise of musick, speculative, practical and historical|first1=Alexander|last1=Malcolm|first2=Mr (Joseph)|last2=Mitchell|date=25 May 2018|publisher=Edinburgh : Printed for the author|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by theorist [[Jose Wuerschmidt]] in the 20th century. A form of it is used in the music of northern India.

American composer [[Terry Riley]] also made use of the inverted form of it in his "Harp of New Albion". Just intonation gives superior results when there is little or no [[chord progression]]: voices and other instruments gravitate to just intonation whenever possible. However, it gives two different whole tone intervals (9:8 and 10:9) because a fixed tuned instrument, such as a piano, cannot change key.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Montagu, in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 2002, Article: ''just intonation''.&lt;/ref&gt; To calculate the frequency of a note in a scale given in terms of ratios, the frequency ratio is multiplied by the tonic frequency. For instance, with a tonic of [[A440 (pitch standard)|A4]] (A natural above middle C), the frequency is 440&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], and a justly tuned fifth above it (E5) is simply 440×(3:2) = 660&amp;nbsp;Hz.

[[Pythagorean tuning]] is tuning based only on the perfect consonances, the (perfect) octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth. Thus the major third is considered not a third but a ditone, literally "two tones", and is (9:8)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 81:64, rather than the independent and harmonic just 5:4 = 80:64 directly below. A whole tone is a secondary interval, being derived from two perfect fifths, (3:2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9:8.

The just major third, 5:4 and minor third, 6:5, are a [[syntonic comma]], 81:80, apart from their Pythagorean equivalents 81:64 and 32:27 respectively. According to [[Carl Dahlhaus|Carl]] {{harvtxt|Dahlhaus|1990|p=187}}, "the dependent third conforms to the Pythagorean, the independent third to the harmonic tuning of intervals."

Western [[common practice period|common practice music]] usually cannot be played in just intonation but requires a systematically tempered scale. The tempering can involve either the irregularities of [[well temperament]] or be constructed as a [[regular tuning and temperament|regular temperament]], either some form of [[equal temperament]] or some other regular meantone, but in all cases will involve the fundamental features of [[meantone temperament]]. For example, the root of chord '''ii''', if tuned to a fifth above the dominant, would be a major whole tone (9:8) above the tonic. If tuned a just minor third (6:5) below a just subdominant degree of 4:3, however, the interval from the tonic would equal a minor whole tone (10:9). Meantone temperament reduces the difference between 9:8 and 10:9. Their ratio, (9:8)/(10:9) = 81:80, is treated as a unison. The interval 81:80, called the [[syntonic comma]] or comma of Didymus, is the key comma of meantone temperament.

===Equal temperament tunings===
In [[equal temperament]], the octave is divided into equal parts on the logarithmic scale. While it is possible to construct equal temperament scale with any number of notes (for example, the 24-tone [[Arab tone system]]), the most common number is 12, which makes up the equal-temperament [[chromatic scale]]. In western music, a division into twelve intervals is commonly assumed unless it is specified otherwise.

For the chromatic scale, the octave is divided into twelve equal parts, each semitone (half-step) is an interval of the [[twelfth root of two]] so that twelve of these equal half steps add up to exactly an octave. With fretted instruments it is very useful to use equal temperament so that the frets align evenly across the strings. In the European music tradition, equal temperament was used for lute and guitar music far earlier than for other instruments, such as [[musical keyboard]]s. Because of this historical force, twelve-tone equal temperament is now the dominant intonation system in the Western, and much of the non-Western, world.

Equally tempered scales have been used and instruments built using various other numbers of equal intervals. The [[19 equal temperament]], first proposed and used by [[Guillaume Costeley]] in the 16th century, uses 19 equally spaced tones, offering better major thirds and far better minor thirds than normal 12-semitone equal temperament at the cost of a flatter fifth. The overall effect is one of greater consonance. [[Quarter tone|Twenty-four equal temperament]], with twenty-four equally spaced tones, is widespread in the pedagogy and [[Arabic maqam#Notation|notation]] of [[Arabic music]]. However, in theory and practice, the intonation of Arabic music conforms to [[Rational number|rational ratios]], as opposed to the [[Irrational number|irrational ratios]] of equally tempered systems.&lt;ref name="Touma 1996 22–24"&gt;{{cite book|last=Touma|first=Habib Hassan|title=The Music of the Arabs|year=1996|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, OR|isbn=0-931340-88-8|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While any analog to the equally tempered [[quarter tone]] is entirely absent from Arabic intonation systems, analogs to a three-quarter tone, or [[neutral second]], frequently occur. These neutral seconds, however, vary slightly in their ratios dependent on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]], as well as geography. Indeed, Arabic music historian [[Habib Hassan Touma]] has written that "the breadth of deviation of this musical step is a crucial ingredient in the peculiar flavor of Arabian music. To temper the scale by dividing the octave into twenty-four quarter-tones of equal size would be to surrender one of the most characteristic elements of this musical culture."&lt;ref name="Touma 1996 22–24"/&gt;

==Connections to mathematics==
===Set theory===
{{Main|Set theory (music)}}
Musical set theory uses the language of mathematical [[set theory]] in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set.

===Abstract algebra===
{{Main|Abstract algebra}}
Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Algebra of Tonal Functions. |url=http://sonantometry.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_archive.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmonic Limit|url=https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Harmonic+Limit||}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transformational theory]] is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]]. The theory allows for great generality because it emphasizes transformations between musical objects, rather than the musical objects themselves.

Theorists have also proposed musical applications of more sophisticated algebraic concepts. The theory of regular temperaments has been extensively developed with a wide range of sophisticated mathematics, for example by associating each regular temperament with a rational point on a [[Grassmannian]].

The [[chromatic scale]] has a free and transitive action of the [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, with the action being defined via [[transposition (music)|transposition]] of notes. So the chromatic scale can be thought of as a [[torsor]] for the group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Real and complex analysis===
Real and complex analysis have also been made use of, for instance by applying the theory of the [[Riemann zeta function]] to the study of equal divisions of the octave.[https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/The+Riemann+Zeta+Function+and+Tuning]

'''My Little Pony''' is a [[toy]] line and [[media franchise]] mainly targeting girls, developed by [[United States|American]] toy company [[Hasbro]]. The first toys were developed by [[Bonnie Zacherle]], Charles Muenchinger, and Steve D'Aguanno, and were produced in 1981. The ponies feature colorful bodies, [[mane (horse)|manes]] and a unique symbol on one or both sides of their flanks. Such symbols are referred to in the two most recent incarnations as "cutie marks". My Little Pony has been revamped several times with new and more modern looks to appeal to a new market.

Following the original [[#My Pretty Pony|My Pretty Pony]] toy that was introduced in 1981, My Little Pony [[My Little Pony (1982 toyline)|was launched in 1982]] and the line became popular during the 1980s. The [[My Little Pony (1982 toyline)|original toy line]] ran from 1982 to 1992 in the United States and to 1995 globally, and two animated specials, an animated feature-length film and two animated television series produced during the period up until 1992.

==History==
===''My Pretty Pony'' (1981)===
{{Anchor|My Pretty Pony}}
The predecessor to ''My Little Pony'' was ''My Pretty Pony'', a [[pony]] figurine introduced by [[Hasbro]] in 1981. It was created by illustrator [[Bonnie Zacherle]] and sculptor Charles Muenchinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hasbro.com/mylittlepony/en_US/parents/through-the-years.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114085112/http://www.hasbro.com/mylittlepony/en_US/parents/through-the-years.cfm|title=My Little Pony History|author=Hasbro|archivedate=November 14, 2012|date=2012|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''My Pretty Pony'' was a ten-inch-tall hard plastic figurine that could wiggle its ears, swish its tail, and wink one eye. The original ''My Pretty Pony'' was followed by ''My Pretty Pony and Beautiful Baby'', which came with an additional smaller "baby" pony figure. This was followed by pink, yellow, and blue versions of the original that had the now-hallmark symbol on the ponies' backsides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yum-yum-ponyworld.weebly.com/my-pretty-pony.html|first=Patrick|last=Alkemade|date=2013|title=My Pretty Pony - 1981|accessdate=May 20, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520170802/http://yum-yum-ponyworld.weebly.com/my-pretty-pony.html|archivedate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982–1992===
{{Anchor|First Generation|Generation One|Generation 1|G1}}
{{Main|My Little Pony (1982 toyline)}}
After the relative lack of success of the ''My Pretty Pony'' toy line, Hasbro introduced six smaller and colorful versions of the toy in 1982, sold under the title ''My Little Pony''. The toy line led to many more merchandise under the ''My Little Pony'' brand, which later became unofficially known as the "Generation One" or "G1" of My Little Pony among collectors. This incarnation ended in 1995 in the United States, but was marketed internationally until 1995. Animations from mid-1980s ([[Rescue at Midnight Castle|''My Little Pony'' animated special]], ''[[Escape from Catrina|My Little Pony: Escape from Catrina]]'', ''[[My Little Pony: The Movie (1986 film)|My Little Pony: The Movie]]'' and ''My Little Pony'' segment within ''[[My Little Pony 'n Friends]]'' anthology series) and ''[[My Little Pony Tales]]'' from 1992 accompanied the line-up.

The 1997 incarnation was marketed by Hasbro as "Friendship Garden" and designated "Generation 2" by collectors. They were manufactured in redesigned poses with jewel eyes and turning heads and were smaller, slimmer, and longer-legged than their 1982 counterparts. The line was not successful in the U.S. and was discontinued in 1999, although it continued overseas for several years. Since the second generation was more popular in Western Europe, Hasbro continued to produce and sell them in Western Europe after 1998. Most were Earth Ponies, but a few unicorns were made internationally. Although no Pegasus Ponies were made, some adults had clip-on wings. In the early 2000s, several unicorns with clip-on wings (called the Magic Unicorns) were made. Two baby ponies were introduced, and none of the baby ponies were sold in the United States.

In Europe, the main location was renamed Ponyland instead of Friendship Gardens, and were discontinued with the inception of the "G3" toyline in 2003. Many ponies released in the last years of the line are considered rare. A number of playsets were introduced, including a mansion and a castle. Some of the licensed merchandise released in Europe included beanbag plushes, magazines, clothing, perfume, wrapping paper and coloring books. A CD-ROM game for PC, ''Friendship Gardens'', was also released, which involved taking care of a pony and playing games along the way.

Some "Generation Two" ponies were sold as detachable key chains, including Morning Glory, Sundance, Light Heart and Ivy. The pony came with a comb attached to her neck by a string. The back of the package says, "My Little Pony Logo and Pony Names are Trademarks of Hasbro Inc. Copyright 1998." They were produced under license by Fun-4-All Corporation and made in China.

{{Main|My Little Pony (2003 toyline)}}
The third incarnation of My Little Pony, which is often unofficially referred to as "Generation Three" or "G3" by collectors, began in 2003. The revamped line of dolls was targeted to a younger audience than the previous lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hasbro Revamps My Little Pony to Draw Younger Girls|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-105890012.html|accessdate=9 August 2014|work=Marketing Week|date=10 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the generation's end in 2009, there were at least two minor revamps. A series of direct-to-video animated films (mostly produced by [[SD Entertainment]]) accompanied the line-up.

=== 2010–present ===

{{See also|My Little Pony: Equestria Girls}}
The current incarnation of My Little Pony, unofficially known as the "Generation Four", was launched in 2010. It is set in a fictional location named [[Equestria]], and the main characters include Twilight Sparkle, Spike, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Rarity and Fluttershy. Television series ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'', theatrical film ''[[My Little Pony: The Movie (2017 film)|My Little Pony: The Movie]]'', as well as other related media accompany the current line-up. This era generated a [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom|fandom among grown-ups]] with the success of the television series.

''[[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls]]'', the anthropomorphic spin-off, was launched in 2013.

==Adult fans==
===Collectors===
''My Little Pony'' toys drew the attention of collectors from their initial release.&lt;ref name="Connelly" /&gt;{{rp|at={{tooltip|1:1–5|part 1, section 1}}}} Media coverage in the 2000s reported on collectors' conventions, finding it odd that adult women are interested in ''My Little Pony''. The 2004 ''My Little Pony Collectors' Convention'' reportedly had only one man among the attendees. When updating the toy line, Hasbro reassured collectors that it will produce ''My Little Pony'' editions for collectors.&lt;ref name="Connelly" /&gt;{{rp|at={{tooltip|2:3–4|part 2, sections 3–4}}}}

==Imitations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
In the United States during the 1990s, other toy companies desired to benefit from the success of the My Little Pony line; imitations were produced and sold after the discontinuation of the "G1" toys in 1992 and before the "G2" incarnation was produced and sold in 1997.

When Hasbro discontinued the "G1" My Little Pony line in 1992, some pony molds fell into the hands of other toy companies, who made their own "pony" toys. The second generation was not popular in the United States, and there are few imitations; however, "G3" imitations exist. There are websites to help people identify genuine My Little Pony toys manufactured by Hasbro, and recognize imitations. Many, but not all, imitations are sold at [[Variety store|dollar stores]].

Of many imitations, the four listed below were popular with young girls in the early to mid-1990s and were available at toy stores. These toys had similarities to both the My Little Pony and Dream Beauty lines. In the My Little Pony collecting community, these are known as "fakies" or "bootlegs"; however, some are sought after by collectors:

;Secret Wish Horse
Released by [[Tyco Toys|Tyco]] (now a division of [[Mattel]]), Secret Wish Horse was a toyline of colorful, plastic horses with rooted eyelashes and a bejeweled saddle that would open up to reveal a surprise such as earrings, a bracelet or a ring. They also came with a necklace similar to a [[magic 8-ball]] that was said to make a girl's wishes come true.

;Fantasy Fillies
Fantasy Fillies was a line of colorful plastic horses that were produced by Empire/Marchon. The designer of this line also designed [[Fashion Star Fillies]] released in 1987 by [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] (which was, together with [[Tonka]], later acquired by Hasbro in 1991). They came as pegasi, unicorns, horses and mini-fillies. One, called Princess Growing Hair, had hair that could grow, and a filly was sold with a carriage.

;''Magic Touch Pony''
Magic Touch Pony toys were made of plastic and came in different colors. They had symbols on their flanks, like My Little Ponies and Dream Beauties. Some had hooves that would light up, a necklace that lit up, plastic flowers in their manes that would light up, and some played music.

;''Cabbage Patch Ponies''
Cabbage Patch Ponies toys were made by Hasbro, which had a license to manufacture [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] from 1988 until 1994. They were made of rubber and came in different colors; some had glittery bodies. Some had hair that could be combed, while others had yarn for hair. There were unicorns, pegasi and regular ponies.

== Social impact ==
===Consumerism===
''My Little Pony'' is often derided for promoting consumerism. When the media adaptations of the franchise debuted, there was much controversy in the United States about television advertising targeted at children. Relaxed regulation in the 1980s on cross-referencing between programming and commercials led to toy-based shows, such as [[Mattel]]'s ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'', Hasbro's ''[[Transformers]]'', ''[[G. I. Joe]]'', and later ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony 'n' Friends]]''.&lt;ref name="Connelly"&gt;{{cite|title=Ponyville Confidential: The History and Culture of My Little Pony, 1981-2016|author=Sherilyn Connelly|year=2017|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476662091}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at={{tooltip|1:5–8|part 1, sections 5–8}}}} While ''He-Man'' initially drew the most controversy, ''My Little Pony'' remained controversial for many decades later, even when it was not being produced; the criticism is much more harsh and enduring than similar franchises with toy lines. Sherilyn Connelly cites examples from authors and journalists who single out ''My Little Pony'' for being tied to toys and merchandise, often putting it "first against the wall"  while sparing such criticism from the aforementioned Hasbro franchises, or franchises such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Toy Story]]'', and ''[[Lego]]''.&lt;ref name="Connelly" /&gt;{{rp|at={{tooltip|2:5|part 2, section 5}}}} Connelly notes that professionals who work with children, for example psychologists and librarians, often have a positive view on the franchise; psychologist [[John Rosemond]] described ''My Little Pony'' toys as "great, soothing, quiet-time toys", having none of the violence or sexuality of other toy franchises. The first animated series is often given as the worst example of a [[Saturday-morning cartoon]], despite never airing on Saturday mornings. Even though no ''My Little Pony'' adaptation was airing on television for much of the 1990s and no toys were being produced, it was still often brought up as a contemporary example of aggressive marketing through television.&lt;ref name="Connelly" /&gt;{{rp|at={{tooltip|1:3,5,8|part 1, sections 3, 5, 8}}}}

===Femininity===
Connelly contends that ''My Little Pony'' is singled out not because the franchise's business methods or content standards are particularly different from other franchises', but because it is overtly girly. Replying to criticism that ''My Little Pony'' is "junk" while ''Star Wars'' stems from "integrity and creative vision", cartoonist [[Craig McCracken]] noted that both franchises can have integrity or be junk, depending on how they're produced. Character designer Chris Battle pointed out that the media adaptation of ''My Little Pony'' is seen as less valid because it is aimed at girls.&lt;ref name="Connelly" /&gt;{{rp|at={{tooltip|2:5|part 2, section 5}}}} Director [[Lauren Faust]], who was creative developer of the relaunch of the ''My Little Pony'' franchise in 2010, wrote that she expected people who haven't even watched the animated series "to instantly label it girly, stupid, cheap, for babies or an evil corporate commercial." Faust feels that the show's femininity makes it a target of derision, regardless of its other qualities.&lt;ref name="Connelly" /&gt;{{rp|at={{tooltip|4:3|part 4, section 3}}}} Ellen Seiter, professor of media studies, observed that girl's television shows are a ghettoization of girl culture, and the attacks on these shows is often aimed at their femininity.&lt;ref name="Connelly" /&gt;{{rp|at={{tooltip|1:1|part 1, section 1}}}} ''My Little Pony'' has been perceived as an icon of femininity and "girlie-girls", particularly in the [[United Kingdom]]. The franchise has alternately been described as asexual and ''too'' sexual by the UK media.&lt;ref name="Connelly" /&gt;{{rp|at={{tooltip|1:8|part 1, section 8}}}}

'''Nakshi kantha''', a type of embroidered quilt, is a centuries-old [[Bengal]]i art tradition of the [[Bengal]] Region, notable in [[Bangladesh]] and [[States and union territories of India|Indian states]] of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bengalcrafts.com/History.html |title=Nakshi Kantha-Benhal Craft |website=Bengal Crafts |access-date=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaman |first=Niaz |year=2012 |chapter=Nakshi Kantha |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Nakshi_Kantha |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaismuddin.org" /&gt; The basic material used is thread and old cloth.{{sfn|Ghuznavi|1981|p=23}} Nakshi kanthas are made throughout Bangladesh, but the greater [[Mymensingh]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]] and [[Jessore]] areas are most famous for this craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sirajuddin |first=Muhammad |date=1992 |title=Living Crafts in Bangladesh |location=Dhaka |publisher=Markup International |page=44 |oclc=29737195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colourful patterns and designs that are embroidered resulted in the name "Nakshi Kantha",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sareesofbengal.com/index.php/collections/kantha-stitch.html|title=Kantha Silk Sarees |first=Sarees|last=Kantha|website=sareesofbengal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was derived from the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word "naksha", which refers to artistic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aarong.com/nakshi-kantha/about-nakshi-kantha |title=About Nakshi Kantha |website=Aarong |access-date=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early kanthas had a white background accented with red, blue and black embroidery; later yellow, green, pink and other colours were also included. The [[running stitch]] called "[[kantha]] stitch" is the main stitch used for the purpose.{{sfn|Ghuznavi|1981|pp=23–24}} Traditionally, kantha was produced for the use of the family. Today, after the revival of the nakshi kantha, they are produced commercially.
== Etymology ==
The word ''kantha'' has no discernible etymological root.{{sfn|Ahmad|1997}} The exact time of origin of the word [[kantha]] is not accurately known but it probably had a precursor in ''kheta'' (khet [[Bengali language|Bengali]] means "field").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahmad |first=Perveen |date=1999 |title=Lecture: Aesthetics and Vocabulary of Nakshi Kantha |url=http://ignca.nic.in/nl_01310.htm |journal=Vihangama |publisher=Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) |volume= VII |issue=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Niaz Zaman, the word ''kantha'' originated from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''kontha'',  which means rags, as kantha is made of rags.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=36}}

==Tradition==
Like any other folk art, kantha making is influenced by factors such as materials available, daily needs, climate, geography, and economic factors.{{sfn|Zaman|1993}} Probably the earliest form of kantha was the [[patchwork]] kantha, and the kanthas of the decorative [[appliqué]] type evolved from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Gurusaday |date=1995 |title=Kantha: Album of Art Treasure (Series One) |location=24 Parganas, India |publisher=Gurusaday Dutt Folk Art Society, Gurusaday Museum |oclc=475731213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
The earliest mention of Bengal Kantha is found in the book ''Sri Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita'' by Krishnadas Kaviraj, which was written some five hundred years ago. The famous Bengali poet [[Jasimuddin]] also had a very famous poem '[[Nakshi Kanthar Math]]' on Nakshi Kantha &lt;ref name="Jaismuddin.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sos-arsenic.net/lovingbengal/quilt.html |title=Quilt (Kantha) Art of Bengal |website=Jaismuddin.org |access-date=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Infobox geographical indication

==Making==
Traditionally old [[saree]]s, [[lungi]]s and [[dhoti]]s were used to make kanthas. Kantha making was not a full-time job. Women in almost every household were expert in the art. Rural women worked at leisure time or during the lazy  days of the rainy season, so taking months or even years to finish a kantha was normal.  At least five to seven sarees were needed to make a standard-size kantha. Today the old materials are replaced by new cotton cloths. Traditionally the thread was collected from the old sarees. That is rarely done today.

When a kantha is being made, first the sarees are joined together to attain the required size, and then layers are spread out on the ground. The cloths are then smoothed, and no folds or creases are left in between. During the process, the cloth is kept flat on the ground with weights on the edges. Then the four edges are stitched and two or three rows of large running stitches are done to keep the kantha together. At this stage, the kantha can be folded and stitched at leisure time.

Originally, designs and motifs were not drawn on the cloth. The design was first outlined with needle and thread, followed by focal points, and then the filling motifs were done. In a kantha with a predominant central motif the centre was done first, followed by corner designs and the other details. In some types of kanthas (carpet, lik and sujni, etc.) wooden blocks were used to print the outline. The blocks are replaced today by patterns drawn in tracing papers.

==Types==
The following is how kanthas are categorized, according to the stitch type:{{sfn|Zaman|1993}}

=== Running stitch ===

The [[running stitch]] kantha is truly the indigenous kantha. They are subdivided into Nakshi (figured) and par tola  (patterned). Nakshi (figured) kanthas are further  divided into motif  or scenic kanthas.

=== Lohori kantha ===

The name was derived from Persian word ''lehr'', which means wave. This type of kantha is particularly popular in [[Rajshahi]]. These kanthas are further divided into soja (straight or simple), Kautar khupi (pigeon coop or triangle), borfi or diamond (charchala, atchala or barachala).

=== Lik or anarasi ===

The Lik or Anarasi (pine apple) type of kantha is found in the [[Chapainawabganj District|Chapainawabganj]] and [[Jessore]] areas. The variations are lik tan, lik tile, lik jhumka, and lik lohori.

=== Cross-stitch or carpet ===

This type of kantha was introduced by the English during the British Rule in India.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=114}} The stitch employed in these kanthas is the [[cross-stitch]].

=== Sujni kantha ===

This type of kantha is found only in [[Rajshahi]] area. The popular motif used is the undulating floral and vine motif.

==Influence of religion and folk belief==

==Stitches==
{{main|Kantha}}
The earliest and most basic stitch found in kanthas is the ''[[running stitch]]''. The predominant form of this stitch is called the ''phor'' or kantha stitch.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|pp=44–45}} The other forms of stitches used are the  Chatai or ''pattern darning'', Kaitya or ''[[bending stitch]]'', ''weave running stitch'', ''[[darning stitch]]'', ''Jessore stitch'' (a variation of darning stitch), ''[[threaded running stitch]]'', Lik phor or anarasi or ghar hasia ''([[Holbein stitch|Holbein]]) stitches''. The stitches used in modern-day kantha are the ''Kasmiri stitch'' and the ''[[arrowhead stitch]]''. Stitches like the  ''[[herringbone stitch]]'', ''[[satin stitch]]'', ''[[backstitch]]'' and ''[[cross-stitch]]'' are occasionally used.{{sfn|Zaman|1993}}

==Types==
Kanthas generally denote quilts used as wrappers; however, all articles made by quilting old cloth may also be referred to by the same generic name. However, depending on the size and purpose, kanthas may be divided into various articles, each with its specific names. The various types of kantha are as follows:{{sfn|Ahmad|1997|p=v}}
* [[Quilt]] (lep in Bengali): A light quilted covering made from the old sarees/dhotis/lungis and sometimes from sheet cloths.
* Large spread (Naksi Kantha in Bengali): An embellished quilt embroidered in traditional motifs and innovative style
* [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] floor spread (Ason in Bengali): Cloth spread for sitting at a place of worship or for an honoured guest.
* Cosmetic wrapper (Arshilota in Bengali): A narrow embroidered wrapper to roll and store away a woman's comb, mirror, eye kohl, vermilion, sandal paste, oil bottle, etc. Often, a tying string is used to bind the wrap, as in later day satches.
* Wallet (Batwa thoiley in Bengali): Small envelope-shaped bag for keeping money, [[betel leaves]], etc.
* Cover for Quran (ghilaf in Arabic and Bengali): Envelope-shaped bag to cover the Quran.
* Prayer mats (Jainamaz in Bengali): Mats used by Muslims to say prayers.
* Floor spread (Galicha in Bengali): Floor coverings.
* Cloths wrapper (Bostani, guthri in Bengali): A square wrapper for books and other valuables.
* Cover (Dhakni in Bengali): Covering cloths of various shapes and sizes.
* Ceremonial meal spread (Daster khan in Bengali): A spread for eating place, used at meal time.
* Pillow cover (Balisher chapa or oshar in Bengali): A flat single piece pillow cover.
* Handkerchief (Rumal): Small and square in shape.
* Modern-day articles: Today newer uses are found for nakshi kanthas, such as bedspreads, wall hangins, cushion covers, ladies' purses, place mats, jewellery boxes, dress fronts, skirts border, shawls and sharees.

==Motifs==
Motifs of the nakshi kantha are deeply influenced by religious belief and culture. Even though no specific strict symmetry is followed, a finely embroidered naksi kantha will always have a focal point. Most kanthas will have a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] as focal point, and around the lotus there are often undulating vines or floral motifs, or a shari border motif. The motifs may include images of flower and leaves, birds and fish, animals, kithen forms even toilet articles.

While most kantas have some initial pattern, no two naksi kantas are same. While traditional motifs are repeated, the individual touch is used in  the variety of stitches, colours and shapes. The notable motifs found in naksi kantha are as follows:

===Lotus motif===
[[File:Lotus motif.JPG|thumb|right|Lotus motif]]
The lotus motif is the most common motif found in kanthas. This motif is associated with Hindu iconography and thus is also very popular in the kantha. The  lotus is the divine seat. It is also symbolic of cosmic harmony and essential womanhood. The lotus is also the symbol of eternal order and  of the union of earth, water and, sky. It represents the life-giving power of water, and is also associated with the sun for the opening and closing of the petals. It is also the symbol of the recreating power of life. With the drying up of water, the lotus dies and with the rain it springs to life again. The lotus is associated with purity and the goddess [[Laksmi]], the goddess of good fortune and abundance. There are various forms of lotus motifs, from the eight-petaled ''astadal padma'' to the hundred petaled ''satadal''. In the older kanthas, the central motif is almost always a fully bloomed lotus seen from above.

===Solar motif===
The solar motif is closely associated with the lotus motif. Often, the lotus and the solar motifs are found together at the centre of a nakshi kantha. The solar motif symbolizes the life giving power of the sun. The sun is associated with the fire which plays a significant part in Hindu rites, both religious and matrimonial.

===Moon motif===
The moon motif has a religious influence, and is popular amongst the Muslims. Mostly it is in the form of a crescent moon accompanied by a star. This motif is particularly found in ''jainamaz'' kanthas.

===Wheel motif===
The wheel is a common symbol in Indian art, both Hindu and Buddhist. It is the symbol of order. The wheel also represents the world. The wheel is a popular motif in kanthas even when the maker has forgotten the significance of the symbol. The motif is relatively easy to make with ''chatai phor.''

===Swastika motif===
Su asti in [[Sanskrit]] means '''it is well'''. As a motif in Indian art, it dates back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. It is symbol of good fortune. It is also known as ''muchri'' or ''golok dhanda.''  With the passage of time, the design is more curvilinear than the four armed swastika of the [[Mohenjodaro]] seal. The symbolic design has significant influence in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

===Tree of life motif===
[[File:BanglaNak1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Contemporary Nakshi Kantha (used as a wall hanging) with animal, fish, butterfly, tree and human figure motif]]
The influence of this motif in Indian art and culture (as with kantha) may be traced back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. ''It is likely that the Indus people conceived the pipal as the [[Tree of Life]]...with the devata inside embodying the power of fecundity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mukerjee |first=Radhakamal |date=1964 |title=The Flowering of Indian Art: The Growth and Spread of a Civilization |location=Bombay |publisher=Asia Pub. House |page=35 |oclc=30086718}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Buddhist times, the cult of the tree continued. [[Ficus religiosa|Pipal]] is sacred to the Buddha because he received enlightenment under its shade.  It reflects the fecundity of nature and is very popular in Bengal. Vines and creepers play an important role in kanthas and they contain the same symbolisation as that of tree of life. A popular motif in [[Rajshahi]] lohori is the betel leaf.

===Kalka motif===
[[File:Kalka motif.JPG|thumb|right|Close view of Kalka motif]]
This is a latter-day motif, dating from Mughal times.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=82}} The kalka or [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] motif originated in Persia and Kashmir and has become an integral image of the subcontinental decorative motif.{{sfn|Ahmad|1997|p=92}} It can be compared with a stylized leaf, mango or flame. The kalka is an attractive motif and number of varieties are experimented. Similar motifs can be found in traditional kashmiri [[shawl]]s.

Most nakshi kanthas have some kind of border. Either a sari border is stitched on or a border pattern is embroidered around the kantha. The common border found in kanthas are as follows:{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=94}} [[File:Kantha border2.JPG|thumb|left|200px|From the top: necklace border, ladder border, gut taga, chik taga, nose ring border, fish border, panch taga, bisa taga, anaj taga]]

== Controversy regarding Geographical Indication ==
Despite being a Bangladeshi traditional art, the Indian state of West Bengal applied for the [[Geographical Indication]] for Nakshi kantha in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ttg-sric.iitkgp.ernet.in/GIDrive/images/gi/registered_GI_13June2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to absence of proper law on Geographical Indication in Bangladesh that time (which was later adopted), Bangladesh couldn't counter apply for the GI. The registry office had no option but to hand-over the Geographical Indication to West Bengal in 2008.

Bangladesh authority however later passed the "Bangladesh Geographical Indication (Registration and Protection) Act, 2013"&lt;ref&gt;http://dpdt.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/dpdt.portal.gov.bd/page/cc2ca133_4da5_42f7_9776_21cff528a032/GI%20Act-2013%20Bangla.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in parliament and with other necessary preparations now waiting for the next re-applying time cycle to claim the Geographical Indication for Nakshi kantha to Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpd.org.bd/index.php/press-reports-geographical-indication-jamdani-bangladesh-cpd-dialogue/ |title=Press reports on Protecting Geographical Indication Products in Bangladesh |website=Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) |access-date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ficci-inbdpd.com/htm/recom.html |title=India – Bangladesh Parliamentary Dialogue |website=Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry |access-date=24 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160127051454/http://www.ficci-inbdpd.com/htm/recom.html |archivedate=27 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7882">'''Oba''' means [[ruler]] in the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Bini people|Bini]] languages of contemporary [[West Africa]]. Kings in [[Yorubaland]], a region which is in the modern republics of [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Togo]], make use of it as a pre-nominal [[honorific]]. Post-colonial examples of Yoruba bearers include Oba [[Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi|Ogunwusi]] of [[Ile Ife]], Oba Aromolaran of [[Ilesha]] and Oba [[Lamidi Adeyemi III|Adeyemi]] of [[Oyo State|Oyo]]. An example of a Bini bearer is Oba Ewuare II of [[Kingdom of Benin|Benin]].

The title is distinct from that of '''Oloye''', which is used in like fashion by subordinate titleholders in the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] chieftaincy system.

==Aristocratic titles among the Yoruba==

The Yoruba [[chieftaincy]] system can be divided into four separate [[Nobility|ranks]]: royal chiefs, noble chiefs, religious chiefs and common chiefs. The royals are led by the obas, who sit at the apex of the hierarchy and serve as the [[fons honorum]] of the entire system. They are joined in the class of royal chiefs by the titled [[dynast]]s of their royal families. The three other ranks, who traditionally provide the membership of a series of [[privy council]]s, [[sect]]s and [[guild]]s, oversee the day-to-day administration of the Yoruba [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] and are led by the [[Ogboni#The Iwarefa|Iwarefa]]s, the [[Babalawo|Araba]]s and the titled [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s of the kingdoms' constituent families.

==Oba==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 70.109.2 Beaded Crown Ade of Onijagbo Obasoro Alowolodu Ogoga of Ikere 1890-1928.jpg|thumbnail|Beaded Crown "Ade" of King Onijagbo Obasoro Alowolodu, the Ogoga of Ikere]]
There are two different kinds of Yoruba monarchs: The kings of Yoruba [[clan]]s, which are often simply networks of related towns (For example, the Oba of the [[Egba people|Egba]] bears the title "[[Alake of Egba (title)|Alake of Egbaland]]" because his ancestral seat is the [[Egba Alake|Ake]] quarter of [[Abeokuta]], hence the title Alake, which is Yoruba for ''Man of Ake''. The [[Oyo Kingdom|Oyo]] oba, meanwhile, bears the title "[[Alaafin]]", which means ''Man of the palace'') and the kings of individual Yoruba towns, such as that of [[Iwo, Nigeria|Iwo]] - a town in [[Osun]] State - who bears the title "Olu'wo" (Olu of Iwo, lit. ''Lord of Iwo'').

The first generation towns of the Yoruba homeland, which encompasses large swathes of the said countries of Benin, Nigeria, and Togo, are those with obas who generally wear beaded crowns; the rulers of many of the 'second generation' settlements are also often obas. Those that remain and those of the third generation tend to only be headed by the holders of the title "Baale" (lit. ''Head of the Clan''), who do not wear crowns and who are, at least in theory, the reigning viceroys of people who do.

==Oloye==

All of the subordinate members of the Yoruba aristocracy, both traditional titleholders and honorary ones, use the pre-nominal "Oloye" (lit. ''Owner of a title'', also appearing as "Ijoye") in the way that kings and queens regnant use 'Oba'. It is also often used by princes and princesses in colloquial situations, though the title that is most often ascribed to them officially is "Omoba" (lit. ''Child of a Monarch'', sometimes rendered alternatively as "Omo'ba", "Omooba" and "Omo-Oba"). The wives of kings, princes and chiefs of royal background usually make use of the title "Olori" (the equivalent of ''Princess Consort'', otherwise spelled "Oloori"), though some of the wives of dynastic rulers prefer to be referred to as "Ayaba" (the equivalent of ''Queen Consort''). The wives of the non-royal chiefs, when themselves titleholders in their own right, tend to use the honorific "Iyaloye" (lit. ''Lady who owns a title'') in their capacities as married chieftesses.

==The Oba's crown==
{{Main|Oba's crown}}

The bead-embroidered crown with beaded veil, foremost attribute of the oba, symbolizes the aspirations of a civilization at the highest level of authority. In his seminal article on the topic, Robert F. Thompson writes, "The crown incarnates the intuition of royal ancestral force, the revelation of great moral insight in the person of the king, and the glitter of aesthetic experience."&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert F.|title=African art &amp; leadership|year=1972|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=0299058204|pages=227–260|editor=Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal duties==
[[File:US Navy 060602-N-8637R-010 Commanding Officer USS Barry (DDG 52), Cmdr. Jeffrey Wolstenholme, presents the Oba of Nigeria, with a ship's plaque during the ship's visit.jpg|thumb|June 2006, [[:w:USS Barry (DDG-52)|USS ''Barry'']] (DDG 52), Cmdr. Jeffrey Wolstenholme, presents [[Rilwan Akiolu]], the [[Oba of Lagos]], with a ship's plaque during the ship's visit.]]

The role of the oba has diminished with the coming of [[Colonialism|colonial]] and [[democracy|democratic]] [[institutions]]. However, an event that still has symbolic prestige and capital is that of chieftaincy title-taking and awarding. This dates back to the era of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] warrior chiefs and [[palace]] officials in the medieval period, when powerful individuals of varied ancestries held prominent titles in the [[empire]]. In [[Yorubaland]], like in many other areas of Benin, Nigeria and Togo, chieftaincy titles are mostly given to successful men and women from within a given sub-sectional territory, although it is not unheard of for a person from elsewhere to receive one. The [[title]]s also act as symbolic capital that can be used to gain favour when desired by the individual oba that awarded them, and sometimes vice versa. During any of the traditional [[investiture]] ceremonies for the chiefs-designate, the oba is regarded by the Yoruba as the major center of attention, taking precedence over even the members of the official governments of any of the three countries if they are present. As he leads the procession of nominees into a specially embroidered dais in front of a wider audience of guests and well wishers, festivities of varied sorts occur to the accompaniment of traditional drumming. Emblems are given out according to seniority, and drapery worn by the oba and chiefs are created to be elaborate and also expensive. Most of the activities are covered by the local [[Mass media|media]] and enter the public domain thereafter. Only the secret initiations for traditional chiefs of the highest rank are kept secret from all outsiders. Ceremonies such as this, and the process of selection and maintenance of networks of chiefs, are two of the major sources of power for the contemporary royals of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Caplan, Humphrey Fisher, David Parkin; The Politics of Cultural Performance.

==Priestly duties==

As a sacred ruler, the oba is traditionally regarded by the Yoruba as the ex officio chief priest of all of the [[Orisha]] sects in his or her domain. Although most of the day-to-day functions of this position are delegated in practice to such figures as the Arabas, certain traditional rites of the Yoruba religion can only be performed by the oba, and it is for this reason that the holders of the title are often thought of as being religious leaders in addition to being politico-ceremonial monarchs.

'''Oceanic art''' or '''Oceanian art''' comprises the creative works made by the native people of the [[Pacific Islands]] and [[Australia]], including areas as far apart as [[Hawaii]] and [[Easter Island]]. Specifically it comprises the works of the two groups of people who settled the area, though during two different periods. They would in time however, come to interact and together reach even more remote islands. The area is often broken down into four separate regions: [[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]], [[Australasia]], and [[Melanesia]]. The former two share a common ancestral culture of the [[Lapita]], while the latter two comprise settlers of the first wave of people into the area. All of the regions in later times would be greatly affected by western influence and colonization. In more recent times, the people of [[Oceania]] have found a greater appreciation of their region's artistic heritage.

The artistic creations of these people varies greatly throughout the cultures and regions. The subject matter typically carries themes of fertility or the supernatural. Art such as masks were used in religious ceremonies or social rituals. [[Petroglyphs]], [[Tattooing]],  painting, wood carving, stone carving and textile work are other common art forms. Contemporary Pacific art is alive and well, encompassing traditional styles, symbols, and materials, but now imagined in a diversity of contemporary forms, revealing the complexity of geographic, cultural and individual interaction and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brunt|first1=Peter|title=Art in Oceania: A New History|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-19028-1|pages=410–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Atingting Kon 001.JPG|thumb|left|Split gong figures from [[Vanuatu]]]]
Art of Oceania properly encompasses the artistic traditions of the people indigenous to Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Island and Lebanon Dahia. The ancestors of the people of these islands came from Southeast Asia by two different groups at separate times. The first, an [[Australoid]] people and the ancestors of modern-day [[Melanesians]] and Australian Aboriginals, came to [[New Guinea]] and Australia about 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. The Melanesians expanded as far as the northern [[Solomon Islands]] by 38,000 BC. The second wave, from [[Southeast Asia]], would not come for another 30,000 years. They would come to interact and together reach even the most remote Pacific islands. These early peoples lacked a writing system, and made works on perishable materials, so few records of them exist from this time.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/02/oc/ht02oc.htm Oceania, 80000-2000 B.C.]. Retrieved on June 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that Oceanic peoples traditionally did not see their work in the western concept of "art", but rather created objects for the practical purpose of use in religious or social ceremonies, or for use in everyday life.&lt;ref name=oce&gt;[[Hutchinson Encyclopedia]].

Retrieved on June 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1500 BC the Lapita culture, descendants of the second wave, would begin to expand and spread into the more remote islands. At around the same time, art began to appear in New Guinea, including the earliest examples of sculpture in Oceania. The period from 1000 BC on, the Lapita people would consolidate and begin to create the contemporary Polynesian cultures of [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]]. They would from there venture further out into the Pacific and settle  the [[Marquesas]] and northern [[Cook Islands]] between 200 BC and 1 AD. Additionally from about 1000 BC, trade between the Pacific Islands and mainland Asia was growing, and starting 600 BC, works of the [[Dongson culture]] of [[Vietnam]], known for their bronze working, can be found in Oceania, and their imagery has a strong influence on the indigenous artistic tradition. Records to 1000 AD continue to be few, however most artistic tradition are continued to this point, such as New Guinea sculpture and Australian rock art, although the period is characterized by increasing trade and interaction as well as new areas being settled, including Hawaii, Easter Island, Tahiti, and New Zealand. Starting around 1100 AD, the people of Easter Island would begin construction of nearly 900 [[moai]] (large stone statues). At about 1200 AD, the people of Pohnpei, a Micronesian island, would embark on another megalithic construction, building [[Nan Madol]], a city of artificial islands and a system of canals. By 1500, the first European explorers begin to reach Oceania. Although previous artistic and architectural traditions are continued, the various regions would begin to diverge and record more distinct cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/oc/ht07oc.htm Oceania, 1000-1400 A.D.].

==Prehistoric==

The rock art of Australian Aborigines is the longest continuously practiced artistic tradition in the world. These sites, found in [[Arnhem Land]], Australia, are divided into three periods: Pre-Estuarine (c. 40,000?&amp;ndash;6000 BC), Estuarine (c. 6000 BC&amp;ndash;500 AD), and Fresh Water (c. 500 AD&amp;ndash;present). They are dated based on the styles and content of the art. Pre-Estuarine, the oldest, is characterized by imagery in a red ocher pigment. However, by about 6000 BC, increasingly elaborate images begin to appear, marking the beginning of the Estuarine period. These rock paintings served several functions.  Some were used in magic, others to increase animal populations for hunting, while some were simply for amusement. One of the more elaborate collections of rock art in this area is the site of Ubirr, a favored camping ground during wet seasons which has had its rock faces painted many times over thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/ubir/hd_ubir.htm Ubirr (40,000?B.C.-present)].

Sculpture in Oceania first appears on New Guinea as a series of stone figures found throughout the island, but mostly in mountainous highlands. Establishing a chronological timeframe for these pieces in most cases is difficult, but one has been dated to 1500 BC. The content of the sculptures fit into three categories: mortars, pestles, and freestanding figures. The tops of many pestles contain images, often of birds or human heads. Mortars show similar imagery, or sometimes geometric patterns. Freestanding figures again portray similar themes: humans, animals, and phalluses. The original significance of these pieces however, are unknown, but were perhaps used in the context of rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/ngss/hd_ngss.htm Prehistoric Stone Sculpture from New Guinea]. Retrieved on June 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early culture with an artistic tradition are the Lapita, dating from about 1500 BC to 500 BC, who are thought to be the ancestors of the modern day cultures of [[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]], and some parts of [[Melanesia]]. The culture was formed by the second wave of Oceanic settlers. The name comes from the site of Lapita in [[New Caledonia]], which was among the first places its distinctive sculpture would be found. It is debated exactly where the culture developed, but the people themselves originally came from Southeast Asia. Their art is best known by its ceramics, which include elaborate geometric motifs and sometimes anthropomorphic imagery. It is thought some of the designs may be related to modern Polynesian tattoos and barkcloths. They were created by firing a comblike tool that stamped the designs on to wet clay. Each stamp would have one design and would be layered until an elaborate pattern was created. Their usage was primarily, in cooking, serving, and storing food.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/lapi/hd_lapi.htm Lapita Pottery (ca. 1500-5000 B.C.)].

Micronesia comprises second-wave settlers of Oceania, encompassing the people of the islands north of Melanesia, and has an artistic tradition attested to the Lapita culture. Among the most prominent works of the region is the megalithic floating city of Nan Madol. The city began in 1200 AD, and is still being built when European explorers begin to arrive around 1600. The city however, undergoes a decline by around 1800 along with the Saudeleur dynasty, and is abandoned altogether by the 1820s. The 19th century would see the region divided up amongst the colonial powers, however art continued to thrive. Wood carving by men in particular flourishes in the region, creating richly decorated ceremonial houses in [[Belau]], stylized bowls, canoe ornaments, ceremonial vessels, and sometimes sculptured figures. Women on the other hand created textiles and ornaments like bracelets and headbands. Stylistically, Micronesian art is streamlined and of a practical simplicity to its function, but is typically finished to a high standard of quality.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/10/oci/ht10oci.htm Micronesia, 1800-1900 A.D.].

The first half of the 20th century saw a downturn in Micronesia's cultural integrity and a strong foreign influence from both western and Japanese Imperialist powers. A number of historical artistic traditions, especially sculptural, simply ceased to be practiced. However other art forms continued, including traditional architecture and weaving. But by the second half of the century, independence from colonial powers allows their traditional arts to find a renewed interest and respect from within the region, and a new generation are taught these art forms. There is also a notable movement of contemporary art within Micronesia toward the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/oci/ht11oci.htm Micronesia, 1900 A.D.-present].

Polynesia, like Micronesia, stretched back to Lapita cultural traditions.

The most famous Polynesian art forms are the [[Moai]] (statues) of Rapa Nui/Easter Island. Polynesian art is characteristically ornate, and often meant to contain supernatural power or mana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaeppler|first1=Adrienne|title=The Pacific Arts of Polynesia and Micronesia|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-284238-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polynesian works of art were thought to contain spiritual power and could affect change in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooper|first1=Steven|title=Pacific Encounters: Art and Divinity in Polynesia 1760-1860|date=2006|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-3084-7|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the period beyond 1600 AD had seen intense interaction with European explorers, in addition to continuing earlier cultural traditions. The collections of European explorers during the period show that classical Polynesian art was indeed flourishing. In the 19th century, depopulation of areas due to slave raiding and Western diseases disrupted many societies and cultures. Missionary work in the region caused the conversion to Christianity, and in some cases the destruction of traditional cultural and artistic heritage of the region, specifically sculpture. However more secular art forms continue, such as carving non-religious objects like kava bowls and textile work such as [[Tapa cloth|tapa]] making. With the end of colonialism however, Polynesians increasingly attempted to assert their cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/ocp/ht11ocp.htmPolynesia, 1900 A.D.-present].

{{main|Indigenous Australian art}}

Australian Aboriginal people are most known for their rock art, which they continue to practice after their contact with Western explorers. Other forms of art however, reflect their lifestyle of often moving from one camp to another and is utilitarian and portable, albeit still highly decorated. They used rocks and other natural sources mixed with water to make their paint. Often using sticks to make their famous but recent (from 1971) dot paintings. Even today we still see Aboriginals making these. When dancing, they paint their bodies with white "paint" and apply it to their body in patterns and meaningful shapes and lines. Their dancing uses native Australian animals as inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/oca/ht11oca.htm Australia, 1800-1900 A.D.].

===Melanesia===
{{further|Papua New Guinean art}}
Melanesia, comprising New Guinea and the surrounding islands and people of first wave settlers, has perhaps the most striking art of all Oceania. Stylistically art is typically highly decorative and portrays exaggerated forms, often of sexual themes. It is mostly made in connection with ancestors, hunting, and cannibalism. Commonly they would be used in the context of spiritual rituals, such as the creation of elaborate masks. However, few examples of Melanesian art exist on the islands today.&lt;ref name=oce/&gt;

After 1600, like the other regions of Oceania, saw increasing encounters with European explorers. What they witnessed was a flourishing tradition of art and culture, such as the first record of the region's elaborate wood carving. It isn't until the latter half of the 19th century, however, that westernization begins to takes its toll. Some traditional forms of art go into decline, but others like sculpture survive and even thrive in the region. Not until more of the islands were explored by the western powers that the sheer diversity of Melanesian art begins to be seen. By the 20th century, Melanesian art begins to find its way to the West and has a profound impact on contemporary artists. However a great cultural disruption would follow the second World War, and much traditional art would begin to decline or be destroyed. This would be followed decades later by a newfound appreciation for their native art forms.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/ocm/ht11ocm.htm Melanesia, 1900 A.D.-present].

[[File:Oilpastel.JPG|thumb|300px|Oil pastel sticks in a box]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:mop3.JPG|thumb|250px|A box of [[commercial]] oil pastels]] --&gt;
'''Oil pastel''' (also called '''wax oil crayon''') is a painting and drawing medium with characteristics similar to [[pastel]]s and wax [[crayon]]s. Unlike "soft" or "Japanese" pastel sticks, which are made with a gum or [[methyl cellulose]] binder, oil pastels consist of [[pigment]] mixed with a non-drying oil and wax binder. The surface of an oil pastel painting is therefore less powdery, but more difficult to protect with a [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]]. Oil pastels provide a harder edge than "soft" or "French" pastels but are more difficult to blend. 

==History==
[[Image:Oil pastel portrait of a child.JPG|thumb|350px|Portrait of a child made from oil pastels.]]At the end of [[World War I]], [[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)|Kanae Yamamoto]] proposed an overhaul of the [[Japan]]ese education system. He thought that it had been geared too much towards uncritical absorption of information by imitation and wanted to promote a less restraining system, a vision he expounded in his book ''Theory of self-expression'' which described the ''Jiyu-ga'' method, "learning without a teacher". Teachers Rinzo Satake and his brother-in-law Shuku Sasaki read Yamamoto's work and became fanatical supporters. They became keen to implement his ideas by replacing the many hours Japanese children had to spend drawing [[ideogram]]s with black [[Indian ink]] with free drawing hours, filled with as much color as possible. For this, they decided to produce an improved wax crayon and in 1921 founded the  ''[[Sakura Color Products|Sakura Cray-Pas Company]]'' and began production. The new product wasn't completely satisfactory, pigment concentration was low and blending or impasto was impossible, so in 1924 they decided to develop a high viscosity crayon: the oil pastel. This used a mixture of mashed [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], [[stearic acid]] and [[coconut oil]] as a [[Binder (material)|binder]]. Designed as a relatively cheap, easily applied, colorful medium, oil pastels granted younger artists and students a greater freedom of expression than the expensive chalk-like [[pastels]] normally associated with the fine arts. Until the addition of a stabiliser in 1927, oil pastels came in two types: winter pastels with additional oil to prevent hardening and summer pastels with little oil to avoid melting. [[State school]]s simply couldn't afford the medium and, suspicious of the very idea of "self-expression" in general, favoured the [[coloured pencil]], a cheaper German invention then widely promoted in Europe as a means to instill [[work ethic|work discipline]] in young children.

Oil pastels were an immediate commercial success and other manufacturers were quick to take up the idea, such as Dutch company ''Talens'', who began to produce Panda Pastels in 1930. However, none of these were comparable to the professional quality oil pastels produced today. These early products were intended to introduce [[Western world|west]]ern [[art education]] to Japanese children, and not as a fine arts medium, although Sakura managed to persuade some avant-garde artists to acquaint themselves with the technique, among them [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1947 Picasso, who for many years had been unable to procure oil pastels because of the [[World War II|war condition]]s, convinced [[Henri Sennelier]], a French manufacturer who specialized in high quality art products, to develop a fine arts version. In 1949 [[Sennelier]] produced the first oil pastels intended for professionals and experienced artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These were superior in wax viscosity, texture and pigment quality and capable of producing more consistent and attractive work. The Japanese ''Holbein'' brand of oil pastel appeared in the mid-1980s with both student and professional grades; the latter with a range of 225 colours. Another brand, Caran d'Ache, introduced [[Neocolor]] wax crayons onto the market in 1965, using a patented [[polyethylene]] wax with superior [[lubrication]]; in the nineties these were developed into an oil pastel, [[Neopastel]].

==Use==
Oil pastels can be used directly in dry form; when done lightly, the resulting effects are similar to oil paints. Heavy build-ups can create an almost [[impasto]] effect. Once applied to a surface, the oil pastel pigment can be manipulated with a brush moistened in [[white spirit]], [[turpentine]], [[linseed oil]], or another type of [[vegetable oil]] or [[solvent]]. Alternatively, the drawing surface can be oiled before drawing or the pastel itself can be dipped in oil. Some of these solvents pose serious health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baylor.edu/ehs/index.php?id=94372|title=Section 10: Painting and Drawing|website=Environmental Health &amp; Safety {{!}} Baylor University|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil pastels are considered a fast medium because they are easy to paint with and convenient to carry; for this reason they are often used for sketching, but can also be used for sustained works. Because oil pastels never dry out completely, they need to be protected somehow, often by applying a special [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]] to the painting or placing the painting in a sleeve and then inside a frame. There are some known [[wikt:durability|durability]] problems: firstly, as the oil doesn't dry, it keeps permeating the paper. This process degrades both the paper and the colour layer as it reduces the flexibility of the latter. A second problem is that the stearic acid makes the paper brittle. Lastly both the stearic acid and the wax will be prone to [[efflorescence]] or "wax bloom", the building-up of fatty acids and wax on the surface into an opaque white layer. This is easily made transparent again by gentle polishing with a woolen cloth; but the three effects together result in a colour layer consisting mainly of brittle stearic acid on top of brittle paper, a combination that will crumble easily. A long term concern is simple [[evaporation]]: [[palmitic acid]] is often present and half of it will have evaporated within 40 years; within 140 years half of the stearic acid will have disappeared. Impregnation of the entire art work by [[beeswax]] has been evaluated as a [[Art conservation|conservation]] measure.

==Surface and techniques==

[[Image:Example Scraping Oil pastel.JPG|thumb|150px|An example of the ''scraping down'' technique.]]The surface chosen for oil pastels can have a very dramatic effect on the final painting. Paper is a common surface but this medium can be used on other surfaces including wood, metal, hardboard (often known as "masonite"), [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]], canvas and glass. Many companies make papers specifically for pastels that are suitable for use with oil pastels.

Building up layers of color with the oil pastel, called ''[[Layering (painting)|layering]]'', is a very common technique. Other techniques include ''[[underpainting]]'' and ''scraping down'' or [[sgraffito]]. Turpentine, or similar liquids such as [[mineral spirits]], are often used as a blending tool to create a [[wash (visual arts)|wash]] effect similar to some watercolor paintings. Commercially available oil sketching papers are preferred for such technique.

==Brands==

[[Image:Blended Oil pastel.JPG|thumb|150px|A blended picture using mineral spirits and oil pastels.]]There are a number of types of oil pastels, each of which can be classified as either ''scholastic'', ''student'' or ''professional'' grade.

''Scholastic grade'', for example the Loew Cornell brand, is the lowest grade: generally the oil pastels are harder and less vibrant than higher grades. It is generally meant for children or people starting out with oil pastels, and is fairly cheap compared to other grades, often about [[US$]]5 for a large box. The middle grade, ''student grade'', is meant for art students and can be much more expensive but softer and more vibrant than scholastic grade. They are usually more expensive and cost around $1 to $2 each. An example of a student grade oil pastel is ''Van Gogh'', manufactured by Talens. ''Professional grade'' is the highest grade of oil pastel and can be very expensive, often costing $3 to $5 per oil pastel, but are also the softest and most vibrant. Professional quality brands of oil pastel include Sennelier, Holbein, Garich, and Sakura Specialist.

'''Personal imaging''' is the continuous [[real time (media)|realtime]] capturing, archiving, recording,
and sharing of personal [[experience]] through [[image]]s. Typically the images are accompanied by other media such as [[sound reproduction|audio]]visual streams, or with [[writing|text]]ual narratives such as [[diary|diaries]], and often in an interactive way, i.e. people viewing the images comment on the images in realtime while they are being captured, so as to influence the capture process.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Business model==

Sales of RAW tickets are enacted by the artists featured, who are expected to purchase tickets from RAW and sell them on. Whilst RAW does not provide any compensation to the artists involved, the artists retain the proceeds from any sales of their work. This business practice has let to criticism from some artists, who have derided RAW as "pay-to-play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zaragoza |first1=Alex |title=Beef Week: A RAW Deal for Local Artists |url=https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/beef-week-a-raw-deal-for-local-artists/ |publisher=Voice of San Diego |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gibson |first1=Dan |title=Article About RAW: Natural Born Artists Might Confirm What You Thought About the Organization |url=https://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2014/03/14/article-about-raw-natural-born-artists-might-confirm-what-you-thought-about-the-organization |publisher=Tucson Weekly |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hortillosa |first1=Summer Dawn |title=RAW artists, international arts organization, schedules exhibit in Hudson County |url=https://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/02/raw_artists_schedule_a_exhibit.html |publisher=Jersey Journal |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== RAWards ==

At the end of every season (October), RAW artists hosts an awards show called RAWards. The awards season is a two-month process with an online voting, local semi-final shows with live voting, and lastly, a selection by a panel of judges made up of industry professionals from each field. One winner is chosen from each category (e.g. "RAW Visual Artist of the Year") and the nine winners are honored at a RAWards ceremony and show in Hollywood, CA in January. In 2012, RAW artists hosted two separate awards shows, in the United States and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, Brenna (2012) ''The Indie RAWards: So Not Your Average Awards Show!''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1580">'''Reconstructed clothing''' is used or [[vintage clothing]] that has been [[fashion design|redesigned]] and [[sewing|resewn]] into a new garment.&lt;ref name="pdi"&gt;De la Paz, Gino.  "If It's Worth It, Then Rework It."  Philippine Daily Inquirer (November 13, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Reconstructed [[clothing]] was [[Fashion trends|trendy]] in the [[2000s in fashion|mid-2000s]].&lt;ref name="pdi"/&gt;  The book ''Generation T'' (2006), which gave instructions for "108 Ways to Transform a [[T-Shirt]]", was one example of this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolay, Megan.  Generation T: 108 Ways to Transform a T-Shirt. Workman Publishing Company, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book included instructions for how to make [[halter top]]s, [[A-line skirt]]s, and string [[bikini]]s out of T-shirts. In 2008, Nicolay released another book entitled: ''Generation T-Beyond Fashion 120 More Ways to Transform Your T's''. This book had a bigger variety of projects including ones for children, men, and even pets. 

In March 2006, the DIY group Compai released their first DIY clothing reconstruction book, ''99 Ways to Cut, Sew, Trim, and Tie Your T-shirt Into Something Fabulous!'' After this book's release, Compai went on to release three more books about reconstructing jeans, sweaters and scarves.

Reconstructed clothing is appealing because it allows the designer to "stamp [their ideas] into an existing piece...and come up with a totally different piece" and because it makes the wearer's clothing unique.&lt;ref name="pdi"/&gt;

'''Richard Parkes Bonington''' (25 October 1802&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; – 23 September 1828) was an English [[Romanticism (art)|Romantic]] [[Landscape art|landscape]] painter, who moved to France at the age of 14 and can also be considered as a French artist, and an intermediary bringing aspects of English style to France.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 171&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming, after his very early death, one of the most influential British artists of his time, the facility of his style was inspired by the old masters, yet was entirely modern in its application. His landscapes were mostly of coastal scenes, with a low horizon and large sky, showing a brilliant handling of light and atmosphere. He also painted small historical [[cabinet painting]]s in a freely-handled version of the [[troubadour style]].

==Life and work==
[[File:Richard Parkes Bonington 003.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Francis I of France|François I]] and [[Marguerite de Navarre]]'' (45.7 by 34.5 cm), based on the discovery of a scratched inscription on a window at the [[Château de Chambord]]]]

Richard Parkes Bonington was born in the town of [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]], four miles from [[Nottingham]].&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"Arnold" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt; His father also known as Richard was successively a gaoler, a drawing master and lace-maker, and his mother a teacher. Bonington learned watercolour painting from his father and exhibited paintings at the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts|Liverpool Academy]] at the age of eleven.

In 1817, Bonington's family moved to [[Calais]], France, where his father had set up a lace factory. At this time, Bonington started taking lessons from the painter [[François Louis Thomas Francia]],&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19"&gt;Ingamells, 19&lt;/ref&gt; who, having recently returned from England, where he had been deeply influenced by the work of [[Thomas Girtin]],&lt;ref&gt;Binyon, pp.166 – 7&lt;/ref&gt; taught him the English watercolour technique. In 1818, the Bonington family moved to Paris to open a lace shop. There he met and became friends with [[Eugène Delacroix]]. He worked for a time producing copies of Dutch and Flemish landscapes in the [[Louvre]]. In 1820, he started attending the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, where he studied under [[Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros]].&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19"/&gt;

It was around this time that Bonington started going on sketching tours in the suburbs of Paris and the surrounding countryside. His first paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1822. He also began to work in oils and lithography, illustrating [[Baron Isidore Justin Séverin Taylor|Baron Taylor]]'s ''Voyages pittoresques dans l'ancienne France'' and his own architectural series ''Restes et Fragmens''. In 1824, he won a gold medal at the Paris Salon along with [[John Constable]] and [[Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding]], and spent most of the year painting coastal views in [[Dunkirk]].&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19"/&gt;

In 1825 he met Delacroix on a visit with [[Alexandre-Marie Colin]] to London, and they sketched together there, and shared a studio for some months in Paris on their return; Delacroix influenced him in turning to historical painting. He also developed a technique mixing watercolour with [[gouache]] and gum, achieving an effect close to oil painting.  In 1826 he visited northern Italy,&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19-20"&gt;Ingamells, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; staying in Venice for a month,&lt;ref name="Binyon, pp.169"&gt;Binyon, pp. 169&lt;/ref&gt; and London again in 1827–8. In late 1828 his [[tuberculosis]] worsened and his parents sent him back to London for treatment. Bonington died of tuberculosis on 23 September 1828 at 29 Tottenham Street in London, aged 25.&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19-20"/&gt;

Delacroix paid tribute to Bonington's work in a letter to [[Théophile Thoré]] in 1861. It reads, in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I met him for the first time, I too was very young and was making studies in the Louvre: this was around 1816 or 1817... Already in this genre (watercolor), which was an English novelty at that time, he had an astonishing ability... To my mind, one can find in other modern artists qualities of strength and of precision in rendering that are superior to those in Bonington's pictures, but no one in this modern school, and perhaps even before, has possessed that lightness of touch which, especially in watercolours, makes his works a type of diamond which flatters and ravishes the eye, independently of any subject and any imitation.&lt;ref&gt;Noon, Patrick: ''Richard Parkes Bonington "On the Pleasure of Painting"'', page 12. [[Yale University Press]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To [[Laurence Binyon]] however, "Bonington's extraordinary technical gift was also his enemy. There is none of the interest of struggle in his painting."&lt;ref name="Binyon, pp.169"/&gt;

Bonington had a number of close followers, such as Roqueplan and Isabey in France, and [[Thomas Shotter Boys]], James Holland, [[William Callow]] and [[John Scarlett Davis]] in England. In addition, there were many copies and forgeries of his work made in the period immediately after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Watercolours|first=Graham|last=Reynolds|series=World of Art|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=108|year=1998|origyear=1971 (as ''A Concise History of Watercolour''))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue to him was erected outside the [[Nottingham Trent University, School of Art and Design|Nottingham School of Art]] by [[Watson Fothergill]], and a theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arnold|url=http://www.gedling.gov.uk/businesslicensing/towncentres/arnold/|work=Gedling Borough Council website|publisher=Gedling Borough Council|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and primary school in his home town of [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]] are named after him. In addition, the house in which he was born (79 High Street, Arnold) is now named ‘Bonington House’ and is Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[Listed building|listed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listed Buildings|url=http://www.gedling.gov.uk/media/documents/planningbuildingcontrol/listed_buildings_GedlingBor.pdf|publisher=Gedling Borough Council|accessdate=21 May 2014|author=Gedling Borough Council Planning and Environment Department Local Plans Section|date=6 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wallace Collection]] has an especially large group of 35 works, representing both his landscapes and [[history painting]]s.

The '''Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolours''' (RSW) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] organisation of painters.

It was founded in 1876, with the support of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]], by artists to "promote, through exhibition, the medium of watercolour and encourage the bold, free and colourful qualities of Scottish Painting."&lt;ref&gt;From organisation's website at [http://www.thersw.org.uk/history.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

The society received permission from [[Queen Victoria]] to use the prefix "Royal" in 1886 and throughout its history many renowned artists have been members, including [[Sam Bough]], [[David McClure (artist)|David McClure]], [[William McTaggart]], [[Adam Bruce Thomson]], [[Claire Harrigan]], [[George Paul Chalmers]], Alison Dunlop, [[Elizabeth Blackadder]] and [[Barbara Rae]].

Past presidents include William J L Baillie (1975–1988), Ian McKenzie Smith (1988–1998), Philip T L Reeves (1998–2005), John Inglis (2005–2016); the current president is Jim Dunbar.

Past vice presidents include Alison Dunlop, Helga Chart, Gregor Smith and Iona Montgomery.

'''''Salome''''' is an oil painting, probably of [[Salome]] with the head of [[John the Baptist]], by the Italian late [[Renaissance]] painter [[Titian]].  It is usually dated to around 1515 and is now in the [[Doria Pamphilj Gallery]] in [[Rome]].  Like other paintings of this subject,&lt;ref&gt;Ciletti, 50&lt;/ref&gt; it has sometimes been considered to represent ''[[Book of Judith|Judith]] with the Head of [[Holofernes]]'', the other biblical incident found in art showing a female and a severed male head .&lt;ref&gt;DP. Safarik's official guide of 1993 calls it "''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'' (known as ''Salome'')", but in 2017 the museum website called it ''Salome''.  See below also.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, the main figure has also been called [[Herodias]], the mother of Salome.

Sometimes attributed to [[Giorgione]], the painting is now usually seen as one where Titian's personal style can be seen in development, with a "sense of physical proximity and involvement of the viewer", in which "expert handling of the malleable oil medium enabled the artist to evoke the sensation of softly spun hair upon creamy flesh".&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erwin Panofsky]] suggested the head of John the Baptist might be a self-portrait,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 220; Hale, 147; Neginsky, 96 quotes him, 98-99; Falomir&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible that Titian was alluding to his private life with the model, anticipating [[Cristofano Allori]]'s, ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'' (1613, [[Royal Collection]], and other versions), where the severed head was a self-portrait and Judith and the maid portraits of his ex-mistress and her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Neginsky, 96&lt;/ref&gt;  The model here, allowing for a degree of idealization, has been said to be the same used in the ''[[Dresden Venus]]'' (Giorgione and Titian, c. 1510).&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 147; Robertson, 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- as well as other Titians of the period, including the ''[[Woman at the Mirror]]'', ''[[Violante (Titian)|Violante]]'', ''[[Vanity (Titian)|Vanity]]'' and ''[[Sacred and Profane Love]]''. NO REF, &amp; doesn't look much like them to me --&gt;

This composition was copied many times, in some cases at least by Titian's workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Norton; Robertson, 219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salome, Judith or Herodias?==
[[File:Titian-salome.jpg|thumb|Lighter image, with clearer view of the background cupid and fittings]]
The possible [[provenance]] of the painting begins in 1533, with a ''Judith'' by Titian recorded in the collection of [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]], a very important patron of Titian.  No other surviving Titian painting seems to fit this record, so if it is not the painting now in Rome, it must be lost.&lt;ref&gt;Safarik, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1592 Duke Alfonso's granddaughter, [[Lucrezia d'Este (1535–1598)]] owned a painting described as a "[[Herodias]]" (Salome's mother).&lt;ref&gt;Again, that this is the same painting is uncertain, but endorsed by Safarik, apparently [[Harold Wethey]], and others.&lt;/ref&gt;  What is certainly the Doria Pamphilj painting belonged by 1603 to Cardinal [[Pietro Aldobrandini]] before passing to his niece [[Olimpia Aldobrandini]], whose second husband was the ex-cardinal [[Camillo Pamphilj]]; since then it has passed by descent through the family.&lt;ref&gt;DP&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 18th century the painting was called a ''Herodias'', but a number of foreign visitors who saw it record thinking the main figure to be Judith.&lt;ref&gt;Safarik, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

If the painting's main figure was Herodias, traditionally seen as the prime mover of the conspiracy to get John the Baptist executed, the younger woman next to her would be intended to represent her daughter Salome,&lt;ref&gt;Safarik, 12&lt;/ref&gt; here shown as a figure in thrall to her more glamourous mother.  The identification as Herodias seems to have no recent supporters, but that as Judith does.&lt;ref&gt;Including: Joannides, 250; Safarik, 12, and Peter Humfrey in his ''Titian'', 2007, which lists it as "Judith (?), c. 1516"&lt;/ref&gt;

A medieval addition to the Salome legend held that, as well as her mother's hatred of John for his preaching against her, Salome was also motivated by a frustrated love for John, to which the cupid might refer.&lt;ref&gt;Neginsky, 96-98&lt;/ref&gt;  Her face is turned away from his head, but her eyes look back to it.  Panofsky describes her as: "Meditative, sad and a little benumbed, she seems to recoil from the face of St. John which yet attracts her sidelong glances with irresistible force".  Meanwhile, the maid "looks at the heroine with the eyes of a faithful dog who feels and shares his master's distress without comprehending its cause".&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, quoted in Neginsky, 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in the pyramidal group of figures,&lt;ref&gt;Falomir&lt;/ref&gt; the glances flow from the maid on the left, up to Salome at centre, and down to John at right, whose dead eyes are closed.

The use of erotic allure on male figures of power is the core of both stories, but to the church and Titian's contemporaries, Herodias and Salome were bad, but Judith a heroine.&lt;ref&gt;Safarik, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Both stories were part of the repertoire of the [[Power of Women]] topos, mainly a feature of German art in this period, but whose subjects were also depicted in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Ciletti, 35-52 and especially 45-52&lt;/ref&gt;  The small [[Cupid]] at the top of the arch reinforces the eroticism of the treatment, suggesting either Salome's lust for John,&lt;ref&gt;Neginsky, 96&lt;/ref&gt; (or Herod's implied attraction to Salome) or that of Holfernes for Judith,&lt;ref&gt;Joannides, 250&lt;/ref&gt; according to choice. It has also been suggested that the use of cupids on the keystone of arches was common in public buildings of the period in Venice, which "stresses the official nature of St. John's imprisonment and execution".&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 219-220&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of a maidservant is usual in depictions of Judith (following the [[Book of Judith]], which mentions her), but not in those of Salome with the head of [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 173-174, 181.  But there are exceptions both ways - Judith with no maid, Salome with one.  See Joannides, 250&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the head on a dish is normally associated with Salome's story, and is mentioned in the gospel,&lt;ref&gt;Mark: 6, 21-18&lt;/ref&gt; while Judith often puts hers in a sack, or carries it by the hair, both also following the text of their story.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Judith]], Chapter 13, 9-10: "After which, she went out and gave the head of Holofernes to her maid, who put it in her food bag", and after their return, 15: "She pulled the head out of the bag and held it for them to see.", [http://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=18&amp;bible_chapter=13 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  A single lock of hair falling over the face was considered highly alluring, and associated with courtesans, perhaps suggesting Salome is indeed the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 147; Jaffé, 72&lt;/ref&gt; though Judith is described as using every effort to dress seductively.&lt;ref&gt;Judith, Ch 10: "3 There she removed the sackcloth she was wearing and taking off her widow's dress, she washed all over, anointed herself plentifully with perfumes, dressed her hair, wrapped a turban round it and put on the robe of joy she used to wear when her husband Manasseh was alive. 4 She put sandals on her feet, put on her necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings and all her jewellery, and made herself beautiful enough to beguile the eye of any man who saw her."&lt;/ref&gt;

The murky background at the left includes a fitting at the top, between the two women's heads, which is described as a lock by Panofsky, though it might be a hinge also.&lt;ref&gt;Neginsky, 96&lt;/ref&gt;  This marks the vertical edge of a zone with a slightly different tint, perhaps showing the transition from a door to a wall. What could be an iron bar, or door top, is to the left of the fitting.  The Pasadena version also shows a fitting and change in colour.  This suggests the paintings show the women leaving the prison where John was killed, to return with the head to the head to Herod's feast, a version of the story often shown in art, though not exactly following the gospel, in which a soldier presents the head on a dish to Herod, who gives it to Salome, who in turn gives it to her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Mark 6, 21-28: "So the king immediately sent a bodyguard and commanded him to bring John’s head. So he went off and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter. He gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother."&lt;/ref&gt;  The biblical text is very clear that Holofernes is assassinated in his tent in his camp, and the scene (rare in art) where Judith shows the head to the people of [[Bethulia]] happens at night inside the city gate, so the background of the painting is difficult to reconcile with a depiction of Judith.

==Attribution and date==
As with other small Titians from the 1510s, the attribution has wavered over the centuries, beginning with Titian in early records, but (almost inevitably) becoming attributed to [[Giorgione]] by the 19th century, until [[Crowe and Cavalcaselle]] attributed it to [[il Pordenone]].  By the end of that century it was once again attributed by most to Titian, which has remained the usual view among experts.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 219; DP&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norton Simon Museum]] version was attributed to Titian in sales in England between 1801 and 1859, but a sale in London in 1891 called it a Giorgione.&lt;ref&gt;Norton&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a date of about 1515 has long been the usual view, purely on stylistic grounds, [[Charles Hope (art historian)|Charles Hope]] has suggested about 1511. This is partly because of its relationship to [[Sebastiano del Piombo]]'s ''Salome'' of 1510 ([[National Gallery]]), where the setting also moves from dark at the left to light at the right.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 219; Hale, 147; [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sebastiano-del-piombo-salome National Gallery page]&lt;/ref&gt;  This has also been regarded by some as a "Judith".&lt;ref&gt;Joannides, 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
[[File:Titian - Salome with Head of John the Baptist.png|thumb|Version in the Norton Simon Museum]]
The painting relates to two different types of painting found in Venetian painting in the years dominated by Giorgione, including his posthumous influence. The first is a number of Venetian paintings of the 1510s showing two or three half-length figures with heads close together, often with their expressions and interactions enigmatic.  Many of these are "Giorgionesque" genre or [[tronie]] subjects where the subjects are anonymous.  But Titian's ''[[Lucretia and her Husband]]'' shows a specific subject, even if views differ as to the point in the story shown.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion on the early copy in the [[Royal Collection]]: [https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/402681/tarquin-and-lucretia Royal Collection], "After Titian (c. 1488-Venice 1576), ''Tarquin and Lucretia'',  c. 1514–15, Oil on panel, RCIN 402681&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''[[The Bravo (Titian)|Bravo]]'' may have a specific subject;&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 98&lt;/ref&gt; both of these are now in Vienna.  ''The Lovers'' ([[Royal Collection]]) probably does not.  His ''[[The Tribute Money (Titian)|Tribute Money]]'' (Dresden, c. 1516) has a clear subject, also from the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 98; Hale, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The other type it relates to is Titian's series of ''belle donne'' half-length female figures from the mid-1510s,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt; which also includes ''Lucretia and her Husband'', as well as the single figures of ''[[Flora (Titian)|Flora]]'' at the [[Uffizi]],&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 96; Hale, 147&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Woman with a Mirror]]'' at the [[Louvre]], the ''[[Violante (Titian)|Violante]]'' and ''[[Vanity (Titian)|Vanity]]'' in Munich.  Most of these have the appearance of portraits, and were sometimes regarded as contemporaries as portraits of leading Venetian courtesans, but are best thought of as idealized figures of beautiful women which may only loosely reflect any individual.  This type was more long-lived in Venetian painting, and made by many other artists; [[Palma Vecchio]] for one made a speciality of them.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 96; Hale, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
There are several early repetitions that might be by Titian or his workshop, or both.   A version now in the [[Norton Simon Museum]], [[Pasadena]] has been considered to be the best of the workshop versions.  It was also in the Doria Pamphilj collection between Cardinal [[Pietro Aldobrandini]] at the start of the 17th century and 1797-98 during the French revolutionary invasion of Italy, when much Italian art was sold, mostly to the English, in anticipation of the French looting it otherwise.  [[William Young Ottley]] was the initial purchaser, who took it to London and sold it in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Safarik, 12; Norton&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version that was part of the collections of Prince [[Salviati (bankers)|Salviati]], [[Christina of Sweden]] and of Prince [[Odescalchi]] is now owned by the real estate magnate [[Luke Brugnara]]. That Salome was also attributed to [[il Pordenone]] and Giorgione, and finally to Titian in the late 19th century.

==Other compositions of Salome and Judith==
Titian painted Salome in at least one later composition, from the 1550s, with the dish holding the head held above her head ([[Prado]]), possibly using his daughter Lavinia as the model.&lt;ref&gt;Falomir; Neginsky, 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;  Another composition has recently resurfaced, which dates from the 1560s; as of 2012, this is in the [[National Museum of Western Art]], Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;Falomir; [https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/salome-with-the-head-of-john-the-baptist/-gE-LbtnmGl4tQ National Museum of Western Art] page on their version.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1570 Titian painted an undoubted ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'' (now [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dia.org/art/collection/object/judith-head-holofernes-63581 Detroit page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sculpture Park Erich Engelbrecht''' is located at the Château des Fougis, 03220 [[Thionne]], department of [[Allier]], France, and displays monumental massive steel sculptures of the German artist Erich Engelbrecht.

In 2001, Erich Engelbrecht bought the property with the intent of installing his Sculpture Park throughout the gardens and former farming and hunting fields of Château des Fougis

On loan from a private collection, the artist mounted also a second exhibition in the main wing of the castle, presenting some of his previous works like large-format tapestries, oil paintings, small steel figures and graphics.

The open air exhibition at the Sculpture Park is open to public viewing. The indoor exhibition can only be visited following a previous private appointment.

==Les Fougis (the site)==

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“In the 15th century, according to tradition, '''Les Fougis''' were the hunting grounds of the Bourbons. In 1495 records exist of financial payments between {{nowrap|Duke Charles the 3rd}} and {{nowrap|Hughes le Long}}, Lord of Fougis and provost of the Duke’s Hunting. Earlier still, there’s a reference to the Lord of Fougis in an inventory written in 1410 by {{nowrap|Pierre Bodet}} for {{nowrap|Guichard Dauphin}}, Lord of Jaligny. In fact, the family le Long were the registered holders of {{nowrap|les Fougis}} from 1461 onwards, through squire {{nowrap|Hugonin le Long}}, who was also provost of the Hunting of {{nowrap|Pierre the 2nd}}. The {{nowrap|Le Longs}} retained the ownership of {{nowrap|Les Fougis}} until 1727, the date on which the territory was bequeathed to a nephew, {{nowrap|Jean Berthier de Bizy}}. Their descendants retained it until the French Revolution. In 1802 it was bought by {{nowrap|Antoine Clayeux}}, whose family owns the site to the present day.''

''Rebuilt at the end of the 16th century (a doorway in classic style is dated 1593) the Fougis have walls pierced with more decorative openings. A description from {{nowrap|Nicolas de Nicolay}} in 1569 states {{nowrap|‘fort chasteau, terre et seigneurie…’}} (strong castle, land and lordship…)''

''The château is composed of a main rectangular building, flanked by two square towers on its southwest and northeast corners, and a round tower to the southeast. A second perpendicular wing to the north is also flanked by another square tower on its east corner. The walls are made of red and dark brown brickwork, paired to form lozenge patterns. The openings are framed with white limestone. The north façade and some windows to the other sides were modified throughout the end of the 19th century.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=GERMAIN |first1=Dominique LAURENT, Maurice PIBOULE, Anne REGOND... [et al.] ; sous la dir. de René |title=Châteaux, fiefs, mottes, maisons fortes et manoirs en Bourbonnais |date=2004 |publisher=Éditions De Borée |location=Romagnat |isbn=2-84494-199-0 |pages=539-540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the turn of the 19th to the 20th centuries, the house was completely renovated and remodelled. The main courtyard received arcades on both wings, one of them with a glazed loggia. The north wing became an extra floor for the extended family and services. The interiors present a language typical for the period.

After acquiring the property, Erich Engelbrecht undertook a multitude of renovation and building works on the fields and buildings to adapt Les Fougis for these exhibitions.

Some of his family members settled in Fougis, where they presently live and work.

==Erich Engelbrecht (the artist)==
'''Erich Engelbrecht''' ([[Bielefeld]], 27th October 1928 - [[Vichy]], France, 21st July 2011) was a German artist who left a [http://www.engelbrecht.fr/english/work/ multitude of works] in the fields of painting, graphics, tapestry, sculpture, architecture and poetry.

==Construction==

The first sculptures arrived in 2002 and until his death in 2011 he managed to create an open exhibition of 29 large monumental and (mostly) coloured sculptures. The last sculpture - the smallest - arrived just after his death.

All sculptures were produced in Germany and transported by road to Fougis, where they were finally assembled.

Two sculptures positioned at the entrance of the park were created in 1984 and came to the present place after originally guarding the entrance of his property in Germany for nearly a decade and being exhibited in Hamburg-[[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] (Altonaer Balkon) for nearly another decade. Belonging to a private collection, theses two sculptures are displayed on loan to the sculpture park.

Some sculptures are distributed around the Château des Fougis, others follow a path designed by the artist.

The indoor exhibition, a selection of large-format tapestries, oil paintings, small steel figures and graphics of Erich Engelbrecht, all on loan from a private collection, was imagined and installed between 2002 and 20011 by the artist himself and his wife Mrs Waltraud Engelbrecht. It is displayed throughout the galleries and the two main reception rooms of the Château des Fougis, which where specially renovated to receive these works.

A '''sock monkey''' is a [[stuffed toy]] made from socks fashioned in the likeness of a [[monkey]]. These stuffed animals are a mixture of [[folk art]] and [[kitsch]] in the [[culture of the United States|cultures of the United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[culture of Canada|Canada]]. The typical sock monkey is grey and white with extra long limbs, a long tail and bright red lips. The animal may be adorned with additional ornamentation on its head or around its neck.  The character has become part of [[popular culture]] and can be found in [[Sock Monkey|comic books]] and art.

== Origin ==
The sock monkey's most direct predecessors originated in the [[Victorian era]], when the craze for imitation stuffed animals swept from Europe into North America and met the burgeoning [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]. Craft makers began sewing stuffed animals as toys to comfort children, and, as tales of the [[Scramble for Africa]] increased the public's familiarity with exotic species, monkey toys soon became a fixture of American nurseries. Tales like [[Rudyard Kipling|Rudyard Kipling's]] [[the Jungle Book]] and [[Just So Stories]] inspired crafters to create toys that depicted exotic animals,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encounters with Popular Pasts: Cultural Heritage and Popular Culture|last = Robinson|first = Mike|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = 978-3-319-13183-2|location = New York|pages = 109–111|last2 = Silverman|first2 = Helaine}}&lt;/ref&gt; however these early stuffed monkeys were not necessarily made from socks, and also lacked the characteristic red lips of the sock monkeys popular today.

John Nelson, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] immigrant to the United States, patented the sock-knitting machine in 1868, and began knitting socks on an automatic machine in [[Rockford, Illinois]] as early as 1870. On September 15, 1880, the Nelson Knitting Company formed, producing "Celebrated Rockford Seamless Hosiery," and selling them under the name of the "Nelson Sock."

John Nelson's son Franklin created a machine that knitted a sock without seams in the heel. The original machine required workers to sew every seam at the heel. The seamless sock saved time and labor costs and it became so popular, companies began to imitate his idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These seamless work socks were so popular that the market was soon flooded with imitators, and socks of this type were known under the generic term "Rockfords".

The iconic sock monkeys made from red-heeled socks, known today as the ''Rockford Red Heel'', emerged at the earliest in 1932, the year the Nelson Knitting Company added the trademark red heel to its product. In 1932, advertising executive Howard Monk came up with an idea to change the heel of the brown sock from white to red. The red heeled sock was marketed as "de-tec-tip."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Nelson Knitting added the red heel "De-Tec-Tip" to assure its customers that they were buying "original Rockfords" as opposed to the generic "Rockfords". This red heel gave the monkeys their distinctive mouth and during the [[Great Depression]], American crafters first made sock monkeys out of worn-out Rockford Red Heel Socks.

In 1953, a woman named Helen Cooke received the [[patent]] for sock monkeys. She sued a man named Stanley Levy because he sold sock monkeys but they were not the same design as hers. Levy contacted the Nelson Knitting Company hoping that they would declare the patent invalid. The company knew that people had been making dolls for the last two years, so they gathered up all the dolls that had been made the past two years so that they could have evidence proving that Helen Cooke should not have the patent. One of the most important pieces of evidence was a testimony and a doll made in February 1951 by a lady named Grace Wingent. She was a resident of Rockford and she had made a doll for her grandson. Helen Cooke settled the case against Stanley Levy when she was shown all the evidence that had been collected against her. She decided to sell the patent to the Nelson Knitting Company for $750. The company also paid other women for the rights to the doll including a woman in Tennessee who was paid $1000. Rockford, Illinois became the "home of the sock monkey."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.midwayvillage.com/wordpress/exhibits/the-missing-link-socks-monkeys-and-rockfords-industrial-past/|title = Sock Monkey Resource Packet|date = |accessdate = October 12, 2015|website = midwayvillage|publisher = |last = Midway Village Museum Collections Department|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
[[File:Sock.monkey.ministries.2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Servicemember]]s with sock monkeys made in [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]].]]

Sock monkeys remain a popular icon and are popular with all ages.&lt;ref name="Creative Publishing International"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sew Cute and Collectible Sock Monkeys|date=June 2015|publisher=Creative Publishing International|isbn=9781589238664}}&lt;/ref&gt; They now come in different styles, such as "birthday-themed", different colors, and even electronic ones that sing up-to-date [[pop songs]]. Most vintage red-heel sock monkeys found today are no older than the late 1950s, and many date from the 1970s.

A number of methods exist for dating red-heel sock monkeys, including the colors, shape of the red heel (elongated oval or swing), the amount of cream color in the red-heel and toe areas, sock seams, and interior sock content.&lt;ref name="Creative Publishing International" /&gt;

The term "vintage" red-heel sock monkeys is typically relegated to sock monkeys made from red-heel socks knitted by the Nelson Knitting Company and from similar socks knitted with red-heels by other companies in the same time period. The term "modern" red-heel sock monkeys is normally relegated to sock monkey dolls created after [[Fox River Mills|Fox River Mills, Inc.]] acquired the Nelson Knitting Company in 1992.&lt;ref name="Creative Publishing International" /&gt;

Homemade red-heel sock monkey dolls usually have unique faces and body characteristics and are considered one-of-a-kind. Sock monkey dolls are also mass-manufactured in the marketplace. Sock monkey dolls mass-manufactured by a company normally all have the same face and body characteristics. Not all sock monkey dolls are created from red-heel socks. A 2015 trend started to create sock monkey dolls from colorful striped or [[polka dot]] socks—even mismatched socks. &lt;ref name="Creative Publishing International" /&gt;

People's love for sock monkeys has made the toys the center of many special occasions: trips, birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and graduations to name a few, with their images now being used in photography, books, bookmarks, journals, greeting cards, jewelry, quilting, baking, sewing, commercials, movies, and more.&lt;ref name="Creative Publishing International" /&gt;

Sock monkeys are found in literature: gift books like ''Monkey Love'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monkey Love|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=9780740754838}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Friends Knock Your Socks Off'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Friends Knock Your Socks Off|publisher=Peter Pauper Press|isbn=9781593598983}}&lt;/ref&gt; the children's novel ''The Secrets of Eastcliff-by-the-Sea'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of Eastcliff-by-the-Sea|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1442498402}}&lt;/ref&gt; craft books such as ''Sew Cute and Collectible Sock Monkeys'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sew Cute and Collectible Sock Monkeys|publisher=Creative Publishing International|isbn=9781589238664}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they can be seen in [[Tony Millionaire|Tony Millionaire']]s [[Sock Monkey|graphic novel where a sock monkey is the main character]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Everything's Coming up Sock Monkeys!: Art, History and Business of the American Sock Monkey|last = Connelly|first = Bonnie Kraus|publisher = In My Own Dream|year = 2006|isbn = 9780979032301|location = New York|pages = 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; There's a film adaptation of Millionaire's comic currently in the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/tony-millionaires-sock-monkey-in-development-as-animated-feature-105537.html|title=Tony Millionaire’s ‘Sock Monkey’ in Development as Animated Feature|publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]]|author=Amid Amidi|date=November 13, 2014|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also featured in the cover art for the 1992 alternative rock album "Dirty" by Sonic Youth.

One reason why sock monkeys are popular is that sock monkeys are said to be [[good luck charm]]s, and as a result, people offer sock monkeys as gifts. Sock monkeys have been given to patients in hospitals as a symbol of a quick recovery. They have been given to employees to relieve stress and sock monkeys have even been sent to soldiers overseas to relieve [[homesickness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sew Cute and Collectible Sock Monkeys: For Red-heel Sock Monkey Crafters and Collectors|last = Lindner|first = Dee|publisher = Creative Publishing International|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-58923-866-4|location = Minneapolis|pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Jody Lewis of [[Bridgwater]], [[Somerset|Somerset UK]], made the official [[Guinness world record]] for largest sock monkey made from individual socks. The sock monkey stands at 10 feet 5.59 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/biggest/largest_sock_monkey_Jody_Lewis_breaks_Guinness_World_Records_record_215434.html|title=Largest sock monkey: Jody Lewis breaks Guinness World Records record|website=www.worldrecordacademy.com|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Festivals ==
The city of [[Rockford, Illinois]] embraces the doll as part of its history. In 2005, Midway Village Museum in Rockford held its first "Sock Monkey Madness Festival", where sock monkey fans could view an exhibit highlighting the industrial, legal, and creative history of the Nelson red-heel sock and the sock monkey. In 2009, the annual Sock Monkey Madness Festival was awarded a national Leadership in History Award of Merit from the American Association for State and Local History for excellence in educational programming.

The Sock Monkey Madness Festival also includes the original sock monkey that helped the Nelson Knitting Company win the [[patent]] and obtain the title “Home of the Sock Monkey.” Additionally, there is a 7-foot-2-inch sock monkey named "Nelson" (he acquired his namesake after the founder of the factory, John Nelson). Nelson, the super-sized sock monkey mascot created by author/crafter Dee Lindner was sewn out of 44 Rockford red-heeled socks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, the festival is kid friendly and has unique attractions such as the “Sockford General Hospital”. The hospital is a “crafty clinic” that repairs sock monkeys if they require any care. Volunteers dress as nurses and fix any button eyes that fall off, torn mouths, or do any other sewing that is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, Jenna "(Sock) Monkey Business: A Festival For
An Iconic Toy." ''Weekend All Things Considered (NPR)'' 12 March 2012.

'''''The Banksias''''', by [[Celia Rosser]], is a three-volume series of monographs containing paintings of every ''[[Banksia]]'' species. Its publication represented the first time such a large genus had been entirely painted by a single [[botanical artist]]. It has been described as "one of the outstanding botanical works of this century."&lt;ref name="Nokomis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nokomis.com.au/banksias.html | title = The Banksias | accessdate = 2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings themselves are [[watercolour painting|watercolours]] on Arches rag paper. The three volumes comprise plates reproduced using [[offset printing]], and bound in green leather.&lt;ref name="Studio International"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.studio-international.co.uk/painting/banksias.asp | title = The Banksias: Watercolours | publisher = Studio International | accessdate = 2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex George]] wrote the accompanying text.

Rosser began working on the series in 1974. Volume I of ''The Banksias'', containing 24 plates, was published in 1981. The edition comprised 730 books and 100 portfolios. Volume II, published in 1988, also contained 24 plates and was also released in an edition of 730 books and 100 portfolios. Volume III, completed in 2000, contained 28 plates, and was released in an edition of 530 books and 300 portfolios.&lt;ref name="Studio International"/&gt; Since the publication of Volume III, a new ''Banksia'', ''[[Banksia rosserae|B.&amp;nbsp;rosserae]]'' has been described; Rosser subsequently painted it and released a set of prints. In 2007, the genus ''[[Banksia ser. Dryandra|Dryandra]]'' was transferred to ''[[Banksia]]'', so there are now a great many ''Banksia'' species that have not been painted by Rosser.

Each volume of ''The Banksia''s has been presented to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] by the Australian Government as a gift of the Australian people. Largely on the basis of her work for ''The Banksias'', Rosser was awarded a Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] 1995 for her contribution to botanical art, and the [[Jill Smythies Award]] for botanical art in 1997.

The film premiered at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] on 11 October 2014 and was released theatrically on 24 April 2015 in the UK. ''The Falling'' earned £468,762 on a £750,000 budget.

== Plot ==
In 1969, Lydia and Abbie are best friends at an English girls school. Lydia, the neglected daughter of an [[agoraphobic]] mother, becomes fixated on Abbie, who has begun to explore her sexuality. After having sex with Lydia's brother Kenneth in an attempt to abort her pregnancy by another boy, Abbie begins to suffer from [[Mass psychogenic illness|fainting spells]]. She suffers an episode after a stint in detention with Lydia and dies in the process. Following Abbie's burial, Lydia begins suffering as well from fainting spells, and it soon becomes an epidemic, with numerous girls and a young teacher in the school spontaneously passing out for no more than a few seconds. Lydia becomes convinced that the administration must take action, much to the chagrin of the school principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfilms/articles/the_falling_begins_shoot |title=Independent Announces Start of Shoot for Carol Morley's Film ''The Falling'' |work=[[BBC Films]] |accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an assembly becomes disrupted by a mass fainting episode, the school is temporarily shut down and all affected students are hospitalized and psychoanalysed. When no cause for the spells is discovered, the school is reopened and Lydia is expelled. That same night, the virginal Lydia has sex with Kenneth, with whom she has developed an incestuous relationship after Abbie's death. However their mother Eileen catches them and, armed with a pair of scissors, angrily forces Kenneth out of the house before launching into an argument with her daughter, in which she brands Lydia dangerous and that she ought to be locked up. Eileen also reveals that Lydia and Kenneth are only half-siblings; Lydia being the product of a rape. 

Upon learning this, Lydia runs out of the house and Eileen follows her outside, despite having never ventured outside in over 16 years. Searching for Lydia, Eileen is overcome with flashbacks of her own sexual assault, and eventually locates Lydia; who has climbed to the top of a tree in a breakdown over Abbie's death. Eileen pleads with Lydia to come down, but she laughs, challenging her mother's lack of maternal affection, before losing her footing and leaping from the tree into a lake. 

Distraught, Eileen ventures into the water and cradles Lydia's seemingly drowned body, realizing that her emotional frigidity had done more harm to her daughter than she knew. Lydia regains consciousness, and the film ends with the two women in a crying embrace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1359">'''''Allegories of the Five Senses''''' is a series of early 17th century painting by the Spanish artist [[Jusepe de Ribera]]. One of the series (''Hearing'') has been lost and is only known through copies.

According the art historian [[Giulio Mancini]], a contemporary of the artist, their commissioner was Spanish but they were probably produced during Ribera's stay in Rome - Alfonso Pérez Sánchez dates their production to between 1611 and 1615{{sfn|Sánchez et Spinosa|p=60}}.

'''''The Funeral of Phocion''''' is a 1648 [[Landscape art|landscape]] painting, also known as '''''The Burial of Phocion''''', '''''Landscape with the Funeral of Phocion''''' and '''''Landscape with the Body of Phocion Carried out of Athens''''', by the French artist [[Nicolas Poussin]].
