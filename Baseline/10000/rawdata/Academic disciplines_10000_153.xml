'''Authoritarian literature''' &lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used by [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]] to designate the body of literature written by persons living under an [[authoritarian]] governmental regime. Literary works produced in these regimes share common characteristics that make the designation useful. Authoritarian regimes revere their leaders, who historically were typically referred to as kings, along with advisors to the king. These leaders were considered innately better than ordinary people. The authoritarian leader, and his approved circle, if not directly writing about a subject themselves, were the only ones who could designate, approve, and sanction writers as acceptable authorities. Government authorities also financially supported writers under a [[patronage]] system. The writers in such a system therefore must necessarily be careful to ensure the composition of their work met (or would meet) the approval of authorities. Failure to comply risked official warnings, loss of governmental sanction, and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life.

Fiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic. Subject matter can vary in terms of plot, but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society. This didactic point is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus, hopefully, perpetuate it. Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative. The author's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader. Since most people don't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior, the more successful (or popular) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise, or sugarcoat, their didactic purpose. One common way to achieve such indirectness is through the use of the form [[allegory]].

==Examples==

Good examples of authoritarian literature include ''[[Beowulf]]'', ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', and in [[English literature]] we see vestiges as late as [[Charles Dickens]]. While didacticism forms a significant component of [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]'s, [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s and [[C. S. Lewis]]' fiction as well, their works can not strictly be considered as authoritarian literature because they were not writing at the whim of political leaders. Dickens was not writing for the British government either, but he used the same forms of his predecessors, who did write for the court, particularly in his earlier novels, such as ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', where we most easily observe a certain preachiness. Dickens constructed his plots for the sake of demonstration rather than the purpose of exploration. However, Charles Dickens is a transitional figure, and in his later novels, such as ''[[Great Expectations]]'', we can "feel the two impulses warring in the writer's mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, John. ''The Art of Fiction''. New York: Random House 1983. Vintage Books ed. New York: Random House 1991. pp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Works==

Authoritarian literature is, of course, not a purely historical phenomenon. It persists as the dominant form of everyday literature of [[Middle East]]ern countries ([[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and arguably [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Iran]]'s literature excepted), and, until recently, [[Chinese literature]]. To understand the nature of authoritarian literature's purpose is to better understand the reason for the forms in which we see literature currently being produced in these countries.

The antithesis to Authoritarian literature is Anti-Authoritarian literature. Practitioners of this genre in the aforementioned countries are routinely subjected to harsh sanctions, and many choose to go into exile in order to write freely. Still other writers suffer censorship and imprisonment at their government's hands (e.g. [[Sunallah Ibrahim]] and [[Abdul Rahman Munif]]). Authoritarian literature authors, however, who write works of fiction that support or praise governments, as expected, often see promotion to positions of authority within their respective country's governing cultural body

The '''Basque Declaration''' (2016) is a formal document outlining 15 pathways for the development of more sustainable cities in Europe. The Declaration was acclaimed at the 8th European Conference on Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns from 27-29 April 2016 in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. The document can be seen as a continuation of the [[Aalborg Charter|Aalborg Charter (1994)]] and the Aalborg Commitments (2004) echoing sustainability vision from Local [[Agenda 21|Agenda 21]], and is itself a call for active engagement from civil society..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/about-the-basque-declaration/|title=About the Basque Declaration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of the Declaration is 'to create productive, sustainable and resilient cities for a liveable and inclusive Europe'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/fileadmin/repository/Basque_Declaration/BD_May_Update/Basque-Declaration-ENGLISH-www.pdf|title=The Basque Declaration (English)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basque Declaration is targeted at city leaders in Europe, including mayors and city governments, and can also be signed by individuals. It outlines pathways to help city leaders shape the development of their own municipalities, and ultimately aims to accelerate socio-cultural, socio-economic and technological transformation. The Declaration is based on the understanding that a diversity of local initiatives are required to address social, environmental and economic challenges. It recognises the importance of things such as protecting biodiversity, decarbonising energy systems, creating more sustainable mobility systems, protecting water systems, adapting to climate change, promoting social inclusion and strengthening local economies, among other things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although focusing on action at the local scale, the Declaration is underpinned by the idea of cooperation, sharing and replication of solutions adapted to the local context. A strong theme of the Declaration is to have a highly engaged civil society, where participation is a key ingredient in both developing and ''implementing'' local transformative actions.

The 15 pathways listed in the Basque Declaration are summarised under three headings:

&lt;u&gt;The Socio-Cultural Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To develop a 'culture of sustainability'
* To actively involve citizens, going beyond just participatory planning to co-creative approaches
* To re-think boundaries between public and private activities
* To promote social innovation, enterprises and civic engagement, focusing especially on marginalised groups and immigrants
* To nurture the [[sharing economy|sharing economy]] and ideas that combine entrepreneurship, civic engagement and societal transformation

&lt;u&gt;The Socio-Economic Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To turn challenges into opportunities for local economies in key areas such as energy and food production
* To create and close local value chains, increasing public income and local investment
* To apply innovative financing, including crowd-funding and blends of public funding or complementary currencies
* To purchase products and services conscientiously, taking into account the environmental, social and economic impacts of purchasing decisions
* To pursue development towards a circular economy, reducing the demand of natural resources and waste output

&lt;u&gt;The Technological Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To wisely take advantage of smart technologies
* To use public procurement as a way to accelerate innovation in the market
* To address the [[Digital divide|digital divide]] within local societies, focusing on equal access
* To support open data standards, keeping data available to the public
* The prepare political and governance structures to deal with these changes

==Transformative actions==

The Declaration supports local 'transformative actions' and encourages cities to develop and share their sustainability solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transformative Action Award|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/transformative-action-award/|website=Sustainable Cities EU|access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.sustainablecities.eu/| Sustainable Cities EU] website has a central database where cities can submit their own 'transformative actions'. The idea is that local innovations can inspire other city leaders and where it is possible, help to facilitate replication of successful strategies. To encourage cities to report on their activities a 'Transformative Action Award' was created.

The '''Bielefeld School''' is a group of German historians based originally at [[Bielefeld University]] who promote [[social history]] and [[political history]] using quantification and the methods of [[political science]] and [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lorenz, Chris "Wehler, Hans-Ulrich" pages 1289–1290 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 2 page 1289&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaders include [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Jürgen Kocka]] and [[Reinhart Koselleck]]. Instead of emphasizing the personalities of great historical leaders, as in the conventional approach, it concentrates on socio-cultural developments. History as "historical social science" (as Wehler described it) has mainly been explored in the context of studies of German society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The movement has published the scholarly journal ''{{ill|Geschichte und Gesellschaft: Zeitschrift fur Historische Sozialwissenschaft|de|Geschichte und Gesellschaft}}'' since 1975.

Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s–60s as the successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].  The German brand of "history of society"—''Gesellschaftsgeschichte''—has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. [[Modernization theory]] was presented by Wehler and his Bielefeld School as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the [[modernization theory]] of [[Max Weber]], with concepts also from [[Karl Marx]], [[Otto Hintze]], [[Gustav Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fletcher,  "Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics." ''German Studies Review'' 1984 7(3): 451-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte==
''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte'' (1987–) is Wehler's comprehensive 5-volume history of German society in the eighteenth-twentieth centuries. Each volume approaches historical processes from a social history perspective, organized under the themes of demographics, economics, and social equality.  His detailed structural analysis of developmental processes supported by a vast body of notes and statistics sometimes obscures the larger context. Nonetheless, patterns of continuity and change in the social fabric are emphasized.   More than a historiographical synthesis of Ranke and Marx (envisioned by some German historians after the catastrophe of World War I), Wehler's work incorporates [[Max Weber]]'s concepts of authority, economy, and culture and strives toward a concept of "total history."

Volumes 1–2 cover the period from feudalism through the Revolution of 1848. Volume 3 ''Von der "Deutschen Doppelrevolution" bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849–1914'' (1995) employs Wehler's longtime emphasis on a German [[Sonderweg]] or "special path" as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the twentieth century. Wehler places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s–1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.  Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society. Recognizing the importance of modernizing forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).  Wehler's ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gründung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914–1949'' (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society.  The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernization of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's fourth volume is his treatment of "the middle class" and "revolution," each of which was instrumental in shaping the twentieth century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of "charismatic domination," which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler.  The fifth volume will extend to 1990; none of the series has yet been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871–1918'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
British historian of Germany [[Richard J. Evans]] disagreed with the Bielefeld school regarding the Sonderweg thesis. Instead he argued for the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the twentieth century in a "[[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|failed bourgeois revolution]]" in 1848. Influenced by the [[New Left]], Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history in the Imperial period "from below."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore S. Hamerow, "Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History" ''The American Historical Review'', February 1983, Volume 88#1 pages 53–72 quote on page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'', he launched a critique of the "top-down" approach of the Bielefeld School. Evans and the others wanted a perspective from the Left that stressed the importance of the working class by highlighting "the importance of the grass roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, "Introduction: Wilhelm II's Germany and the Historians" in Evans, ed. ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'' (1978) pages 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Along with historians [[Geoff Eley]] and [[David Blackbourn]], Evans emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;See Evans, ''In Defence of History,'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural turn===
From the 1980s, however, the Bielefeld school was increasingly challenged by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'? On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Modernization Theory for History." ''Rethinking History'' 2006 10(2): 171-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kocka responded by arguing that social history has become so all-pervasive that it has lost its position as the cutting edge within historiography. He says, "But: in the meantime social historians' approaches, viewpoints, topics and results have been accepted and incorporated by many other historians who would not call themselves social historians. Social history has successfully penetrated its opponents."  He expects to see a return to social history, this time with more cultural and linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Magnússon, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brewer–Dobson circulation''' is a [[Model (abstract)|model]] of atmospheric circulation, proposed by [[Alan West Brewer|Alan Brewer]] in 1949 and [[Gordon Dobson]] in 1956, which attempts to explain why tropical air has less [[ozone]] than polar air, even though the tropical [[stratosphere]] is where most atmospheric ozone is produced. It is a simple circulation model that posits the existence of a slow [[Air current|current]] in the winter [[Sphere|hemisphere]] which redistributes air from the tropics to the extratropics.  The Brewer–Dobson circulation is driven by [[atmospheric waves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281990%29047%3C0392%3AOTGEOM%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | title= On the Global Exchange of Mass between the Stratosphere and Troposphere|author = J.R.

'''Cabinets of curiosities''' (also known in [[German language|German]] loanwords as '''Kunstkabinett''', '''Kunstkammer''' or '''Wunderkammer'''; also '''Cabinets of Wonder''', and '''wonder-rooms''') were encyclopedic collections of objects the categorical boundaries of which were, in [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]], yet to be defined. Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to [[natural history]] (sometimes faked), [[geology]], [[ethnography]], [[archaeology]], religious or historical [[relic]]s, works of art (including  [[cabinet painting]]s), and [[antiquities]]. "The Kunstkammer was regarded as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] or theater of the world, and a memory theater. The Kunstkammer conveyed symbolically the patron's control of the world through its indoor, microscopic reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Francesaco Fiorani, reviewing Bredecamp 1995 in ''Renaissance Quarterly'' '''51'''.1  (Spring 1998:268-270) p 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Charles I of England]]'s collection, Peter Thomas states succinctly, "The ''Kunstkabinett'' itself was a form of propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, "Charles I of England: The tragedy of Absolutism", A.G. Dickens, ed. ''The Courts of Europe'' (London) 1977:201.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the most famous, best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of [[science]] in [[Europe]] formed collections that were precursors to [[museum]]s.

The term ''[[Cabinet (architecture)|cabinet]]'' originally described a room rather than a [[Cabinet (furniture)|piece of furniture]]. The classic cabinet of curiosities emerged in the sixteenth century, although more rudimentary collections had existed earlier. The Kunstkammer of [[Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (ruled 1576–1612), housed in the [[Hradschin]] at Prague, was unrivalled north of the Alps; it provided a solace and retreat for contemplation&lt;ref&gt;This is the secretive aspect emphasised by R.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;W. Evans, ''Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II and His World: A Study in Intellectual History'' (Oxford) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; that also served to demonstrate his imperial magnificence and power in symbolic arrangement of their display, ceremoniously presented to visiting diplomats and magnates.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, "Remarks on the Collections of Rudolf&amp;nbsp;II: The Kunstkammer as a Form of Representatio",&lt;!--Representatio is correct--&gt; ''Art Journal'' '''38'''.1 (Autumn 1978:22–28).&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf's uncle, [[Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;II, Archduke of Austria]], also had a collection, with a special emphasis on paintings of people with interesting deformities, which remains largely intact as the [[Chamber of Art and Curiosities]] at [[Ambras Castle]] in Austria.

==History==
[[Image:RitrattoMuseoFerranteImperato.jpg|thumb|left|Fold-out engraving from [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599), the earliest illustration of a natural history cabinet]]
[[Image:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|A corner of a cabinet, painted by [[Frans II Francken]] in 1636 reveals the range of connoisseurship a Baroque-era ''[[virtuoso]]'' might evince]]
The earliest pictorial record of a natural history cabinet is the engraving in [[Ferrante Imperato]]'s ''Dell'Historia Naturale'' (Naples 1599) (''illustration, left''). It serves to authenticate its author's credibility as a source of natural history information, in showing his open bookcases at the right, in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Some of the volumes doubtless represent his [[herbarium]]. Every surface of the vaulted ceiling is occupied with preserved fishes, stuffed mammals and curious shells, with a stuffed crocodile suspended in the centre. Examples of corals stand on the bookcases. At the left, the room is fitted out like a ''studiolo''&lt;ref&gt;''Studiolo'': the small retreats in the palaces of Urbino and Gubbio were inlaid with [[intarsia]] that figured just such fitted cabinets with feigned lattice doors and shelves filled with scientific instruments, books and small sculptures in ''trompe-l'oeil'' perspective. The Gubbio ''studiolo'' has been reassembled at the [[Metropolitan Museum]]; the Urbino ''studiolo'' remains in situ.&lt;/ref&gt; with a range of built-in cabinets whose fronts can be unlocked and let down to reveal intricately fitted nests of pigeonholes forming architectural units, filled with small mineral specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Sixteenth-century cabinet-makers serving the luxury trades of [[Florence]] and [[Antwerp]] were beginning to produce moveable cabinets with similar architectural interior fittings, which could be set upon a carpet-covered table or on a purpose-built stand.&lt;/ref&gt; Above them, stuffed birds stand against panels inlaid with square polished stone samples, doubtless marbles and jaspers or fitted with pigeonhole compartments for specimens. Below them, a range of cupboards contain specimen boxes and covered jars.

In 1587 Gabriel Kaltemarckt advised [[Christian&amp;nbsp;I of Saxony]] that three types of item were indispensable in forming a "Kunstkammer" or art collection: firstly sculptures and paintings; secondly "curious items from home or abroad"; and thirdly "antlers, horns, claws, feathers and other things belonging to strange and curious animals".&lt;ref&gt;B. Gutfleish and J. Menzhausen, "How a Kunstkammer Should Be Formed", ''Journal of the History of Collections'', 1989 Vol I: p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Albrecht Dürer]] visited the [[Netherlands]] in 1521, apart from artworks he sent back to [[Nuremberg]] various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 48.{{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly characteristic range of interests represented in  [[Frans II Francken]]'s painting of 1636 (''illustration, left'') shows paintings on the wall that range from landscapes, including a moonlit scene—a genre in itself—to a portrait and a religious picture (the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'') intermixed with preserved tropical marine fish and a string of carved beads, most likely [[amber]], which is both precious and a natural curiosity. Sculpture both classical and secular (the sacrificing ''Libera'', a Roman fertility goddess)&lt;ref&gt;Her base is inscribed LIBER[A]&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand and modern and religious (''Christ at the Column''&lt;ref&gt;It appears to represent a reduction of a well-known sculpture by [[Alessandro Algardi]].&lt;/ref&gt;) are represented, while on the table are ranged, among the exotic shells (including some tropical ones and a shark's tooth): [[portrait miniature]]s, gem-stones mounted with pearls in a curious quatrefoil box, a set of sepia [[Chiaroscuro|chiaroscuro woodcuts]] or drawings, and a small [[still-life]] painting&lt;ref&gt;Still life was considered a [[hierarchy of genres|lesser genre]] than even portraits or landscapes.&lt;/ref&gt; leaning against a flower-piece, coins and medals—presumably Greek and Roman—and Roman terracotta oil-lamps, a Chinese-style brass lock, curious flasks, and a blue-and-white Ming porcelain bowl.

Two of the most famously described seventeenth-century cabinets were those of [[Ole Worm]], known as Olaus Wormius (1588–1654) (''illustration, above right''), and [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602–1680). These seventeenth-century cabinets were filled with preserved animals, horns, tusks, skeletons, minerals, as well as other interesting man-made objects: sculptures wondrously old, wondrously fine or wondrously small; clockwork [[automaton|automata]]; ethnographic specimens from exotic locations. Often they would contain a mix of fact and fiction, including apparently [[mythology|mythical]] creatures. Worm's collection contained, for example, what he thought was a [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Scythian Lamb]], a woolly [[fern]] thought to be a plant/sheep fabulous creature. However he was also responsible for identifying the [[narwhal]]'s tusk as coming from a whale rather than a [[unicorn]], as most owners of these believed. The specimens displayed were often collected during exploring expeditions and trading voyages.

In the second half of the 18th century, [[Belsazar Hacquet]] (c. 1735–1815) operated in [[Ljubljana]], then the capital of [[Carniola]], a natural history cabinet ({{lang-de|Naturalienkabinet}}) that was appreciated throughout Europe and was visited by the highest nobility, including the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Russian grand duke [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]] and [[Pope Pius VI]], as well as by famous naturalists, such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Francesco Griselini|it}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Benedikt Hermann|de|3=Franz Benedikt Hermann (Geologe)}}. It included a number of minerals, including specimens of mercury from the [[Idrija mercury mine|Idrija mine]], a ''[[herbarium vivum]]'' with over 4,000 specimens of Carniolan and foreign plants, a smaller number of animal specimens, a natural history and medical library, and an [[anatomical theatre]].&lt;ref name=Jezernik&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-IARZL5AU |title=Ljubljanske »knjige sveta« od Auerspergov do Hacqueta |first=Božidar |last=Jezernik |year=2009 |language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=Ljubljana's "Books of the World" – from the Auerspergs to Hacquet |journal=Etnolog |id={{COBISS|ID=1242502}} |volume=19=70 |pages=23–33 |issn=0354-0316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinets of curiosities would often serve scientific advancement when images of their contents were published. The catalog of Worm's collection, published as the ''Museum Wormianum'' (1655), used the collection of artifacts as a starting point for Worm's speculations on philosophy, science, natural history, and more.

Cabinets of curiosities were limited to those who could afford to create and maintain them. Many [[monarch]]s, in particular, developed large collections. A rather under-used example, stronger in art than other areas, was the [[Studiolo of Francesco&amp;nbsp;I]], the first Medici Grand-Duke of Tuscany. [[Frederick&amp;nbsp;III of Denmark]], who added Worm's collection to his own after Worm's death, was another such monarch. A third example is the [[Kunstkamera]] founded by [[Peter the Great]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1714. Many items were bought in Amsterdam from [[Albertus Seba]] and [[Frederik Ruysch]]. The fabulous [[Habsburg]] Imperial collection included important [[Aztec]] artifacts, including the [[Montezuma's headdress|feather head-dress]] or crown of [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] now in the [[Vienna Museum of Ethnology|Museum of Ethnology, Vienna]]. 
[[File:Berlin Naturkundemuseum Korallen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An early eighteenth-century German  ''Schrank'' with a traditional display of [[coral]]s (Naturkundenmuseum Berlin)]]

Similar collections on a smaller scale were the complex ''Kunstschränke'' produced in the early seventeenth century by the [[Augsburg]] merchant, diplomat and collector [[Philipp Hainhofer]]. These were cabinets in the sense of pieces of furniture, made from all imaginable exotic and expensive materials and filled with contents and ornamental details intended to reflect the entire cosmos on a miniature scale. The best preserved example is the one given by the city of Augsburg to King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] in 1632, which is kept in the [[Gustavianum|Museum Gustavianum]] in [[Uppsala]]. The [[curio cabinet]], as a modern single piece of furniture, is a version of the grander historical examples.

The juxtaposition of such disparate objects, according to Horst Bredekamp's analysis (Bredekamp 1995), encouraged comparisons, finding analogies and parallels and favoured the cultural change from a world viewed as static to a dynamic view of endlessly transforming natural history and a historical perspective that led in the seventeenth century to the germs of a scientific view of reality.

A late example of the juxtaposition of natural materials with richly worked artifice is provided by the [[Grünes Gewölbe]], the "Green Vaults" formed by [[Augustus the Strong]] in [[Dresden]] to display his chamber of wonders.  The "Enlightenment Gallery" in the [[British Museum]], installed in the former "Kings Library" room in 2003 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the museum, aims to recreate the abundance and diversity that still characterized museums in the mid-eighteenth century, mixing shells, rock samples and botanical specimens with a great variety of artworks and other man-made objects from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/themes/room_1_enlightenment.aspx |title=Enlightenment Gallery at the British Museum |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seventeenth-century parlance, both French and English, a ''cabinet'' came to signify a collection of works of art, which might still also include an assembly objects of ''[[virtù]]'' or curiosities, such as a ''[[virtuoso]]'' would find intellectually stimulating. In 1714, [[Michael Bernhard Valentini]] published an early [[Museology|museological]] work, ''Museum Museorum'', an account of the cabinets known to him with catalogues of their contents.

Some strands of the early universal collections, the bizarre or freakish biological specimens, whether genuine or fake, and the more exotic historical objects, could find a home in commercial [[freak show]]s and [[sideshows]].

[[Sir Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753) was an English physician, a member of the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]], and the founder of the [[British Museum]] in London. He began sporadically collecting plants in England and France while studying medicine. In 1687, the [[Duke of Albemarle]] offered Sloane a position as personal physician to the West Indies fleet at Jamaica. He accepted and spent fifteen months collecting and cataloguing the native plants, animals, and artificial curiosities (e.g. cultural artifacts of native and African populations) of Jamaica. This became the basis for his two volume work, ''Natural History of Jamaica'', published in 1707 and 1725. Sloane returned to England in 1689 with over eight hundred specimens of plants, which were live or mounted on heavy paper in an eight-volume herbarium. He also attempted to bring back live animals (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;snakes, an alligator, and an iguana) but they all died before reaching England.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 20–42; Clark, Jack A. " Sir Hans Sloane and Abbé Jean Paul Bignon: Notes on Collection Building in the Eighteenth Century," in ''The Library Quarterly'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (October 1980), 475–482; de Beer, G.&amp;nbsp;R. "Sir Hans Sloane, F.R.S 1660–1753," in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1953), 81–84; and [[Kay Dian Kriz|Kriz, Kay Dian]]. "Curiosities, Commodities, and Transplanted Bodies in Hans Sloane's "Natural History of Jamaica", in ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 57, No. 1 (January 2000), 35–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane meticulously cataloged and created extensive records for most of the specimens and objects in his collection. He also began to acquire other collections by gift or purchase. [[Herman Boerhaave]] gave him four volumes of plants from Boerhaave's gardens at Leiden. William Charleton, in a bequest in 1702, gave Sloane numerous books of birds, fish, flowers, and shells and his miscellaneous museum consisting of curiosities, miniatures, insects, medals, animals, minerals, precious stones and curiosities in amber. Sloane purchased [[Leonard Plukenet]]'s collection in 1710. It consisted of twenty-three volumes with over 8,000 plants from Africa, India, Japan and China. [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630–1715)]], left him a twelve-volume herbarium from her gardens at Chelsea and Badminton upon her death in 1714. Reverend [[Adam Buddle]] gave Sloane thirteen volumes of British plants. In 1716, Sloane purchased Englebert Kaempfer's volume of Japanese plants and [[James Petiver]]'s virtual museum of approximately one hundred volumes of plants from Europe, North America, Africa, the Near East, India, and the Orient. [[Mark Catesby]] gave him plants from North America and the West Indies from an expedition funded by Sloane. [[Philip Miller]] gave him twelve volumes of plants grown from the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 20–42; de Beer, G. R. "Sir Hans Sloane, F.R.S 1660–1753," in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1953), 81–84; Gray, Basil. "Sloane and the Kaempfer Collection," in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 20–23; and "The Sloane Collection of Manuscripts" in ''The British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 1, Sir Hans Sloane (March 1953), 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane acquired approximately three hundred and fifty artificial curiosities from North American Indians, Eskimos, South America, the Lapland, Siberia, East Indies, and the West Indies, including nine items from Jamaica.
"These ethnological artifacts were important because they established a field of collection for the British Museum that was to increase greatly with the explorations of Captain [[James Cook]] in Oceania and Australia and the rapid expansion of the [[British Empire]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Edward P. ''Museum Masters: Their Museums and Their Influence'', (Walnut Creek, London, New Delhi: AltaMira Press, 1995), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon his death in 1753, Sloane bequeathed his sizable collection of 337 volumes to England for £20,000. In 1759, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s royal library was added to Sloane’s collection to form the foundation of the British Museum.

[[John Tradescant the elder]] (circa 1570s–1638) was a gardener, naturalist, and botanist in the employ of the Duke of Buckingham. He collected plants, bulbs, flowers, vines, berries, and fruit trees from Russia, the Levant, Algiers, France, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and the East Indies. His son, [[John Tradescant the younger]] (1608–1662) traveled to Virginia in 1637 and collected flowers, plants, shells, an Indian deerskin mantle believed to have belonged to [[Powhatan]], father of [[Pocahontas]]. Father and son, in addition to botanical specimens, collected zoological (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;the [[dodo]] from Mauritius, the upper jaw of a walrus, and armadillos), artificial curiosities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;wampum belts, portraits, lathe turned ivory, weapons, costumes, Oriental footwear and carved alabaster panels) and rarities (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;a mermaid's hand, a dragon's egg, two feathers of a phoenix's tail, a piece of the True Cross, and a vial of blood that rained in the Isle of Wight). By the 1630s, the Tradescants displayed their eclectic collection at their residence in South Lambeth. Tradescant's Ark, as it came to be known, was the earliest major cabinet of curiosity in England and open to the public for a small entrance fee.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr"&gt;Ivins, Jr., William M. "The Tradescant Collection", in ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', Vol. 20, No. 8 (August 1925), 194–197; Josten, C.H. ''Elias Ashmole (1617–1692): His Autobiographical and Historical Notes, His Correspondence, and Other Contemporary Sources Relating to His Life and Work: Texts, 1661–1672'', (Oxford: Clarendon, 1967); Leith-Ross, Prudence.

[[Elias Ashmole]] (1617–1692) was a lawyer, chemist, antiquarian, [[Freemason]], and a member of the Royal Society with a keen interest in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and botany. Ashmole was also a neighbor of the Tradescants in Lambeth. He financed the publication of ''Musaeum Tradescantianum'', a catalogue of the Ark collection in 1656. Ashmole, a collector in his own right, acquired the Tradescant Ark in 1659 and added it to his collection of astrological, medical, and historical manuscripts. In 1675, he donated his library and collection and the Tradescant collection to the [[University of Oxford]], provided that a suitable building be provided to house the collection. Ashmole’s donation formed the foundation of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at Oxford.&lt;ref name="IvinsJr" /&gt;

Cabinets of Curiosities can now be found at [[Snowshill Manor]] and [[Wallington Hall]]. The concept has been reinterpreted at [[The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art &amp; Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A two-headed lamb and ancient dildos: the UK's strangest new museum|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/28/two-headed-lamb-ancient-dildos-uks-strangest-new-museum|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-04|first = Oliver|last = Wainwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social function====
[[File:17th-Century Cabinet of Curiosities.jpg|thumb|left|Italian Baroque-era cabinet of curiosities, circa 1635.]]
Cabinets of curiosities served not only as collections to reflect the particular curiosities of their curators but as social devices to establish and uphold rank in society. There are said to be two main types of cabinets. As R. J. W. Evans notes, there could be "the princely cabinet, serving a largely representational function, and dominated by aesthetic concerns and a marked predilection for the exotic," or the less grandiose, "the more modest collection of the humanist scholar or virtuoso, which served more practical and scientific purposes." Evans goes on to explain that "no clear distinction existed between the two categories: all collecting was marked by curiosity, shading into credulity, and by some sort of universal underlying design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Impey, MacGregor|first1=Oliver, Arthur|title=The Origins of Museums: The Cabinet of Curiosities in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cabinets of curiosity serving as an establisher of socioeconomic status for its curator, these cabinets served as entertainment, as particularly illustrated by the proceedings of the [[Royal Society]], whose early meetings were often a sort of open floor to any Fellow to exhibit the findings his curiosities led him to. However purely educational or investigative these exhibitions may sound, it is important to note that the Fellows in this period supported the idea of “learned entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/detail.action?docID=10677039&amp;p00=cabinet+curiosities|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” or the alignment of learning with entertainment. This was not unusual, as the Royal Society had an earlier history of a love of the marvellous. This love was often exploited by eighteenth-century natural philosophers to secure the attention of their audience during their exhibitions.

Places of exhibitions of and places of new societies that promoted natural knowledge also seemed to culture the idea of perfect civility. Some scholars propose that this was “a reaction against the dogmatism and enthusiasm of the [[English Civil War]] and Interregum [sic].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fontes da Costa|first1=Palmira|title=Singular and the Making of Knowledge at the Royal Society of London in the Eighteenth Century|website=site.ebrary.com/lib/byuprovo/reader.action?docID=10677039|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This move to politeness put bars on how one should behave and interact socially, which enabled the distinguishing of the polite from the supposed common or more vulgar members of society. Exhibitions of curiosities (as they were typically odd and foreign marvels) attracted a wide, more general audience, which “[rendered] them more suitable subjects of polite discourse at the Society.”&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt; A subject was considered less suitable for polite discourse if the curiosity being displayed was accompanied by too much other material evidence, as it allowed for less conjecture and exploration of ideas regarding the displayed curiosity. Because of this, many displays simply included a concise description of the phenomena and avoided any mention of explanation for the phenomena. Quentin Skinner describes the early Royal Society as “something much more like a gentleman’s club,&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;” an idea supported by [[John Evelyn]], who depicts the Royal Society as “an Assembly of many honorable Gentlemen, who meete inoffensively together under his Majesty’s Royal Cognizance; and to entertaine themselves ingenously, whilst their other domestique avocations or publique business deprives them of being always in the company of learned men and that they cannot dwell forever in the Universities.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt;”

===United States===
Thomas Dent Mütter (1811–1859) was an early American pioneer of reconstructive plastic surgery. His specialty was repairing congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palates, and club foot. He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to Mütter's death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the [[American College of Physicians]] in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. Mütter’s collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The [[Mütter Museum]] began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including [[Benjamin Rush]]'s medical chest and [[Florence Nightingale]]'s sewing kit. In 1874 the museum acquired one hundred human skulls from Austrian anatomist and phrenologist, [[Joseph Hyrtl]] (1810–1894); a nineteenth-century corpse, dubbed the "soap lady"; the conjoined liver and death cast of [[Chang and Eng Bunker]], the Siamese twins; and in 1893, [[Grover Cleveland]]'s jaw tumor. The Mütter Museum is an excellent example of a nineteenth-century grotesque cabinet of medical curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304022221/http://www.collphyphil.org/Site/mutter_museum.html |date=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundieart.com/cabinet/ |title=James G.

[[P.&amp;nbsp;T. Barnum]] took over [[Barnum's American Museum]] on five floors in New York, "perpetuating into the 1860s the Wunderkammer tradition of curiosities for gullible, often slow-moving throngs—Barnum's famously sly but effective method of crowd control was to post a sign, "THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS!" at the exit door".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324407504578185622576715416?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn_Life%26Culture "Catalog of Curiosities"] by BARRYMORE LAURENCE SCHERER Wall Street Journal.

In 1908, New York businessmen formed the [[Hobby Club]], a dining club limited to 50 men, in order to showcase their "cabinets of wonder" and their selected collections. These included literary specimens and [[incunable]]; antiquities such as ancient armour; precious stones and geological items of interest. Annual formal dinners would be used to open the various collections up to inspection for the other members of the club.&lt;ref&gt;According to its constitution, "This Club shall be called THE HOBBY CLUB. The object of the Club shall be to encourage the collection of literary, artistic and scientific works; to aid in the development of literary, artistic and scientific matters; to promote social and literary intercourse among its members, and the discussion and consideration of various literary and economic subjects."[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101060744370 Annals of the Hobby Club of New York City, 1912–1920].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
[[Image:My Cabinet o'Curiosities1.jpg|thumb|right|upright||Modern interpretation of a Wunderkammer]]

The Houston Museum of Natural Science houses a hands-on Cabinet of Curiosities, complete with taxidermied crocodile embedded in the ceiling a la Ferrante Imperato's Dell'Historia Naturale. In [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the modern-day [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] anachronistically seeks to recreate the sense of wonder that the old cabinets of curiosity once aroused.&lt;ref&gt;The American writer Lawrence Weschler, wrote an entire book about the museum: ''Mr. Wilson's Cabinet Of Wonder: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]], the house and museum of Alex Jordan, known as [[House on the Rock]], can also be interpreted as a modern day curiosity cabinet, especially in the collection and display of automatons. In [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], [[Musée Patamécanique]] is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theater and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics, an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by [['Pataphysics|Pataphysics]]. The idea of a cabinet of curiosities has also appeared in recent publications and performances. For example, ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine is a quarterly magazine that juxtaposes apparently unrelated cultural artifacts and phenomena to show their interconnectedness in ways that encourage curiosity about the world. The Italian cultural association Wunderkamern&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderkammern.net// Wunderkammern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325091444/http://www.wunderkammern.net/ |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the theme of historical cabinets of curiosities to explore how "amazement" is manifested within today's artistic discourse. The May of 2008, the University of Leeds Fine Art BA programme hosted a show called "Wunder Kammer", the culmination of research and practice from students, which allowed viewers to encounter work from across all disciplines, ranging from intimate installation to thought-provoking video and highly skilled drawing, punctuated by live performances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120918075929/http://www.wunder-kammer.com/ wunder-kamer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several internet bloggers describe their sites as a wunderkammern either because they are primarily made up of links to things that are interesting, or because they inspire wonder in a similar manner to the original wunderkammern (see External Links, below). The researcher Robert Gehl describes such internet video sites as [[YouTube]] as modern-day wunderkammern, although in danger of being refined into capitalist institutions "just as professionalized curators refined Wunderkammers into the modern museum in the 18th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehl|first=Robert W.|title=Youtube As Archive: Who Will Curate This Digital Wunderkammer?|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|year=2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=43–60|doi=10.1177/1367877908098854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Christ at the Sea of Galilee''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Tintoretto|Jacopo Tintoretto]]. The painting depicts [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] raises a hand toward the [[apostles]], who appear in a boat amid hostile waves at sea. It is an example of [[mannerism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Christ at the Sea of Galilee| accessdate=2018-04-17| publisher=Aaron Art Prints| url=http://www.aaronartprints.org/tintoretto-christattheseaofgalilee.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; a European art style that exaggerates proportion and favors compositional tension. This can be seen in the expressive postures of the figures and the muted, yet intense color of the sea and sky.

Tintoretto had a mostly [[Venice|Venetian]] audience and was known for painting scenes of Venice, but this painting departs from this path. Additionally, the scene was made to look overly dramatic rather than realistic. The paint is thin and Tintoretto uses extreme highlights, intensifying the darkness and light that seems to come from a compressed and directed light source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Muhlberger| first=Richard| title=The Bible in Art: The New Testament| publisher=New York: Portland House| year=1990| pages=82-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is currently on display in the Samuel H. Kress Collection at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=nga&gt;{{cite web| title=National Gallery of Art| publisher=National Gallery of Art| url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.41637.html| accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dalibor Vesely''' (19 June 1934 – 31 March 2015&lt;ref name="AJObituary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/obituary-dalibor-vesely-1934-2015/8680795.article|title=Obituary: Dalibor Vesely (1934 – 2015)|work=[[Architects'_Journal]]|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-born [[architectural historian]] and [[Architectural theory|theorist]] who was influential through his teaching and writing in promoting the role of [[hermeneutics]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as part of the discourse of architecture and of architectural design.

Vesely was one of the most outstanding architectural teachers of the late twentieth century. As well as inspiring generations of students, he taught some of the current leading architects and architectural historians, such as [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Eric Parry]], [[Alberto Pérez-Gómez]], [[Mohsen Mostafavi]] and [[David Leatherbarrow]]. He began teaching at the [[University of Essex]], before moving to  the [[Architectural Association]] in London and in 1978 to the [[University of Cambridge Department of Architecture]], where he also started an M.Phil. programme in History and Philosophy of Architecture with [[Peter Carl]]. Together with Peter Carl, his teaching and theoretical approach became associated and dominated the Cambridge Architecture School in the 1980s and early 1990s. After retiring from his full-time post in Cambridge, Vesely continued to teach there, remaining Director of Studies at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] and he also taught Architectural History and Philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and was an Honorary Professorial Fellow at the [[Manchester School of Architecture]]. In 2005 he was recipient of the CICA Bruno Zevi Book Award granted by the [[International Committee of Architectural Critics]] for his book "Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation". In 2006 the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) honoured Dalibor Vesely with the Annie Spink Award for Excellence in Architectural Education and in 2015 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the RIBA in recognition of both his lifetime contributions to architectural theory and to teaching.  

== Biography ==
Vesely was Born in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]],in 1934. He studied engineering, architecture, art history and philosophy in [[Prague]], [[Munich]], [[Paris]] and [[Heidelberg]] and obtained his PhD from [[Charles University in Prague]]. This was supervised by  [[Josef Havlicek]], [[Karel Honzik]], and [[Jaroslav Fragner]]. He studied with [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], with whom he kept a correspondence until Gadamer's death. He stated it was the philosopher of phenomenology [[Jan Patočka]] who, in his own words, “contributed more than anyone else to [his] overall intellectual orientation and to the articulation of some of the critical topics”  it was under the influence of Gadamer and  Patočka that he developed the lifelong interest in the poetics and hermeneutics of architecture that defined his teaching and research .
Vesely was in England with his brother in 1968 when the Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia. He stayed in London, first teaching at the Architectural Association, taking charge of the 'Unit 1' studio and then moving to the [[University of Essex]] where he and [[Joseph Rykwert]] established a Masters Degree in architectural history. He was invited to Cambridge by [[Colin St John Wilson]] in 1978. There he, Rykwert and Peter Carl initiated MPhil and PhD courses in the history and philosophy of architecture, thereby bringing the emerging studio culture which had been cultivated at the AA which came to define the school in the 1980s and 1990s.

== Architecture and hermeneutics ==
Vesely's work may be understood primarily as a contribution to cultural [[hermeneutics]], and his exploration of the historical background of modern science in the sixteenth- and seventeenth centuries is particularly rich in detail and insight onto the changing nature of [[representations (arts)|representation]]. Vesely polemises on concepts such as [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and [[anamorphosis]], which are traditionally understood to have taken departure from [[Renaissance]] culture. Vesely contributes to the current debate with the depth of the problem of representation; a question which has divided [[Western philosophy]] with regard to the [[epistemology|epistemological]] possibility of representation and understanding of natural phenomena. The 'birth' of modern science and its increasing challenge on traditional views has also marked the divide within the possibilities of representation. In the context of the seventeenth century, this was especially clear as a polemics surrounding the nature of scientific work and philosophical understanding.

According to Vesely, the inevitable partiality of such views is at the very core of the problem that affects the cultural understanding of representation. Its contingent nature was not always understood as a divide originating all kinds of dualisms. Before modern science, representation was naturally contingent and the universal aspirations of science ([[metaphysics]]) were bound to the nature of the epistemological ground (''arché''). Vesely's work traces back the [[ontological]] foundations of the problem to the Greek context, helping to clarify its original meaning. In ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation'' (2004), Vesely presents the notion of ''ground'' as having a provisional nature, that can only be seized as a continuity of reference through different levels of representation, ranging from the more explicit, visible world down to a ''latent world'' of potential articulation. Precisely this continuity is what may allow us to address the modern, fragmented notion of representation as a task of rehabilitation, which would trace the fragment back to its original whole.

== Architecture and representation ==
Vesely's written work was mostly in articles in journals and many of the arguments developed over the years in lectures and seminars. There is thus no comprehensive overview of his thought or his range of interests. However ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation'' (2004), provides a summary of his thinking and this work remains the main source for understanding his approach. Many of his other ideas which were expressed in lectures and seminars remain unpublished. 

===Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation===
In ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation'' (2004), Vesely sets the argument from the experience of architecture, as it constantly works through different modes of representation, including "built reality". In it, Vesely defines the present cultural situation as divided and ambiguous, especially when it comes to architecture (pp.&amp;nbsp;4–12, 36, 44 ss). Twentieth-century architecture, he argues, places its trust in the epistemological model of modern science and technology that is today largely reflected in instrumental concepts of city and suburban landscape. Today, he states, the attempt to rehabilitate the primary tradition of architecture faces the problem of bridging the gap between different modes of representation and concepts of [[knowledge]] that in some cases precede modern science, i.e., precede the historical notion of scientific knowledge as it takes course from the seventeenth- and sixteenth centuries.

Vesely's research delved into these historical settings that are understood to be the birthplace of modern science, in the general hope of exposing the origin of our modern notion of [[knowledge]] and how it came about to emancipate from traditional representations of the world. Vesely's research was accordingly a working out the historical notion of representation, as it constituted a central issue in this historical affair; and how the construction of a modern notion of knowledge had much to do with a changing nature in the concept of representation (pp.&amp;nbsp;13–19). The concept as it is generally understood today largely surpasses the history of epistemology. According to Vesely, this is because representation is generally understood on the basis of a certain "continuity between a particular mode of representation and what is represented" (p.&amp;nbsp;14), a notion which has been current throughout the whole of European architectural history.

=== The modern situation===
When looking at the modern situation, Vesely finds that the problem is generally structured on the basis of an ontological difference that is intrinsic to representation itself. This is precisely the difference that allows modes of representation to emancipate from that which is represented, and from particular, given circumstances (pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5). The discussion of ''ontological difference'' therefore constitutes an ''epistemological difference'' affecting the conditions and possibilities of knowledge. And speculative thought, which we so associate with modern science, is built on this difference. Charles Taylor (1995) points out how the question for modern science is to fit a particular mode of representation to another, extrinsic representation: what we commonly call the "outer reality". The difference between the two constantly jeopardizes their epistemological value; and affects not only the way in which representation relates to ''what it means to represent'', but also between different modes of representing it.

In response, Vesely's work explores how architecture constantly works between different modes of representation, through the difference between project and what is built, for instance, when it translates a whole city into a diagram, a plan or a map. The simple act of reading a map involves more than just the imagination to relate the map with the buildings and the surrounding space; it involves the reciprocity between different levels of representation, that may intake discrepancy and lack of information. According to Vesely, this kind of discrepancy might be useful to understand the nature of the question; and may in fact become a means to understand what impairs the communication between different levels of representation, and conversely, what happens when such communication takes place.

Vesely also takes up the example of an experiment that, paradoxically perhaps, was carried out in the hey-day of logical [[empiricism]]. The experiment was carried out by Schilder, and involved a temporary inversion of the visual field (pp.&amp;nbsp;46ss), leaving other perceptual fields untouched. Schilder's experiment addressed the discontinuity between the visual and other fields of [[perception]], and exposed the situated [[human body]] as a basic structure of spatial reference (pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49). Vesely investigates how the subjects of the experiment found that their bodies were the first instance they could rely on when trying to situate in a visual world that was not only upside down, but also turned from left to right; and when trying to perform simple gestures like picking up a book, or reading. Although the experience was difficult to endure, the inverted vision could be partially reconciled with the original body structure (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

According to Vesely, the ability to reconcile the acquired inverted vision with the situational structure of the human body, points out to a deeper problem when dealing with situation, which is related to our ability to become situated on provisional grounds, even when lacking a fundamental 'ground' of spatial or temporal reference. The example from inverted vision also means to show that such a basis is far from being immediate; it is constituted in the process of a search within the actual space and comes about in the reciprocity between different levels and forms of representation such as visual, tactile, and so forth. Vesely elaborates on situation and the phenomenon of being situated as an example of how we contextualize spatial knowledge and on which basis; and on how a particular point of reference allows us to situate spatial [[knowledge]]. In the course of the argument, Vesely demonstrates that what constitutes the fabric of situation is a continuity of reference and experience through different forms of articulating spatiality down to an implicit structure that itself is neither visual nor tactile, and is only potentially articulated in the objective realm (pp.&amp;nbsp;48, 82–87, 378ss).

=== Situation and perception ===
Vesely's argument on the epistemological process of being situated develops in terms of an analogy to the formation of the visual field. And takes the organic ability of sight only as a point of departure to the phenomenon of [[Visual perception|vision]], i.e. what one is able to recognize and know out of visual [[perception]]. Accordingly, the natural process of seeing is shown to be a result from learning. Vesely presents the example of inborn conditions of blindness treated through surgery, where sight itself only emerges after a painful stage of learning, and without which, the recently acquired sense of sight would be unable to detach or recognize individual objects out of a 'visual field' (pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51). Vesely describes how the integration of the newly acquired sense relies on the fact that the world of the blind is already structured, not only in terms of temporal sequences, but spatially; and that the reconciliation of the new ability of sight takes place on an already structured ground of existing objects and spatiality. [[Perception]] such as visual or tactile is reconciled upon an implicitly structured ground.

Vesely shows how the task of bridging different plateaux of representation can only be fulfilled by covering the distance to a common 'ground' (pp.&amp;nbsp;61–63). 'Ground' is like a point of departure from which it would become possible to uncover the basic structure of spatiality; but it is hardly the case that such an epistemological ground can provide us with an absolute source of spatial reference. The notion of epistemological ground is not established a priori, as a given point of reference. It comes about in the process of searching, taking place as a continuum of references between different levels of spatial understanding. In which case, what constitutes the structural source of situation is this ''stream of references'' (p.&amp;nbsp;60).

Vesely's notion of ground consists of a primary source of reference that in many ways coincides with the traditional Greek understanding of ''arché''. ''Arché'' is not an absolute source of reference, but only a primary one that works as a point of departure towards our notion of "earth" and our understanding of "world" (pp.&amp;nbsp;50–52). This is an ''insecure ground'' that in a sense, speaks more of its own [[topography]], than of clearly defined rules and references. Although this is an unfamiliar ground for modern science, Vesely accurately describes how much of the understanding of what it means to be situated derives from the knowledge of daily situations on Earth, where horizon and gravity play a common role. Accordingly, architecture's task of raising and 'building' situations does not address the mere existence of conditions such as floor or gravity, but concerns the fundamental condition of 'ground' allowing the phenomenon of situation to take place.

=== Situation and knowledge ===
On the epistemological level, this means that for Vesely, the nature of 'ground' allows an understanding of ‘spatial structure’; like a ''hermeneutical key'' granting access to phenomena of spatiality. Contemporary architecture has been particularly keen on challenging the average views on ''ground'' viz. gravity. Although most architecture cannot escape the 'predicament' of gravity, there are numerous examples of play with gravity and the 'visual weight' of architectural mass against gravity, starting from the early twentieth-century [[Constructivist architecture|constructivism]]. Such architectural play shows an impulse towards the emancipation from gravity as a natural source of situation, and looks forward to expose a more fundamental ground of reference and its problematic nature. Architecture is thus setting a clear challenge on everyday experience as they are structured characteristically in terms of up and down, and according to a horizontal ground. The experiment of the 'inverted vision' seems to show exactly that: the touch of ground helps to define the vertical and the relative distances of objects, orientation, and to recognize the [[physiognomy]] of the space. Outside these conditions it seems more or less obvious that the 'grounds' for situation escape our grasp. At the same time, architects are conscious that it is precisely the implicit nature of ground as a structure of references that makes the task of its architectural exploration so difficult.

Moreover, according to Vesely, the notion of 'ground' can never provide us with an absolute knowledge of the whole, but only with a mediated understanding of spatial structure. This means that the task of uncovering the hidden nature of ground becomes, a fortiori, one of looking for a provisional ground that is beyond gravity as a natural source of spatial reference. The first long-term programme dealing with the consequences of the absence of gravity was developed already in 1973 by the [[NASA]] [[Skylab]]. Vesely reports how one of the greatest difficulties encountered by the astronauts is the constant loss of orientation that becomes a general difficulty in recognizing previously known situations. Without gravity, an otherwise familiar compartment would be unrecognizable if not seen from a particular angle. The Sky Lab experience seems to illustrate quite well how the phenomenon of spatial structure and situation comes to be known through a sequence of approximations. Without the right orientation, simple recognition such as finding objects in their right places would become an almost impossible task. Once found the right orientation towards objects, however, the entire spatial frame of the compartment was recognized and so would all objects in their right places and relative positions. In a situation without light or gravity, one of the Sky Lab astronauts also described how a single touch on one of the walls of the space compartment would be sufficient to enact the knowledge of the relative position of the body with respect to all objects (pp.&amp;nbsp;52–54). This seems to be particularly relevant to show how a particular point of visual or tactile reference can provide with orientation; a physiognomic recognition of the space; and be related to the spatial disposition of the whole. These are instances that, according to Vesely, constitute a continuity of spatial reference and an epistemological, provisional ground. As it arises in the continuity of understanding the potential structure of the space, the notion of ground seems to be of a projective nature (p.&amp;nbsp;103).

=== The continuity of reference ===
Vesely seems to confer a projective ability on spatiality that is thus knowable from its own potential to generate a situation. According to Vesely, the continuity of reference to ground exists within a permanent tension with the actual space, a continuity which under certain conditions may be disrupted and even destroyed (pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56). The fact that there are discrepancies between different levels of representation should perhaps be no surprise as it is the case of the above-mentioned examples of reading a map, or orienting oneself in a space under zero gravity. That there is discrepancy between the given representation of a space and the actual space is in fact a common datum of everyday experience. The question is not to be solved, although it may constitute one important point of departure to understand the phenomenon of representation. This is particularly the case of extreme conditions where the phenomenon of 'continuity' is no longer recognizable. In the cases of [[aphasia]] and [[apraxia]], which rank among others of what is generally known as mental blindness, there is a blatant discontinuity between the possibilities of notional understanding and the actual performance of a purposive act or standard articulation of speech. The work and research that has been carried out on mental blindness tends to show that the ability to articulate both speech and purposive actions and gestures is nonetheless affected by the surrounding environment, and is not based upon mental impairment alone. On the contrary, it has become increasingly clear that such conditions do not take place solely as a result of mental functions; neither can they be enacted by the situational structure, as both contribute to the failure and success of treatment (p.&amp;nbsp;57).
	
Vesely brings the argument about these conditions back to the experiments regarding orientation, such as the inverted vision experiment and orientation under zero gravity conditions, and correlates it with the problems experienced with mental blindness. This is because of the fundamental knowledge of spatiality that is at stake that enables a possible representation to be actually effected. As regards spatiality, Vesely presupposes an existing continuity between the possible and the actual spatial configuration, as a mediated structure (p.&amp;nbsp;58). This understanding of representation seems to reverberate [[Husserl]]'s phenomenological treatment of representation, as moving from the horizon of vague, informal representation (''Vorstellung''), through a number of possibilities (''Vergegenwärtigungen''), until it finally reaches actuality (''Repräsentation''). The fact that [[Husserl]] only used the word ''Repräsentation'' to deal with explicit forms of representation, may serve us as an example of how a whole representational process was being kept in the background. Husserl's process of representation shows that our knowledge of spatiality intakes different levels of articulation, which are not always as clearly defined as we would wish. This means that the ground and point of departure of explicit references is not a point of departure towards a growing, cumulative knowledge of situation, but is rather a 'coming back' into a prereflective world of experience. In this sense, representation takes place as a spectrum ranging out of explicit forms of articulation into an implicit background, a concept that seems to be confirmed by later [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of perception. It seems obvious that, because of the nature of this prereflective ground, verbal or visual articulation of it cannot take place in an explicit sense. On the contrary, the phenomenological gaze at this background takes place indirectly (p.&amp;nbsp;69) as a preunderstanding of the world. If this is so, then not only our epistemological ground is constituted as an identity of interpretation of different levels of [[perception]], but also the concept of representation as such is constituted as a movement out of a prereflective background. This is precisely the background against which it becomes possible for an articulated structure to take place and be identified as such (pp.&amp;nbsp;75–77). This also means that the difference between different levels of articulation, namely between a preunderstanding background and a given object is precisely what allows us to see the object and situate it within our world of experience. If we accept Vesely's argument, then the difference that formerly stood as an epistemological barrier now becomes a necessary condition for representation to take place.

=== The latent world of architecture ===
Vesely addresses the preunderstanding of world as a ''latent world'' (p.&amp;nbsp;83), that is potentially articulated and structured, and whose relationship to its visible manifestation is not immediate. The reciprocity between this prearticulated level and its visible articulation dwells within the very ontological difference that has been discussed previously. Such reciprocity is a schematic constituent of phenomena of continuity and metaphoricity, that have been constantly described throughout the primary tradition of Christian humanism in the nature of [[being]] and [[becoming (philosophy)|becoming]]. Vesely thus enters the core of the question of representation in terms of its coming into the level of visibility. In the sequence of Vesely's argument, the subject of visibility becomes then, of itself, problematic in nature as it intakes a background of potential articulation.

According to Vesely, "the horizon of visibility displays a synthesis of the prereflective experience and of the achievements of reflection insofar as they preserve ontological continuity with the visible" (p.&amp;nbsp;85). On the other hand, the rise onto the explicit level of visibility primarily seems to express the problem of representation in terms of what is kept from the prereflective world. This could perhaps be seen as a consequence of the traditional concept of inner representation as relating to an external reality. Vesely challenges this concept of representation, and widens it as a spectrum that ranges from the explicitness of our world down to implicit levels of articulation. Consequently, the term reality is restricted mostly to certain types of representation (e.g. [[virtual reality]]) that view reality as something extrinsic (pp.&amp;nbsp;308–315).
	
Vesely's concept of representation, however, takes place in terms of a communication between a wide range of levels; whereby the question that concerns representation also concerns the [[truth]] of representation, a question that has been amply developed by modern [[hermeneutics]]. In this domain, the visible world conveys a kind of knowledge of the prereflective levels of articulation that also jeopardizes the epistemological status of the visible. As we have seen, contrary to empiricist belief, the visible world by itself does not constitute an epistemological ground (pp.&amp;nbsp;84–86). Instead, our epistemological ground is constituted by features such as orientation, [[physiognomy]], and the relative position of things with regard to one another; and it is from these features that a provisional ground comes to be constituted as regards spatiality. This ground is not a still point of reference. On the contrary, by ground is here meant a source and stream of references. This means that the explicit horizon of the visible, tangible world is the most explicit form of [[:wikt:embody|embodiment]] we have, but such a narrow horizon we can only take as a point of departure if we want to understand the rest of our world that is largely beyond visibility. This also means that the visible holds a very important part as a symbolic representation of our world, enabling us to see and imagine beyond the visible.

Finally, this means that we construe our knowledge of 'world' largely on the basis of invisible, implicit references which are only symbolically re-enacted by the visible realm. The level of visual representation may perhaps be compared to the level of more explicit verbal articulation as regards the implicit, preverbal domain of knowledge. Just as visual representation, verbal articulation has the power to emancipate from the given world, and the freedom to convey any meaning. This is a power bestowed upon representation, allowing it to withdraw from its original symbolic domain, thus establishing a tension between the instrumental nature of representation and its larger symbolic field.

'''Desertification''' is a type of [[land degradation]] in which a relatively [[drylands|dry]] area of land becomes increasingly arid, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife .&lt;ref name="Geist-2005-p2"&gt;Geist (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=acbWdynlU3cC&amp;pg=PA2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by a variety of factors, such as through [[climate change]] (particularly the current [[global warming]])&lt;ref name="Zeng L17401"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Ning|last2=Yoon|first2=Jinho|date=1 September 2009|title=Expansion of the world's deserts due to vegetation-albedo feedback under global warming|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=36|issue=17|page=L17401|doi=10.1029/2009GL039699|issn=1944-8007|bibcode=2009GeoRL..3617401Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through the [[overexploitation]] of soil through human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v0265e/v0265e01.htm|title=Sustainable development of drylands and combating desertification|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When deserts appear automatically over the natural course of a planet's life cycle, then it can be called a natural phenomenon; however, when deserts emerge due to the rampant and unchecked depletion of nutrients in soil that are essential for it to remain arable, then a virtual "soil death" can be spoken of,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102180358/http://ca.figu.org/the-desert-will-win.html|title=The Desert Will Win|website=FIGU-Landesgruppe Canada|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traces its cause back to human overexploitation.

==Definitions==
Considerable controversy exists over the proper definition of the term "desertification" for which Helmut Geist (2005) has identified more than 100 formal definitions. The most widely accepted&lt;ref name="Geist-2005-p2" /&gt; of these is that of the [[Princeton University]] Dictionary which defines it as "the process of fertile land transforming into desert typically as a result of [[deforestation]], drought or improper/inappropriate agriculture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.sg/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=define:desertification#hl=en&amp;q=desertification&amp;tbs=dfn:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HWuXT-GGL8_NrQeTvq26AQ&amp;ved=0CCwQkQ4&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=83aa6ed19b0ba29e&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=809|title=define:desertification – Google Search|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Desertification has been neatly defined in the text of the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD) as "land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unccd.int/en/about-the-convention/Pages/Text-Part-I.aspx|title=Part I|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major contribution to the controversy comes from the sub-grouping of types of desertification. Spanning from the very vague yet shortsighted view as the "man-made-desert" to the more broad yet less focused type as the "Non-pattern-Desert"&lt;ref&gt;Helmut J. Geist, and Eric F. Lambin. "Dynamic Causal Patterns of Desertifcation." BioScience 54.9 (2004): 817 . Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known discussion of the topic arose soon after the [[French colonization]] of [[West Africa]], when the Comité d'Etudes commissioned a study on ''desséchement progressif'' to explore the prehistoric expansion of the Sahara Desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mortimore, Michael|title=Adapting to drought: farmers, famines, and desertification in west Africa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-521-32312-3|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dx89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The world's most noted [[deserts]] have been formed by natural processes interacting over long intervals of time. During most of these times, deserts have grown and shrunk independent of human activities. Paleodeserts are large [[sand sea]]s now inactive because they are stabilized by vegetation, some extending beyond the present margins of core deserts, such as the [[Sahara]], the largest hot desert.&lt;ref name="Desertification"&gt;United States Geological Survey, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/desertification/ "Desertification"], 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Desertification has played a significant role in human history, contributing to the collapse of several large empires, such as Carthage, Greece, and the Roman Empire, as well as causing displacement of local populations.&lt;ref name="Geist-2005-p4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LOWDERMILK"&gt;{{cite web|last=LOWDERMILK|first=W C|title=CONQUEST OF THE LAND THROUGH SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1043789.pdf|work=Soil Conservation Service|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Whitford, Walter G.|title=Ecology of desert systems|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-12-747261-4|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZ4hZbXS8IcC&amp;pg=PA277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogumil Terminski (2011), Towards Recognition and Protection of Forced Environmental Migrants in the Public International Law: Refugee or IDPs Umbrella, Policy Studies Organization (PSO), Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geist|first=Helmut|title=The causes and progression of desertification|url=https://books.google.com/?id=acbWdynlU3cC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=desertification+and+its+effect+on+ancient+civilisations#v=onepage&amp;q=desertification%20and%20its%20effect%20on%20ancient%20civilisations&amp;f=false|work=Antony Rowe Ltd|publisher=Ashgate publishing limited|accessdate=6 July 2013|isbn=9780754643234|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical evidence shows that the serious and extensive land deterioration occurring several centuries ago in arid regions had three epicenters: the Mediterranean, the Mesopotamian Valley, and the [[Loess Plateau]] of China, where population was dense.&lt;ref name="LOWDERMILK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dregne|first=H.E.|title=Desertification of Arid Lands|url=http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-193/002-193.html|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1998, the then-current degree of southward expansion of the [[Sahara]] was not well known, due to a lack of recent, measurable expansion of the desert into the Sahel at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/~alesall/ouagaCILSS/articles/sen_bams1998.pdf | title=IRI – International Research Institute for Climate and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of global warming and human activities are presented in the Sahel. In this area, the level of desertification is very high compared to other areas in the world. All areas situated in the eastern part of Africa (i.e. in the Sahel region) are characterized by a dry climate, hot temperatures, and low rainfall (300–750&amp;nbsp;mm rainfall per year). So, droughts are the rule in the Sahel region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Desertification/desertification2.php|title=Defining Desertification : Feature Articles|last=Riebeek|first=Holli|date=2007-01-03|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that Africa has lost approximately 650,000&amp;nbsp;km² of its productive agricultural land over the past 50 years. The propagation of desertification in this area is considerable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savezvousque.fr/monde/progression-desert-sahara-augmente-annee.html|title=La progression du désert du Sahara augmente chaque année ?|website=Savezvousque.fr|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some statistics have shown that since 1900 the Sahara has expanded by 250&amp;nbsp;km to the south over a stretch of land from west to east 6,000&amp;nbsp;km long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hecke|first=Geoffrey Van|title=Humanum 3, le secret d'Épidaure: suivi de Amazone City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89u9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|year=2012|publisher=Mon Petit Éditeur|isbn=978-2-7483-9214-2|page=192|quote=D'après Monique Mainguet, depuis 1900, le Sahara a progressé vers le sud de 250 kilomètres et ce sur un front qui en fait plus de 6000 km.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christian Bouquet|title=Le Sahara entre ses deux rives.

The loss of topsoil means that plants cannot take root firmly and can be uprooted by torrential water or strong winds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2014/04/30/united-nations-convention-to-combat-desertification-issues-and-challenges/|title=United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification: Issues and Challenges|website=E-International Relations|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Convention (UNC) says that about six million Sahelian citizens would have to give up the desertified zones of sub-Saharan Africa for North Africa and Europe between 1997 and 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another major area that is being impacted by desertification is the [[Gobi Desert]]. Currently, the Gobi desert is the fastest moving desert on Earth; according to some researchers, the Gobi Desert swallows up over 1,300 square miles (3,370&amp;nbsp;km²) of land annually. This has destroyed many villages in its path. Currently, photos show that the Gobi Desert has expanded to the point the entire nation of Croatia could fit inside its area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/24/world/asia/living-in-chinas-expanding-deserts.html?_r=0 | title=Living in China's Expanding Deserts| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is causing a major problem for the people of China. They will soon have to deal with the desert as it creeps closer. Although the Gobi Desert itself is still a distance away from Beijing, reports from field studies state there are large sand dunes forming only 70&amp;nbsp;km (43.5&amp;nbsp;mi) outside the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geo.utexas.edu/courses/371c/project/2009/Welker_Desertification.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetation patterning==
As the desertification takes place, the landscape may progress through different stages and continuously transform in appearance. On gradually sloped terrain, desertification can create increasingly larger empty spaces over a large strip of land, a phenomenon known as "[[Tiger bush|Brousse tigrée]]". A mathematical model of this phenomenon proposed by C. Klausmeier attributes this patterning to dynamics in plant-water interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klausmeier|first=Christopher|title=Regular and irregular patterns in semiarid vegetation|journal=Science|year=1999|volume=284|issue=5421|pages=1826–1828|doi=10.1126/science.284.5421.1826}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One outcome of this observation suggests an optimal planting strategy for agriculture in arid environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15182754,00.html|title=Grid of straw squares turns Chinese sand to soil – Environment – DW.COM – 23.06.2011|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate cause is the loss of most vegetation. This is driven by a number of factors, alone or in combination, such as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation for fuel or construction materials. Vegetation plays a major role in determining the biological composition of the soil. Studies have shown that, in many environments, the rate of erosion and runoff decreases exponentially with increased vegetation cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Geeson, Nichola|title=Mediterranean desertification: a mosaic of processes and responses|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2002|isbn=978-0-470-84448-9|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_0qg0f49GQC&amp;pg=PA58|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unprotected, dry soil surfaces blow away with the wind or are washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile lower soil layers that bake in the sun and become an unproductive hardpan.

Many scientists think that one of the most common causes is [[overgrazing]], too much consumption of vegetation by cattle. Controversially, [[Allan Savory]] has claimed that the controlled movement of herds of livestock, mimicking herds of grazing wildlife, can reverse desertification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Allan Savory: How to green the world's deserts and reverse climate change|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Holistic resource management: a conceptual framework for ecologically sound economic modelling|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ISEE_economic_modeling_paper.pdf|work=Ecological Economics|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers|accessdate=10 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523200348/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ISEE_economic_modeling_paper.pdf|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butterfield|first=Jody|title=Holistic Management Handbook: Healthy Land, Healthy Profits, Second Edition|year=2006|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1559638852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Response to request for information on the "science" and "methodology" underpinning Holistic Management and holistic planned grazing|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Science-Methodology-Holistic-Mgt_Update_March.pdf|work=Savory Institute|accessdate=10 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523074713/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Science-Methodology-Holistic-Mgt_Update_March.pdf|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drury|first1=Steve|title=Large-animal extinction in Australia linked to human hunters|url=http://earth-pages.co.uk/2012/04/13/large-animal-extinction-in-australia-linked-to-human-hunters/|publisher=Earth-Pages|accessdate=9 June 2014|date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists agree, that there is a natural cause for the existence of desert in the place where is now the [[Sahara|Sahara desert]]: a natural climate cycle cause a lack of water in this area from time to time. There is a suggestion that the last time that the Sahara was converted from savanna to desert it was partially due to overgrazing by the cattle of the local population.&lt;ref name="Humans as Agents in the Termination of the African Humid Period"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=K.

One of the causes of desertification in the 20th-21st centuries is probably [[Global warming|climate change]]&lt;ref name="Zeng L17401"/&gt;

==Poverty==
At least 90% of the inhabitants of drylands live in [[Developing country|developing countries]], where they also suffer from poor economic and social conditions.&lt;ref name="holtz" /&gt; This situation is exacerbated by land degradation because of the reduction in productivity, the precariousness of living conditions and the difficulty of access to resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;
Dobie, Ph. 2001. “Poverty and the drylands”, in Global Drylands Imperative, Challenge paper, Undp, Nairobi (Kenya) 16 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

A downward spiral is created in many underdeveloped countries by [[overgrazing]], [[land exhaustion]] and [[overdrafting]] of groundwater in many of the marginally productive world regions due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures to exploit marginal drylands for farming. Decision-makers are understandably averse to invest in arid zones with low potential. This absence of investment contributes to the marginalisation of these zones. When unfavourable agro-climatic conditions are combined with an absence of infrastructure and access to markets, as well as poorly adapted production techniques and an underfed and undereducated population, most such zones are excluded from development.&lt;ref name="csf-desertification.org"&gt;[http://www.csf-desertification.org/index.php/bibliotheque/doc_details/119-cornet-antoine-2002-desertification-and-its-relationship-to-the-environment-and-development Cornet A., 2002.

Desertification often causes rural lands to become unable to support the same sized populations that previously lived there. This results in mass [[human migration|migrations]] out of rural areas and into urban areas, particularly in Africa. These migrations into the cities often cause large numbers of unemployed people, who end up living in [[slums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Pasternak, Dov &amp; Schlissel, Arnold|title=Combating desertification with plants|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-0-306-46632-8|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-i8-DPf6xgC&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Briassoulis, Helen|title=Policy integration for complex environmental problems: the example of Mediterranean desertification|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-4243-5|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpYnV45hVRsC&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture is a main source of income for many desert communities. The increase in desertification in theses regions has degraded the land enough where people can no longer productively farm and make a profit. This has negatively impacted the economy and increased poverty rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stringer|first=Lindsay C.|last2=Dyer|first2=Jen C.|last3=Reed|first3=Mark S.|last4=Dougill|first4=Andrew J.|last5=Twyman|first5=Chasca|last6=Mkwambisi|first6=David|title=Adaptations to climate change, drought and desertification: local insights to enhance policy in southern Africa|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy|volume=12|issue=7|pages=748–765|doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2009.04.002|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques and countermeasures exist for mitigating or reversing the effects of desertification, and some possess varying levels of difficulty. For some, there are numerous barriers to their implementation. Yet for others, the solution simply requires the exercise of human reason.

One less difficult solution that has been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofmankind.co.uk/Billy_Meier/Overpopulation_Crusade#Required_Worldwide_Measures|title=The Future Of Mankind – A Billy Meier Wiki – Overpopulation Crusade|website=www.futureofmankind.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; however controversial it may be, is to bring about a cap on the population growth, and in fact to turn this into a population decay, so that each year there will gradually exist fewer and fewer humans who require the land to be depleted even further in order to grow their food.

One proposed barrier is that the costs of adopting sustainable agricultural practices sometimes exceed the benefits for individual farmers, even while they are socially and environmentally beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drost|first1=Daniel|last2=Long|first2=Gilbert|last3=Wilson|first3=David|last4=Miller|first4=Bruce|last5=Campbell|first5=William|title=Barriers to Adopting Sustainable Agricultural Practices|issue=6|url=https://www.joe.org/joe/1996december/a1.php|journal=Journal of Extension|volume=34|date=1 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is a lack of political will, and lack of funding to support [[land reclamation]] and anti-desertification programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Briassoulis, Helen|title=Policy integration for complex environmental problems: the example of Mediterranean desertification|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-4243-5|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpYnV45hVRsC&amp;pg=PA237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desertification is recognized as a major threat to [[biodiversity]]. Some countries have developed [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to counter its effects, particularly in relation to the protection of endangered [[flora]] and [[fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;Techniques for Desert Reclamation by Andrew S. Goudie&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsafweb.org/TrusteeNews/desertdevelopmen.html Desert reclamation projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103172821/http://www.gsafweb.org/TrusteeNews/desertdevelopmen.html |date=2009-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reforestation]] gets at one of the root causes of desertification and is not just a treatment of the symptoms. Environmental organizations&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://edenprojects.org/ Eden Reforestation Projects website], [https://vimeo.com/edenprojects on Vimeo], on {{YouTube|id=edenreforest|title=''Eden Reforestation Projects''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; work in places where deforestation and desertification are contributing to extreme [[poverty]]. There they focus primarily on educating the local population about the dangers of deforestation and sometimes employ them to grow seedlings, which they transfer to severely deforested areas during the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;{{USGovernment|sourceURL=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/desertification/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] launched the FAO [http://www.fao.org/forestry/aridzone/restoration/en/ Drylands Restoration Initiative] in 2012 to draw together knowledge and experience on dryland restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drylands Restoration Initiative|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/aridzone/restoration/en/|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, FAO published global guidelines for the restoration of degraded forests and landscapes in drylands, in collaboration with the Turkish Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs and the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global guidelines for the restoration of degraded forests and landscapes in drylands|date=June 2015|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=978-92-5-108912-5|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5036e.pdf&lt;!-- |accessdate=June 2015 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Green Wall of China]]'' is a high-profile example of one method that has been finding success in this battle with desertification.{{According to whom|date=April 2018}}. This wall is a much larger-scale version of what American farmers did in the 1930s to stop the great Midwest dust bowl. This plan was proposed in the late 1970s, and has become a major ecological engineering project that is not predicted to end until the year 2055. According to Chinese reports, there have been nearly 66,000,000,000 trees planted in China's great green wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/china-great-green-wall-gobi-tengger-desertification/ | title=China's 'Great Green Wall' Fights Expanding Desert| date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the success that China has been finding in stopping the spread of desertification, plans are currently be made in Africa to start a "wall" along the borders of the Sahara desert as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Techniques focus on two aspects: provisioning of water, and fixation and hyper-fertilizing soil.

Fixating the soil is often done through the use of [[windbreak|shelter belts]], [[woodlot]]s and [[windbreak]]s. Windbreaks are made from trees and bushes and are used to reduce [[soil erosion]] and [[evapotranspiration]]. They were widely encouraged by development agencies from the middle of the 1980s in the [[Sahel]] area of [[Africa]].

Some soils (for example, clay), due to lack of water can become [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidated]] rather than porous (as in the case of sandy soils). Some techniques as zaï or [[tillage]] are then used to still allow the planting of crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/mann-text.html|title=Our Good Earth – National Geographic Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique that is useful is [[contour trenching]]. This involves the digging of 150&amp;nbsp;m long, 1&amp;nbsp;m deep trenches in the soil. The trenches are made parallel to the height lines of the landscape, preventing the water from flowing within the trenches and causing erosion. Stone walls are placed around the trenches to prevent the trenches from closing up again. The method was invented by Peter Westerveld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nagafoundation.org/|title=Home – Justdiggit|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enriching of the soil and restoration of its fertility is often done by plants. Of these, [[legume|leguminous plants]] which extract [[nitrogen]] from the air and fix it in the soil, and food crops/trees as [[grain]]s, [[barley]], [[beans]] and [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s are the most important. [[Sand fence]]s can also be used to control drifting of soil and sand erosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ List of plants to halt desertification; some of which may be soil-fixating] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201080944/http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ |date=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research centra (such as Bel-Air Research Center IRD/ISRA/UCAD) are also experimenting with the inoculation of tree species with [[mycorrhiza]] in arid zones. The mycorrhiza are basically fungi attaching themselves to the roots of the plants. They hereby create a symbiotic relation with the trees, increasing the surface area of the tree's roots greatly (allowing the tree to gather much more nutrients from the soil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://196.1.95.4/fst/biologie-vegetale/labo_commun.htm|title=Département Biologie Végétale – Laboratoire Commun de Microbiologie IRD-ISRA-UCAD|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there are many different types of deserts, there are also different types of desert reclamation methodologies. An example for this is the salt-flats in the  [[Rub' al Khali]] desert in  [[Saudi-Arabia]]. These salt-flats are one of the most promising desert areas for seawater agriculture and could be revitalized without the use of freshwater or much energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prototype-creation.de/rethinking_landscapes.pdf Rethinking landscapes, Nicol-André Berdellé July 2011] H2O magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Farmer-managed natural regeneration]] (FMNR) is another technique that has produced successful results for desert reclamation. Since 1980, this method to reforest degraded landscape has been applied with some success in Niger. This simple and low-cost method has enabled farmers to regenerate some 30,000 square kilometers in Niger. The process involves enabling native sprouting tree growth through selective pruning of shrub shoots. The residue from pruned trees can be used to provide mulching for fields thus increasing soil water retention and reducing evaporation. Additionally, properly spaced and pruned trees can increase crop yields. The Humbo Assisted Regeneration Project which uses FMNR techniques in Ethiopia has received money from The World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund, which supports projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forests or agricultural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/10/18/sprouting-trees-from-the-underground-forest-a-simple-way-to-fight-desertification-and-climate-change/ |title=Sprouting Trees From the Underground Forest — A Simple Way to Fight Desertification and Climate Change – Water Matters – State of the Planet |publisher=Blogs.ei.columbia.edu |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cow female black white.jpg|left|thumb|It is argued that managed grazing methods are able to restore grasslands.&lt;ref name=ASavory/&gt;]]

===Managed grazing===
Restoring grasslands store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air into plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth while grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds, preventing them from photosynthesizing and killing the plant.&lt;ref name=Tlovell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2011/01/lovell-carbon-ward-climate|title=How fences could save the planet|publisher=newstatesman.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day or two in order to mimic natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|title=Restoring soil carbon can reverse global warming, desertification and biodiversity|publisher=mongabay.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=February 21, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130625040133/http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|archivedate=June 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1953692,00.html|title=How eating grass-fed beef could help fight climate change|publisher=time.com|accessdate=May 11, 2013|date=January 25, 2010|first=Lisa|last=Abend}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the world’s 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland would offset nearly 12 years of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt; [[Allan Savory]], as part of [[holistic management]], claims that while large herds are often blamed for desertification, prehistoric lands used to support large or larger herds and areas where herds were removed in the United States are still desertifying;&lt;ref name=ASavory&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/06/how-cows-could-repair-the-world-allan-savory-at-ted/|title=How cows could repair the world|publisher=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[range science|range scientists]] have however not been able to experimentally confirm his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Briske|first=D.

The '''Dextroscope''' is a [[Virtual Reality]] (VR) environment designed to provide medical professionals with deeper understanding of a patient's complex 3D anatomical relationships and pathology. Although its main intended purpose is to enable surgeons to plan a surgical procedure (in particular, neurosurgery&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;), it has also proven useful in research in cardiology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jcmr-online.com/content/12/S1/O14|title = MRI and CT Tracking of Mesenchymal Stem Cells with Novel Perfluorinated Alginate Microcapsules|last = Fu|first = Yingli|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance|doi = 10.1186/1532-429X-12-S1-O14|pmid = |access-date =|volume=12|pages=O14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of immersing the whole user into a virtual reality, it just immersed the hands of the neurosurgeon into the patient data. The Dextroscope started as a research project in the mid-90s with the name The Virtual Workbench&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  and started commercialization in 2000 with the incorporation of the company [[Volume Interactions Pte Ltd]]. 

The Dextroscope allows its user to interact intuitively with a [[Virtual Patient]]. The Virtual Patient is composed of computer-generated 3D multi-modal images obtained from any [[DICOM]] tomographic data including [[Computer to|CT]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MRA]], [[Magnetic resonance venography|MRV]], functional MRI and [[Computer Tomography angiography|CTA]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography|SPECT]] and [[Tractography]]. It can work with any multi-modality combination, supporting polygonal meshes as well.

The user sits at the Dextroscope 3D interaction console and manipulates the Virtual Patient using both hands in a similar manner to how one would manipulate a real object. Using stereoscopic visualisations displayed via a mirror, the Dextroscope user sees the Virtual Patient floating behind the mirror but within easy reach of the hands and uses flexible 3D hand movements to rotate and manipulate the object of interest. The Dextroscope allows virtual segmentation of organs and structures, making accurate 3D measurements, etc.
[[File:Dextroscope MK10.jpg|thumb|The Dextroscope.]]
In one hand the user holds an ergonomically shaped handle with a switch that, when pressed, allows the 3D image to be moved freely as if it were an object held in real space. The other hand holds a pencil shaped stylus that is used to select tools from a virtual control panel and perform detailed manipulations and operations on the 3D image. The user does not see the stylus, handle or his/her hands directly, as they are hidden behind the surface of the mirror. Instead he/she sees a virtual handle and stylus calibrated to appear in exactly the same position as the real handle and stylus. The business end of the virtual handle can be selected to be anything that the software can create - drill tool, measurement tool, cutter, etc. Experience has shown that it is unnecessary to model the user's hands, provided that he/she can see and feel the real tools and that these perceptions match the virtual scene. This is highly advantageous since the hands would otherwise clutter the workspace and obscure the view of the object of interest.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Poston, T., Serra, L., 1996. ''Dextrous Virtual Work. Commun. ACM'' 39, 37–45. doi:10.1145/229459.229464
&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the uses of the Dextroscope is to allow surgeons to interact with and manipulate the Virtual Patient and plan the ideal surgical trajectory - for example, by simulating inter-operative viewpoints or the removal of bone and soft tissue. Apart from being much faster to work this way than using a mouse and keyboard, this approach also provides the medical professional, typically a surgeon, with a greater degree of control over the 3D image - with the hands literally being able to reach inside to manipulate the image interior.

== Manipulating the Virtual Patient – Virtual Reality Toolsets ==

The Dextroscope provides an extensive set of virtual tools that can be used to manipulate the 3D image. For example, there are dedicated tools to perform data segmentation to extract surgically relevant structures like the cortex or a tumor
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chia | first1 = W.K. | last2 = Serra | first2 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Contouring in 2D while viewing stereoscopic 3D volumes | url = | journal = Stud Health Technol Inform | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 93–95 | pmid = 16404022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extract blood vessels,&lt;ref&gt;Serra, L., Hern, N., Choon, C.B., Poston, T., 1997. Interactive vessel tracing in volume data, in: Proceedings of the 1997 Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics, I3D ’97. ACM, New York, NY, USA, p. 131–ff. {{DOI|10.1145/253284.253320}}&lt;/ref&gt; adjust the color and transparency of displayed structures to see deep inside the patient and even simulate some surgical procedures – such as the removal of bone using a simulated skull drilling tool.

Typical structures that can be segmented are tumors, blood vessels, aneurysms, parts of the skull base, and organs. Segmentation is done either automatically (when the structures are demarcated clearly by their outstanding image intensity - such as the cortex) or through user interaction (using for example an outlining tool to define the extent of the structure manually). A virtual ‘pick’ tool allows the user to pick a segmented object and uncouple it from its surroundings for closer inspection. A measurement tool provides accurate measurement of straight and curving 3D structures such as the scalp, and measure angles, such as those between vessels or bony structures (for example, when planning the insertion of a screw into the spine).

== Dextroscope and Diagnostic Imaging ==

Dextroscope is not just for surgeons - radiologists can benefit from it too. The rapid growth in multi-modal diagnostic imaging data routinely available has increased their workload tremendously. Using the Dextroscope, radiologists can reconstruct multimodal models from high volumes of 2D slices – hence facilitating a better understanding of the 3D anatomical structures and helping with the diagnosis.

Furthermore, the Dextroscope virtual reality environment helps bridge the gap between radiology and surgery - by allowing the radiologist to easily demonstrate to surgeons important 3D structures in a way that surgeons are familiar with.&lt;br /&gt; This demonstration capability makes it also useful as a base for medical educators in which to convey 3D information to students.&lt;ref&gt;Haase, J., 2010.

(Eds.), Neurosurgery, European Manual of Medicine. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 17–23.

'''Dry sex''' is the sexual practice of having [[sexual intercourse]] without [[vaginal lubrication]]. Vaginal lubrication can be removed by using herbal aphrodisiacs, household detergents, antiseptics,&lt;ref name="cirp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/baleta1/ |title=Concern voiced over "dry sex" practices in South Africa |publisher=Cirp.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; by wiping out the vagina,&lt;ref name="popline.org"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 8562002|year= 1995|author1= Sandala|first1= L|title= 'Dry sex' and HIV infection among women attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Lusaka, Zambia|journal= AIDS|volume= 9 Suppl 1|pages= S61–8|last2= Lurie|first2= P|last3= Sunkutu|first3= M.

Removing or preventing vaginal lubrication through practices associated with dry sex increases friction during intercourse, which may be perceived as increased vaginal tightness, and enhanced sexual pleasure for the male partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Local Voices: What Some Harare Men Say about Preparation for Sex |first1=Sunanda|last1=Ray|date=May 1996|first2=Nyasha |last2=Gumbo|first3=Michael|last3=Mbizvo  |jstor=3775349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men who insist on dry sex regard "wet" women to be [[chaste|unchaste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(96)90004-X |author1=Sunanda Ray |author2=Nyasha Gumbo |author3=Michael Mbizvo |title=Local Voices: What Some Harare Men Say about Preparation for Sex |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=34–45 |date=May 1996 |jstor=3775349 |publisher=Reproductive Health Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry sex can be painful for men&lt;ref&gt;January 2001 edition of "Parade": [https://books.google.com/books?id=vigxAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22dry+sex+is+painful+for+both+men+and+women%22 Page 45]: "Dry sex is painful for both men and women and may expose one to infection."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Women in Action" published 2001 by Isis International

==Health risks==
The practice has been linked to the high incidence of [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV/AIDS infection in Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="cirp.org" /&gt; The practice is regarded as increasing the risk of transmitting [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs) for both partners, including HIV&lt;ref name="cirp.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFPP /&gt; in a number of ways. Increased friction during intercourse may cause lacerations in vaginal tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hyena, Hank |title="Dry sex" worsens AIDS numbers in southern Africa |url=http://www.salon.com/health/sex/urge/world/1999/12/10/drysex/ |publisher=Salon.com |date=1999-12-10 |accessdate=2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drying the vagina also removes the natural antiseptic [[lactobacilli]] which can combat sexually transmitted diseases.  Furthermore, dry sex increases the risk that a [[condom]] will break because of the increased friction. It may also result in vaginal inflammation and/or traumatic lesions which in turn may increase the transmission of STDs in other ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6738">'''Edith Balas''' is a Professor of Art History, College of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Born June 20, 1929 in [[Cluj]], [[Romania]], she is a [[Holocaust survivor]], art professor, and [[historian]]. She is married to mathematician [[Egon Balas]], also a retired professor at Carnegie Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holocaustcenterpgh.org/exhibitions/in-celebration-of-life-living-legacy-project/edith-balas/|title=Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh » Edith Balas|website=holocaustcenterpgh.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balas' main areas of interest are [[modern art]] (1890-1960), painting and sculpture, and the art of the Italian Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Beck review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=James|title=Review: Michelangelo's Medici Chapel: A New Interpretation.

She has been teaching at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] since 1977, and is also an Adjunct Professor of History of Art and Architecture at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

Edith Balas is also a Holocaust survivor, having been sent to the Nazi death camp [[Auschwitz]].  In ''Bird in Flight: Memoir of a Survivor and Scholar,''  Balas tells her story of facing grim situations and becoming what she describes as a “professional survivor.”  Balas named her memoir “Bird in Flight” after [[Constantin Brâncuși]]’s famous sculpture of the same name. “I consider it emblematic of my life,” she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2011/March/march22_edithbalasmemoir.shtml|title=March 22: CMU's Edith Balas Pens Memoir Depicting Life as a Survivor and Scholar - Carnegie Mellon University - CMU|first=Carnegie Mellon University|last=(CMU)|website=www.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war her husband was imprisoned by the [[Communist Romania|communist authorities]] for three years, during which Balas raised their two daughters. She received an M.A. in Philosophy from the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmu.edu/cas/people/balas_edith.html|title=Edith Balas - Center for the Arts in Society - Carnegie Mellon University|first=Carnegie Mellon|last=University|website=www.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then emigrated to the United States with her husband, and received an M.A. in the History of Arts from Pittsburgh University in 1970 and a Ph.D. in 1973.

'''Elegant glass''' is high quality glassware created in the United States during the [[Depression Era]]. It was sold for high prices in department stores and given as wedding gifts.&lt;ref name="dep-v-eleg"&gt;"Elegant Glass is Not Depression Glass | Just Glass Online." Designer Glassware, Vintage Art Glass, Depression Glass &amp; Collectible Glass | Just Glass Online. Stephen Thornton Internet Consulting Services. Web. 8 January 2010. &lt;http://www.justglass-online.com/collectibles/elegant-glass-is-not-depression-glass.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; When new, Elegant glass would cost more than its oft-confused counterpart, [[Depression glass]], because it was at least partially handmade, had a cleaner finish, and more vibrant colors. From the 1920s through the 1950s, Elegant glass was an alternative to [[Porcelain|fine china]]. Most of the Elegant glassware manufacturers closed by the end of the 1950s, and cheap glassware and imported china took its place.

==Manufacturing process==
Elegant glass was at least partially hand made during production.&lt;ref&gt;"Depression Glass, Elegant Glass and Depression Glass Manufacturers | Just Glass Online." Designer Glassware, Vintage Art Glass, Depression Glass &amp; Collectible Glass | Just Glass Online. Stephen Thornton Internet Consulting Services. Web. 7 January 2010. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justglass-online.com/depression-glass/depression-glass-elegant-glass-and-depression-glass-manufacturers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231093700/http://www.justglass-online.com/depression-glass/depression-glass-elegant-glass-and-depression-glass-manufacturers.html |archivedate=31 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Elegant glass manufacturers produced vibrant colors that varied far more than Depression Glass.&lt;ref name="dep-v-eleg"/&gt;  Shades of red, blue, green, amber, yellow, smoke, amethyst, and pink were produced.  An easy way to compare the difference in color quality is to take a look at a piece of cobalt Elegant glass and place it alongside a piece of cobalt Depression Glass.  The intensity of the former piece is quite evident. Pressed Elegant glass was fire polished to get rid of the flaws in the glass. The normal flaws found in pressed glass – straw marks, raised seams, etc. were removed. The base of bowls, platters, etc. was ground so it would sit evenly on a table. Many patterns of Elegant glass were embellished with acid etching, cutting, enamel decoration, gold encrustation, platinum and gold trim.&lt;ref name="dep-v-eleg"/&gt;

==Sale and marketing==
Elegant glass was sold in the finer stores (never given away). It was also marketed as wedding patterns. It was offered as an alternative to china and crystal which were still imported due to manufacturing costs and were incredibly expensive. Many consumers purchased Elegant glass and placed it on display, only using it for very special occasions.&lt;ref name="dep-v-eleg"/&gt;

==Products==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6138">'''Elegiac comedy''' was a [[genre]] of [[medieval Latin]] [[Latin literature|literature]]—or [[Medieval theatre|drama]]—which survives as a collection of about twenty texts written in the 12th and 13th centuries in the liberal arts schools of west central France (roughly the [[Loire Valley]]). Though commonly identified in [[manuscript]]s as ''comoedia'', modern scholars often reject their status as [[comedy]]. Unlike [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] comedy, they were written in [[elegiac couplet]]s. Denying their true comedic nature, [[Edmond Faral]] called them '''Latin ''fabliaux''''', after the later [[Old French]] ''[[fabliaux]]'', and [[Ian Thomson (antiquary)|Ian Thomson]] labelled them '''Latin comic tales'''. Other scholars have invented terms like '''verse tales''', '''rhymed monologues''', '''epic comedies''', and '''Horatian comedies''' to describe them.&lt;ref&gt;Roy (1974), 258 n. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin "comedies", the dramatic nature of which varies greatly, may have been the direct ancestors of the ''fabliaux'' but more likely merely share similarities. Other interpretations have concluded that they are primitive [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], student [[juvenilia]], didactic poems, or merely collections of elegies on related themes.

Some elegiac comedies were adapted into [[vernacular]] language in the later Middle Ages, and retold by major vernacular writers such as [[Boccaccio]], [[Chaucer]], and [[John Gower|Gower]]. The poem ''Pamphilus'' has [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Old French]] versions.

==Style==
These comedies were composed in a high style, but they were typically about low or unimportant subject matter; [[Lyric poetry|lyric complaints]] only sometimes mixed with amorous content. They combined the plot and character types of the [[New comedy|Greek "new comedy"]] practised by [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]], but the greatest influence on them was [[Ovid]]. His ''[[Ars amatoria]]'', ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'', and ''[[Heroides]]'' were highly influential. [[Plautus]], though less widely read in the Middle Ages, was also an influence, as were the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] debates concerning the nature of [[universals]] and other contemporary philosophical problems, with which the elegiac comedies often dealt, always humorously but no doubt sometimes to a serious end.

The elegiac dramatists delight in "showing off" their Latin skills. Their use of rhetoric, logic, and various grammatical constructions suggest that they may have been used in the schools as exercises in poetic composition and philosophical argument. The language of their "fools" can be deliberately outlandish, and their deft use of puns is frequently sexual in nature. [[Parody]] is another typical element of elegiac humour. Persons of low rank are often placed in positions unsuited to them. Their bumbling, as when a rustic attempts to speak philosophically or the commoner pretends he is a chivalrous gentleman, is portrayed for its [[Satire|satiric]] effect. Satire is often employed in long digressions criticizing the corruption of the times, specifically targeting the selling of church offices, political corruption at court, sycophants’ attempts to rise in society, and aristocrats’ attempts to philosophize. In the Middle Ages, satire was usually considered a breed of comedy.

==Dramatic features==
The comedies were often about a sexual conquest, in which the lover must use his guile to overcome obstacles such as guardians, rivals, and reluctance on the part of the woman. The setting is some unspecified time contemporary with the poet, and the characters are all typical and have names descriptive of their traits and function in the story. The lack of resources on the part of the hero forces him to resort to deception and to employ intermediaries (as Ovid did in his narratives) in order to win the object of his desire.

The elegiac comedies bear limited dramatic features. Thompson denies their theatricality, saying that "no ancient drama would ever have been written in elegiacs." A similar opinion is that the comedies are [[rhetoric]]al exercises. Medieval poetic theory, however, did not regard comedy and elegy as mutually exclusive, nor identical. [[John of Garland]] wrote "all comedy is elegy, but the reverse is not true." Other arguments raised against the dramatic performance of the comedies is, in general, their large number of narrative segments as opposed to dialogue. [[Arnulf of Orléans (commentator)|Arnulf of Orléans]], one of the elegiac writers, seems to have considered his work to have been made for the stage. These performances may have been narrated, mimed, or sung.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10079">'''Ethics in mathematics''' is a field of [[applied ethics]], the inquiry into ethical aspects of the applications of [[mathematics]]. It deals with the professional responsibilities of [[mathematicians]] whose work influences decisions with major consequences, such as in law, finance, the military, and environmental science.

==Need for ethics in the mathematics profession==
Mathematicians in industrial, scientific, military and intelligence roles crucially influence decisions with large consequences. For example, complex calculations were needed for the success of the [[Manhattan Project]], while the overextended use of the [[Copula (probability theory)|Gaussian copula]] formula to price derivatives before the [[Global Financial Crisis]] of 2008 has been called "the formula that killed Wall Street",&lt;ref&gt;Felix Salmon, [https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wp-quant/ Recipe for disaster: the formula that killed Wall Street"], ''Wired''23 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory of global warming depends on the reliability of [[climate models|mathematical models of climate]]. For the same reason as in [[medical ethics]] and [[engineering ethics]], the high impact of the consequences of decisions imposes serious ethical obligations on practitioners to consider the rights and wrongs of their advice and decisions.

==Disasters and scandals involving the use of mathematics==
These illustrate the major consequences of numerical mistakes and hence the need for ethical care.
* The [[Club of Rome]]'s 1972 mathematical-model based predictions in ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' of widespread collapse of the world system by the end of the century.
* [[Sally Clark|Wrongful conviction of Sally Clark]] (1999), An English solicitor, Sally Clark, was wrongfully convicted of murdering her two children – each of whom had died due to [[sudden infant death syndrome]] – due to a fundamental statistical error in the testimony of an "expert".&lt;br&gt;The error was further compounded by the "[[prosecutor's fallacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1432762/Misleading-statistics-were-presented-as-facts-in-Sally-Clark-trial.html Derbyshire, D., "Misleading statistics were presented as facts in Sally Clark trial", ''The Telegraph'', (12 June 2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical issues in the mathematical profession==
Mathematicians in professional roles in finance and similar work have a particular responsibility to ensure they use the best methods and data to reach the right answer, as the prestige of mathematics is high and others rely on mathematical results which they cannot fully understand. Other ethical issues are shared with [[information economy]] professionals in general, such as [[duty of care]], [[confidentiality]] of information, [[whistleblowing]], and avoiding [[conflict of interest]].

==Misuse of statistics==
{{Main|Misuse of statistics}}
Much of mathematics as used in applications involves the drawing of conclusions from quantitative data. It is recognised that there are many difficulties in reaching and communicating such conclusions accurately, honestly and with due regard to the uncertainties that remain. It is easy for a statistician to mislead clients whose understanding of data and inference is less developed, so statisticians have professional responsibilities to act fairly.

==Ethics in pure mathematical research==
The [[American Mathematical Society]] publishes a code of ethical guidelines for mathematical researchers. The responsibilities of researchers include being knowledgeable in the field, avoiding plagiarism and giving credit, to publish without unreasonable delay, and to correct errors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/policy-statements/sec-ethics American Mathematical Society Policy Statement on Ethical Guidelines], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Mathematical Society]] Ethics Committee also publishes a code of practice relating to the publication, editing and refereeing of research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euro-math-soc.eu/system/files/uploads/COP-approved.pdf Code of Practice – European Mathematical Society].&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that as pure mathematical research is relatively harmless, it raises few urgent ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Reuben Hersh]], [http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1068&amp;context=hmnj Mathematics and ethics], ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'' 12 (3) (1990), 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that raises the question of whether and why pure mathematics is ethically worth doing, given that it consumes the lives of many highly intelligent people who could be making more immediately useful contributions.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]], [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF03024064 Ethics of mathematics], ''Mathematical Intelligencer'' 13 (1) (1991), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching ethics in mathematics==
Courses in the ethics of mathematics remain rare. The [[University of New South Wales]] taught a compulsory course on Professional Issues and Ethics in Mathematics in its mathematics degrees from 1998 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, [http://www.austms.org.au/Publ/Gazette/2005/May05/franklin.pdf A “Professional issues and ethics in mathematics” course], ''Gazette of the Australian Mathematical Society'' 32 (2005), 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1892, José Francisco da Rocha Pombo, an intellectual of the state of Paraná would have initiated the construction of the University, but his project was frustrated by the Federalist Movement.

Twenty years later, Paraná had a reduced number of intellectuals (nine doctors and four engineers), but it was in true development because of the production of the [[yerba mate]].

Moreover, at this time, the [[Contestado War]] appeared as an incentive to the efforts of political leaderships concerning the creation of a university. In this context, [[Victor Ferreira do Amaral]], deputy and director of public instruction of Paraná, started the effective creation of the University.

On December 19, 1912 the University was established and, in 1913, it has initiated its activities as a private institution in an old building situated on Comendador Araújo street. The first courses offered were [[Law|Juridical and Social Sciences]], Engineering, [[Medicine|Medicine and Surgery]], Commerce, [[Dentistry]], [[Pharmacy|Pharmacy and Obstetrics]]. After the establishment of the University, Victor Ferreira do Amaral, who was also its first president, initiated the construction of a central building in a land donated by the municipal government.

Due to the economic recession caused by the World War I, difficulties started to appear. In 1920, a federal law determined the closing of all universities. In a contradictory measure, the federal government created the ''Universidade do Rio de Janeiro'', currently ''[[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro]]'' (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). The alternative to this law was to split the UFPR in several colleges.

Throughout several years, efforts in order to restore the university took place. Only in the beginning of the fifties the colleges were reunited once again in the University of Paraná, its federalization happening just after that, in 1951, when the university became a public and free-of-charge institution.

After its federalization, a process of expansion began with the construction of the Clinic's Hospital ('''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:''' ''Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal do Paraná'') in 1953, the ''Reitoria'' Campus in 1958 and the Polytechnic Center in 1961. The Polytechnic Center campus occupies {{convert|617,128|m2|ft2}}.&lt;ref name="t"/&gt;

==Historical Building==
[[Image:Universidade Federal do Parana 4 Curitiba Parana.jpg|200px|right|thumb|UFPR – ''Historic building at Santos Andrade Square, in Curitiba'']]
The construction placed in the Santos Andrade Square began to be built in 1913, being a project of the military engineer Baeta de Faria. Its inauguration occurred in 1915.

Seven years later, in 1923, two lateral parts were added, according to the original project. The building of the right sector was ended in 1925 and was designated to the Engineering graduation course. In the following year, the left sector had been finalized and it passed to serve the Dentistry course. Other additions were made to the right side of the building and it has received in its totality new paint in 1940. The building was extended towards XV de Novembro Street and, in 1952, new works in the right section led to the demolition of part of the lateral façade built in 1940.

In 1954, the building occupied a whole block between the Santos Andrade Square, XV de Novembro Street, Presidente Faria Street and Alfredo Bufren Lane. The last modifications were made: a new façade with several columns and a wide set of staircases were projected and the covered dome was eliminated. The inauguration of the neoclassical, 17,000 square meter building, took place in 1955.

In the year on 1999, the mayor of Curitiba signed a law that made this building the official symbol of the city.

===Technical High School===

Besides the above-mentioned courses, it offers high school education through its Technical High School. [http://www.et.ufpr.br/]

==Admissions==

Students are admitted by an entrance exam, known as the [[vestibular]], which consists of two parts:

*'''Part I''' is composed of 80 multiple-choice questions including nine questions of each of the following subjects: Portuguese, Literature, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, History and Biology, plus eight questions of a foreign language which can be chosen from English, French, Spanish, German or Italian.

Over 50,000 people apply every year and sit for exactly the same exam. After two weeks time or so, 15,000 are called to take the Part II (or Phase II) written exams.

*'''Part II''' is composed of a Portuguese test which covers five (previously seven) compulsory writing essays. Certain courses require that the candidate take an additional one or two exams involving open-questions in Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, History, Biology, Philosophy or [[Sociology]], the specific exam choice being determined by correlation between the subject and each major course. Engineering candidates, for example, take Mathematics and Physics tests.

The wait for the results of Part II is much longer and the results may take something between 4 and 7 weeks. A list with all the admitted candidates comes out usually in the middle of January—on the same day as the ''Mud-bath Party'' sponsored by the Central Directory of Students ('''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:''' Diretório Central dos Estudantes, DCE) occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3026">[[Image:Chenal-beautemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in [[Velm]], Belgium, during a sunny day]]
A '''grassed waterway''' consists in a {{convert|2|m|ft|sing=on}} to 48-metre-wide (157 ft) native [[grassland]] strip of [[green belt]]. It is generally installed in the [[thalweg]], the deepest continuous line along a [[valley]] or [[watercourse]], of a cultivated dry valley in order to control [[erosion]]. A study carried out on a grassed waterway during 8 years in [[Bavaria]] showed that it can lead to several other types of positive impacts, e.g. on [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiener P., Auerswald K. (2003). Concept and effects of a multi-purpose grassed waterway. Soil Use and Management 19, 65-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==

Confusion between "grassed waterway" and "vegetative filter strips" should be avoided. The latter are generally narrower (only a few metres wide) and rather installed along rivers as well as along or within cultivated fields. However, [[buffer strip]] can be a [[synonym]], with shrubs and trees added to the plant component, as does a [[riparian zone]].

== Runoff and erosion mitigation ==
[[Image:Chenal-mauvaistemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in Velm, Belgium, after a thunderstorm]]
[[Surface runoff|Runoff]] generated on cropland during storms or long winter rains concentrates in the [[thalweg]] where it can lead to rill or [[gully]] erosion.   

Rills and gullies further concentrate runoff and speed up its transfer, which can worsen damage occurring downstream. This can result in a [[muddy flood]]. 

In this context, a grassed waterway allows increasing soil cohesion and roughness. It also prevents the formation of rills and gullies. Furthermore, it can slow down runoff and allow its re-infiltration during long winter rains. In contrast, its infiltration capacity is generally not sufficient to reinfiltrate runoff produced by heavy spring and summer storms. It can therefore be useful to combine it with extra measures, like the installation of earthen dams across the grassed waterway, in order to buffer runoff temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;Evrard, O., Vandaele, K., van Wesemael, B., Bielders, C.L, 2008. A grassed waterway and earthen dams to control muddy floods from a cultivated catchment of the Belgian loess belt. Geomorphology  100, 419-428.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jaan! in Hakui.jpg|thumb|An example of Japanese sound symbolism, "''jaan!''"]]
'''Ideophones''' are words that evoke an idea in sound, often a vivid impression of certain sensations or sensory perceptions, e.g. sound ([[onomatopoeia]]), movement, color, shape, or action. Ideophones are found in many of the world's [[language]]s, though they are claimed to be relatively uncommon in Western languages.&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In many languages, they are a major lexical class of the same order of magnitude as nouns and verbs:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; dictionaries of languages like Japanese, Korean, and Zulu list thousands of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lib.kobe-u.ac.jp/handle_gakui/D1004724|title=A Grammar of Sound-Symbolic Words in Japanese: Theoretical Approaches to Iconic and Lexical Properties of Japanese Mimetics|last=Akita|first=Kimi|publisher=Kobe University|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word class of ideophones is sometimes called ''phonosemantic'' to indicate that it is not a grammatical word class in the traditional sense of the word (like '[[verb]]' or '[[noun]]'), but rather a lexical class based on the special relation between form and meaning exhibited by ideophones. In the discipline of [[linguistics]], ideophones have long been overlooked or treated as mysterious words,&lt;ref&gt;Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:2&lt;/ref&gt; though a recent surge of interest in [[sound symbolism]], [[iconicity]] and linguistic diversity has brought them renewed attention.&lt;ref&gt;Imai &amp; Kita 2014, Dingemanse et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

An often-cited definition of the notion of ideophone is the following by [[Clement Martyn Doke]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Doke 1935 as cited in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A vivid representation of an idea in sound. A word, often onomatopoeic, which describes a predicate, qualificative or adverb in respect to manner, color, sound, smell, action, state or intensity.}}

Ideophones evoke sensory events. A well known instance of ideophones are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words – words that imitate the sound (of the event) they refer to. Some ideophones may be derived from onomatopoeic notions. A case in point is the English ideophonic verb ''to tinkle'', which imitates a brief metallic sound. In many languages, however, ideophones go far beyond onomatopoeia in imitating many things beyond sound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, in [[Gbaya languages|Gbaya]],  ''kpuk '''a rap on the door' may be onomatopoeic, but other ideophones depict motion and visual scenes: ''loɓoto-loɓoto'' 'large animals plodding through mud', ''kiláŋ-kiláŋ'' 'in a zigzagging motion', ''pɛɗɛŋ-pɛɗɛŋ'' 'razor sharp'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ideophones are often characterized as [[Iconicity|iconic]] or [[Sound symbolism|sound-symbolic]] words, meaning that there can be a resemblance between their form and their meaning. For instance, in West-African languages, voiced consonants and low tone in ideophones are often connected to large and heavy meanings, whereas voiceless consonants and high tones tend to relate to small and light things.&lt;ref&gt;Westermann 1927&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reduplication]] figures quite prominently in ideophones, often conveying a sense of repetition or plurality present in the evoked event.&lt;ref&gt;Watson in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The iconicity of ideophones is shown by the fact that people can guess the meanings of ideophones from various languages at a level above chance.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasaki et al. 2007, Dingemanse et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everything about the form of ideophones directly relates to their meaning; as conventionalized words, they contain arbitrary, language-specific phonemes just like other parts of the vocabulary.

===Grammar===
The grammatical function of ideophones varies by language. In some languages (e.g. [[Welayta language|Welayta]], [[Yir-Yoront language|Yir-Yiront]], [[Semai language|Semai]], [[Korean language|Korean]]), they form a separate word class, while in others, they occur across a number of different word classes (e.g. [[Mundang]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]]).&lt;ref&gt;Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this diversity, ideophones show a number of robust regularities across languages. One is that they are often marked in the same way as quoted speech and demonstrations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samarin|first=William J.|year=1971|title=Survey of Bantu ideophones|url=|journal=African Language Studies|volume=12|pages=130–168|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes ideophones can form a complete utterance on their own, as in English "ta-da!" or Japanese {{Nihongo||ジャーン|jaan|ta-da}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Diffloth 1972&lt;/ref&gt; However, ideophones also often occur within utterances, depicting a scene described by other elements of the utterance, as in Japanese ''Taro wa &lt;u&gt;sutasuta to&lt;/u&gt; haya-aruki o si-ta'' 'Taro walked hurriedly' (literally 'Taro did haste-walk ''sutasuta''&lt;nowiki/&gt;').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kita|first=Sotaro|year=1997|title=Two-dimensional semantic analysis of Japanese mimetics|url=|journal=Linguistics|volume=35|pages=379–415|via=|doi=10.1515/ling.1997.35.2.379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether they occur as part of other utterances or on their own, ideophones tend show a high degree of grammatical independence. They often occur at the edge of the utterance; they may be syntactically optional; and they tend to carry little inflectional or derivational morphology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other signs of their relative independence are that they are often produced with higher intonation and expressive lengthening, and set off from the rest of the utterance by a brief pause.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kunene in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their relative independence, ideophones are sometimes compared to [[interjection]]s: direct expressions of emotions like "Wow!" or "Ouch!". However, they are distinct in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ameka|first=Felix K.|year=1992|title=Interjections: the universal yet neglected part of speech|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=18|pages=101–118|via=|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(92)90048-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas interjections usually occur on their own, ideophones more often modify other utterances, providing an illustration of a scene the utterance is about. Also, ideophones are more like illustrations ''of'' events than responses ''to'' events. An ideophone like Gbaya ''kiláŋ-kiláŋ'' 'in a zigzagging motion' displays a certain resemblance to the event (for instance, its irregular vowels and tones depicting the irregularity of the motion). An interjection like 'Wow!' indexes someone's response to an event but does not resemble that event itself.

===Registers===
Languages may differ in the context in which ideophones are used. In some languages, ideophones are primarily used in spoken language (e.g. [[narrative]] contexts) and are rarely encountered in written language.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Noss in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages (e.g. [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), ideophones can be freely used in all [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]]. In general, however, ideophones tend to occur more extensively in spoken language because of their expressive or dramaturgic function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Examples==

===[[English language|English]]===

* ''boing''; the sound of a spring being released
* ''boom''; the sound of an explosion
* ''bang''; the sound of a gunshot
* ''[[bling-bling]]''; glitter, sparkle
* ''pitter-patter''; the sound of rain drops
* ''swish''; the sound of swift movement
* ''splish-splash''; the sound of water splashing
* ''ta-daa!''; the sound of a [[fanfare]]
* ''thud''; the sound of something heavy falling on the ground
* ''tick-tock''; the sound of time passing
* ''twinkle''; the glow of something sparkling or shiny

===[[Japanese language|Japanese]]===
{{main article|Japanese sound symbolism}}
The Japanese language has thousands of ideophones, often called ''mimetics''. The constructions are quite metrical 2-2, or 3-3, where [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] play a role in the symmetry. The first consonant of the second item of the reduplication [[rendaku|may become voiced]] if phonological conditions allow. Japanese ideophones are used extensively in daily conversations as well as in the written language.

* ''doki doki'' ({{lang|ja|ドキドキ}}) &amp;mdash; heartbeat: excitement
* ''kira kira'' ({{lang|ja|キラキラ}}) &amp;mdash; glitter
* ''shiin'' ({{lang|ja|シーン}}) &amp;mdash; silence
* ''niko niko'' ({{lang|ja|ニコニコ}}) &amp;mdash; smile

'''Kinesiology''' is the scientific study of human or non-human body movement. Kinesiology addresses physiological, biomechanical, and psychological dynamic principles and mechanisms of movement. Applications of kinesiology to human health (i.e., '''human kinesiology''') include [[biomechanics]] and [[orthopedics]]; strength and conditioning; [[sport psychology]]; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise. Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, [[electrophysiology]] of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Bodo Rosenhahn, Reinhard Klette and Dimitris Metaxas (eds.). Human Motion - Understanding, Modelling, Capture and Animation. Volume 36 in ''Computational Imaging and Vision'', Springer, Dordrecht, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Elgammal, Bodo Rosenhahn, and Reinhard Klette (eds.) Human Motion - Understanding, Modelling, Capture and Animation. 2nd Workshop, in conjunction with ICCV 2007, Rio de Janeiro, ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', LNCS 4814, Springer, Berlin, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κίνησις}} ''kínēsis'', "movement" (itself from κινεῖν ''kineîn'', "to move"), and -λογία ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'', "study".

== Basics ==
Kinesiology is the study of human and nonhuman animal-body movements, performance, and function by applying the sciences of [[biomechanics]], [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[psychology]], and [[neuroscience]]. Applications of kinesiology in human-health include physical education teacher, rehabilitation, health and safety, health promotion, workplaces, sport and exercise industries. A bachelor's degree in kinesiology can provide strong preparation for graduate study in biomedical research, as well as in professional programs, such as medicine.

Whereas the term "kinesiologist" is neither a licensed nor professional designation in the United States nor most countries (with the exception of Canada), individuals with training in this area can teach physical education, provide consulting services, conduct research and develop policies related to rehabilitation, human motor performance, [[ergonomics]], and occupational health and safety. In North America, kinesiologists may study to earn a [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Science]], or [[Doctorate of Philosophy]] degree in Kinesiology or a [[Bachelor's degree#Kinesiology|Bachelor of Kinesiology]] degree, while in Australia or New Zealand, they are often conferred an Applied Science (Human Movement) degree (or higher). Many doctoral level faculty in North American kinesiology programs received their doctoral training in related disciplines, such as neuroscience, mechanical engineering, psychology, and physiology.

The world's first kinesiology department was launched in 1967 at the [[University of Waterloo]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahs.uwaterloo.ca/kin/|title=Home - Kinesiology|author=|date=20 August 2012|website=uwaterloo.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021063436/http://www.ahs.uwaterloo.ca/kin/|archivedate=21 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motor redundancy ===
[[File:Motor Redundancy Animation.gif|300px|thumb|left|Animation illustrating the concept of motor redundancy: the motor action of bringing the finger in contact with a point in space can be achieved using a wide variety of limb configurations.]]

Motor redundancy is a widely used concept in kinesiology and [[motor control]] which states that, for any task the human body can perform, there are effectively an unlimited number of ways the nervous system could achieve that task.&lt;ref name=Bernstein1967&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bernstein|first=Nikolai|title=The Co-ordination and Regulation of Movement| year=1967|publisher=Permagon Press|location=Long Island City, NY|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; This redundancy appears at multiple levels in the chain of motor execution:

* [[kinematics|Kinematic]] redundancy means that for a desired location of the endpoint (e.g. the hand or finger), there are many configurations of the joints that would produce the same endpoint location in space.
* [[Muscle]] redundancy means that the same net joint [[torque]] could be generated by many different relative contributions of individual muscles.
* [[Motor unit]] redundancy means that for the same net muscle [[force]] could be generated by many different relative contributions of motor units within that muscle.

The concept of motor redundancy is explored in numerous studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Latash|first=ML|author2=Scholz, JP |author3=Schöner, G |title=Motor control strategies revealed in the structure of motor variability.|journal=Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews|date=January 2002|volume=30|issue=1|pages=26–31|pmid=11800496|doi=10.1097/00003677-200201000-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tresch|first=MC|author2=Jarc, A |title=The case for and against muscle synergies.|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|date=December 2009|volume=19|issue=6|pages=601–7|pmid=19828310|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2009.09.002|pmc=2818278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=todorov2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todorov|first=E|author2=Jordan, MI |title=Optimal feedback control as a theory of motor coordination.|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=November 2002|volume=5|issue=11|pages=1226–35|pmid=12404008|doi=10.1038/nn963}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually with the goal of describing the relative contribution of a set of motor elements (e.g. muscles) in various human movements, and how these contributions can be predicted from a comprehensive theory. Two distinct (but not incompatible) theories have emerged for how the nervous system coordinates redundant elements: '''simplification''' and '''optimization'''. In the simplification theory, complex movements and muscle actions are constructed from simpler ones, often known as primitives or synergies, resulting in a simpler system for the brain to control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=d'Avella|first=A|author2=Saltiel, P |author3=Bizzi, E |title=Combinations of muscle synergies in the construction of a natural motor behavior.|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=March 2003|volume=6|issue=3|pages=300–8|pmid=12563264|doi=10.1038/nn1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mussa-Ivaldi|first=FA|author2=Giszter, SF |author3=Bizzi, E |title=Linear combinations of primitives in vertebrate motor control|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Aug 2, 1994|volume=91|issue=16|pages=7534–8|pmid=8052615|doi=10.1073/pnas.91.16.7534|bibcode=1994PNAS...91.7534M|pmc=44436}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the optimization theory, motor actions arise from the minimization of a control parameter,&lt;ref name=todorov2002 /&gt; such as the energetic cost of movement or errors in movement performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=CM|author2=Wolpert, DM |title=Signal-dependent noise determines motor planning|journal=Nature|date=Aug 20, 1998|volume=394|issue=6695|pages=780–4|pmid=9723616|doi=10.1038/29528|bibcode=1998Natur.394..780H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope of practice ==
In Canada, kinesiology is a professional designation as well as an area of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oka.on.ca/ |title=Welcome to the Ontario Kinesiology Association |publisher=Oka.on.ca |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924214553/http://www.oka.on.ca/ |archivedate=2008-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the province of Ontario the scope has been officially defined as, "the assessment of human movement and performance and its rehabilitation and management to maintain, rehabilitate or enhance movement and performance" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_07k10_e.htm|title=Law Document English View|author=|date=24 July 2014|website=gov.on.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403094418/http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_07k10_e.htm|archivedate=3 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinesiologists work in a variety of roles as health professionals. They work as rehabilitation providers in hospitals, clinics and private settings working with populations needing care for musculoskeletal, cardiac and neurological conditions. They provide rehabilitation to persons injured at work and in vehicular accidents. Kinesiologists also work as functional assessment specialists, exercise therapists, ergonomists, return to work specialists, case managers and medical legal evaluators. They can be found in hospital, long term care, clinic, work, and community settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hprac.org/en/reports/resources/New_Directions_April_2006_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628061020/http://www.hprac.org/en/reports/resources/New_Directions_April_2006_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-28 |df= }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, kinesiology is applied in areas of health and fitness for all levels of athletes, but more often found with training of elite athletes.

== Licensing and regulation ==

=== Canada ===
In Canada, Kinesiology has been designated a regulated health profession in [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=S. J.|title=Introduction to Kinesiology|editor=Shirl J.

The [[College of Kinesiologists of Ontario]] achieved proclamation on April 1, 2013, at which time the professional title "Kinesiologist" became protected by law. In Ontario only members of the college may call themselves a Registered Kinesiologist.
Individuals who have earned degrees in kinesiology can work in research, the fitness industry, clinical settings, and in industrial environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cka.ca/kinesiology.php |title=CKA - Canadian Kinesiology Alliance - Alliance Canadienne de Kinésiologie |publisher=Cka.ca |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318005051/http://www.cka.ca/kinesiology.php |archivedate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also work in cardiac rehabilitation, health and safety, hospital and long-term care facilities and community health centers just to name a few.

== History of Kinesiology ==
[[File:NilsPosse.png|600px|thumb|In 1886, Swedish baron Nils Posse (1862-1895) introduced the term Kinesiology in the U.S.A., 1894 he wrote the book "The Special Kinesiology of Educational Gymnastics". Nils Posse was a graduate of the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute in Stockholm, Sweden and founder of the Posse Gymnasium, Boston, MA.]]

[[Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics]] ([[:sv:Gymnastik- och idrottshögskolan|sv]]) G.C.I. was founded 1813 in Stockholm, Sweden by [[Pehr Henrik Ling]]. It was the first [[Physiotherapy]] School in the world, training hundreds of medical gymnasts who spread the Swedish physical therapy around the entire world. 
In 1887, Sweden was the first country in the world to give a national state licence to physiotherapists/physical therapists.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ottosson|first=Anders|date=2010|title=The First Historical Movements of Kinesiology: Scientification in the Borderline between Physical Culture and Medicine around 1850|journal=The International Journal of the History of Sport|volume= 27| issue = 11|pages=1892–1919|doi=10.1080/09523367.2010.491618|pmid=20653114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish medical gymnast and [[kinesiologist]] [[Carl August Georgii]] ([[:sv:August Georgii|sv]]), Professor at the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute GCI in Stockholm, was the one who created and coined the new international word '''Kinesiology''' in 1854.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The term ''Kinesiology'' is a literal translation to Greek+English from the original Swedish word ''Rörelselära'', meaning "Movement Science". It was the foundation of the Medical Gymnastics, the original [[Physiotherapy]] and [[Physical Therapy]], developed during 100 years in Sweden (starting 1813).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
 
The new medical therapy created in Sweden was originally called [[Rörelselära]] ([[:sv:Rörelselära|sv]]), and later in 1854 translated to the new and invented international word "Kinesiology". 
The Kinesiology consisted of nearly 2,000 physical movements and 50 different types of massage therapy techniques. 
They were all used to affect various dysfunctions and even illnesses, not only in the movement apparatus, but also into the internal physiology of man. 
Thus, the original classical and Traditional Kinesiology was not only a system of rehabilitation for the body, or biomechanics like in modern Academic Kinesiology, but also a new therapy for relieving and curing diseases, by affecting the autonomic nervous system, organs and glands in the body.,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sjukgymnasten - vart tog han vägen?

In 1886, the Swedish Medical Gymnast [[Nils Posse]] (1862-1895) introduced the term kinesiology in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2005/np2005zq.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911234740/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2005/np2005zq.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nils Posse was a graduate of the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute in Stockholm, Sweden and founder of the Posse Gymnasium in Boston, MA. He was teaching at [[Boston Normal School of Gymnastics]] BNSG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kinesiology.com/image/NilsPosse.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107034519/http://kinesiology.com/image/NilsPosse.png |archivedate=2017-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Special Kinesiology Of Educational Gymnastics'' was the first book ever written in the world with the word "Kinesiology" in the title of the book. It was written by Nils Posse and published in Boston, 1894-1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinesiology.com/|title=Kinesiology.com - manual muscle testing MMT|first=Mac Pompeius Wolontis,|last=www.Kinesiology.com|date=|website=kinesiology.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107072051/http://www.kinesiology.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Beverage description --&gt;
'''Kombucha''' (also '''tea mushroom''', '''tea fungus''', or '''Manchurian mushroom''' when referring to the [[Microbiological culture|culture]]; botanical name ''Medusomyces gisevii'' Lindau&lt;ref name=Jayabalan/&gt;) is a [[fermentation|fermented]], slightly [[Alcoholic drink|alcoholic]], lightly [[effervescent]], [[Sweetened beverage|sweetened]] [[black tea|black]] or [[green tea]] drink commonly intended as a [[functional beverage]] for its supposed health benefits. Sometimes the beverage is called '''kombucha tea''' to distinguish the name from the ''kombucha'' culture of bacteria and yeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/expert-answers/kombucha-tea/faq-20058126|title=A mug of kombucha for your health?|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Culture description --&gt;
Kombucha is produced by fermenting [[tea]] using a ''[[symbiotic]] culture of [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]]'' ([[SCOBY]]) commonly called a ''mother'' or ''mushroom''. The [[microbial]] populations in a SCOBY vary: the yeast component generally includes ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', along with other species, while the bacterial component almost always includes ''[[Gluconacetobacter xylinus]]'' to [[oxidize]] yeast-produced [[alcohols]] to [[acetic acid]] (and other acids).&lt;ref name=myc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jonas|first=Rainer|last2=Farah|first2=Luiz F.|title=Production and application of microbial cellulose|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0141391097001973|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume=59|issue=1–3|pages=101–106|doi=10.1016/s0141-3910(97)00197-3|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a SCOBY is commonly called tea ''fungus'' or ''mushroom'', those terms are misleading.

===Etymology===

The word ''kombucha'' is of uncertain [[etymology]], but may be a case of a misapplied [[loanword]] from Japanese.&lt;ref name=Algeo97&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John |last1=Algeo |first2=Adele |last2=Algeo |year=1997 |title=Among the New Words |journal=American Speech |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=183–97 |jstor=455789 |doi=10.2307/455789}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japanese, the term {{nihongo3|"[[Kombu#Cooking|kelp tea]]"|昆布茶|kombucha}} refers to a completely different beverage: the [[kelp tea]], made from dried and powdered ''[[konbu]]'' (an edible [[kelp]] from the [[Laminariaceae]] family). The term for the fermented tea in Japanese, is {{nihongo3|"fungus tea"|紅茶キノコ|kōcha kinoko}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wong |first=Crystal |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/07/12/national/u-s-kombucha-smelly-and-no-kelp/ |title=U.S. 'kombucha': Smelly and No Kelp |work=Japan Times |date=12 July 2007 |accessdate=14 June 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' suggests that it is probably from the "Japanese ''kombucha'', tea made from ''konbu'' (the Japanese word for [[kelp]] perhaps being used by English speakers to designate fermented tea due to confusion or because the thick gelatinous film produced by the ''kombucha culture'' was thought to resemble seaweed)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/kombucha |encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary |title=Kombucha |edition=Fifth |date=2015 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company]] |accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writings about the beverage in Japanese generally take the point of view that the Japanese word 'kombucha' was mistakenly applied in English to what Japanese call "kocha kinoko." ''Cha'' means tea or ''o-cha'', Japanese [[green tea]].

Kombucha has about 80 other names worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/28/garden/a-magic-mushroom-or-a-toxic-fad.html |work=New York Times |date=28 December 1994 |last=O'Neill |first=Molly |accessdate=14 June 2015 |title=A Magic Mushroom Or a Toxic Fad?}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1965 mycological study called kombucha "tea fungus" and listed other names: "teeschwamm, Japanese or Indonesian tea fungus, kombucha, wunderpilz, hongo, cajnij, fungus japonicus, and teekwass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=C.

===Biological===
A kombucha culture is a [[SCOBY|symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast]] (SCOBY), similar to [[mother of vinegar]], containing one or more species each of bacteria and yeasts, which form a [[zoogleal mat]]&lt;ref name=Blanc&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanc|first1=Phillipe J|title=Characterization of the tea fungus metabolites|journal=Biotechnology Letters|date=February 1996|volume=18|issue=2|pages=139–142|doi=10.1007/BF00128667}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as a "mother."&lt;ref name=Jayabalan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jayabalan|first1=Rasu|title=A Review on Kombucha Tea—Microbiology, Composition, Fermentation, Beneficial Effects, Toxicity, and Tea Fungus|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|date=21 June 2014|volume=13|issue=4|pages=538–550|doi=10.1111/1541-4337.12073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultures may contain one or more of the ''yeasts'' ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]'', ''[[Candida stellata]]'', ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'' and ''[[Zygosaccharomyces bailii]]''.&lt;ref name=Dufresne2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dufresne|first1=C.|last2=Farnworth|first2=E.|title=Tea, Kombucha, and health: a review|journal=Food Research International|volume=33|issue=6|year=2000|pages=409–421|issn=0963-9969|doi=10.1016/S0963-9969(00)00067-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of research regarding its biological properties.&lt;ref name=Villarreal-SotoBeaufort2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Villarreal-Soto|first1=Silvia Alejandra|last2=Beaufort|first2=Sandra|last3=Bouajila|first3=Jalloul|last4=Souchard|first4=Jean-Pierre|last5=Taillandier|first5=Patricia|title=Understanding Kombucha Tea Fermentation: A Review|journal=Journal of Food Science|volume=83|issue=3|year=2018|pages=580–588|issn=0022-1147|doi=10.1111/1750-3841.14068|pmid=29508944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bacterial component of kombucha comprises several species, almost always including ''[[Acetobacter xylinum|Gluconacetobacter xylinus]]'' (''G. xylinus'', formerly ''Acetobacter xylinum''), which ferments alcohols produced by the yeasts into [[acetic acid|acetic]] and other acids, increasing the acidity and limiting [[ethanol]] content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fermentation and metabolic characteristics of Gluconacetobacter oboediens for different carbon sources|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|volume=87|issue=1|pages=127–136|doi=10.1007/s00253-010-2474-x|pmid=20191270|year=2010|last1=Sarkar|first1=Dayanidhi|last2=Yabusaki|first2=Masahiro|last3=Hasebe|first3=Yuta|last4=Ho|first4=Pei Yee|last5=Kohmoto|first5=Shuji|last6=Kaga|first6=Takayuki|last7=Shimizu|first7=Kazuyuki}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The population of bacteria and yeasts found to produce acetic acid has been reported to increase for the first 4 days of fermentation, decreasing thereafter.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''G. xylinus'' has been shown to produce microbial [[cellulose]], and is reportedly responsible for most or all of the physical structure of the "mother", which may have been selectively encouraged over time for firmer (denser) and more robust cultures by brewers.&lt;ref name="Nguyen2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nguyen |first1= VT |last2= Flanagan |first2= B |last3= Gidley |first3= MJ |last4= Dykes |first4= GA |year= 2008 |title= Characterization of cellulose production by a gluconacetobacter xylinus strain from kombucha |journal= Current Microbiology |volume= 57 |issue= 5 |pages= 449–53 |doi= 10.1007/s00284-008-9228-3|pmid= 18704575}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2015}}

The mixed, presumably symbiotic culture has been further described as being lichenous, in accord with the reported presence of the known lichenous natural product [[usnic acid]], though as of 2015, no report appears indicating the standard cyanobacterial species of [[lichen]]s in association with kombucha fungal components.&lt;ref name=LiverToxUsnic/&gt;

The alcohol content of the kombucha is usually less than 0.5%, but this number increases with elongated fermentation times.&lt;ref name=bccdc/&gt; Over-fermentation generates high amounts of acids similar to vinegar.&lt;ref name=Jayabalan/&gt; The pH of the drink is typically about 2.5.&lt;ref name=Ernst2003/&gt;

==Production==

Kombucha drink is prepared at home globally and some companies sell it commercially.&lt;ref name=Jayabalan/&gt;  Standard Kombucha production procedures include starts with boiling 1L non-chlorinated water and dissolving 50g sugar in the boiling water.  Next, 5g of tea leaves are steeped in the hot sugar water for 5 minutes and then tea leaves are discarded. Sweetened tea is cooled to around 20℃ and 24g of SCOBY culture is added. This is poured into a sterilized beaker or other glass container along with 0.2L of previously fermented kombucha tea.  This will lower the pH.  The container is covered with a paper towel or breathable fabric that will not allow insects such as ''Drosophila'' fruit flies to contaminate the kombucha.  The tea is left to ferment for a period of up to 10 to 14 days at room temperature (18℃ to 26℃).  A new "daughter" SCOBY will form on the surface of the tea to the diameter of the container.  After fermentation is completed, the SCOBY is removed and stored along with a small amount of the newly fermented tea.  The remaining kombucha is strained and bottled for a secondary ferment for a few days or stored at a temperature of 4℃.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jayabalan|first=Rasu|last2=Malbaša|first2=Radomir V.|last3=Lončar|first3=Eva S.|last4=Vitas|first4=Jasmina S.|last5=Sathishkumar|first5=Muthuswamy|date=2014-06-21|title=A Review on Kombucha Tea-Microbiology, Composition, Fermentation, Beneficial Effects, Toxicity, and Tea Fungus|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=538–550|doi=10.1111/1541-4337.12073|issn=1541-4337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:300ml glass of kombucha with ice.png|thumb|150px|Kombucha tea with ice cubes]]
People drink kombucha for its many purported health benefits.&lt;ref name=Jayabalan/&gt; Research has been conducted using biological assays ''[[in vitro]]''.&lt;ref name=Villarreal-SotoBeaufort2018/&gt; Other studies have been ''[[in vivo]]'' using rats.&lt;ref name=Villarreal-SotoBeaufort2018/&gt; There have not been any [[clinical trial|human trials]] conducted to assess its possible [[biological effects]],&lt;ref name=Jayabalan/&gt;&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt; and the purported health beneﬁts resulting from its biological activities have not been demonstrated in humans.&lt;ref name=Villarreal-SotoBeaufort2018/&gt;

In 2000, a scientific review was done, which summarized the range of claimed health benefits: "It has been claimed that Kombucha teas cure asthma, cataracts, diabetes, diarrhea, gout, herpes, insomnia and rheumatism. They are purported to shrink the prostate and expand the libido, reverse grey hair, remove wrinkles, relieve haemorrhoids, lower hypertension, prevent cancer, and promote general well-being. They are believed to stimulate the immune system, and have become popular among people who are HIV positive or have full-blown AIDS".&lt;ref name=myc&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Kombucha Consortia of yeasts and bacteria|volume=14|issue=4|year=2000|vauthors=Jarrell J, Cal T, Bennett JW|journal=Mycologist|doi=10.1016/S0269-915X(00)80034-8|pages=166–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stammderlikatierlogo.gif|thumb]]
The '''Likatier tribe''' (in [[German language|German]] '''''Stamm der Likatier''''', known as ''Stamm Füssen Eins'' until 1998) is a community of about 200 people (more than half being minors) who live and work together in [[Füssen]] in the south of [[Germany]]. The group is not a [[tribe]] in the usual sense, since anyone can become a member. It owns several houses and businesses in the city, and critics sometimes view it as a [[cult]] or [[sect]], although members do not share a common well-defined religious or spiritual belief system.

The community was founded in 1974 by then 17-year-old Wolfgang Wankmiller, who still leads it. It strives for independence and self-sufficiency with minimal environmental impact, practices [[ovo-lacto vegetarianism]], and encourages [[free love]] while tolerating stable relationships. Separate men's and women's discussion groups meet weekly. Children are raised as a group by several women; some children are schooled privately by members of the tribe in a house across the border in [[Austria]] (as home schooling is not possible in Germany).

Several of the group's activities are related to [[esotericism]], and a 
self-description states "our foremost goal is the perception and understanding of reality and its expression in vibrancy". The group also has its own internal currency and employs a creative approach to language, giving uncommon names to days or to everyday objects. It intends to create a genuine new "tribe culture" and is in active contact with other ecological communities around the world.

The group is hierarchically organized, with members having different "levels" reflecting their commitment to the tribe. There is also an outer circle of people who join the group in some of its activities but for the most part live separately.

In the 1970s the tribe tried to undermine several organizations in Füssen, and Wankmiller was active in local politics for a while. The Likatier are generally regarded with suspicion or even hostility in the city, and a citizen's action group has been formed that opposes the tribe and supports people who want to leave it.

In 2001, a cook of the group was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison for sexual abuse of five minor members of the tribe. While the trial judge found that the behavior was neither condoned by nor connected to the group, critics have pointed out that the cook was readmitted to the community after having served his sentence. The German [[yellow journalism|yellow press]] occasionally reports on the group in a sensationalist manner, labeling Wankmiller as a "Sex-Guru", claiming that he believe himself to be a reincarnation of Jesus, and accusing the group of running sex orgies in the presence of minors.

To counter negative publicity, the group started a website in 2003. It has always welcomed outside visitors, and has recently started to offer "get-to-know" seminars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">The '''Lincoln's Birthday Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom''' ('''LBCDIF''') was an [[antifascist]] organization of [[scientists]] founded by [[Franz Boas]] in 1938 to discredit the theories of race being forwarded by the [[Nazis]] in [[Germany]]. 

In the 1930s Franz Boas was one of the first scientists to become aware of the immense prestige and influence of scientists in that era. Even at his advanced age Boas wanted to find a way to use the influence of scientists to promote human welfare. At [[Columbia University]] he collaborated with [[Ruth Benedict]], [[Leslie Dunn]], [[Robert Staughton Lynd|Robert Lynd]], [[Walter Rautenstrauch]], [[Harold Urey]] and other members of the [[University Federation for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom]] to find a unifying political position that would bring scientists of all disciplines together on a common front. He decided antifascism was such a position, and based on his collaborations wrote the [[Manifesto on Freedom in Science]]. In 1938 the Manifesto was released with 1,284 signatures of prominent scientists, including [[Roger Adams]], [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Albert Einstein]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20110616123216/http://www.alberteinstein.info/High/28-468.jpg (see: Einstein Letter to LBCDIF)]. Boas used the excitement generated by the Manifesto to launch the LBCDIF.  Twenty-six meetings were organized to uphold the principles of the Manifesto, and the success of these meetings encouraged the organizers to expand the Birthday Committee to an ongoing group called the [[American Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom]] (ACDIF).

The '''National High Magnetic Field Laboratory''' ('''MagLab''') is a facility at  [[Florida State University]], the [[University of Florida]], and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico, that performs [[magnetic field]] research in [[physics]], [[biology]], [[bioengineering]], [[chemistry]], [[geochemistry]], [[biochemistry]]. It is the only such facility in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Science Foundation Supported Research Infrastructure |page=66 |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/nsf09013/nsf_09013.pdf |publisher=National Science Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is among nine{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} worldwide. The lab is supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the state of [[Florida]], and works in collaboration with private industry. 

Currently the lab holds a world record of possessing the world's strongest magnet for [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] experiments. The 33-ton engineering marvel, called the series connected hybrid (SCH) magnet, successfully broke the record during a series of tests conducted by MagLab engineers and scientists.The instrument reached its full field of 36 tesla on 15 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National MagLab racks up new world record with hybrid magnet |publisher=Phys.Org, November 10, 2016 |url= http://phys.org/news/2016-11-national-maglab-racks-world-hybrid.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Proposal and award===
In 1989 Florida State University (FSU), Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the University of Florida submitted a proposal to the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) for a new [[national laboratory]] supporting [[interdisciplinary]] research in high magnetic fields. The plan proposed a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]]-[[U.S. state|state]] partnership serving magnet-related research, science and technology education, and partnering industry. The goal was to maintain the competitive position of the United States in magnet-related research and development. Following a peer-review competition, the NSF approved the FSU-led consortium's proposal.

===Competing proposal by MIT===
In a competing proposal to the NSF, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), with the [[University of Iowa]], the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], and [[Argonne National Laboratory]], had suggested improving the existing world-class [[Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory]] at MIT instead. On September 5, 1990, MIT researchers asked the 21 members of the [[National Science Board]] (NSB) to "review and reconsider" its decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/tt/90/sep12/23617.html |title=MIT Asks National Science Board To Reconsider Magnet Lab Vote |publisher=MIT News Office |work=[[MIT Tech Talk]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311072238/http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/tt/90/sep12/23617.html |archivedate=March 11, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With $60 million at stake in the NSF grant, MIT stated it would phase out the Francis Bitter Lab if it lost its appeal, the first of its kind in NSF history. The request was turned down September 18, 1990.&lt;ref name="NSF denies MIT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N35/magnet.35n.html |publisher=[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]] (Online Edition) |author=Mehta, Prabhat |title=NSB denies MIT magnet appeal |date=September 18, 1990 |volume=Vol. 110  |issue=Iss. 35 |accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
The laboratory's early years were spent establishing infrastructure, building the facility, and recruiting faculty. The Tallahassee complex was dedicated on October 1, 1994, to a large crowd, with keynote speaker Vice President [[Al Gore]].

==Mission==
The lab's mission, as set forth by the NSF, is: "To provide the highest magnetic fields and necessary services for scientific research conducted by users from a wide range of disciplines, including physics, chemistry, materials science, engineering, biology and geology."

The lab focuses on four objectives:
* Develop user facilities and services for magnet-related research, open to all qualified scientists and engineers
* Advance magnet technology in cooperation with industry
* Promote a multidisciplinary research environment and administer in-house research program that uses and advances the facilities
* Develop an educational outreach program

===Education and Public Outreach===
The National MagLab promotes [[science education]] and supports science, engineering, and science teachers through its Center for Integrating Research and Learning. Programs include [[mentor]]ships in an interdisciplinary learning environment. Through the Magnet Academy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy Magnet Academy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the lab's website provides educational content on electricity and magnetism.

The National MagLab also conducts monthly tours open to the public and hosts an annual open house with about 5,000 attendees. Special tour and outreach opportunities are also available to all local schools. In an interview on [[Skepticality]], Dr. Scott Hannahs said, "If you come by on the third Saturday in February I believe we have an open house and we have Tesla coils shooting sparks and we melt rocks in the geochemistry group and we measure the speed of sound and we have lasers and potato launchers and we just have all sorts of things showing little scientific principles and stuff. We get together and we have about 5,000 people show up to come and tour a physics lab which is a pretty amazing group of people."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.skepticality.com/download-episode.php?thefile=traffic.libsyn.com/skepticality/172_Skepticality.mp3 |title=Magnetic Force |publisher=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |host=[[Derek Colanduno]] |date=13 December 2011 |time= |accessdate=5 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
[[Image:National High Magnetic Field Lab00.png|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of the 45 tesla hybrid magnet]]
===Florida State University programs===
The [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] laboratory at Florida State University is a 34,374 square meter (370,000 sq ft.) complex and has approximately 300 [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]], staff, [[Graduate student|graduate]], and [[postdoctoral]] students. Its director is physicist [[Gregory Scott Boebinger]].  Its chief scientist is [[Laura Greene (physicist)|Laura Greene]].

====DC field program====

The facility contains 14 resistive magnet cells connected to a  48 megawatt DC power supply and {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}} of cooling equipment to remove the heat generated by the magnets. The facility houses several magnets, including a 45 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] hybrid magnet, which combines resistive and superconducting magnets. The lab's 35 tesla resistive magnet is the strongest resistive magnet in the world, and the 25 tesla Keck magnet has the highest homogeneity of any resistive magnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalmaglab.org/about/around-the-lab/meet-the-magnets/meet-the-45-tesla-hybrid-magnet |title=The World's Strongest Magnet |publisher=MationalMagLab.org |date= |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NMR spectroscopy and imaging====
This program serves a broad user base in solution and solid state NMR [[spectroscopy]] and [[MRI]] and diffusion measurements at high magnetic field strengths. The lab develops technology, methodology, and applications at high magnetic fields through both in-house and external user activities. An in-house made 900&amp;nbsp;MHz (21.1 tesla) NMR magnet has an ultra-wide bore measuring 105&amp;nbsp;mm (about 4&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter, this superconducting magnet has the highest field for MRI study of a living animals.{{fact|date=April 2016}}

====Ion cyclotron resonance====
The [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]] mass spectrometry program is involved in instrument and technique development and applications of FT-ICR mass spectrometry. Under the leadership of director [[Alan G. Marshall]], the program continuously develops techniques and instruments and applications of FT-ICR mass spectrometry. The program has several instruments, including a 14.5 tesla, 104&amp;nbsp;mm bore system.

====Electron magnetic resonance====
The most common form of EMR is electron paramagnetic/spin resonance (EPR/ESR). In EPR experiments, transitions are observed between the mS sublevels of an electronic spin state S that are split by the applied magnetic field as well as by the fine structure interactions and the electron-nuclear hyperfine interactions. This technique has applications in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, physics and materials research.

====Magnet science and technology====
The Magnet Science and Technology division is charged with developing the technology and expertise for magnet systems. These magnet projects include building advanced magnet systems for the Tallahassee and Los Alamos sites, working with industry to develop the technology to improve high-field magnet manufacturing capabilities, and improving high field magnet systems through research and development.

Also at the lab's FSU headquarters, the Applied Superconductivity Center advances the science and technology of superconductivity for both the low temperature niobium-based and the high temperature cuprate or MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based materials. The ASC pursues the superconductors for magnets for fusion, high energy physics, MRI, and electric power transmission lines and transformers.

====In-house research====
The in-house research program utilizes MagLab facilities to pursue high field research in science and engineering, while advancing the lab’s user programs through development of new techniques and equipment.

=====Condensed matter group=====
The condensed matter group scientists concentrate on various aspects of [[condensed matter physics]], including studies and experiments involving magnetism, the [[quantum hall effect]], quantum oscillations, [[high temperature superconductivity]], and heavy fermion systems.

=====Geochemistry Program=====
The geochemistry research program is centered around the use of [[trace elements]] and [[isotopes]] to understand the Earth processes and environment. The research interests range from the chemical evolution of Earth and [[solar system]] through time to local scale problems on the sources and transport of environmentally significant substances. The studies conducted by the geochemistry division concern [[Earth|terrestrial]] and [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] questions and involve land-based and seagoing expeditions and spacecraft missions. Together with FSU's Chemistry and Oceanography departments, Geochemistry has started a program in Biogeochemical Dynamics.

=====Other programs=====
Other programs include cryogenics, optical microscopy, quantum materials and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy.

The lab also has a materials research team that researches new ways to make high strength magnetic materials using more common and cheaper elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Los Alamos National Laboratory Pulsed Field Facility===
[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] hosts the Pulsed Field Facility, which provides researchers with experimental capabilities for a wide range of measurements in non-destructive pulsed fields to 60 teslas. Pulsed field magnets create high magnetic fields, but only for fractions of a second. A 100 tesla multi-shot magnet is being jointly constructed by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the National Science Foundation. The laboratory is located at the center of Los Alamos. In 1999-2000, the facility was relocated into a new specially designed Experimental Hall to better accommodate user operations and support. The program is the first and only high pulsed field user facility in the United States. 

The facility provides a wide variety of experimental capabilities to 60 teslas, using short and long pulse magnets. Power comes from a pulsed power infrastructure which includes a 1.43 [[gigawatt]] motor generator and five 64-megawatt power supplies. The 1200-ton motor generator sits on a 4800-short ton (4350 t) inertia block which rests on 60 springs to minimize earth tremors and is the centerpiece of the Pulsed Field Laboratory.

The facility's magnets include a 60 tesla long-pulse magnet that is the most powerful controlled-pulse magnet in the world.

===University of Florida Programs===
The University of Florida is home to user facilities in magnetic resonance imaging or (MRI) with an ultra-low temperature, ultra-quiet environment for experimental studies in the High B/T (high magnetic field/low temperature) Facility. Facilities are also available for the [[Microfabrication|fabrication]] and characterization of [[nanostructure]]s at a new nanoscale research facility operated in conjunction with the university's Major Analytical and Instrumentation Center.

====High B/T Facility====
The High B/T Facility is part of the Microkelvin Laboratory of the Physics Department and conducts experiments in high magnetic fields up to 15.2 teslas and at temperatures as low as 0.4 mK simultaneously for studies of magnetization, thermodynamic quantities, transport measurements, magnetic resonance, viscosity, diffusion, and pressure.

The facility holds world records for high B/T in Bay 1 for short term low field capabilities and world records for high field long time (&gt; 1 week) experiments.{{fact|date=April 2016}} The research group leads the world in collective studies of quantum fluids and solids in terms of breadth and low temperature techniques (thermometry, NMR, ultrasound, heat capacity, sample cooling.)

====Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy====
The Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy program (AMRIS) contains facilities for the Mag Lab's NMR Program that complement the facilities at the lab's headquarters in Tallahassee. AMRIS is located at the University of Florida's McKnight Brain Institute. Their instruments include a 600&amp;nbsp;MHz NMR magnet with 1&amp;nbsp;mm triple-resonance, high-temperature superconducting probe, which delivers the highest mass sensitivity of any probe at any frequency in the world.{{fact|date=April 2016}}

'''Oculolinctus''', also known as '''"worming"''' or '''eyeball-licking fetishism''', refers to the  [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] practice of licking [[eyeball]]s for erotic gratification. In mid-2013, English-language newspapers reported that this fetish had allegedly become popular in [[Japan]], where it was referred to as {{nihongo|''Gankyū name purei''|眼球舐めプレイ|4 = "eyeball licking play"}}.&lt;ref&gt;2013-06-07, [http://news.merumo.ne.jp/article/genre/1249531 小学生に眼球なめ変態プレイが大流行], 読めるモ&lt;/ref&gt; However, other media have reported that the existence of this practice is a [[hoax]] based on a story in a Japanese [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://no1.fccj.ne.jp/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=954 LICK THIS! Mark Schreiber ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57597395-1/blind-spot-how-a-hoax-about-eye-licking-went-global/|title=Blind spot: How a hoax about eye licking went global|publisher=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the originally reporting articles were corrected&lt;ref name="Moye" /&gt; or [[Retraction|retracted]]&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; as being possibly a hoax.

==Characteristics==
In 2013, oculolinctus reportedly became popular among teenagers in Japan, causing a significant rise in eye infections. According to a retracted article by ''[[The Guardian]]'', eyeball-licking was "seen as a new [[Baseball metaphors for sex|second-base]]; the thing you graduate to when kissing gets boring", possibly due to it being featured in a music video by the Japanese band [[Born (band)|Born]].&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heritage|first=Stuart|title=Eyeball-licking: the fetish that is making Japanese teenagers sick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/jun/14/eyeball-licking-fetish-japanese-teenagers-sick|accessdate=14 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further reports, e.g. in an article by the Huffington Post later corrected as a possible hoax, showed an increase in Japanese schoolchildren wearing eyepatches due to eye infections arising from the act, with one school finding one third of 12-year-old students admitting to engaging in oculolinctus.&lt;ref name="Moye"&gt;David Moye, 2013-06-12, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/12/eyeball-licking-pinkeye_n_3423985.html Eyeball Licking Causing Pinkeye In Japan]", ''The Huffington Post'' (later corrected as a hoax)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also accounts of this practice in the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name=Waxman&gt;{{cite web|last=Waxman|first=Olivia B.|title=Eyeball-Licking Fetish Isn’t Just Disgusting, It Spreads Pink Eye|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/06/14/eyeball-licking-fetish-isnt-just-disgusting-it-spreads-pink-eye-too/|publisher=[[TIME]]|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks of licking an eyeball==
The practice is associated with significant health risks, as [[tongue]]s are coated with a film of microorganisms, which may cause infections in the eye, such as [[conjunctivitis]], [[herpes]] and [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]. It also carries the risk of [[corneal abrasion]]&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; and corneal ulcers.&lt;ref name=Narcisse&gt;{{cite web|last=Narcisse|first=Quenton|title=Eyeball Licking: Japan's Craziest New Fetish|url=http://mashable.com/2013/06/14/eyeball-licking/|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral bacteria on the tongue can potentially enter corneal scratches caused by licking the eye, which then lead to infection.&lt;ref&gt;Ashik Siddique, 2013-06-12, "[http://www.medicaldaily.com/articles/16481/20130612/eyeball-licking-oculolinctus-japanese-teenagers-spreads-pink-eye.htm Eyeball Licking ‘Oculolinctus’ Fetish Spreads Pink Eye Among Japanese Preteens]", ''Medical Daily''&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there is also the risk of [[blindness]] from the resulting infections, as well as [[styes]]. The difference in bacteria between the eye and mouth is why it is no longer recommended to lick [[contact lens]]es before they are inserted into one's eye.&lt;ref name="Waxman" /&gt;

'''Officer training''' refers to the training that most [[military officer]]s must complete before acquiring an officer rank. A potential recruit becomes an [[officer cadet]], someone in training. An officer in training can either be trained in a [[Military academy|military college]], such as [[West Point]], or taken from the enlisted ranks. After this training is complete, the recruit in question becomes a fully fledged officer, taking on a commanding position in his or her military branch.

== Production Process ==
The Seattle based chocolate maker Theo Chocolate was one of the first companies that were "fair-trade certified" and produced Organic Chocolate. In 2006 Theo Chocolate began their production of organic chocolate, there were no solid guidelines for the manufacturing and they had to get the process and ingredients in the correct measurements. The main ingredient in chocolate, cocoa is going to be found close to the equator and the majority of it is grown in Western Africa. The organic cocoa, the main ingredient in organic chocolate, is sent to the chocolate factor where they arrive in burlap sacks. The cocoa beans are then thoroughly cleaned and foreign objects are removed until just the beans remain. The manufacturer makes sure to use all organic ingredients to ensure that the final product is truly organic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://emagazine.com/sweet-dreams/|title=Sweet Dreams|date=2007-10-26|work=Emagazine.com|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''party political broadcast''' (also known, in pre-election campaigning periods, as a '''party election broadcast''') is a television or radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] made by a political party.

In the United Kingdom the [[Communications Act 2003]] prohibits [[political advertising]] on television or radio; parties are instead allocated broadcast slots (usually around five minutes long) free of charge on broadcast channels using a formula set by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cap.org.uk/Advertising-Codes/Broadcast/CodeItem.aspx?cscid={85344a94-8673-4fbf-9890-195a4ac1a093}#.WCOa9XV970o|title=07 Political and controversial matters|work= [[BCAP code]]|publisher=[[Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice]] (BCAP)|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cap.org.uk/Advertising-Codes/Broadcast/CodeItem.aspx?cscid={9bbcc79f-2faa-4e64-b14b-39c1b3cd263b}#.WCOaiXV970o|title=10 Prohibited categories|work= BCAP code|publisher=Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP)|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar format exists in the [[Republic of Ireland]], though for smaller parties, because a greater number of them are represented in the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]], their allocated time may be as little as one or two minutes each.

In [[Canada]], the [[Canada Elections Act]] includes provisions for free-time election broadcasts (in addition to paid advertising) during Canadian federal elections, on all licensed terrestrial television and radio networks; notably, however, none of Canada's main English-language private television networks ([[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[City (TV network)|City]]) actually operates under a network license anymore, meaning that in actual practice in the 2010s this provision applies only to [[CBC Television]] and the French-language networks in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=abo&amp;dir=bra/fre&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e "Allocation of Free Broadcasting Time"]. [[Elections Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; CBC Television formerly broadcast the regular weekly series ''[[The Nation's Business]]'', in which Members of Parliament from all parties could give a short speech on a political issue, but this series no longer airs. 

In Asia, party political broadcasts have existed in [[Singapore]] since 1980, where they are known as ''political party broadcasts''. In Japan, party political broadcasts are known as {{nihongo|政見放送|''seiken hōsō''}}. In Brazil, party political broadcasts are known as ''Horário político''. In Chile, party political broadcasts are known as ''Franja Electoral''.

"'''''Pensée unique'''''" ([[French language|French]] for "single thought") is a pejorative expression for [[mainstream]] [[ideology|ideological]] [[conformism]] of any kind, almost always opposed to that of the speaker. Originally, it is a French expression and referred to claims that [[neoliberalism]] is the only correct way to structure society. The phrase implies that mainstream discussion is limited by ideological assumptions of what is possible. One example of ''pensée unique'' given by critics was the motto of [[Margaret Thatcher]] (former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]): [[There is no alternative|TINA]] ("There is no alternative").

The expression was coined by [[Jean-François Kahn]], editor-in-chief of L'Événement du Jeudi,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-François Kahn, Les Risques de la pensée unique. L'Événement du Jeudi, 30th January 1992, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; in an editorial in January 1992. The phrase pensée unique is often used by political parties and organisations and in criticism.

The term has been used regarding [[prohibitionism]] of marijuana, with some commenters saying that ''pensée unique'' is a barrier to legalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/onu-condena-uruguay-violar-convenios.html ''ONU condena a Uruguay por violar convenios con la marihuana legal''] quotation: {{quotation|"Este es un tema que por primera vez rompe el pensamiento único. Acá se cayó otro muro, el muro del pensamiento único. Las convenciones no son una Biblia, son convenciones y no es el pensamiento único", afirmó Romani.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''praetexta''''' or '''''fabula praetexta''''' was a genre of Latin [[tragedy]] introduced at Rome by [[Gnaeus Naevius]] in the third century B.C. It dealt with historical Roman figures, in place of the conventional [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]]. Subsequent writers of ''praetextae'' included [[Ennius]], [[Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]]. The name refers to the ''toga praetexta'', the official dress of Roman magistrates.

All [[Roman Republic]]an tragedies are now lost. From the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]] only one play has survived, the [[Octavia (play)|''Octavia'']].

{{Refimprove|lead|date=December 2011}}
A '''prologue''' or '''prolog''' from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πρόλογος ''prologos'', from πρό ''pro'', "before" and λόγος ''logos'', "word" is an opening to a story that establishes the context and gives background details, often some earlier story that ties into the main one, and other miscellaneous information. The Ancient Greek ''prólogos'' included the modern meaning of ''prologue'', but was of wider significance, more like the meaning of [[preface]]. The importance, therefore, of the prologue in [[Greek tragedy#Structure|Greek drama]] was very great; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance, to which, or to an episode in which, the play itself succeeded.

It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of [[Euripides]], and with him, as has been said, it takes the place of an explanatory first act. This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue, as an impertinence, a useless growth prefixed to the play, and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it. The point precisely is that, to an Athenian audience, it was useful and pertinent, as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible. But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of [[Deus ex machina|producing a god out of a machine]] to justify the action of deity upon man, because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it. He seems, in such a typical prologue as that to the ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', to be accepting a conventional formula, and employing it, almost perversely, as a medium for his ironic rationalism.

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
Many of the existing Greek prologues may be later in date than the plays they illustrate, or may contain large interpolations. On the Latin stage the prologue was often more elaborate than it was in Athens, and in the careful composition of the poems which [[Plautus]] prefixes to his plays we see what importance he gave to this portion of the entertainment; sometimes, as in the preface to the ''[[Rudens]]'', Plautus rises to the height of his genius in his adroit and romantic prologues, usually placed in the mouths of persons who make no appearance in the play itself.

[[Molière]] revived the Plautian prologue in the introduction to his ''[[Amphitryon (Molière)|Amphitryon]]''. [[Jean Racine|Racine]] introduced Piety as the speaker of a prologue which opened his choral tragedy of [[Esther]].

The tradition of the ancients vividly affected our own early dramatists. Not only were the [[mystery play]]s and miracles of the [[Middle Ages]] begun by a [[homily]], but when the drama in its modern sense was inaugurated in the reign of Elizabeth, the prologue came with it, directly adapted from the practice of Euripides and [[Terence]]. [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Sackville, Lord Buckhurst]], prepared a sort of prologue in dumb show for his ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'' of 1562; and he also wrote a famous [[Induction (play)|Induction]], which is, practically, a prologue, to a [[miscellany]] of short romantic epics by diverse hands.

==Elizabethan==

Prologues of Renaissance drama often served a specific function of transition and clarification for the audience. A direct address made by one actor, the prologue acted as an appeal to the audience's attention and sympathy, providing historical context, a guide to themes of the play, and occasionally, a disclaimer &lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 17&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this mode, a prologue, like any scripted performance, would exist as the text, the actor who speaks that text, and the presentation of the language as it is spoken.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In ushering the audience from the reality into the world of the play, the prologue straddles boundaries between audience, actors, characters, playwrights--basically, it creates a distinction between the imaginary space within the play and the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Jonson]] has often been noted as using the prologue to remind the audience of the complexities between themselves and all aspects of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cave, Richard, Elizabeth Schafer and Brian Wooland, Ben Jonson and Theatre, 1999. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The actor reciting the prologue would appear dressed in black, a stark contrast to the elaborate costumes used during the play.&lt;ref&gt;White, Martin, Renaissance Drama in Action, 1998. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  The prologue removed his hat and wore no makeup.  He may have carried a book, scroll, or a placard displaying the title of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  He was introduced by three short trumpet calls, on the third of which he entered and took a position downstage.  He made three bows in the current fashion of the court, and then addressed the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;
The Elizabethan prologue was unique in incorporating aspects of both classical and medieval traditions.&lt;ref name="BrusterDouglas"&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In the classical tradition, the prologue conformed to one of four subgenres: the ''sustatikos'', which recommends either the play or the poet; the ''epitimetikos'', in which a curse is given against a rival, or thanks given to the audience; ''dramatikos'', in which the plot of the play is explained; and mixtos, which contains all of these things.&lt;ref name="BrusterDouglas" /&gt;  In the medieval tradition, expressions of morality and modesty are seen,&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 14&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a meta-theatrical self-consciousness, and an unabashed awareness of the financial contract engaged upon by paid actors and playwrights, and a paying audience.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2009. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in fiction==
Prologues have long been used in non-dramatic fiction, since at least the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hXCi_DViuqwC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=prologue&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1 Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although Chaucer had prologues to many of the tales, rather than one at the front of the book.

[[File:Charlemagne-by-Durer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charlemagne]] holds a sword in his proper right hand, on the "viewer's left", and an [[Globus cruciger|orb]] in his proper left hand.]] 
[[File:Orestes (1848).jpg|thumb|Statue holding a sword in its proper right hand]]
'''Proper right''' and '''proper left''' are conceptual terms used to unambiguously convey [[relative direction]] when describing an image or other object. The "proper right" hand of a figure is the hand that would be regarded by that figure as its right hand.&lt;ref&gt;"For figurative works, use the abbreviations PR (proper right) and PL (proper left) to indicate the right or left side of the statue from the perspective of the statue (i.e., your right or left side if you were positioned on the base facing in the same direction as the statue)" - p. 34, [http://www.heritagepreservation.org/PDFS/SOSvolunteerHandboook.pdf Save Outdoor Sculpture! Volunteer Handbook]. ("Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!) is a joint project of the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, and the National Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Property").&lt;/ref&gt; In a frontal representation, that appears on the left as the viewer sees it, creating the potential for ambiguity if the hand is just described as the "right hand".

The terms are mainly used in discussing images of humans, whether in [[art history]], medical contexts such as [[x-ray]] images, or elsewhere, but they can be used in describing any object that has an unambiguous front and back (for example [[furniture]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gNN1vgkxzicC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=%22proper+right%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vw6iUuHRPKrm7Ab4moHYCA&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proper%20right%22&amp;f=false ''The Furniture of John Shearer, 1790-1820: 'A True North Britain' in the Southern Backcountry'']&lt;/ref&gt;) or,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RELAWM00539/ though see this somewhat puzzling example], which appears just to refer to the specific image, with the side shown the "front".&lt;/ref&gt; when describing things that move or change position, with reference to the original position. However a more restricted use may be preferred, and the internal instructions for cataloguing objects in the "Inventory of American Sculpture" at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] say that "The terms "proper right" and "proper left" should be used when describing figures only".&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/research/programs/inventory/report_form_guidelines.pdf Smithsonian American Art Museum], "Inventorying" section.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[heraldry]], right and left is always used in the meaning of proper right and proper left, as for the imaginary bearer of a coat of arms; to avoid confusion, the Latin terms [[dexter and sinister]] are often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bedingfeld|first1= Henry|author1-link= Henry Bedingfeld|last2= Gwynn-Jones|first2= Peter|author2-link= Peter Gwynn-Jones|page= 42|title= Heraldry|year= 1993|location= Leicester|publisher= Magna Books|isbn= 1-85422-433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative is to use language that makes it clear that the viewer's perspective is being used. The swords in the illustrations might be described as: "to the left as the viewer sees it", "at the view's left", "at the viewer's left", and so on.  However these formulations do not work for freestanding sculpture in the round, where the viewer might be at any position around the sculpture.  A British 19th-century manual for military drill contrasts "proper left" with "present left" when discussing the orientation of formations performing intricate movements on a parade ground, "proper" meaning the orientraion at the start of the drill.&lt;ref&gt;''Brigade drill, as established by order in the Field exercise and evolutions of infantry, as revised in 1859. With remarks and references, by W.N. Hutchinson'', 1860, War Office, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UU4BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22proper+right%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vw6iUuHRPKrm7Ab4moHYCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proper%20right%22&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms are analogous to the nautical [[port and starboard]], where "port" is to a watercraft as "proper left" is to a sculpture, and they are used for essentially the same reason. Their use obviates the need for potentially ambiguous language such as "my right," "your left," and so on, by expressing the direction in a manner that holds true regardless of the relative orientations of the object and observer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17900 The origins of 'port' and 'starboard'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025011852/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17900 |date=2007-10-25 }} at the UK [[National Maritime Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is [[stage right]] and left in the theatre, which uses the actor's orientation, "stage right" equating to the audience's "house left".

'''Reality mining''' is the collection and analysis of machine-sensed environmental data pertaining to human social [[behavior]], with the goal of identifying predictable patterns of behavior. In 2008, ''MIT Technology Review'' called it one of the "10 technologies most likely to change the way we live."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?ch=specialsections&amp;sc=emerging08&amp;id=20247 "TR10: Reality Mining", ''Technology Review Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Reality mining studies human interactions based on the usage of wireless devices such as [[mobile phones]] and GPS systems providing a more accurate picture of what people do, where they go, and with whom they communicate with rather than from more subjective sources such as a person's own account. Reality mining is one aspect of [[digital footprint]] analysis.&lt;ref name=businessweek-gold&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2008/tc20080323_387127.htm "There's Gold in 'Reality Mining{{'"}}, BusinessWeek 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reality Mining'' is using [[Big data|Big Data]] to conduct research and analyze how people interact with technology everyday to build systems that allow for positive change from the individual to the global community. Reality Mining also deals with ''[[data exhaust]] .''

== Individual Scale (1 person) ==

Individuals use mobile phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, and any device connected to the internet for a variety of purposes, therefore creating a variety of data from GPS locations to frequently asked questions on Google. Mobile phones carry so much data about the individual that now phones can suggest restaurants based on our searches, visited places, book preference, and even guess the ends of sentences we type. A simple application of Reality Mining is listening to voices and understanding speech patterns to diagnose medical problems such as the simple flu to even early onset Parkinson's. More powerful phones also allow for calendar customization and event tracking which display behaviors within individuals, what is deemed important enough to track. Social websites also allow researchers to view snapshots of a person's life by following status updates on FaceBook or tweets from Twitter. Even more specific, a recent app called Snapchat allows users to post videos, pictures, or even live streams of exactly what they're doing when they're doing it, strong indicators of behaviors and interactions with the world. In 2004, MIT conducted the Reality Mining Project which gave 100 MIT students a Nokia 6600 which was tracked in a variety of ways by the researchers. The Cell Tower ID #'s (a very cheap and unobtrusive way to measure location), the status of the phone (charging or idle), and any use of the phone's applications (games, web surfing, etc...). They found that by collecting this kind of data, they could predict with high accuracy the behaviors of the students, for example, if one of the students woke up on a Saturday morning at 10 AM, the researches could predict what they were going to do that day using "eigenbehaviors". This new way of understanding data opened up doors for new research and possibly even larger survey research with detailed and accurate statistics. There are hundreds of websites offering software for mobile phones that will track just about everything the phone does, useful for worried parents or people who want to increase their personal productivity. This data is then uploaded to a server and can be accessed at any time.

Although already a lot of data can be collected from personal devices, they only make up a part of a person's life. Reality Miners can also use biometric devices to measure physical health and activity. There are many devices like this such as the Fitbit, Nike+, and Polar and Garmin GPS watches. There is even an app called Sleep Cycle for iPhone and Android users that measures sleep quality, which includes the amount of sleep and even optimal alarms settings. Using this data, Reality Miners may be able to measure one's actual health and processes that allow us to function (or dysfunction). Heart attacks generally don't have any longitudinal indicators, but using all this data or even when a person engages in Lifelogging can create date useful to the medical field and track the lifestyles of those who undergo heart attacks to then create preventative guidelines. There are several ways to start Lifelogging, for instance Google has its own device called Google Glass that has a Heads-Up-Display (HUD), a microphone, a processor, and a camera. These are all ways to log information in specific directories.

== Community Scale (10 to 1,000 people) ==

The way researchers have started to observe and record behaviors in large groups was by using [[Rfid tag|RFID badges]]. Data is also recorded in work places using Knowledge Management Systems that try to improve worker productivity and efficiency, although a short-coming of this is the inability to converge the social and technological cultures of the work place, therefore providing incomplete behavioral data. Another way to measure larger groups of people in a community is through conference attendance. This data allows researchers to know where participants are from, ethnic demographics, and the actual number of people attending the event. Some conferences use smart-badges with more functions than the standard RFID badges. Companies like Microsoft and IBM have used them to record the number of people they interact with during the conference and allow people to answer survey questions. The smart-badges also record vocal interactions and when attendees are at certain booths and can even alert booth workers when certain profiles enter within a certain range of the booth. Smart-badges have obvious advantages for gathering data for reality miners. In 2009, a company called nTag, which was then acquired by Alliance Technology used nTag technology which allows for users to even be notified who to talk to and it's able to exchange business cards electronically. 
Another type of data reality miners are looking are climate and environmental information. They collect data from neighborhoods by employing air-quality sensors which records [[carbon dioxide]] and nitrogen oxides as well as the general climate. Information like this could help policy makers decide whether to act or not or to see progress. Another way to collect data about the surrounding is through Project Noah. Project Noah was an effort to collect data on types of plant species by geotagging pictures of plants and fungi people upload, allowing users to see the kind of ecosystems users live in. This helps schools and students who want to collect data for projects, but also for bird-watchers to know what kind of birds are in the area.

== City Scale (1,000 to 1,000,000 people) ==

In general terms for this section, a city is defined  by 1,000 to 1,000,000 people. One way data is collected on a city scale is through collecting data on traffic with traffic signals and speed cameras. Data can also be collected from police reports and road scanners as well as GPS from mobile applications. Using this kind of traffic data, cities can create routes that would best allow for efficient movement and flow of traffic. A company called Inrix, started in 2010, has been compiling data on traffic and buys data from bridge operators and other transportation systems. It uses this data to predict traffic routes and time of congestion. Another way traffic can be monitored is through bluetooth technology, which is a technology that Inrix does not consider. The University of Maryland completed a project in 2012 that demonstrated that two Bluetooth sensors permanently placed two miles apart could accurately detect traffic speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catt.umd.edu/sites/default/files/documents/UMD-BT-Brochure_REV3.pdf BLUETOOTH TRAFFIC MONITORING TECHNOLOGY - UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND – CENTER FOR ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagle|first1=Nathan|last2=Green|first2=Kate|title=Reality Mining : Using Big Data to Engineer a Better World|journal=The MIT Press|date=August 2014|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of this combined can be created to make route-suggestion algorithms to help people get to and from places in an efficient matter that, additionally, the route can update itself in real time using these type of sensors and information. Notable start-up, now a subsidiary of google, [[Waze]], which also collected data from users (anonymously) who reported accidents and this game them in-app currencies and rewards. 
For crime on the city scale, the first way to collect and view data is through historical research of previous reports within any area. Now, more complex algorithms automatically place officers in places of high crime rates before any actual crime has been committed. Since 2005, the Memphis Police Department has been using a program called Blue CRUSH (Criminal Reduction Utilization Statistical History) which uses the police reports and uses heat maps to distinguish between high and low areas of crime. This program updates itself weekly and allows to the police department to change tactics accordingly. Using this kind of data will allow police departments to interact with the society in a much more meaningful way, also allowing preventative work to be done rather than rehabilitative work.

== National Scale (1,000,000 to 100,000,000 people) ==

On the national scale, government play a much larger role. Census data are by far the easiest to acquire. Many nations make their census findings public via websites from which data can be downloaded and visualized for further analysis. "In addition, the World Bank conducts international surveys and compiles census data from all participating nations— a sort of one-stop shop for information on its member countries. These data are publicly accessible: they can be downloaded and independently sorted and analyzed. Importantly, the World Bank offers an open API that allows programmers to integrate various data into software applications. Using World Bank data, Google has integrated a simple visualization tool into its search results; a search query on the population of Botswana will pull up the number, the dated World Bank source, and a graph showing population change over decades".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagle|first1=Nathan|last2=Green|first2=Kate|title=Reality Mining : Using Big Data to Engineer a Better World|journal=The MIT Press|date=August 2014|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to collect data is through [[call data record]] (or call detail record) which is just a log of phone calls and texts with information such as time and location of both the caller or sender and the recipient. CDR's allow phone companies to view human mobility trends. Major data companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter also allow researchers to track cultural trends and even the when/where of the allocation of resources in time of natural disasters.

== Global Scale (100,000,000 to 7,000,000,000 people) ==

The biggest worry for the world is the spread of disease and is one of reality mining's best applications. With globalization, the ability to travel is unprecedented compared to previous histories. The United Nations has created an agenda called the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) which are eight goals that aim to improve the world. They collect population data, the first step to allowing for policy making on disease control, nations must first collect data on air travel as billions of people travel by air each year and sea travel. Air travel carries more people each year than sea shipments, but the primary reason for collecting data on shipments is that shipments often carry pests that carry diseases, food-borne illnesses, and sometimes invasive species of plant and animal. 
The idea of managing and collecting seems monumental, but the World Bank has already started which helps statistical software like MAPS which stands for Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics. MAPS aims to complete six objectives, which include these three;
* Planning statistical systems and preparing national statistical development strategies for all low-income countries
* Ensuring full participation of developing countries
* Setting up the International Household Survey Network, a global collection of household-based socioeconomic data sets
For people traveling on flights, a source of data is the International Air Transportation Association (IATA) which has been collecting data on about 90% of global air traffic on a monthly basis since 2000. This data allowed researchers and professionals to view the ability of disease to spread from certain location on Earth. Ships carry about 90% of global trade; in 2001, the Automatic Identification system was implemented to record the "comings and goings of sea traffic".

&lt;/score&gt;|width=210|caption=Repeat signs around the second note}}In [[music]], a '''repeat sign''' is a [[Musical notation|sign]] that indicates a section should be [[repetition (music)|repeated]]. If the piece has one repeat sign alone, then that means to repeat from the beginning, and then continue on (or stop, if the sign appears at the end of the piece). A corresponding sign facing the other way indicates where the repeat is to begin. These are similar to the instructions [[da capo]] and [[dal segno]].

{{Quote|Repeat. ''Wiederholungszeichen'' (''Ger.'') A sign that a movement or part of a movement is to be twice performed. That which is to be repeated is generally included within the sign of two or four dots in the spaces...When the performer does not, on repeating, go so far as the last dot-sign, but finishes at a previous cadence, it is usual to write over the repeat, Da Capo, placing a pause and ''fine'' over the chord at which the performer is to stop. If the signs of the repeat do not coincide with a well-defined portion of a movement the sign &amp;#x1D10B; is sometimes added.&lt;ref&gt;Stainer, John and Barrett, William Alexander (1898).

&lt;/score&gt;|width=290|caption=Repeat sign with first and second endings}}When a repeat calls for a different ending, numbered brackets above the bars indicate which to play the first time ('''1.'''), which to play the second time ('''2.'''), and so on if necessary. These are called "first-time bars" and "second-time bars", or "first and second endings". They are also known as "[[wikt:volta#Italian|volta]] brackets" and have no limit to how many there can be.

==In Unicode==
In [[Unicode]], repeat signs are part of the [[Musical Symbols (Unicode block)|Musical Symbols]] and are coded as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf PDF of Musical Symbols block from the unicode consortium]&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

==Other notation==
When only standard  keyboard characters are available, the [[punctuation]] marks [[vertical bar]] and [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] are used to represent repeat signs: &lt;code&gt;|: ... :|&lt;/code&gt;

In [[Gregorian chant]], a repeat is indicated by a [[Roman numeral]] following a section. This is common particularly in a [[Kyrie]], where the lines followed by "iii" or "iij" are to be sung three times (corresponding to the correct liturgical form).

In [[shape-note]] singing, repeat signs usually have four dots, between each line of the staff. The corresponding sign to show where the repeat is from is either the same sign reversed (if it is at the beginning of a bar), or the dots themselves (if it is in the middle of a bar). First and second endings are given with just the numbers above the corresponding bars. Repeats notated at the beginning of a verse, or given with multiple lines of text per verse, are generally required; the repeats given for most songs of the final few lines are optional, and almost always used only for the final verse sung.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5016">'''SQRRR''' or '''SQ3R''' is a [[reading comprehension]] method named for its five steps: '''survey, question, read, recite, and review'''. The method was introduced by [[Francis P. Robinson]], an American education philosopher in his 1946 book ''Effective Study''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The method offers a more efficient and active approach to reading textbook material.{{cn|date=February 2018}} It was created for college students, but is extremely useful for young students as well.

== Process ==
#Survey
#:The first step, survey or [[Speed_reading#Skimming_and_scanning|skim]], advises that one should resist the temptation to read the book and instead first go through a chapter and note headings, sub-headings and other outstanding features, such as figures, tables, and summary paragraphs. This survey step only takes 3–5 minutes, but it provides an outline or framework for what will be presented. The reader should identify ideas and formulate questions about the content of the chapter.
#Question
#:[[Inquiry-based learning|Generate questions]] about the content of the reading. For example, convert headings and sub-headings into questions, and then look for answers in the content of the text. Other more general questions may also be formulated:
#:* ''What is this chapter about?
#:* ''What question is this chapter trying to answer?''
#:* ''How does this information help me?''
#:* The Question step again only takes 3–5 minutes to complete, but it will motivate the reader to seek answers to the questions.
#Read (R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)
#:Use the background work done with "S" and "Q" in order to begin reading actively. This means reading in order to answer the questions raised under "Q". Passive reading, in contrast, results in merely reading without engaging with the study material.
#Recite (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
#:The second "R" refers to the part known as "Recite." The reader should try to retrieve from memory what was learned in the same manner as telling someone else about the information. It is important that the reader use his/her own words in order to formulate and conceptualize the material. Try recalling and identifying major points (heading/subheadings) and answers to questions from the "Q" step. This recital step may be done either in an oral or written format and is related to the benefits of retrieval ([[testing effect]]) in boosting long-term memory for the material.
#Review (R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
#:The final "R" is "Review." Once you reach the end of the passage, say back to yourself what the point of the whole passage is – again, using your own words. You may then repeat the process on the second set of questions. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat/new-sat-tips-planning/sat-reading-test-strategies/a/sat-active-reading-strategies-part-1-sq3r&lt;/ref&gt;

== Six stages of effective comprehension ==
Best's process of effective comprehension suggests six stages for better understanding a topic while in a learning process.

*Knowing vs Understanding what the passage says (Fact finding vs Making meaning with [[time management]]).
*Reflecting (Bringing the information to life in your own words to personalize and consolidate).
*Interpersonal understanding (Checking whether the reader understood the topic e.g. Explaining the idea to someone, doing seminars...etc.)
*Intrapersonal understanding (Finding personal significance (interpret, compare &amp; conclude tentatively) of the topic in real world aspects)
*Visualisation (Tony Buzan's [[Mind Map]]ping)
*[[Mindfulness]] and [[Acceptance]]

'''''Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society''''' ({{ISBN|0-674-79291-2}}) is an influential book by [[Bruno Latour]]. The English edition was published in 1987 by [[Harvard University Press]]. It is written in a textbook style, and contains a full-featured approach to the empirical study of science and technology. Moreover, it also entertains ontological conceptions and theoretical discussions making it a research monograph and not a methodological handbook per se.

In the first chapter Latour develops the methodological dictum that science and technology must be studied "in action", or "in the making". Because scientific discoveries turn esoteric and difficult to understand, it has to be studied where discoveries are made in practice. For example, Latour turns back time in the case of the discovery of the "double helix". Going back in time, deconstructing statements, machines and articles, it is possible to arrive at a point where scientific discovery could have chosen to take many other directions (contingency). Also the concept of "black box" is introduced. A black box is a metaphor borrowed from cybernetics denoting a piece of machinery that "runs by itself". That is, when a series of instructions are too complicated to be repeated all the time, a black box is drawn around it, allowing it to function only by giving it "input" and "output" data. For example, a CPU inside a computer is a black box. Its inner complexity doesn't have to be known; one only needs to use it in his/her daily activities.
&lt;!-- To do: Summarize the following chapters in science in action. --&gt;

==Criticism==
Latour's work, including ''Science in Action'', has received heavy criticism from some scholars.  Olga Amsterdamska's highly critical book review concluded with the following sentence: "Somehow, the ideal of a social science whose only goal is to tell inconsistent, false, and incoherent stories about nothing in particular does not strike me as very appealing or sufficiently ambitious."&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdamska, Olga.  Surely You Are Joking, Monsieur Latour!  Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, Vol. 15 No. 4, Fall 1990 495-504.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the journal|Sociology of Education (journal)}}
The '''sociology of education''' is the study of how public [[institution]]s and individual experiences affect [[education]] and its outcomes. It is mostly concerned with the public schooling systems of modern industrial societies, including the expansion of [[higher education|higher]], [[further education|further]], [[adult education|adult]], and [[continuing education|continuing]] education.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Gordon Marshall (ed) ''A Dictionary of Sociology'' (Article: Sociology of Education), Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is seen as a fundamentally [[optimistic]] human endeavour characterised by [[Hope|aspiration]]s for [[Social progress|progress]] and betterment.&lt;ref name="schofield"&gt;Schofield, K. (1999). [http://www.aspa.asn.au/Papers/eqfinalc.PDF ''The Purposes of Education, Queensland State Education: 2010''] Accessed 2002, Oct 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood by many to be a means of overcoming handicaps, achieving greater [[Social equality|equality]], and acquiring wealth and [[social status]].&lt;ref name="Sargent"&gt;Sargent, M. (1994) ''The New Sociology for Australians'' (3rd ed.), Longman Cheshire, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; Education is perceived as a place where children can develop according to their unique needs and potential.&lt;ref name="schofield"/&gt; It is also perceived as one of the best means of achieving greater social equality.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; Many would say that the purpose of education should be to develop every individual to their full potential, and give them a chance to achieve as much in life as their natural abilities allow ([[meritocracy]]). Few would argue that any education system accomplishes this goal perfectly.  Some take a particularly critical view, arguing that the education system is designed with the intention of causing the [[social reproduction]] of inequality.

== Foundations ==
Systematic [[sociology]] of [[education]] began with the work of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) on moral education as a basis for [[organic solidarity]], and with studies by [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) on the [[Mandarin Chinese|Chinese literati]] as an instrument of political control. After [[World War II]], however, the subject received renewed interest around the world: from technological [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] in the US, egalitarian reform of opportunity in Europe, and [[human capital|human-capital]] theory in economics. These all implied that, with [[industrialization]], the need for a technologically skilled labour force  undermines [[social class|class]] distinctions and other ascriptive systems of stratification, and that education promotes [[social mobility]]. However, statistical and field research across numerous societies showed a persistent link between an individual's social class and achievement, and suggested that education could only achieve limited social mobility.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; Sociological studies showed how schooling patterns reflected, rather than challenged, class stratification and racial and sexual discrimination.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; After the general collapse of [[structural functionalism|functionalism]] from the late 1960s onwards, the idea of education as an unmitigated good was even more profoundly challenged. [[Neo-Marxists]] argued that school education simply produced a docile labour force essential to [[Late capitalism|late-capitalist]] class relations.

== Theoretical perspectives ==
The sociology of education contains a number of theories. Some of the main theories are presented below.

=== Political arithmetic ===
The Political Arithmetic tradition within the sociology of education began with Hogben (1938)&lt;ref&gt;Hogben, L.

(2000) The Political Arithmetic Tradition in the Sociology of Education, Oxford Review of Education 26(3-4): 313-331.&lt;/ref&gt; Important works in this tradition have been (Glass 1954),&lt;ref&gt;Glass, D. V. (1954) Social Mobility in Britain, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; (Floud, et al. 1956)&lt;ref&gt;Floud, J., Halsey, A. H. and Martin, F. (1956) Social class and educational opportunity: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; and (Halsey, et al. 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, A. H., Heath, A. F. and Ridge, J. M. (1980) Origins and destinations : family, class, and education in modern Britain, Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; All of these works were concerned with the way in which school structures were implicated in social class inequalities in Britain. More recent work in this tradition has broadened its focus to include gender,&lt;ref&gt;Gorard, S., Salisbury, J. and Rees, G. (1999) Reappraising the apparent underachievement of boys at school, Gender and Education 11(4): 441-454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A., Heath, A. F. and Rothon, C. (2011) Equalisation or inflation? Social class and gender differentials in England and Wales, Oxford Review of Education 37(2): 215-240.&lt;/ref&gt; ethnic differentials &lt;ref&gt;Heath, A. F. and Cheung, S.-Y. (eds) (2007) Unequal Chances: ethnic minoroties in western labour markets, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and international differences.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, A. F. and Sullivan, A. (2011) Introduction: The democratisation of upper-secondary education?, Oxford Review of Education 37(2): 123-138.&lt;/ref&gt;  While researchers in this tradition have engaged with sociological theories such as Rational Choice Theory &lt;ref&gt;Breen, R. and Goldthorpe, J. (1997) Explaining Educational Differentials: Towards a Rational Action Theory, Rationality and Society 9(3): 275-305.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cultural Reproduction Theory,&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A. (2001) Cultural Capital and Educational Attainment, Sociology 35(4): 893-912.&lt;/ref&gt;  the political arithmetic tradition has tended to remain rather sceptical of 'grand theory' and very much concerned with empirical evidence and social policy. The political arithmetic tradition was attacked by the 'New Sociology of Education' of the 1970s &lt;ref&gt;M. F. D. Young (ed) Knowledge and Control: New Directions for the Sociology of Education, London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; which rejected quantitative research methods. This heralded a period of methodological division within the sociology of education. However, the political arithmetic tradition, while rooted in quantitative methods, has increasingly engaged with mixed methods approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Ogg, T., Zimdars, A. and Heath, A. F. (2009) Schooling effects on degree performance: a comparison of the predictive validity of aptitude testing and secondary school grades at Oxford University, British Educational Research Journal 35(5): 781-807.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural functionalism ===
[[Structural functionalism|Structural functionalists]] believe that society leans towards [[social equilibrium]] and social order. They see society like a human body, in which institutions such as education are like important organs that keep the society/body healthy and well.&lt;ref name="Bessant"&gt;Bessant, J. and Watts, R. (2002) ''Sociology Australia'' (2nd ed), Allen &amp; Unwin, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

====Socialization====

Social health means the same as social order, and is guaranteed when nearly everyone accepts the general moral [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] of their society. Hence structural functionalists believe the aim of key institutions, such as education, is to socialize children and teenagers. [[Socialization]] is the process by which the new generation learns the knowledge, attitudes and values that they will need as productive [[citizens]]. Although this aim is stated in the formal curriculum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au NSW Board of Studies, ''K-6 HSIE Syllabus (NSW Australia)'']&lt;/ref&gt; it is mainly achieved through the [[hidden curriculum]],&lt;ref name="harper"&gt;Harper, G. (1997) "Society, culture, socialization and the individual" in Stafford, C. and Furze, B. (eds) ''Society and Change'' (2nd ed), Macmillan Education Australia, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; a subtler, but nonetheless powerful, [[indoctrination]] of the [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and values of the wider society. Students learn these values because their behavior at school is regulated ([[Durkheim]] in &lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt;) until they gradually internalize and accept them.

====Filling roles in society====

Education must also perform another function: As various jobs become vacant, they must be filled with the appropriate people. Therefore, the other purpose of education is to sort and rank individuals for placement in the labor market [Munro, 1997]. Those with high achievement will be trained for the most important jobs and in reward, be given the highest incomes. Those who achieve the least, will be given the least demanding (intellectually at any rate, if not physically) jobs, and hence the least income.

According to Sennet and Cobb however, "to believe that ability alone decides who is rewarded is to be deceived".&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; Meighan agrees, stating that large numbers of capable students from working-class backgrounds fail to achieve satisfactory standards in school and therefore fail to obtain the status they deserve.&lt;ref name="meighan 1997"&gt;Meighan, R. &amp; Siraj-Blatchford, I. (1997) ''A Sociology of Educating'' (3rd Ed), Cassell, London&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob believes this is because the middle class cultural experiences that are provided at school may be contrary to the experiences working-class children receive at home.&lt;ref name="jacob"&gt;Jacob, A. (2001) ''Research links poverty and literacy'', ABC Radio Transcript [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s433501.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, [[working class]] children are not adequately prepared to cope at school. They are therefore "cooled out"&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;Foster, L. E. (1987) ''Australian Education: A Sociological Perspective''(2nd Ed),  Prentice Hall, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; from school with the least qualifications, hence they get the least desirable jobs, and so remain working class. Sargent confirms this cycle, arguing that schooling supports continuity, which in turn supports [[social order]].&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; [[Talcott Parsons]] believed that this process, whereby some students were identified and [[label]]led educational failures, "was a necessary activity which one part of the social system, education, performed for the whole".&lt;ref name="meighan 1997"/&gt; Yet the structural functionalist perspective maintains that this social order, this [[Social change|continuity]], is what most people desire.&lt;ref name="Bessant"/&gt;

=== Education and social reproduction ===
The perspective of [[conflict theory]], contrary to the structural functionalist perspective, believes that society is full of vying social groups with different aspirations, different access to life chances and gain different social rewards.&lt;ref name=furze&gt;Furze, B. and Healy, P. (1997) "Understanding society and change" in Stafford, C. and Furze, B. (eds) ''Society and Change'' (2nd Ed), Macmillan Education Australia, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt;  Relations in society, in this view, are mainly based on [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[oppression]], domination and [[Insubordination|subordination]].&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Connell&gt;Connell, R. W. and White, V., (1989) 'Child poverty and educational action' in Edgar, D., Keane, D. &amp; McDonald, P. (eds), ''Child Poverty'', Allen &amp; Unwin, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;  Many teachers assume that students will have particular middle class experiences at home, and for some children this assumption isn't necessarily true.&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt; Some children are expected to help their parents after school and carry considerable domestic responsibilities in their often single-parent home.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, B. and Wyn, J. (1987) ''Shaping Futures: Youth Action for Livelihood'', Allen &amp; Unwin, Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt; The demands of this domestic labour often make it difficult for them to find time to do all their homework and thus affects their academic performance.

Where teachers have softened the formality of regular study and integrated student's preferred working methods into the curriculum, they noted that particular students displayed strengths they had not been aware of before.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; However few teachers deviate from the traditional [[curriculum]], and the curriculum conveys what constitutes knowledge as determined by the [[State (polity)|state]] - and those in power [Young in &lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt;]. This knowledge isn't very meaningful to many of the students, who see it as pointless.&lt;ref name="jacob"/&gt; Wilson &amp; Wyn state that the students realise there is little or no direct link between the subjects they are doing and their perceived future in the labour market.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Anti-school values displayed by these children are often derived from their consciousness of their real interests. Sargent believes that for working-class students, striving to succeed and absorbing the school's middle class values, are accepting their inferior social position as much as if they were determined to fail.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; Fitzgerald states that "irrespective of their academic ability or desire to learn, students from poor families have relatively little chance of securing success".&lt;ref name=henry&gt;Henry, M., Knight, J., Lingard, R. and Taylor, S. (1988) ''Understanding Schooling: An Introductory Sociology of Australian Education'', Routledge, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, for middle and especially upper-class children, maintaining their superior position in society requires little effort. The federal government subsidises 'independent' private schools enabling the rich to obtain 'good education' by paying for it.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; With this 'good education', rich children perform better, achieve higher and obtain greater rewards. In this way, the continuation of privilege and wealth for the [[elite]] is made possible ''in continuum''.

Conflict theorists believe this [[social reproduction]] continues to occur because the whole education system is overlain with [[ideology]] provided by the dominant group. In effect, they perpetuate the [[myth]] that education is available to all to provide a means of achieving wealth and status. Anyone who fails to achieve this goal, according to the myth, has only themselves to blame.&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; Wright agrees, stating that "the effect of the myth is to…stop them from seeing that their personal troubles are part of major social issues".&lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt; The duplicity is so successful that many parents endure appalling jobs for many years, believing that this sacrifice will enable their children to have opportunities in life that they did not have themselves.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; These people who are poor and disadvantaged are victims of a societal [[confidence trick]]. They have been encouraged to believe that a major goal of schooling is to strengthen equality while, in reality, schools reflect society's intention to maintain the previous unequal distribution of status and power [Fitzgerald, cited in &lt;ref name="Sargent"/&gt;].

This perspective has been criticised as [[determinist]]ic and pessimistic, while there is some evidence for [[social mobility]] among disadvantaged students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kislev|first=E.|date=2016-05-01|title=The effect of education policies on higher-education attainment of immigrants in Western Europe: A cross-classified multilevel analysis|url=http://esp.sagepub.com/content/26/2/183.short|journal=Journal of European Social Policy|volume=26|issue=2|pages=183–199|doi=10.1177/0958928716637142|issn=0958-9287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be recognised however that it is a model, an aspect of reality which is an important part of the picture.

=== Structure and agency ===

==== Bourdieu and cultural capital ====
This theory of [[social reproduction]] has been significantly theorised by [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. However Bourdieu as a social theorist has always been concerned with the dichotomy between the objective and subjective, or to put it another way, between [[structure and agency]]. Bourdieu has therefore built his theoretical framework around the important concepts of [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]], field and [[cultural capital]]. These concepts are based on the idea that objective structures determine individuals' chances, through the mechanism of the habitus, where individuals internalise these structures. However, the habitus is also formed by, for example, an individual's position in various fields, their family and their everyday experiences. Therefore, one's class position does not determine one's life chances, although it does play an important part, alongside other factors.

Bourdieu used the idea of [[cultural capital]] to explore the differences in outcomes for students from different classes in the [[French educational system]]. He explored the tension between the conservative reproduction and the innovative production of knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name=harker&gt;Harker, R., (1990) "Education and Cultural Capital" in Harker, R., Mahar, C., &amp; Wilkes, C., (eds) (1990) ''An Introduction to the Work of Pierre Bourdieu: the practice of theory'', Macmillan Press, London&lt;/ref&gt; He found that this tension is intensified by considerations of which particular cultural past and present is to be conserved and reproduced in schools. Bourdieu argues that it is the culture of the dominant groups, and therefore their cultural capital, which is embodied in schools, and that this leads to social reproduction.&lt;ref name=harker/&gt;

The cultural capital of the dominant group, in the form of practices and relation to culture, is assumed by the school to be the natural and only proper type of cultural capital and is therefore legitimated. It demands "uniformly of all its students that they should have what it does not give" [Bourdieu &lt;ref name=swartz&gt;Swartz, D., "Pierre Bourdieu: The Cultural Transmission of Social Inequality" in Robbins, D., (2000) ''Pierre Bourdieu Volume II'', Sage Publications, London, pp.207-217&lt;/ref&gt;]. This legitimate cultural capital allows students who possess it to gain [[educational capital]] in the form of qualifications. Those lower-class students are therefore disadvantaged. To gain qualifications they must acquire legitimate cultural capital, by exchanging their own (usually working-class) cultural capital.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, R., (1984) "On Reproduction, Habitus and Education" in Robbins, D., (2000) ''Pierre Bourdieu Volume II'', Sage Publications, London, pp.164-176&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange is not a straightforward one, due to the class ethos of the lower-class students. Class ethos is described as the particular dispositions towards, and subjective expectations of, school and culture. It is in part determined by the objective chances of that class.&lt;ref name=gorder&gt;Gorder, K., (1980) "Understanding School Knowledge: a critical appraisal of Basil Bernstein and Pierre Bourdieu" in Robbins, D., (2000) ''Pierre Bourdieu Volume II'', Sage Publications, London, pp.218-233&lt;/ref&gt; This means that not only do children find success harder in school due to the fact that they must learn a new way of 'being', or relating to the world, and especially, a new way of relating to and using language, but they must also act against their instincts and expectations. The subjective expectations influenced by the objective structures found in the school, perpetuate social reproduction by encouraging less-privileged students to eliminate themselves from the system, so that fewer and fewer are to be found as one journeys through the levels of the system. The process of social reproduction is neither perfect nor complete,&lt;ref name=harker/&gt; but still, only a small number of less-privileged students achieve success. For the majority of these students who do succeed at school, they have had to internalise the values of the dominant classes and use them as their own, to the detriment of their original habitus and cultural values.'''

Therefore, Bourdieu's perspective reveals how objective structures play an important role in determining individual achievement in school, but allows for the exercise of an individual's agency to overcome these barriers, although this choice is not without its penalties.

'''Identity'''

Drawing on Bourdieu's ideas, Fuller (2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZuvAwAAQBAJ|title=Sociology, Gender and Educational Aspirations: Girls and Their Ambitions|last=Fuller|first=Carol|date=2009-02-10|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781441172822|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) adds to the theoretical understanding of structure and agency by considering how young people shape their educational identity and how this identity is often the result of messages reflected at them, for example, through grades, setting and gendered expectations. Social location is considered important but its role is complex. Her work considered the importance of understanding the ways that individuals identify within an academic discourse, a discourse that typically situates young people dichotomously; as those who will achieve and those that will not. Understanding the importance of areas such as self-efficacy, confidence and resilience in shaping educational identity at the level of agent and subsequently, educational attainment and aspirations, has been central to her most recent work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6121">'''Soil and Water Bioengineering''' is a discipline of [[civil engineering]]. It pursues technological, ecological, economic as well as design goals and seeks to achieve these primarily by making use of living materials, i.e. seeds, plants, part of plants and plant communities, and employing them in near–natural constructions while exploiting the manifold abilities inherent in plants.
Soil [[bioengineering]] may sometimes be a substitute for classical engineering works; however, in most cases it is a meaningful and necessary method of complementing the latter.
Its application suggests itself in all fields of soil and [[hydraulic engineering]], especially for [[slope stabilization|slope]] and embankment stabilization and [[erosion control]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiechtl, H. M. (Trans. N.K. Horstmann, 1980). Bioengineering for Land Reclamation and Conservation. University of Alberta Press. Edmonton. Alberta. 404 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil bioengineering is the use of living plant materials to provide some engineering function. Soil bioengineering is an effective tool for treatment of a variety of unstable and / or eroding sites. Soil bioengineering techniques have been used for many centuries. More recently Schiechtl (1980) has encouraged the use of soil bioengineering with a variety of European examples. Soil bioengineering is now widely practiced throughout the world for the treatment of erosion and unstable slopes.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, D.H. and A.T. Leiser. 1982. Biotechnical Slope Protection and Erosion Control. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc. Scarborough, Ontario, 271 pp. reprinted by Krieger Publishing Co. Malabar, Florida).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. and J. Hellin. 1996. Bio-engineering for Effective Road Maintenance in the Caribbean. Natural Resources Institute. The University of Greenwich. United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields of Application and Plants for Soil Bioengineering Control Works ==
Soil Bioengineering methods can be applied wherever the plants which are used as living building materials are able to grow well and develop.
This is the case in tropical, subtropical and [[temperate zone]]s whereas there are obvious limits in dry and cold regions, i.e. where arid, semi–arid and frost zones prevail. In exceptional cases, lack of water may be compensated for by watering or [[irrigation]].
In Europe, dry conditions limiting application exist in the Mediterranean as well as in some inner alpine and eastern European snowy regions. However, limits are most frequently imposed in alpine and arctic regions. These can usually be clearly noticed by the limited growth of woody plants ([[forest line|forest]], tree and shrub lines) and the upper limits of closed [[turf]] [[vegetative cover|cover]]. The more impoverished a region is in species, the less suited it is for the application of bioengineering methods.

== Functions and Effects of Soil Bioengineering Structures ==
===Technical functions===
*protection of soil surface from erosion by wind, precipitation, frost and flowing water
*protection from rock fall
*elimination or binding of destructive mechanical forces
*reduction of flow velocity along banks
*surface and/or deep soil cohesion and stabilization
*drainage
*protection from wind
*aiding the deposition of snow, drift sand and sediments
*increasing soil roughness and thus preventing avalanche release

Apart from these, ecological functions are gaining in importance, particularly as these can be fulfilled to a very limited extent only by classical engineering constructions.

===Ecological functions===
*improvement of water regime by improved soil interception and storage capability as well as water
*consumption by plants
*[[soil drainage]]
*protection from wind
*protection from ambient [[air pollution]]
*mechanical [[soil amelioration]] by the roots of plants
*balancing of temperature conditions in near–ground layers of air and in the soil
*[[shading]]
*improvement of nutrient content in the soil and thus of soil fertility on previously raw soils
*balancing of snow deposits
*[[noise protection]]
*yield increase on neighbouring cropland

===Landscaping functions===
*healing of wounds inflicted on the landscape by disasters and humans (exploitation of mineral resources, construction work, deposition of overburden, tunnel excavation material, industrial and domestic waste)
*integration of structures into the landscape
*concealment of offending structures
*enrichment of the landscape by creating new features and structures, shapes and colours of vegetation

===Economic effects===

Bioengineering control works are not always necessarily cheaper in construction when compared to classical engineering structures. However, when taking into account their lifetime including their service and maintenance, they will normally turn out to be more economical.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Their special advantages are:

*lower construction costs compared to “hard” constructions
*lower maintenance and rehabilitation costs
*creation of useful green areas and woody plant populations on previously derelict land
*Useful for income generation 
The result of soil bioengineering protection works are living systems which develop further and maintain their balance by natural succession (i.e. by dynamic self–control, without artificial input of energy). If the right living but also non–living building materials and the appropriate types of construction are chosen, exceptionally high sustainability requiring little maintenance effort can be achieved. &lt;ref&gt;Schiechtl, H.M. and R. Stem. 1996. Ground Bioengineering Techniques for Slope Protection and Erosion Control. Trans. By L. Jaklitsch. Blackwell Scientific. Oxford, U.K. 146 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schiechtl, H.M. and R.

{{About|the alleged poisoning|the [[Tito &amp; Tarantula]] album|Tarantism (album)}}
[[File:Lycosa Tarantula.jpg|thumb|''[[Lycosa tarantula]] carrying her offspring'']]
'''Tarantism''' is a form of [[hysteria|hysteric]] behaviour, popularly believed to result from the bite of the [[wolf spider]] ''[[Lycosa tarantula]]'' (distinct from the broad class of spiders also called [[tarantula]]s).
A better candidate cause is ''[[Latrodectus tredecimguttatus]]'', commonly known as the Mediterranean black widow or steppe spider, although no link between such bites and the behaviour of tarantism has ever been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1968), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term historically is used to refer to a [[dancing mania]] - characteristic of southern Italy - which likely had little to do with spider bites. The  [[tarantella]] dance supposedly evolved from this [[therapy]].

==History==
It was originally described in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; The condition was common in southern [[Italy]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. There were strong suggestions that there is no organic cause for the heightened excitability and [[anxiety|restlessness]] that gripped the victims. The stated belief of the time was that victims needed to engage in frenzied [[dancing]] to prevent [[death]] from tarantism. Supposedly a particular kind of dance, called the [[tarantella]], evolved from this [[therapy]]. A prime location for such outbursts was the church at [[Galatina]], particularly at the time of the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1968), pp. 173-4.&lt;/ref&gt; "The dancing is placed under the sign of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], whose chapel serves as a "theatre" for the tarantulees' public meetings. The spider seems constantly interchangeable with Saint Paul; the female tarantulees dress as "brides of Saint Paul".&lt;ref&gt;Hanna (2006) p. 29. See Anon (1968), ''passim'', for a more detailed description of this custom.&lt;/ref&gt; As a climax, "the tarantulees, after having danced for a long time, meet together in the chapel of Saint Paul and communally attain the paroxysm of their trance, ... the general and desperate agitation was dominated by the stylised cry of the tarantulees, the 'crisis cry', an ''ahiii'' uttered with various modulations".&lt;ref&gt;Rouget (1985) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antidotum tarantulae.jpg|thumb|''Antidotum tarantulae'', a curative musical score from Athanasius Kircher (c. 1660)]]
[[Francesco Cancellieri]], in his exhaustive treatise on Tarantism, takes note of semi-scientific, literary, and popular observations, both recent and ancient, giving each similar weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Cancellieri|first=Francesco|authorlink=Francesco Cancellieri|title=Lettera sopra il Tarantismo, l'aria di Roma, e della sua campagna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaVdAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=1817}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes a report that in August 1693, a doctor in Naples had himself bitten by two tarantulas with six witnesses and a notary, but did not suffer the dancing illness. Cancellieri in part attributes this illness not only to the spiders but to the locale, since Tarantism was mainly seen in [[Abruzzo]], [[Apulia]], and [[Calabria]]. He states:
{{quote|Quando uno è punto da questa mal augurata bestia, si fanno cento diverse mosse in un momento. Si piange, si balla, si vomita, si trema, si ride, s'impallidisce, si grida, si sviene, si soffre gran dolore, e finalmente dopo qualche giorno si muore, se uno non è soccorso. Il sudore, e gli antidoti sollevano l'ammalato; ma il sovrano, ed unico rimedio è la Musica
When one is in the hold of this ill-wished beast, one has a hundred different feelings at a time. One cries, dances, vomits, trembles, laughs, pales, cries, faints, and one will suffer great pain, and finally after a few days, if unaided, you die. Sweat and antidotes relieve the sick, but the sovereign and the only remedy is Music.{{sfn|Cancellieri|1817|p=6}}}}

He goes on to describe some specific observations of the malady, typically afflicting peasants, alone or in groups. The malady typically affected peasants on hot summer days, causing indolence. Then he describes how only treatment through dancing music could restore them to vitality; for example:
{{quote|[...] e trovammo il misero contadino oppresso da difficile respirazione, ed osservammo inoltre, che la faccia, e le mani erano incominciate a divenir nere. E perchè il suo male era a tutti noto, si portò la Chitarra, la cui armonìa subito, che da lui fu intesa, cominciò a mover prima li piedi, poco dipoi le gambe. Si reggeva appresso sulle ginocchia. Indi a poco intervallo s'alzò passenggiando. Finalmente fra lo spazio di un quarto d'ora saltava si, che si sollevava ben tre palmi da terra. Sospirava, ma con empito sì grande, che portava terrore a' circostanti; e prima d'un'ora se gli tolse il nero dalle mani, e dal viso, riacquistando il suo natio colore.
[...] and we found the poor peasant oppressed with difficult breathing, and we observed also that the face and hands had started to be become black. And 'cause his illness was known to all, a guitar was brought, whose harmony immediately that he was understood, began first moving the feet, legs shortly afterwards. He stood on his knees. Soon after an interval he arose swaying. Finally, in the space of a quarter of an hour he was leaping, nearly three palms from the ground. Sighed, but with such great impetus, that it terrorised bystanders, and before an hour, the black was gone from his hands and face, and he regained his native colour.{{sfn|Cancellieri|1817|p=11}}}}

==Interpretation and controversy==
John Crompton proposed that ancient [[Bacchanalia|Bacchanalian rites]] that had been suppressed by the [[Roman Senate]] in 186 BC went underground, reappearing under the guise of emergency therapy for bite victims.&lt;ref&gt;Crompton (1954), p. 56f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of tarantism is consistent with [[mass psychogenic illness]].

Although the popular belief persists that tarantism results from a spider bite, it remains scientifically unsubstantiated. Donaldson, Cavanagh, and Rankin (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that the actual cause or causes of tarantism remain unknown.

==Cultural references==
Many historical and cultural references are associated with this disease and the ensuing "cure" - the [[tarantella]]. It is, for example, a key image in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and the spell "Tarantallegra" from the [[Harry Potter]] series.{{fact|date=May 2014}} It was also mentioned in the novel 39 Clues: Superspecial Outbreak.

'''Technological momentum''' is a theory about the relationship between [[technology]] and [[society]] over time. The term, which is considered a fourth technological determinism variant,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Philosophy of Technology: From Technical Artefacts to Sociotechnical Systems|last=Vermaas|first=Peter|last2=Kroes|first2=Peter|last3=Franssen|first3=Maarten|last4=van de Poel|first4=Ibo|last5=Houkes|first5=Wybo|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781608455980|location=San Rafael, CA|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally developed by the [[history of technology|historian of technology]] [[Thomas P. Hughes]]. The idea is that relationship between technology and society is reciprocal and time-dependent so that one does not determine the changes in the other but both influence each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green Technology: An A-to-Z Guide|last=Mulvaney|first=Dustin|last2=Robbins|first2=Paul|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=9781412996921|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Hughes's thesis is a synthesis of two separate models for how technology and society interact. One, ''[[technological determinism]]'', claims that society itself is modified by the introduction of a new technology in an irreversible and irreparable way&amp;mdash;for example, the introduction of the [[automobile]] has influenced the manner in which [[United States of America|American]] cities are designed, a change that can clearly be seen when comparing the pre-automobile cities on the East Coast to the post-automobile cities on the West Coast. Technology, under this model, self-propagates as well&amp;mdash;there is no turning back once the adoption has taken place, and the very existence of the technology means that it will continue to exist in the future.

The other model, ''[[social determinism]]'', claims that society itself controls how a technology is used and developed&amp;mdash;for example, the rejection of [[nuclear power]] technology in the USA amid the public fears after the [[Three Mile Island]] incident.

''Technological momentum'' takes the two models and adds ''time'' as the unifying factor. In Hughes's theory, when a technology is young, deliberate control over its use and scope is possible and enacted by society. However, as a technology matures, and becomes increasingly enmeshed in the society where it was created, its own deterministic force takes hold, achieving technological momentum in the process. According to Hughes this inertia, which is particularly the case for large technological systems with their technological and social components, makes them difficult to influence and steer as they start to go more on their own way, assuming deterministic traits in the process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, Hughes's says that the relationship between technology and society always starts with a ''social determinism'' model, but evolves into a form of ''technological determinism'' over time and as its use becomes more prevalent and important.

Since its introduction by Hughes, the ''technological momentum'' concept has been applied by a number of other historians of technology.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Consuming Power: A Social History of American Energies'' (1998) by [[David E. Nye]]; "Technology and War: A Bibliographic Essay" by Alex Roland in ''Military Enterprise and Technological Change'' (1985), edited by Merritt Roe Smith; and ''Nuclear Fallacies: How We Have Been Misguided since Hiroshima'' (1985) by Robert W. Malcomson.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it is considered an effective approach to reconciling the apparently opposite perspectives of the autonomy of technology and the social and political motivations behind technological choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democratizing Technology: Andrew Feenberg's Critical Theory of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|last2=Cooper|first2=Simon|last3=Doppelt|first3=Gerlad|last4=Feenberg|first4=Andrew|last5=Glazebrook|first5=Trish|last6=Hickman|first6=Larry|last7=Light|first7=Andrew|last8=Stump|first8=David|last9=Thompson|first9=Paul|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2006|isbn=9780791469170|location=New York|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is able to describe how socially and politically conditioned technological institutions become independent and autonomous over time.

'''''The History of Human Marriage''''' is an 1891 book about the history of human marriage by the Finnish philosopher [[Edvard Westermarck]]. The work is a classic in its field.

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on a secondary source discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
''The History of Human Marriage'' is an overview of the world history of human marriage.&lt;ref name="Blakenhornpp910"&gt;[[#Bla07|Blankenhorn 2007]]. pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Westermarck argues that marriage is a social institution that rests on a biological foundation, and developed through a process in which human males came to live together with human females for sexual gratification, companionship, mutual economic aid, procreation, and the joint rearing of offspring.&lt;ref name="Blankenhornp37"&gt;[[#Bla07|Blankenhorn 2007]]. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly reception==
[[David Blankenhorn]] calls the book one of the best histories of human marriage, and considers it deservedly famous. He comments, however, that it leaves out a great deal of material while "skimming too quickly over too much."&lt;ref name="Blakenhornpp910" /&gt; Blankenhorn believes, however, that scholarship subsequent to Westermarck's has tended to support his conclusions.&lt;ref name="Blankenhornp37" /&gt;

The Finnish philosopher [[Jaakko Hintikka]] calls the work a monumental study and a classic in its field, but notes that it is now antiquated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hin95|Hintikka 2005]]. p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings''''' (1951)&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951;  2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257&lt;/ref&gt; is a reconstruction of the chronology of the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|kingdoms of Israel and Judah]] by [[Edwin R. Thiele]]. The book was originally his doctoral dissertation and is widely regarded as the definitive work on the chronology of [[History_of_ancient_Israel_and_Judah#Iron_Age_II_.281000.E2.80.93587.C2.A0BCE.29|Hebrew Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Thiele's chronology is accepted in several recent study Bibles, and is the chronology used for the Hebrew monarchs in the ''Cambridge Ancient History'' (T. C. Mitchell, "Israel and Judah until the Revolt of Jehu (931-841 B.C.)" ''CAH'' 3, Part 1, p. 445). Thiele's chronology with the slight modifications of Leslie McFall, ("A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles," ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 [1991], pp. 3-45) is accepted in Jack Finegan's influential ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'', rev. ed. (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1998), p. 249. See also, in the notes below, the list of scholars who accept his date for the beginning of the divided kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is considered the classic and comprehensive work in reckoning the accession of kings, calendars, and co-regencies, based on biblical and extra-biblical sources.

==Biblical chronology ==
The chronology of the kings of Israel and Judah rests primarily on a series of reign lengths and cross references within the books of Kings and Chronicles, in which the accession of each king is dated in terms of the reign of his contemporary in either the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] or the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], and fitting them into the chronology of other ancient civilizations.

However, some of the biblical cross references did not seem to match, so that a reign which is said to have lasted for 20 years results in a cross reference that would give a result of either 19 or 21 years. Thiele noticed that the cross references given during the long reign of King [[Asa of Judah]] had a cumulative error of 1 year for each succeeding reign of the kings of Israel: the first cross-reference resulted in an error of 1 year, the second gave an error of 2 years, the third of 3 years and so on. He explained this pattern as a result of two different methods of reckoning regnal years: the ''accession year'' method in one and the ''non-accession year'' method in the other. Under the accession year method, if a king died in the middle of a year, the period to the end of that year would be called the "accession year" of the new king, whose Year 1 would begin at the new year. Under the non-accession year method the period to the end of the year would be Year 1 of the new king and Year 2 would begin at the start of the new year. Israel appears to have used the non-accession method, while Judah used the accession method until [[Athaliah]] seized power in Judah, when Israel's non-accession method appears to have been adopted in Judah.

In addition, Thiele also concluded that Israel counted years starting in the spring month of [[Nisan]], while Judah counted years starting in the autumn month of [[Tishri]]. The cumulative impact of differing new years and different methods of calculating reigns explained, to Thiele, most of the apparent inconsistencies in the cross references.

Unknown to Thiele when he first published his findings, these same conclusions that the northern kingdom used non-accession years and a spring New Year while the southern kingdom used accession years and a fall New Year had been discovered by [[Valerius Coucke]] of Belgium some years previously, a fact which Thiele acknowledges in his ''Mysterious Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mysterious Numbers'', 3rd ed., p. 59, n. 17, citing V. Coucke, "Chronique biblique," in ''Supplément au Dictionnaire de la Bible'', ed. Louis Pirot, vol. 1, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
Based on his conclusions, Thiele showed that the 14 years between [[Ahab]] and [[Jehu]] were really 12 years. This enabled him to date their reigns precisely, for [[Ahab]] is mentioned in the [[Kurkh Monolith|Kurk Stele]] which records the Assyrian advance into Syria/Israel at the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC, and Jehu is mentioned on the [[Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]] paying tribute in 841 BC. As these two events are dated by Assyrian chronology as being 12 years apart, Ahab must have fought the Assyrians in his last year and Jehu paid tribute in his first year.

Thiele was able to reconcile the Biblical chronological data from the books of Kings and Chronicles with the exception of synchronisms between [[Hoshea]] of Israel and [[Hezekiah]] of Judah towards the end of the kingdom of Israel and reluctantly concluded that at that point the ancient authors had made a mistake. Oddly, it is at that precise point that he himself makes a mistake, by failing to realize that Hezekiah had a coregency with his father Ahaz, which explains the Hoshea/Hezekiah synchronisms. This correction has been supplied by subsequent writers who built on Thiele’s work, including Thiele’s colleague [[Siegfried Horn]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried H. Horn, "The Chronology of King Hezekiah’s Reign," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 2 (1964) pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; TC Mitchell and [[Kenneth Kitchen]],&lt;ref&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'', 1st ed., JD Douglas, editor; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1962, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; and Leslie McFall.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf | first = Leslie | last = McFall | title = Translation Guide | page = 12 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5rKrw27MI?url=http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf | archivedate = 2010-07-19 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiele's method in arriving at his chronology has been contrasted with the analytical method employed by [[Julius Wellhausen]] and other scholars who follow some form of the [[documentary hypothesis]]. Wellhausen taught that the chronological data of the books of Kings and Chronicles were artificially put together at a date much later than the events they were ostensibly describing and were basically not historical.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Wellhausen, ''Prolegomena to the History of Israel'' (New York: Meridian Books, 1957) p. 151, originally published as ''Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels'' (Berlin: Reimer, 1878).&lt;/ref&gt; This was a necessary consequence of his ''a priori'' assumption that the biblical books as we have them today were the work of late-date editors who could not possibly have known the correct history of the times they were writing about. Theodore Robinson summarized this position as follows: "Wellhausen is surely right in believing that the synchronisms in Kings are worthless, being merely a late compilation from the actual figures given."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore H. Robinson, ''A History of Israel'' (Oxford, 1932) I, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellhausen's methodology in interpreting the Scriptures and the history of Israel has therefore been classed by RK Harrison as a deductive approach; that is, one that starts with presuppositions and derives a historical reconstruction from those presuppositions.&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Harrison, "The Critical Use of the OT," ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' (Jan–Mar 1989) pp. 12–20.&lt;/ref&gt; A necessary consequence of this approach has been that no general agreement has been reached on the chronology of the Hebrew kingdom period as calculated by authors who adopted this method. "The disadvantage of the deductive approach is that nothing is settled for certain; the results obtained are as diverse as the [[presupposition (philosophy)|presupposition]]s of the scholars, since diverse presuppositions produce diverse results."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Rodger C | last = Young | contribution = Inductive and Deductive Methods as Applied to OT Chronology | title = [[The Master's Seminary Journal]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | year = 2007 | page = 102 | format = PDF | contribution-url = http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj18e.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Thiele's method of determining the chronology of the Hebrew kings was based on induction, that is, making it a matter of first priority to determine the actual methods used by ancient scribes and court recorders in recording the years of kings, as described above. Thiele's inductive method, then, was based on inscriptional evidence from the ancient Near East, and not on the presuppositions followed by liberal scholarship. It is Thiele's method that has produced the determinative studies for the chronology of the kingdom period, not the presupposition-based method, so that even those interpreters who continue in late-date theories for the authorship of Scripture have recognized the credibility of Thiele's scholarship in determining the date for the division of the kingdom after the death of Solomon, as cited above. The work of Thiele and other textual scholars who have followed an inductive (evidence-based) approach is therefore significant in providing an alternative to the methods of the documentary hypothesis, and the success of that approach has been seen as theologically significant in supporting a high view of the inspiration of Scripture, particularly regarding its integrity in the abundant and complex historical data related to the kingdom period.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the chronological data of the MT [ [[Masoretic text]] ] were not authentic—the actual dates and synchronisms for these various kings—then neither Thiele nor McFall nor anyone else could have constructed a chronology from them that in every case is faithful to the original texts and in every proven instance is consistent with Assyrian and Babylonian chronology. This mathematical demonstration should sit in judgment over the various theories of text formation: If a theory of text formation cannot explain how the chronological data of the MT has produced a chronology that in every respect seems authentic for the four centuries of the monarchic period, then that theory must be rejected as another example of a presupposition-based approach that cannot meet the rational criteria for credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young, review of Christine Tetley's ''The Reconstructed Chronology of the Divided Kingdom'' (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2005), in ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 45:2 (2007), pp. 282-283 ([http://home.swbell.net/rcyoung8/TetleyReview.rtf Link]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception==

Thiele's chronological reconstruction has not been accepted by all scholars,&lt;ref&gt;'Not all scholars are convinced by this solution, and commentators on the prophetic books often accept that dates can only be approximate.', McConville, G (2002). Exploring the Old Testament, Volume 4: The Prophets (viii).  London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Despite that fact of scholarly dedication, neither Thiele’s carefully argued University of Chicago dissertation, nor anyone else’s, has achieved as yet universal acceptance.', Kaiser, WC (1998). A history of Israel: From the bronze age through the Jewish Wars (293). Nashville, TN: Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; nor has any other scholar’s work in this field. Yet the work of Thiele and those who followed in his steps has achieved acceptance across a wider spectrum than that of any comparable chronology, so that Assyriologist [[Donald Wiseman|DJ Wiseman]] wrote “The chronology most widely accepted today is one based on the meticulous study by Thiele,”&lt;ref&gt;Donald J Wiseman, ''1 and 2 Kings'' in ''[[Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries]]'' (Leicester: Intervarsity, 1993), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, Leslie McFall: “Thiele’s chronology is fast becoming the consensus view among Old Testament scholars, if it has not already reached that point.”&lt;ref&gt;Leslie McFall, “The Chronology of Saul and David,” ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' 53 (2010) 215, n. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Although criticism has been leveled at numerous specific points in his chronology,&lt;ref&gt;'but his harmonizing approach has not gone unchallenged, especially because of the many shifts in the basis of reckoning dates that it requires (e.g., Jepsen 1968: 34–35)—shifts which were unlikely in actual practice.', Freedman, DN (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; his work has won considerable praise even from those who disagree with his final conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;'Driver described Thiele’s system as an “important work, which comes very near to, if it does not actually reach, a final solution of the problem of the dates of the kings of Israel and Judah.”  Even a critic of Thiele’s system who accused him of manipulating variable factors to achieve his goal of fitting the biblical evidence into Near Eastern history and who described his work as “more a study in numerical ingenuity than in scholarly research” had to admit that “Thiele’s assumption is validated by the results achieved: inner consistency and harmony and conformity with the fixed dates of ancient Near Eastern history.”', McFall, Leslie, 'A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles', Bibliotheca Sacra Volume 148. 1991 (589) (4). Dallas, TX: Dallas Theological Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, even scholars sharing Thiele's religious convictions have maintained that there are weaknesses in his argument such as unfounded assumptions and assumed circular reasoning.

This citation, from a critic of Thiele's system, demonstrates the difference mentioned above between the deductive approach based on presuppositions and an inductive approach based on data, not a priori assumptions. Thiele is criticized here for basing his theories on data or evidence, not on presuppositions.

Despite these criticisms Thiele's methodological treatment remains the typical starting point of scholarly treatments of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;'Thiele’s work has become a cornerstone of much recent chronological discussion (cf. De Vries IDB 1: 580–99; IDBSup: 161–66);', Freedman, D. N. (1996).  Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; and his work is considered to have established the date of the division of the Israelite kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;'Following Thiele’s revolutionary work, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, a consensus has emerged that the kingdom under Solomon divided at his death in 931 BC.  This date must be the starting point for any chronological reconstruction of previous events.', Merrill, Eugene H, ‘Fixed Dates in Patriarchal Chronology’, Bibliotheca Sacra Volume 137. 1980 (547) (237).

Cross]],&lt;ref&gt;Frank M. Cross, "An Interpretation of the Nora Stone," ''Bulletin of the American School of Oriental Research'' 208 (1972) p. 17, n. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and others studying the chronology of the kings of Tyre.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of these studies is found in William H. Barnes, ''Studies in the Chronology of the Divided Monarchy of Israel'' (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1991), pp. 29-55, and also in Rodger C. Young, "Three Verifications of Thiele's Date for the Beginning of the Divided Kingdom," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 45 (2007), pp. 179-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Thiele's work has found widespread recognition and use across various related scholarly disciplines. His date of 931 BCE, in conjunction with the synchronism between Rehoboam and Pharaoh [[Shoshenq I|Shishak]] in 1 Kings 14:25, is used by Egyptologists to give absolute dates to Egypt’s [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd Dynasty]], and his work has also been used by scholars in other disciplines to establish Assyrian and Babylonian dates.&lt;ref&gt;'In a 1996 article, Kenneth Strand wrote, “What has generally not been given due notice is the effect that Thiele’s clarification of the Hebrew chronology of this period of history has had in furnishing a corrective for various dates in ancient Assyrian and Babylonian history.”28  The purpose of Strand’s article was to show that Thiele’s methodology accomplished more than just producing a coherent chronology from scriptural data. His chronology, once produced, proved useful in settling some troublesome problems in Assyrian and Babylonian history. As Strand pointed out, this outcome was quite the opposite of what some of Thiele’s critics asserted, namely that Thiele merely juggled the scriptural data until he could match generally accepted dates from the surrounding nations.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (112–113). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Thiele's reconstruction led to further research which has refined or even departed from his synthesis. Notable studies of this type include work by Tadmor&lt;ref&gt;'H. Tadmor (EncMiqr 4: 245–310) bases his chronology upon considerations similar to those of Begrich and Thiele, but assumes far fewer systemic fluctuations; items which are inexplicable are regarded as late editorial calculations or errors.', Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'While also somewhat conservative in his approach to the figures in MT, Tadmor’s pragmatic reconstruction delves into the process by which the redactor(s) of Kings compiled their chronological framework from heterogeneous materials, sometimes leaving traces in textual inconsistencies (Tadmor EncMiqr 4: 45).', Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; and McFall.&lt;ref&gt;'It remained then for others to complete the application of principles that Thiele used elsewhere, thereby providing a chronology for the eighth-century kings of Judah that is in complete harmony with the reign lengths and synchronisms given in 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles. The most thorough work in this regard was Leslie McFall’s 1991 article in Bibliotheca Sacra.22  McFall made his way through the reign lengths and synchronisms of Kings and Chronicles, and using an exact notation that indicated whether the years were being measured according to Judah’s Tishri years or Israel’s Nisan years, he was able to produce a chronology for the divided monarchies that was consistent with all the scriptural texts chosen.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (105–106). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly attitudes towards the Biblical record of the Israelite monarchies from the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century were largely disparaging, treating the records as essentially fictional and dismissing the value of the regnal synchronisms.&lt;ref&gt;'R. Kittel: “Wellhausen has shown, by convincing reasons, that the synchronisms within the Book of Kings cannot possibly rest on ancient tradition, but are on the contrary simply the products of artificial reckoning.. . .”5 Theodore H. Robinson: “Wellhausen is surely right in believing that the synchronisms in Kings are worthless, being merely a late compilation from the actual figures given.”6 S. R. and G. R. Driver: “Since, however, it is clear on various grounds that these synchronisms are not original, any attempt to base a chronological scheme on them may be disregarded.”7 Karl Marti: “Almost along the whole line, the discrepancy between synchronisms and years of reign is incurable.”8 TMSJ 18:1 (Spring 2007) p. 102 Cyrus Gordon: “The numerical errors in the Books of Kings have defied every attempt to ungarble them. Those errors are largely the creation of the editors. . . . [T]he editors did not execute the synchronisms skillfully.”9', Young, Roger C, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' Volume 48. 2005 (2) (233). Lynchburg, VA: The Evangelical Theological Society.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, modern scholarly attitudes to the monarchical chronology and synchronisms in 1 and 2 Kings has been far more positive subsequent to the work of Thiele and those who have developed his thesis further,&lt;ref&gt;' The most thorough work in this regard was Leslie McFall’s 1991 article in Bibliotheca Sacra.22  McFall made his way through the reign lengths and synchronisms of Kings and Chronicles, and using an exact notation that indicated whether the years were being measured according to Judah’s Tishri years or Israel’s Nisan years, he was able to produce a chronology for the divided monarchies that was consistent with all the scriptural texts chosen. That was the logical outgrowth of Thiele’s work, and it attained a holy grail that had been sought for twenty-two centuries, namely a rational explanation of the chronological data of the Hebrew monarchies that was consistent with the scriptural texts used to construct the chronology, and also consistent with several fixed dates from Assyrian and Babylonian history.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (105–106). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt; a change in attitude to which recent archaeology has contributed.&lt;ref&gt;'Grabbe suggests that the names and sequence of kings in Israel and Judah, and their approximate chronological placement, agrees with what can be gleaned from extra-biblical sources. To this extent the biblical framework (meaning primarily 1 and 2 Kings) is reliable: even if we had no external sources we could have reasonable confidence in the biblical sequence of Jeroboam I, Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Omri, Ahab, Jehu, etc. in Samaria, and David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Abijam, Asa, Jehoshaphat, etc. in Jerusalem, along with their interrelationships. Beyond that it starts to get more and more tricky, with decreasing reliability in the biblical narrative as the detail increases (this is a general statement, and there are sometimes exceptions in specific instances).', Grabbe, L. L. (2007). Reflections on the Discussion. In L. L. Grabbe (Ed.), Ahab Agonistes: The Rise and Fall of the Omri Dynasty (L. L. Grabbe, Ed.) (337). London: T&amp;T Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of entities and changes in The World Factbook}}

As of July 2011, ''The World Factbook'' consists of 267 entities.&lt;ref name="whatsnew"/&gt; These entities can be divided into categories.&lt;ref name="ents"&gt;{{cite web | author =  Directorate of Intelligence | title = The World Factbook – Notes and Definitions: Entities | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html | accessdate = 2011-07-12 | quote = "Independent state" refers to a people politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory. * * * There are a total of 266 separate geographic entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows... }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

; Independent countries: This category has independent countries, which the CIA defines as people "politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory".&lt;ref name="ents"/&gt; In this category, there are 195 entities.
; Others: The ''Other'' category is a list of other places set apart from the list of independent countries. Currently there are two: [[Taiwan]] and the [[European Union]].
; Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty: This category is a list of places affiliated with another country. They may be subdivided into categories using the country they are affiliated with:
:*[[Australia]]: six entities
:*[[China]]: two entities
:*[[Denmark]]: two entities
:*[[France]]: eight entities
:*[[Netherlands]]: three entities
:*[[New Zealand]]: three entities
:*[[Norway]]: three entities
:*[[United Kingdom]]: seventeen entities
:*[[United States]]: fourteen entities
; Miscellaneous: This category is for [[Antarctica]] and places in dispute. There are '''six''' entities.
; Other entities: This category is for the [[World]] and the [[ocean]]s. There are '''five''' oceans and the World (the World entry is intended as a summary of the other entries).&lt;ref name=press/&gt;

In June 2009, [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), relying on information obtained from the ''CIA World Factbook'', put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the [[West Bank]] and Israeli-annexed [[East Jerusalem]] at 250,000.

'''Visual communication''' is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be seen. Visual communication in part or whole relies on [[Eye|eyesight]].&lt;ref&gt;David Sless (1981). ''Learning and Visual Communication''. p.187&lt;/ref&gt; Visual communication is a broad spectrum that includes [[signage|sign]]s, [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], [[industrial design]], [[advertising]], [[animation]], [[color]], and electronic resources.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Louis Smith (2005). ''Handbook of Visual Communication: Theory, Methods, and Media''. p.123.  {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4178-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The evaluation of a good [[Visual design|visual communication design]] is mainly based on measuring comprehension by the audience,&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Frascara (2004). ''Communication design: principles, methods, and practice''. p.68&lt;/ref&gt; not on personal aesthetic and/or artistic preference as there are no universally agreed-upon principles of aesthetics. Besides [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, there are other ways to express information visually - [[gestures]] and body language, animation (digital or analogue), and film. Visual communication by [[e-mail]], a textual medium, is commonly expressed with [[ASCII art]], [[emoticon]]s, and embedded [[digital image]]s.
[[File:Eye of Horus bw.svg|thumb|right|The Eye of Horus]]
The term 'visual presentation'&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, G. H. ''Visual Communication: More Than Meets the Eye''. Bristol: Intellect Books, 2007.  {{ISBN|978-1-84150-141-3}}. p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; is used to refer to the actual presentation of information through a visible medium such as text or images. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically-oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] also use methods of visual communication in their professional practice. Visual communication on the [[World Wide Web]] is perhaps the most important form of communication that takes place while users are surfing the Internet. When experiencing the web, one uses the eyes as the primary sense, and therefore the visual presentation of a website is very important for users to understand the message or of the communication taking place.The [[Eye of Horus]] is often referred to as the symbol of visual communication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} It is said to be a representation of an eclipse, as the cornea around the pupil is like the cornea around the sun during a solar eclipse.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Important figures===
[[Aldous Huxley]] is highly regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Becoming near-blind in his teen years as the result of an illness set the stage for what would make him one of the most intellectual people to have ever explored visual communication. His work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[The Art of Seeing]]''. He described "seeing" as being the sum of sensing, selecting, and perceiving. One of his most famous quotes is "The more you see, the more you know."

[[Max Wertheimer]] is said to be the father of [[Gestalt psychology]]. Gestalt means ''form'' or ''shape'' in German, and the study of Gestalt psychology show emphasis in simplicity, as its properties group visuals by similarity in shape or color and proximity. Looking for continuation, closure, and figure-ground principles in studied images is also intensively taught.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Study==
Students studying visual communication&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Louis Smith (2005). ''Handbook of visual communication: theory, methods, and media''. [[Routledge]]. p. 12.  {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4178-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; are taught the basic physics of light, anatomy and physiology of the eye, cognitive and perception theories, colour theories, [[Gestalt psychology]], aesthetics, natural reading patterns, design principles, [[semiotics]], persuasion, camera/filming actions and image-types, and so forth. Colleges for visual communications differ in their approach, but most combine theory and practice in some form.

Visual communication takes place through [[picture]]s, [[Information graphics|graphs]] and [[chart]]s, as well as through [[sign]]s, signals and [[symbol]]s. It may be used either independently or as an adjunct to the other methods of communication.

==Image analysis==
Visual communication contains image aspects. The interpretation of images is subjective and to understand the depth of meaning, or multiple meanings, communicated in an image requires analysis. Images can be analysed though many perspectives, for example these six major perspectives presented by [[Paul Martin Lester]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Martin Lester]].  ''Visual Communication: Images with Messages''. Belmont, CA: [[Thomson Wadsworth]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-534-63720-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Personal perspective:
When a viewer has an opinion about an image based on their personal thoughts. Personal response depends on the viewer’s thoughts and values individually. This might be sometimes in conflict with cultural values. Also when a viewer has viewed an image with a personal perspective, it is hard to change the view of the image on the viewer, and the image can even be seen in other ways.

;Historical perspective:
An image’s view can be arising from the history of the use media. Through times sort images have been changed, because the use of different (new) media. For example: The result of using the computer to edit images (e.g. Photoshop) is quite different when comparing images that are made and edited by craft.

;Technical perspective:
When the view of an image is influenced by the use of lights, position and the presentation of the image. The right use of light, position and presentation of the image can improve the view of the image. It makes the image looks better than the reality.

;Ethical perspective:
From this perspective, the maker of the image, the viewer and the image itself must be responsible morally and ethically to the image. This perspective is also categorized in six categories: [[categorical imperative]], utilitarianism, hedonism, golden mean, golden rule and veil of ignorance.

;Cultural perspective:
Symbolization is an important definition for this perspective. Cultural perspective involves identity of symbols.  The uses of words that are related with the image, the use of heroes in the image, etc. are the symbolization of the image. The cultural perspective can also be seen as the semiotic perspective.

;Critical perspective:
The view of images in the critical perspective is when the viewers criticise the images, but the critics have been made in interests of the society, although an individual makes the critics.  This way this perspective differs from the personal perspective.

==Visual aids==
'''Visual aids''' are often used to help audiences of informative and persuasive speeches understand the topic being presented. Visual aids can play a large role in how the audience understands and takes in information that is presented. There are many different types of visual aids that range from handouts to [[PowerPoint]]s. The type of visual aid a speaker uses depends on their preference and the information they are trying to present. Each type of visual aid has pros and cons that must be evaluated to ensure it will be beneficial to the overall presentation. Before incorporating visual aids into speeches, the speaker should understand that if used incorrectly, the visual will not be an aid, but a distraction. Planning ahead is important when using visual aids. It is necessary to choose a visual aid that is appropriate for the material and audience. The purpose of the visual aid is to ''enhance'' the presentation.&lt;ref name="berengueres_2015"&gt;{{cite book | last = Berengueres | first = Jose | year = 2015 | title = Sketch Thinking | publisher = Stokes Hamilton | location = Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual elements==
'''Objects'''
* The use of objects as visual aids involves bringing the actual object to demonstrate on during the speech. For example, a speech about tying knots would be more effective by bringing in a rope.
* '''Pro''': the use of the actual object is often necessary when demonstrating how to do something so that the audience can fully understand procedure.
* '''Con''': some objects are too large or unavailable for a speaker to bring with them.

'''Models'''
* Models are representations of another object that serve to demonstrate that object when use of the real object is ineffective for some reason.  Examples include human skeletal systems, the solar system, or architecture.
* '''Pros''': models can serve as substitutes that provide a better example of the real thing to the audience when the object being spoken about is of an awkward size or composure for use in the demonstration.
* '''Cons''': sometimes a model may take away from the reality of what is being spoken about. For example, the vast size of the solar system cannot be seen from a model, and the actual composure of a human body cannot be seen from a dummy.

'''Graphs'''
* Graphs are used to visualize relationships between different quantities. Various types are used as visual aids, including bar graphs, line graphs, pie graphs, and scatter plots.
* '''Pros''': graphs help the audience to visualize statistics so that they make a greater impact than just listing them verbally would.
* '''Cons''': graphs can easily become cluttered during use in a speech by including too much detail, overwhelming the audience and making the graph ineffective.

'''Maps'''
* Maps show geographic areas that are of interest to the speech. They often are used as aids when speaking of differences between geographical areas or showing the location of something.
* '''Pros''': when maps are simple and clear, they can be used to effectively make points about certain areas. For example, a map showing the building site for a new hospital could show its close location to key neighborhoods, or a map could show the differences in distribution of AIDS victims in North American and African countries.
* '''Cons''': inclusion of too much detail on a map can cause the audience to lose focus on the key point being made. Also, if the map is disproportional or unrealistic, it may prove ineffective for the point being made.

'''Tables'''
* Tables are columns and rows that organize words, symbols, and/or data.
* '''Pros''': Good tables are easy to understand. They are a good way to compare facts and to gain a better overall understanding of the topic being discussed. For example, a table is a good choice to use when comparing the amount of rainfall in 3 counties each month.
* '''Cons''': Tables are not very interesting or pleasing to the eye.  They can be overwhelming if too much information is in a small space or the information is not organized in a convenient way. A table is not a good choice to use if the person viewing it has to take a lot of time to be able to understand it. Tables can be visual distractions if it is hard to read because the font is too small or the writing is too close together.  It can also be a visual distraction if the table is not drawn evenly.

'''Photographs'''
* '''Pros''': Photographs are good tools to make or emphasize a point or to explain a topic. For example, when explaining the shanty-towns in a Third World country it would be beneficial to show a picture of one so the reader can have a better understanding of how those people live. A photograph is also good to use when the actual object cannot be viewed.  For example, in a health class learning about cocaine, the teacher cannot bring in cocaine to show the class because that would be illegal, but the teacher could show a picture of cocaine to the class. Using local photos can also help emphasize how your topic is important in the audience's area.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Presenting Effective Presentations with Visual Aids|url=http://www.osha.gov/doc/outreachtraining/htmlfiles/traintec.html|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]]|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cons''': If the photograph is too small it just becomes a distraction. Enlarging photographs can be expensive if not using a power point or other viewing device.

'''Drawings or diagrams'''
* '''Pros''': Drawings or diagrams can be used when photographs do not show exactly what the speaker wants to show or explain. It could also be used when a photograph is too detailed. For example, a drawing or diagram of the circulatory system throughout the body is a lot more effective than a picture of a cadaver showing the circulatory system.
* '''Cons''':If not drawn correctly a drawing can look sloppy and be ineffective.  This type of drawing will appear unprofessional.

===Visual aids media: simple to advanced===
* '''Chalkboard or whiteboard'''
Chalkboards and whiteboards are very useful visual aids, particularly when more advanced types of media are unavailable.  They are cheap and also allow for much flexibility.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=J. Dan|title=In the company of others : an introduction to communication|year=2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533630-6|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of chalkboards or whiteboards is convenient, but they are not a perfect visual aid.   Often, using this medium as an aid can create confusion or boredom.  Particularly if a student who is not familiar with how to properly use visual aids attempts to draw on a board while they are speaking, they detract time and attention from their actual speech.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Poster board'''
A poster is a very simple and easy visual aid.  Posters can display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations.  The biggest drawback of using a poster as a visual aid is that often a poster can appear unprofessional.  Since a poster board paper is relatively flimsy, often the paper will bend or fall over.  The best way to present a poster is to hang it up or tape it to a wall.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Handouts'''
Handouts can also display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations.  An important aspect of the use of a handout is that a person can keep a handout with them long after the presentation is over.  This can help the person better remember what was discussed.  Passing out handouts, however, can be extremely distracting.  Once a handout is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience’s attention.  The person who receives the handout might be tempted to read what is on the paper, which will keep them from listening to what the speaker is saying. If using a handout, the speaker distributes the hand out right before you reference it.&lt;ref name=maui&gt;{{cite web|last=Kumu|first=Ka|title=Using Visual Aids Effectively|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/mauispeech/html/visual_aids.html|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Maui College]] Speech Department|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Distributing handouts is acceptable in a lecture that is an hour or two, but in a short lecture of five to ten minutes, a handout should not be used.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Video excerpts'''
A video can be a great visual aid and attention grabber, however, a video is not a replacement for an actual speech.  There are several potential drawbacks to playing a video during a speech or lecture.  First, if a video is playing that includes audio, the speaker will not be able to talk.  Also, if the video is very exciting and interesting, it can make what the speaker is saying appear boring and uninteresting.  The key to showing a video during a presentation is to make sure to transition smoothly into the video and to only show very short clips.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Projection equipment'''
There are several types of projectors.  These include slide projectors, PowerPoint presentations, overhead projectors, and computer projectors.  Slide projectors are the oldest form of projector, and are no longer used.  PowerPoint presentations are very popular and are used often.  Overhead projectors are still used but are somewhat inconvenient to use.  In order to use an overhead projector, a transparency must be made of whatever is being projected onto the screen.  This takes time and costs money.  Computer projectors are the most technologically advanced projectors.  When using a computer projector, pictures and slides are easily taken right from a computer either online or from a saved file and are blown up and shown on a large screen.  Though computer projectors are technologically advanced, they are not always completely reliable because technological breakdowns are not uncommon of the computers of today.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Computer-assisted presentations'''
PowerPoint presentations can be an extremely useful visual aid, especially for longer presentations. For five- to ten-minute presentations, it is probably not worth the time or effort to put together a PowerPoint. For longer presentations, however, PowerPoints can be a great way to keep the audience engaged and keep the speaker on track.  A potential drawback of using a PowerPoint is that it usually takes a lot of time and energy to put together.  There is also the possibility of a computer malfunction, which can mess up the flow of a presentation.&lt;ref name=roth /&gt;

* '''Social media'''
Social media is one of the most effective ways to communicate. The incorporation of text and images deliver messages quicker and more simplistic through social media platforms. A potential drawback can be there is limited access due to the internet access requirement and certain limitations to the number of characters and image size.

===Nano-instrumentation===
Techniques to fabricate new instrumentation to characterize critical parameters such as size, composition, stiffness, surface characteristics, dopant concentration, [[magnetic coercivity]], and other properties of particular interest to the nano scale. Due to their small size, nano-systems are extremely challenging to assemble, and yet precise control of their parameters is often critical to their performance. A related goal is to cause a paradigm shift in classical chemical measurements (in which samples are brought to the lab for analysis) by developing wireless, energy-efficient mobile nano-instruments that allow users to bring the lab to the sample. Examples of "the lab" include nano-instruments of all types and two examples of "the sample" include the environment or a patient. The metrology arm of the new labs will be used to study measurements at the nano-scale, to develop new and unique nano-scale measuring instruments, and to calibrate such instruments. It will also address associated challenges involved in fabricating, integrating and packaging instruments at the nano-scale.

===Nano–biosystems===
Nano–bio is a field that includes both the use of nanotechnology in biological and agrifood systems and use of biological or biomimetic techniques in nanotechnology. Nanobiotechnology shows a tremendous promise of improving the quality of life. For example, nanovehicles might deliver drugs directly to targeted cells, nanomembranes may be used for development of cheap, effective water purification systems, or nanochips that interface neurons with electronics may become common place. NEMS (nano-electromechanical systems) might use sensors and physical controls to stabilize individuals with heart, kidney or liver disease. As nanotechnology researchers strive to create self-assembling devices, they are beginning to exploit natural self-assemblers: proteins, DNA and viruses. Examples also include development of food quality monitoring sensors and microfluidic biosensor components.Nanoscale imaging of biological systems helps to understand the nanoscale structure–function relationship of materials and in evaluating the food quality–function information. Characterization of nanoscale fragments of biomaterials such as DNA, proteins, chromosomes, plant cells, bacteria, starch granules and anti-allergens are extremely important.

====Nano–bio projects====
*[[Lab-on-a-chip]] applications, such as DNA chips and pharmacy-on-a-chip.
*Creation of nano-vehicles that mimic the way viruses interact with specific cells. This will facilitate the [[Targeted drug delivery|delivery of drugs directly to targeted cells]], and could, for instance, eliminate the toxic side-effects of [[chemotherapy]] by directing the therapeutic agents to cancer cells only.
*Development of nanotech methods for therapeutic applications, for example, for replacing faulty DNA or RNA strands with corrected strands.
*Fundamental and applied research into how certain peptides self-assemble into nano-structures, which will increase understanding of certain neurological diseases, and may subsequently lead to novel treatment methods.
*Development of polymeric nanostructures from self-assembly block copolymers for delivery of drugs, proteins and DNA.
