      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12579">Formerly called the '''Intern Development Program''' ('''IDP'''), the '''Architectural Experience Program''' ('''AXP''') is a comprehensive training program created to ensure that candidates pursuing licensure in the architecture profession gain the knowledge and skills required for the independent practice of architecture. The program is developed, maintained, and administered by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) and is required by most U.S. architectural registration boards to satisfy experience requirements for licensure.

==History==
In 1976, NCARB introduced the Intern Development Program (IDP) after working with the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) throughout the 1970s to develop a more structured program for candidates to ensure they were gaining the knowledge and skills necessary to practice independently. Administered by NCARB, jurisdictions gradually began adopting the program to satisfy their experience requirement.

Mississippi became the first state to require the IDP in 1978. All 54 U.S. jurisdictions accept the IDP toward the fulfillment of their experience requirement.

The first major change to the program came in 1996 when it became required to record actual training units earned rather than the percent of time spent in each training area. The program has been monitored annually by NCARB’s Internship Committee, which has recommended other minor changes over the years based on interpretations of the current practice of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP-2/IDP2-History.aspx|title=NCARB - National Council of Architectural Registration Boards|website=www.ncarb.org|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, NCARB announced the rollout of IDP 2.0, the most significant update to the program since its inception in the 1970s. IDP 2.0 more closely aligns the program's requirements with the current practice of architecture and ensures the comprehensive training that is essential for competent practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP-2/IDP2-Timeline.aspx IDP 2.0 Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

IDP 2.0 was developed in response to the 2007 Practice Analysis of Architecture. In this study, almost 10,000 practicing architects completed an extensive electronic survey to identify the tasks, knowledge, and skills that recently licensed architects, practicing independently, need in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.

The updates were rolled out in phases with the first phase occurring in July 2009 and the final in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncarb.org/News-and-Events/News/2011/10-IDP-2.aspx Final Phase of IDP 2.0 to be Implemented April 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105224836/http://www.ncarb.org/News-and-Events/News/2011/10-IDP-2.aspx |date=2012-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the IDP was [http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP2-Experience-Categories-Areas.aspx streamlined] to reduce experience hours required from 5,600 to 3,740. (Some jurisdictions require documentation of additional hours to meet their experience requirement. NCARB recommends that you submit all experience until you have satisfied your jurisdiction’s requirement. See individual jurisdiction’s requirements [http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP2-Experience-Categories-Areas/Experience-Requirement-by-State.aspx '''here'''].)

In order to address the findings of the 2012 Practice Analysis, NCARB began an in-depth review and overhaul of the experience program to ensure that the requirements continued to adhere to current architectural practice. In addition, NCARB decided to rename the IDP the Architectural Experience Program (AXP) as part of an effort to sunset the term “intern.”

The introduction of the new name and the overhaul were both launched on June 29, 2016. In the AXP, the previous 17 experience categories were realigned into six broad areas that reflect the current practice of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/News-and-Events/News/2016/AXP-Launch.aspx|title=NCARB Launches Architectural Experience Program|last=|first=|date=2016-06-30|website=NCARB|publisher=NCARB|access-date=2016-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703160133/http://www.ncarb.org/News-and-Events/News/2016/AXP-Launch.aspx|archivedate=2016-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
An individual seeking architectural licensure is referred to as an '''“licensure candidate.”''' All U.S. states and Canadian provinces prohibit the use of the word “architect” from any person not already licensed to practice architecture. Most states and provinces also prohibit any derivation of the word architect as well.

A '''supervisor''' is someone who reviews and directs the work of others and ensures that work is done within acceptable levels of quality. An AXP supervisor is the individual who supervises a candidate on a daily basis. The AXP supervisor is required to certify that the information submitted on an experience report is true and correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Supervisors-and-Mentors/Working-With-A-Supervisor.aspx|title=NCARB - National Council of Architectural Registration Boards|website=www.ncarb.org|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mentor''' is a loyal adviser, teacher, or coach. An AXP mentor must be a registered architect who makes a long-term commitment to a candidate’s professional growth. If possible, the mentor should not work in the same office so that the candidate can gain useful insight into the daily work experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Supervisors-and-Mentors/Working-With-A-Mentor.aspx|title=NCARB - National Council of Architectural Registration Boards|website=www.ncarb.org|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The first step to beginning the AXP is to establish an [http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Getting-Started/My-NCARB-Record.aspx NCARB Record]. Candidates are eligible to start earning credit for the AXP once they have graduated from high school. In order to gain experience, they must work under the direct supervision of an AXP supervisor in one of the NCARB approved work settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Meeting-NCARB-Experience-Requirements/Work-Settings.aspx|title=IDP Work Settings|website=www.ncarb.org|access-date=2016-04-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031417/http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Meeting-NCARB-Experience-Requirements/Work-Settings.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All experience must be reported electronically to NCARB at least every six months through their NCARB Record, and experience may be submitted more often. Half credit will be given for experience reported that is up to five years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Maintaining-Participation.aspx|title=Maintaining Participation|website=www.ncarb.org|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experience requirement==
Licensure candidates must acquire 3,740 experience hours in specific experience areas to complete the AXP. These areas were effective June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP2-Experience-Categories-Areas.aspx|title=Experience Requirements|last=|first=|date=2016-06-29|website=NCARB|publisher=NCARB|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Licensure candidates must be employed in one of two experience settings to earn credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP2-Experience-Categories-Areas.aspx|title=Experience Requirements|last=|first=|date=2016-06-29|website=NCARB|publisher=NCARB|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practice Management===
'''Required hours: 160'''

Practice Management is where licensure candidates gain experience running an architecture firm—including the ins and outs of managing a business, marketing firms, securing projects, working with clients, and sustaining a positive and professional work environment.

===Project Management===
'''Required hours: 360'''

In Project Management, licensure candidates learn how to deliver projects that meet contractual requirements, so they’ll be prepared to budget, coordinate, oversee, and execute a project.

=== Programming &amp; Analysis ===
'''Required hours: 260'''

Programming &amp; Analysis is the first phase of a project, often referred to as pre-design. Licensure candidates will experience tasks related to researching and evaluating client requirements, building code and zoning regulations, and site data to develop recommendations on the feasibility of a project.

=== Project Planning &amp; Design ===
'''Required hours: 1,080'''

Project Planning &amp; Design covers the schematic design phase of a project. Licensure candidates will learn to layout the building design, review building codes and regulations, coordinate schematics with consultants, and communicate design concepts with clients.

=== Project Development &amp; Documentation ===
'''Required hours: 1,520'''

In Project Development &amp; Documentation, licensure candidates will gain experience with projects after the schematic design has been approved—focusing on construction documents and coordinating with regulatory authorities to gain the necessary approvals for construction.

=== Construction &amp; Evaluation ===
'''Required hours: 360'''

In Construction &amp; Evaluation, licensure candidates will get involved with the construction administration and post-construction phases of a project—this includes being out on the job site; meeting with contractors, clients, and building officials; and punching lists, leading to the completion of the project.

===Total hours: 3,740===

==Resources==
'''''AXP Guidelines'':''' Produced by NCARB, the document is essential reading for participants of the AXP. It includes steps to completing the program, reporting procedures, training requirements, and core competencies that should understand before becoming licensed. The document is updated about twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/forms/idp_guidelines.pdf |title=IDP Guidelines |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106003738/http://www.ncarb.org/forms/idp_guidelines.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP-Coordinators.aspx '''Architect Licensing Advisor''']''':''' An individual who provides information and guidance for those working toward licensure. Licensing advisors are usual located at:
* NAAB-accredited architectural degree programs
* AIA chapters
* AIAS chapters
* Firms
* State registration boards
You can find your local architect licensing advisor through the NCARB website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/~/media/Files/PDF/IDP/IDP-Coordinators/ArchitectLicesningAdvisorsbyState.ashx |title=Architect Licensing Advisors by State |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405083209/http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/~/media/Files/PDF/IDP/IDP-Coordinators/ArchitectLicesningAdvisorsbyState.ashx |archivedate=2016-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asimov's Guide to the Bible''''' is a work by [[Isaac Asimov]] that was first published in two volumes in 1968 and 1969, covering the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] (including [[Deuterocanonical books|the Catholic Old Testament, or deuterocanonical, books]] (See [[Catholic Bible]]) and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Old Testament books, or ''[[Deuterocanonical books#Eastern Orthodoxy|anagignoskomena]]'', along with the [[2 Esdras|Fourth Book of Ezra]]), respectively.  He combined them into a single 1296-page volume in 1981. They included maps by the artist [[Rafael Palacios (artist)|Rafael Palacios]].

Including numerous black-and-white maps, the guide goes through the books of the [[Bible]] in the order of the [[King James Version]] to the extent possible, explaining the historical and geographical setting of each one, and the political and historical influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the main characters. His appendix "Guides to the Old and New Testament" include biblical verse, footnotes, references and subject indices.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5707">'''Basic fuzzy Logic''' (or shortly '''BL'''), the logic of [[continuous function|continuous]] [[t-norm]]s, is one of [[t-norm fuzzy logics]]. It belongs to the broader class of [[substructural logic]]s, or logics of [[residuated lattice]]s;&lt;ref name="Ono"&gt;Ono (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; it extends the logic of all left-continuous t-norms [[Monoidal t-norm logic|MTL]].

== Syntax ==

=== Language ===

The language of the propositional logic BL consists of [[countable|countably]] many [[propositional variable]]s and the following primitive [[logical connective]]s:
* '''Implication''' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ([[arity|binary]])
* '''Strong conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; (binary). The sign &amp;amp; is a more traditional notation for strong conjunction in the literature on fuzzy logic, while the notation &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; follows the tradition of substructural logics.
* '''Bottom''' &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; ([[nullary]] — a [[Logical constant|propositional constant]]); &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{0}&lt;/math&gt; are common alternative signs and '''zero''' a common alternative name for the propositional constant (as the constants bottom and zero of substructural logics coincide in MTL).
The following are the most common defined logical connectives:
* '''Weak conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice conjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] in algebraic semantics). Unlike [[Monoidal t-norm logic|MTL]] and weaker substructural logics, weak conjunction is definable in BL as
::&lt;math&gt;A \wedge B \equiv A \otimes (A \rightarrow B)&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Negation''' &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; ([[unary operation|unary]]), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;\neg A \equiv A \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Equivalence''' &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (binary), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;A \leftrightarrow B \equiv (A \rightarrow B) \wedge (B \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
: As in MTL, the definition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(A \rightarrow B) \otimes (B \rightarrow A).&lt;/math&gt;
* '''(Weak) disjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice disjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[join (mathematics)|join]] in algebraic semantics), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;A \vee B \equiv ((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B) \wedge ((B \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Top''' &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (nullary), also called '''one''' and denoted by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{1}&lt;/math&gt; (as the constants top and zero of substructural logics coincide in MTL), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;\top \equiv \bot \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;

[[Well-formed formula]]e of BL are defined as usual in [[propositional logic]]s. In order to save parentheses, it is common to use the following order of precedence:
* Unary connectives (bind most closely)
* Binary connectives other than implication and equivalence
* Implication and equivalence (bind most loosely)

=== Axioms ===

A [[Hilbert-style deduction system]] for BL has been introduced by [[Petr Hájek]] (1998). Its single derivation rule is [[modus ponens]]:
:from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; derive &lt;math&gt;B.&lt;/math&gt;
The following are its [[axiom scheme|axiom schemata]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ll}
  {\rm (BL1)}\colon &amp; (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow ((B \rightarrow C) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow C)) \\
  {\rm (BL2)}\colon &amp; A \otimes B \rightarrow A\\
  {\rm (BL3)}\colon &amp; A \otimes B \rightarrow B \otimes A\\
  {\rm (BL4)}\colon &amp;  A \otimes (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B \otimes (B \rightarrow A)\\
  {\rm (BL5a)}\colon &amp;  (A \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C)) \rightarrow (A \otimes B \rightarrow C)\\
  {\rm (BL5b)}\colon &amp;  (A \otimes B \rightarrow C) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C))\\
  {\rm (BL6)}\colon &amp;  ((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow C) \rightarrow (((B \rightarrow A) \rightarrow C) \rightarrow C)\\
  {\rm (BL7)}\colon &amp;  \bot \rightarrow A
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The axioms (BL2) and (BL3) of the original axiomatic system were shown to be redundant (Chvalovský, 2012) and (Cintula, 2005). All the other axioms were shown to be independent (Chvalovský, 2012).
== Semantics ==

Like in other propositional [[t-norm fuzzy logics]], [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] is predominantly used for BL, with three main classes of [[algebraic structure|algebras]] with respect to which the logic is [[Completeness (logic)|complete]]:
* '''General semantics''', formed of all ''BL-algebras'' — that is, all algebras for which the logic is [[Soundness theorem|sound]]
* '''Linear semantics''', formed of all ''linear'' BL-algebras — that is, all BL-algebras whose [[lattice (order)|lattice]] order is [[total order|linear]]
* '''Standard semantics''', formed of all ''standard'' BL-algebras — that is, all BL-algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] with the usual order; they are uniquely determined by the function that interprets strong conjunction, which can be any continuous [[t-norm]]

In [[biology]], '''cell theory''' is the historic [[scientific theory]], now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, that they are the basic structural/organizational unit of all organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to [[microscope]]s over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to [[Robert Hooke]], and began the scientific study of cells, also known as [[cell biology]]. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to [[Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. However, many other scientists like [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from [[spontaneous generation]].

The three [[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]s to the cell theory are as described below:
# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
# The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
# Cells arise from pre-existing cells.

The first of these tenets is disputed, as [[non-cellular life|non-cellular entities]] such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, Luis P. (August 8, 2008) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-viruses-alive-2004/ Are Viruses Alive?] ''Scientific American''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microscopes==

[[File:Leeuwenhoek Microscope.png|thumb|Anton van Leeuwenhoek's microscope from the 17th century with a magnification of 300x.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.funsci.com/fun3_en/usph/usph.htm |title=A glass-sphere microscope |publisher=Funsci.com |accessdate=13 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100611200259/http://www.funsci.com/fun3_en/usph/usph.htm| archivedate= 11 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Hooke-microscope.png|thumb|Robert Hooke's microscope]]
The discovery of the cell was made possible through the invention of the microscope. In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the [[glass]]. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D’Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of [[Optical microscope#Simple microscope|simple microscope]]s ([[magnifying glass]]es) with limited magnification.&lt;ref&gt;Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554&lt;/ref&gt; [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|Compound microscope]], which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]] achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 - 392&lt;/ref&gt; In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

Extensive microscopic study was done by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses.  This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His were a single lens simple microscope, rather than a [[compound microscope]]. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress for the microscopes until the 1850s, two hundred years later. [[Carl Zeiss]], a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired [[Otto Schott]] and eventually [[Ernst Abbe]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"/&gt;

Optical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a [[wavelength]] or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of [[visible light]]. Later in the 1920s, the [[electron microscope]] was developed, making it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again, changing the possibilities in science.&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept" /&gt;

== Discovery of cells ==
[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|Drawing of the structure of [[Cork cambium|cork]] by [[Robert Hooke]] that appeared in ''[[Micrographia]]''.]]

The cell was first discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book [[Micrographia]]. In this book, he gave 60 ‘observations’ in detail of various objects under a coarse, compound microscope.&lt;ref name=Gest&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One observation was from very thin slices of bottle cork. Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named "cells". This came from the Latin word Cella, meaning ‘a small room’ like monks lived in and also Cellulae, which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb. However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Inwood, Stephen |title=The man who knew too much: the strange and inventive life of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703 |publisher=Pan |location=London |year=2003 |page=72 |isbn=0-330-48829-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
What Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing. Therefore, he did not think the "cellulae" were alive.&lt;ref name="Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Becker, Wayne M. |author2=Kleinsmith, Lewis J. |author3=Hardin, Jeff |page=1|title=The World of the Cell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UA8OAAAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8053-4854-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cell observations gave no indication of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other [[organelle]]s found in most living cells. In Micrographia, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe “seeds” that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian theory]] still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] later discovers generation is achieved otherwise.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects almost 300-fold, or 270x.&lt;ref name="Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1"/&gt; Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to [[The Royal Society]] on October 9, 1676, he states that [[motility]] is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers in which described many specific forms of [[microorganisms]]. Leeuwenhoek named these “animalcules,” which included [[protozoa]] and other unicellular organisms, like [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept" /&gt; Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study "pepper water" in 1676. He also found for the first time the [[sperm cells]] of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the [[egg cell]]. This put an end to the previous theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

The cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.&lt;ref name="History of Biology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Richard|title=History of Biology: Cell Theory and Cell Structure|url=http://www.biologyreference.com/Gr-Hi/History-of-Biology-Cell-Theory-and-Cell-Structure.html#b|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conclusion was not made until [[Henri Dutrochet]]. Besides stating “the cell is the fundamental element of organization”,&lt;ref&gt;Dutrochet, Henri (1824) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA166,M1 "Recherches anatomiques et physiologiques sur la structure intime des animaux et des vegetaux, et sur leur motilite, par M.H. Dutrochet, avec deux planches"]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutrochet also claimed that cells were not just a structural unit, but also a physiological unit.

In 1804, [[Karl Rudolphi]] and [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link|J.H.F. Link]] were awarded the prize for "solving the problem of the nature of cells", meaning they were the first to prove that cells had independent [[cell walls]] by the [[University of Göttingen|Königliche Societät der Wissenschaft]] (Royal Society of Science), Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathnat.uni-rostock.de/geschichte/kalenderblatt/kalenderblatt-dezember-2013/ Kalenderblatt Dezember 2013 – Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Fakultät – Universität Rostock]. Mathnat.uni-rostock.de (2013-11-28). Retrieved on 2015-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and the fluid passed between them this way.

[[File:Schwann Theodore.jpg|thumb|Schwann Theodore| [[Theodor Schwann]] (1810–1882)]]
Credit for developing cell theory is usually given to two scientists: [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=L. W. |year=1921 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontocy032473mbp |title=Introduction To Cytology |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory, he is not as credited for his attributions toward it. In 1839, Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells. He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schleiden, M. J. |year=1839|title= Beiträge zur Phytogenesis|journal=Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin|pages=137–176|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/49861#page/347/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not an original idea of Schleiden. He claimed this theory as his own, though [[Barthelemy Charles Joseph Dumortier|Barthelemy Dumortier]] had stated it years before him. This crystallization process is no longer accepted with [[#Modern interpretation|modern cell theory]]. In 1839, [[Theodor Schwann]] states that along with plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schwann, T. |year=1839|title=Mikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Uebereinstimmung in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und Pflanzen|publisher=Sander|place= Berlin|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/schwann_mikroskopische_1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major advancement in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants. From these conclusions about plants and animals, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;

1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells

2. The cell is the most basic unit of life

Schleiden's theory of free cell formation through crystallization was refuted in the 1850s by [[Robert Remak]], [[Rudolf Virchow]], and [[Albert Kolliker]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/8964| pmid = 10559875| year = 1999| last1 = Mazzarello| first1 = P.| journal = Nature Cell Biology| volume = 1| issue = 1| url = http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| pages = E13–5| title = A unifying concept: the history of cell theory| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603062810/http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| archivedate = 2015-06-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Rudolf Virchow added the third tenet to cell theory. In Latin, this tenet states ''Omnis cellula e cellula''.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;  This translated to:

3. All cells arise only from pre-existing cells

However, the idea that all cells come from pre-existing cells had in fact already been proposed by Robert Remak; it has been suggested that Virchow plagiarized Remak and did not give him credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silver|year=1987|title=Virchow, the heroic model in medicine: health policy by accolade|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=77|issue=1|pmid=3538915|pmc=1646803|doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.1.82|first1=GA|pages=82–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remak published observations in 1852 on cell division, claiming Schleiden and Schawnn were incorrect about generation schemes. He instead said that [[binary fission]], which was first introduced by Dumortier, was how reproduction of new animal cells were made. Once this tenet was added, the classical cell theory was complete.

== Modern interpretation ==
The generally accepted parts of modern cell theory include:

# All known living things are made up of one or more cells&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe&lt;/ref&gt;
# All living cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. 
# The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
# The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of independent cells.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
# Energy flow ([[metabolism]] and [[biochemistry]]) occurs within cells.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;
# Cells contain [[DNA]] which is found specifically in the chromosome and [[RNA]] found in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
# All cells are basically the same in chemical composition in organisms of similar species.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;

== Modern version ==
The modern version of the cell theory includes the ideas that:

*Heredity information ([[DNA]]) is passed on from cell to cell.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;
*All cells have the same basic chemical composition.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;

== Opposing concepts in cell theory: history and background ==

The cell was  first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 using a microscope. The first cell theory is credited to the work of [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called [[protoplasm]] and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, [[colloidal chemistry]] began its development, and the concepts of [[bound water]] emerged. A [[colloid]] being something between a [[solution]] and a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where [[Brownian motion]] is sufficient to prevent [[sedimentation]].
The idea of a [[semipermeable membrane]], a barrier that is permeable to [[solvent]] but impermeable to solute [[molecules]] was developed at about the same time. The term [[osmosis]] originated in 1827 and its importance to [[physiological]] phenomena realized, but it wasn’t until 1877, when the [[botanist]] [[Pfeffer]] proposed the [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] of [[cell physiology]]. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the [[plasma membrane]], and cell water and solutes such as a [[potassium]] [[ion]] existed in a physical state like that of a [[dilute solution]]. In 1889 Hamburger used [[hemolysis]] of [[erythrocytes]] to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.

===Evolution of the membrane and bulk phase theories===

Two opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on [[osmosis]], permeability, and electrical properties of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Gilbert N.|title=In search of the physical basis of life|date=1984|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0306414090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the [[protoplasm]] was responsible for these properties.
The [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the [[lipid membrane]] was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to [[anions]], [[Leonor Michaelis]] concluded that [[ions]] are [[adsorbed]] to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by [[electrostatic repulsion]]. Michaelis demonstrated the [[membrane potential]] (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Michaelis|first1=L.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Permeability of Membranes for Electrolytes|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|volume=8|issue=2 |pages=33–59|year=1925|pmid=19872189|pmc=2140746|doi=10.1085/jgp.8.2.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle &amp; Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both {{chem|K|+}} and {{chem|Cl|-}}, but apparently not to {{chem|Na|+}}, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to {{chem|K|+}}, {{chem|H|+}}, and {{chem|Cl|-}} as well as the impermeability to {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|+}}, and {{chem|Mg|2+}}.
Over the same time period, it was shown (Procter &amp; Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. [[Jacques Loeb|Loeb]] (1920) also studied [[gelatin]] extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in [[gels]] without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the {{chem|H|+}} concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form—the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water—and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and [[fibrin]] gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.
By the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks &amp; Brooks published a monograph, "The Permeability of Living Cells", which rejects the bulk phase theories.

===Emergence of the steady-state membrane pump concept===

With the development of [[radioactive tracers]], it was shown that cells are not impermeable to {{chem|Na|+}}. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove {{chem|Na|+}} as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of [[dynamic equilibrium]], constantly using energy to maintain [[ion gradient]]s. In 1935, [[Karl Lohmann]] discovered [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven [[sodium pump]] was proposed.
The tremendous success of [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.
 
The modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.
These major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact—there are, however, a few dissenters.[citation needed]
===The reemergence of the bulk phase theories===

In 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, ''The Problems of Cell Permeability'', in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.

In 1962, [[Gilbert Ling]] became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.

[[File:Prokaryote cell.svg|thumb|right| [[Prokaryote]] cell.]]
[[File:Endomembrane system diagram en (edit).svg|thumb|Endomembrane system diagram en| Eukaryote cell.]]
Cells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:

# ''[[Prokaryote]]s'': Prokaryotes are relatively small cells surrounded by the plasma membrane, with a characteristic cell wall that may differ in composition depending on the particular organism.&lt;ref name=w11&gt;Wolfe, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt; Prokaryotes lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (although they do have circular or linear [[DNA]]) and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (though they do contain [[ribosome]]s). The [[protoplasm]] of a prokaryote contains the chromosomal region that appears as [[fibrous]] deposits under the microscope, and the [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref name=w11/&gt; [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]] are the  two [[domain (biology)|domains]] of prokaryotes.
# ''[[Eukaryote]]s'': Eukaryotic cells are also surrounded by the plasma membrane, but  on the other hand, they  have distinct nuclei bound by a [[nuclear membrane]] or envelope. Eukaryotic cells also contain membrane-bound organelles, such as  ([[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[lysosomes]], rough and smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[vacuoles]]).&lt;ref name=w13&gt;Wolfe, p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they possess organized chromosomes which store genetic material.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a [[multicellular]] body (100–150 different cell types), compared
with 10–20 in plants, fungi, and protoctista.&lt;ref&gt;Margulis, L. &amp; Chapman, M.J. (2009). Kingdoms and Domains: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth ([4th ed.]. ed.). Amsterdam: Academic Press/Elsevier. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central massive object''' ('''CMO''') refers to a mass concentration at the center of a [[galaxy]]. It can be either a [[supermassive black hole]] or a [[nuclear star cluster]].

The most massive galaxies are thought to always contain a supermassive black hole (SBH); these galaxies do not contain nuclear star clusters, and the CMO is identified with the SBH. Fainter galaxies usually contain a nuclear star cluster (NSC). In most of these galaxies it is not known whether a supermassive black hole is present, and the CMO is identified with the NSC.&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|author-link=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|year=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few galaxies, for instance the [[Milky Way]] and [[NGC 4395]], are known to contain both a SBH and a NSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nishiyama, S.|author2=Schödel, R.|title=Young, Massive Star Candidates Detected throughout the Nuclear Star Cluster of the Milky Way|year=2012|journal=Astrophysics.

==Post Democracy==

Crouch coined the term "[[post-democracy]]" in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that are conducted by fully operating [[Democracy|democratic system]]s (elections are being held, governments fall and there is [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small elite is making the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''&lt;ref&gt;Colin Crouch. [http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&amp;title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] [[Policy Network]] , 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''. The term appeared to define a running evolution within democracies during the 21st century and is [[polemic]]al because it calls attention to recognized democracies losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Carabus auratus with prey.jpg|right|thumb|Interspecific interactions such as [[predation]] are a key aspect of community ecology.]]

In ecology, a '''community'''  is a group or [[association (ecology)|association]] of [[population]]s of two or more different [[species]] occupying the same geographical area and in a particular time, also known as a [[biocoenosis]]. The term community has a variety of uses. In its simplest form it refers to groups of organisms in a specific place or time, for example, "the fish community of Lake Ontario before industrialization".

'''Community ecology''' or '''synecology''' is the study of the interactions between species in communities on many spatial and temporal scales, including the distribution, structure, abundance, [[demography]], and [[biological interaction|interaction]]s between coexisting populations.&lt;ref name="Sahney Benton 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf |author1=Sahney, S. |author2=Benton, M. J. |year=2008 |title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 |volume=275 |pages=759–65 |format=PDF |pmid=18198148 |issue=1636 |pmc=2596898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary focus of community ecology is on the interactions between populations as determined by specific [[genotypic]] and [[phenotypic]] characteristics. Community ecology has its origin in European [[phytosociology|plant sociology]]. Modern community ecology examines patterns such as variation in [[species richness]], equitability, [[productivity (ecology)|productivity]] and [[food web]] structure (see [[community structure]]); it also examines processes such as predator–prey [[population dynamics]], [[ecological succession|succession]], and [[community assembly]].

On a deeper level the meaning and value of the community concept in ecology is up for debate. Communities have traditionally been understood on a fine scale in terms of local processes constructing (or destructing) an assemblage of species, such as the way climate change is likely to affect the make-up of grass communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grime J. P. | year = 2008 | title = Long-term resistance to simulated climate change in an infertile grassland | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/105/29/10028.short | journal = PNAS | volume = 105 | issue = 29| pages = 10028–10032 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0711567105|display-authors=etal | pmid=18606995 | pmc=2481365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently this local community focus has been criticised. [[Robert Ricklefs]] has argued that it is more useful to think of communities on a regional scale, drawing on evolutionary [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[biogeography]],&lt;ref name="Sahney Benton 2008"/&gt; where some species or [[clade]]s evolve and others go extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ricklefs R.E. | year = 2008 | title = Disintegration of the Ecological Community | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 172 | issue = | pages = 741–750 | pmid = 18954264 | doi=10.1086/593002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Holistic theory===
[[Frederic Clements|Clements]] developed a [[Holistic community|holistic (or organismic)]] concept of community, as it was a [[superorganism]] or discrete unit, with sharp boundaries.

===Individualistic theory===
[[Henry A. Gleason (botanist)|Gleason]] developed the individualistic (also known as open or continuum) concept of community, with the abundance of a population of a species changing gradually along complex environmental gradients, but individually, not equally to other populations. In that view, it is possible that individualistic distribution of species gives rise to discrete communities as well as to continuum. [[Ecological niche|Niche]]s would not overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is vegetation classification?|url=https://sites.google.com/site/vegclassmethods/concepts|publisher=International Association for Vegetation Science (IAVS)|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Verhoef|first1=Herman A.|title=Community Ecology|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0042.xml|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutral theory===
In the [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|neutral theory]] view of the community (or [[metacommunity]]), popularized by [[Stephen P. Hubbell|Hubbell]], species are functionally equivalent, and the abundance of a population of a species changes by [[stochastic]] [[demographic]] processes (i.e., random births and deaths).&lt;ref name="hubbell2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbell|first1=Stephen P.|title=The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography|date=2001|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton [u.a.]|isbn=978-0691021287|edition=Print on Demand.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each population would have the same [[adaptive value]] (competitive and dispersal abilities), and local and regional composition would represent a balance between speciation or [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] (which increase diversity), and random extinctions (which decrease diversity).&lt;ref name="Vellend2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vellend|first1=Mark|title=Conceptual synthesis in community ecology.|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=June 2010|volume=85|issue=2|pages=183–206|pmid=20565040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interspecific interactions==
Species [[Biological interaction|interact]] in various ways: competition, [[predation]], [[parasitism]], [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]], etc.  The organization of a biological community with respect to ecological interactions is referred to as community structure.

===Competition===
Species can [[Competition (biology)|compete]] with each other for finite [[Resource (biology)|resources]]. It is considered to be an important limiting factor of [[population size]], [[biomass]] and [[species richness]]. Many types of competition have been described, but proving the existence of these interactions is a matter of debate. Direct competition has been observed between individuals, populations and species, but there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups.&lt;ref name="Sahney Benton Ferry 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Interference competition''': occurs when an individual of one species directly interferes with an individual of another species. Examples include a lion chasing a hyena from a kill, or a plant releasing [[allelopathic]] chemicals to impede the growth of a competing species.
# '''Exploitative competition''': This occurs via the consumption of resources. When an individual of one species consumes a resource (e.g., food, shelter, sunlight, etc.), that resource is no longer available to be consumed by a member of a second species. Exploitative competition is thought to be more common in nature, but care must be taken to distinguish it from apparent competition.Exploitative competition vary from [[size-asymmetric competition|complete symmetric]] (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size) to [[size-asymmetric competition|perfectly size symmetric]] (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely [[size-asymmetric competition|size-asymmetric]] (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities
# '''Apparent competition''':  occurs when two species share a predator. The populations of both species can be depressed by predation without direct exploitative competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holt R.D. | year = 1977 | title = Predation, apparent competition, and the structure of prey communities | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 197–229 | pmid = 929457 | doi=10.1016/0040-5809(77)90042-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predation===
[[Predation]] is hunting another species for food. This is a positive–negative (+ −) interaction in that the predator species benefits while the prey species is harmed. Some predators kill their prey before eating them (e.g., a hawk killing a mouse). Other predators are parasites that feed on prey while alive (e.g., a vampire bat feeding on a cow). Another example is the feeding on plants of [[herbivore]]s (e.g., a cow grazing). Predation may affect the population size of predators and prey and the number of species coexisting in a community.

===Mutualism===
[[Mutualism (biology)|Mutualism]] is an interaction between species in which both benefit. Examples include ''[[Rhizobium]]'' bacteria growing in nodules on the roots of legumes and insects pollinating the flowers of [[angiosperm]]s.

===Commensalism===
[[Commensalism]] is a type of relationship among organisms in which one organism benefits while the other organism is neither benefited nor harmed. The organism that benefited is called the ''commensal'' while the other organism that is neither benefited nor harmed is called the ''host''. For example, an [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] orchid attached to the tree for support benefits the orchid but neither harms nor benefits the tree.
The opposite of commensalism is [[amensalism]], an interspecific relationship in which a product of one organism has a negative effect on another organism but the original organism is unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Willey, Joanne M. |author2=Sherwood, Linda M. |author3=Woolverton Cristopher J. |title=Microbiology|year=2011|publisher=Prescott's|pages=713–738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parasitism ===
[[Parasitism]] is an interaction in which one organism, the host, is harmed while the other, the parasite, benefits.

==Community structure==
A major research theme among community ecology has been whether ecological communities have a (nonrandom) structure and, if so how to characterise this structure. Forms of community structure include [[overdispersion|aggregation]]&lt;ref&gt;Poulin, R. (2006) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8336.html Evolutionary Ecology of Parasites] ''Princeton University Press''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nestedness]].

'''Comparative biology''' uses natural variation and disparity to understand the patterns of life at all levels—from genes to communities—and the critical role of organisms in ecosystems.  Comparative biology is a cross-lineage approach to understanding the phylogenetic history of individuals or higher [[taxa]] and the mechanisms and patterns that drives it. Comparative biology encompasses [[Evolutionary Biology]], [[Systematics]], [[Neontology]], [[Paleontology]], [[Ethology]], [[Anthropology]], and [[Biogeography]] as well as historical approaches to [[Developmental biology]], [[Genomics]], [[Physiology]], [[Ecology]] and many other areas of the biological sciences.The comparative approach also has numerous applications in human health, [[genetics]], [[biomedicine]], and [[conservation biology]]. The biological relationships (phylogenies, pedigree) are important for comparative analyses and usually represented by a [[phylogenetic tree]] or [[cladogram]] to differentiate those features with single origins ([[Homology (biology)|Homology]]) from those with multiple origins ([[Homoplasy]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30766">'''Constructivist epistemology''' is a branch in [[philosophy of science]] maintaining that scientific knowledge is constructed by the scientific community, who seek to measure and construct models of the natural world. [[Natural science]] therefore consists of mental constructs that aim to explain sensory experience and measurements.

According to constructivists, the world is independent of human minds, but knowledge of the world is always a human and social construction.&lt;ref&gt;Crotty, M. 1998. ''The Foundations of Social Science Research: Meaning and Perspective in the Research Process'', Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivism opposes the philosophy of [[Objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|objectivism]], embracing the belief that a human can come to know the truth about the natural world not mediated by scientific approximations with different degrees of [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[accuracy]].

According to constructivists there is no single valid methodology in science, but rather a diversity of useful methods.&lt;ref&gt;(Schofield, n.d.) [http://www.ihrcs.ch/?p=92 Critical Theory and Constructivism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222335/http://www.ihrcs.ch/?p=92 |date=2016-03-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The term originates from [[Constructivism (psychological school)|psychology]], [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|education]], and [[social constructivism]].  The expression "constructivist epistemology" was first used by [[Jean Piaget]], 1967, with plural form in the famous article from the "Encyclopédie de la Pléiade" ''Logique et connaissance scientifique'' or "Logic and Scientific knowledge", an important text for [[epistemology]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} He refers directly to the mathematician [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] and his ''radical constructivism''.

The terms ''Constructionism'' and ''constructivism'' are often, but should not be, used interchangeably.  Constructionism is an approach to learning that was developed by Papert; the approach was greatly influenced by his work with Piaget, but it is very different. Constructionism involves the creation of a product to show learning.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation. [http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=8751190 Award Abstract #8751190, ''Constructionism: A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], as well as tables, chairs and atoms are [[social construction|socially constructed]]. [[Marx]] was among the first to suggest such an ambitious expansion of the power of ideas to inform the material realities of people's lives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==History==
Constructivism stems from a number of philosophies. For instance, early development can be attributed to the thought of Greek philosophers such as [[Heraclitus]] (''Everything flows, nothing stands still''), [[Protagoras]] (''Man is the measure of all things''). Protagoras is clearly represented by Plato and hence the tradition as a relativist. The Pyrrhonist sceptics have also been so interpreted. (Although this is more contentious.){{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Following the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with the phenomenology and the event, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] gives a decisive contradiction to Cartesians' epistemology that has grown since Descartes despite [[Giambattista Vico]] calling in ''Scienza nuova'' ("New Science") in 1725 that "the norm of the truth is to have made it". The Enlightenment's claim of the universality of [[Reason]] as the only true source of knowledge generated a Romantic reaction involving an emphasis on the separate natures of races, species, sexes and types of human.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

* [[Gaston Bachelard]], who is known for his physics psychoanalysis and the definition of an "epistemologic obstacle" that can disturb a changing of scientific paradigm as the one that occurred between classical mechanics and Einstein's relativism, opens the teleological way with "The meditation on the object takes the form of the project". In the following famous saying, he insists that the ways in which questions are posed determines the trajectory of scientific movement, before summarizing "nothing is given, all is constructed" : "And, irrespective of what one might assume, in the life of a science, problems do not arise by themselves. It is precisely this that marks out a problem as being of the true scientific spirit: all knowledge is in response to a question. If there  were no question, there would be no scientific knowledge. Nothing proceeds from itself. Nothing is given. All is constructed.", Gaston Bachelard (''La formation de l'esprit scientifique'', 1934). While quantum mechanics is starting to grow, Gaston Bachelard makes a call for a new science in ''Le nouvel esprit scientifique'' (The New Scientific Spirit).
* [[Paul Valéry]], French poet (20th century) reminds us of the importance of representations and action: "We have always sought explanations when it was only representations that we could seek to invent", "My hand feels touched as well as it touches; reality says this, and nothing more".
* This link with action, which could be called a "philosophy of action", was well represented by Spanish poet [[Antonio Machado]]: ''Caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar''.
* [[Ludwik Fleck]] establishes scientific constructivism by introducing the notions of ''thought collective'' (''Denkkollektiv''), and ''thought style'' (''Denkstil''), through which the evolution of science is much more understandable, because the research objects can be described in terms of the assumptions (thought style) that are shared for practical but also inherently social reasons, or just because any thought collective tends to preserve itself. These notions have been drawn upon by [[Thomas Kuhn]].

* [[Jean Piaget]], after the creation in 1955 of the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva, first uses the expression "constructivist epistemologies" (see above). According to [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], Jean Piaget is "the great pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowing" (in ''An Exposition of Constructivism: Why Some Like it Radical'', 1990) and "the most prolific constructivist in our century" (in ''Aspects of Radical Constructivism'', 1996).
* [[J. L. Austin]] is associated with the view that [[speech]] is not only passively describing a given reality, but it can change the (social) reality to which it is applied through [[speech act]]s.
* [[Herbert A. Simon]] called "the sciences of the artificial" these new sciences (cybernetics, cognitive sciences, decision and organisation sciences) that, because of the abstraction of their object (information, communication, decision), cannot match with the classical epistemology and its experimental method and refutability.

==Constructivism and sciences==
===Social constructivism in sociology===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[International relations]] --&gt;
{{Main|Social constructivism}}
One version of ''social constructivism'' contends that categories of knowledge and reality are actively created by social relationships and interactions. These interactions also alter the way in which scientific episteme is organized.

Social activity presupposes human beings inhabiting shared forms of life, and in the case of social construction, utilizing [[semiotic]] resources ([[meaning-making]] and signifying) with reference to social structures and institutions. Several traditions use the term ''Social Constructivism'': [[psychology]] (after [[Lev Vygotsky]]), [[sociology]] (after  [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], themselves influenced by [[Alfred Schütz]]), [[sociology of knowledge]] ([[David Bloor]]), [[sociology]] of [[mathematics]] ([[Sal Restivo]]), [[philosophy of mathematics]] ([[Paul Ernest]]). [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy can be seen as a foundation for ''social constructivism'', with its key theoretical concepts of ''language games'' embedded in ''forms of life''.

===Constructivism in philosophy of science===
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, "revolutions" in scientific practice and changes in [[Paradigm shift|"paradigms"]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn2&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions |url=http://turkpsikiyatri.org/arsiv/kuhn-ssr-2nded.pdf |author=Thomas S Kuhn |year=1966 |isbn=0226458121 |edition=2nd&lt;!--the 2nd edition is "enlarged" from the 1st, by addition of a postscript--&gt; |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=A paradigm governs, in the first instance, not a subject matter but rather a group of practitioners. Any study ... must begin by locating the responsible group or groups. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328173641/http://turkpsikiyatri.org/arsiv/kuhn-ssr-2nded.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, Kuhn suggested that the Sun-centric [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican "revolution"]] replaced the Earth-centric views of Ptolemy not because of empirical failures, but because of a new "paradigm" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.
{{quote|"But paradigm debates are not really about relative problem-solving ability, though for good reasons they are usually couched in those terms. Instead, the issue is which paradigm should in future guide research on problems many of which neither competitor can yet claim to resolve completely. A decision between alternate ways of practicing science is called for, and in the circumstances that decision must be based less on past achievement than on future promise. ... A decision of that kind can only be made on faith."|Thomas Kuhn|''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', pp 157-8}}

The view of reality as accessible only through models was called [[model-dependent realism]] by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Leonard Mlodinow]].&lt;ref name=Koonin&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution |author=Eugene V. Koonin |publisher=FT Press Science, a division of Pearson Education, Inc |isbn=013262317X |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvmv2kU6PrYC&amp;pg=PA427|page=427}}
&lt;/ref&gt; While not rejecting an independent reality, model-dependent  realism says that we can know only an approximation of it provided by the intermediary of models.&lt;ref name=Mlodinow&gt;
{{Cite book |quote=We shall adopt an approach that we call model-dependent realism. It is based on the idea that our brains interpret the input from our sensory organs by making a model of the world. When such a model is successful at explaining events, we tend to attribute to it, and to the elements and concepts that constitute it, the quality of reality or absolute truth. But there may be different ways in which one could model the same physical situation, with each employing different fundamental elements and concepts. If two such ...theories or models accurately predict the same events, one cannot be said to be more real than the other; rather we are free to use whichever model is the most convenient. |title=The Grand Design |author=Stephen Hawking, Leonard Mlodinow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoO9jkV-yzIC&amp;pg=PA8 |isbn=0553907077 |page=8 |year=2011 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
These models evolve over time as guided by scientific inspiration and experiment.

In the field of the social sciences, constructivism as an epistemology urges that researchers reflect upon the paradigms that may be underpinning their research, and in the light of this that they become more open to consider other ways of interpreting any results of the research. Furthermore, the focus is on presenting results as negotiable constructs rather than as models that aim to "represent" social realities more or less accurately. Norma Romm in her book Accountability in Social Research (2001) argues that social researchers can earn trust from participants and wider audiences insofar as they adopt this orientation and invite inputs from others regarding their inquiry practices and the results thereof.

In [[psychology]], constructivism refers to many schools of thought that, though extraordinarily different in their techniques (applied in fields such as [[education]] and [[psychotherapy]]), are all connected by a common critique of previous standard approaches, and by shared assumptions about the active constructive nature of human knowledge. In particular, the critique is aimed at the "associationist" postulate of empiricism, "by which the mind is conceived as a passive system that gathers its contents from its environment and, through the act of knowing, produces a copy of the order of reality."&lt;ref name="Balbi"&gt;{{cite web |last=Balbi |first=Juan |date=2008 |title=Epistemological and theoretical foundations of constructivist cognitive therapies: post-rationalist developments |journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=15–27 |url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-01-6.pdf |accessdate=2010-10-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708205138/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-01-6.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

In contrast, "constructivism is an epistemological premise grounded on the assertion that, in the act of knowing, it is the human mind that actively gives meaning and order to that reality to which it is responding".&lt;ref name="Balbi"/&gt;{{rp|16}}
The constructivist psychologies theorize about and investigate how human beings create systems for meaningfully understanding their worlds and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Raskin |first=Jonathan D. |date=Spring 2002 |title=Constructivism in psychology: personal construct psychology, radical constructivism, and social constructionism |journal=American Communication Journal |volume=5 |issue=3 |url=http://ac-journal.org/journal/vol5/iss3/special/raskin.pdf |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090209035603/http://ac-journal.org/journal/vol5/iss3/special/raskin.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivism and education===
{{Main|Constructivism (philosophy of education)}}

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] has published numerous social and educational books on critical constructivism (2001, 2005, 2008), a version of constructivist epistemology that places emphasis on the exaggerated influence of political and cultural power in the construction of knowledge, consciousness, and views of reality. In the contemporary mediated electronic era, Kincheloe argues, dominant modes of power have never exerted such influence on human affairs. Coming from a [[critical pedagogy|critical pedagogical]] perspective, Kincheloe argues that understanding a critical constructivist epistemology is central to becoming an educated person and to the institution of just social change.

Kincheloe's characteristics of critical constructivism:

*Knowledge is socially constructed: World and information co-construct one another
*Consciousness is a social construction
*Political struggles: Power plays an exaggerated role in the production of knowledge and consciousness
*The necessity of understanding consciousness—even though it does not lend itself to traditional reductionistic modes of measurability
*The importance of uniting logic and emotion in the process of knowledge and producing knowledge
*The inseparability of the knower and the known
*The centrality of the perspectives of oppressed peoples—the value of the insights of those who have suffered as the result of existing social arrangements
*The existence of multiple realities: Making sense of a world far more complex that we originally imagined
*Becoming humble knowledge workers: Understanding our location in the tangled web of reality
*Standpoint epistemology: Locating ourselves in the web of reality, we are better equipped to produce our own knowledges
*Constructing practical knowledge for critical social action
*Complexity: Overcoming reductionism
*Knowledge is always entrenched in a larger process
*The centrality of interpretation: Critical hermeneutics
*The new frontier of classroom knowledge: Personal experiences intersecting with pluriversal information
*Constructing new ways of being human: Critical ontology

===Constructivism and postmodernism===
For some{{who?|date=October 2017}} [[social constructionism]] has been described as a source of the [[postmodern movement]], and has been influential in the field of cultural studies. Some have gone so far as to attribute the rise of cultural studies (the cultural turn) to [[social constructionism]].

From a realist's point of view, both [[postmodernism]] and constructivism can be interpreted as [[relativism|relativist]] theories.

==Constructivist trends==

===Cultural constructivism===
Cultural constructivism asserts that knowledge and reality are a product of their cultural context, meaning that two independent cultures will likely form different observational methodologies.

===Radical constructivism===
{{See also|Francisco Varela|Humberto Maturana|Heinz von Foerster}}
[[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] was a prominent proponent of radical constructivism. This claims that knowledge is not a commodity which is transported from one mind into another. Rather, it is up to the individual to "link up" specific interpretations of experiences and ideas with their own reference of what is possible and viable. That is, the process of constructing knowledge, of understanding, is dependent on the individual's subjective interpretation of their active experience, not what "actually" occurs. Understanding and acting are seen by radical constructivists not as dualistic processes, but "circularly conjoined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalconstructivism.com|title=Radical Constructivism|author=|date=|website=www.radicalconstructivism.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419043612/http://radicalconstructivism.com/|archivedate=19 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Constructivist Foundations]]'' is a free online journal publishing peer reviewed articles on radical constructivism by researchers from multiple domains.

===Relational constructivism===
{{main|Relational constructivism}}
[[Relational constructivism]] can be perceived as a relational consequence of the radical constructivism. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e. ''self referentially operating cognition''). Therefore, humans are not able to come to objective conclusions about the world.

In spite of the subjectivity of human constructions of reality, relational constructivism focusses on the relational conditions applying to human perceptional processes. [[Björn Kraus]] puts it in a nutshell:

{{Zitat|„It is substantial for relational constructivism that it basically originates from an epistemological point of view, thus from the subject and its construction processes. Coming from this perspective it then focusses on the (not only social, but also material) relations under which these cognitive construction processes are performed. Consequently, it‘s not only about social construction processes, but about cognitive construction processes performed under certain relational conditions.“&lt;ref&gt;Björn Kraus: Plädoyer für den Relationalen Konstruktivismus und eine Relationale Soziale Arbeit. in Forum Sozial (2017) 1 pp. 29-35, {{cite web |url=http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015044520/http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948 |archivedate=2017-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Critical constructivism===
A series of articles published in the journal ''Critical Inquiry'' (1991) served as a manifesto for the movement of critical constructivism in various disciplines, including the [[natural science]]s.   Not only truth and reality, but also "[[evidence]]", "[[document]]", "[[experience]]", "[[fact]]", "proof", and other central categories of empirical research (in [[physics]], [[biology]], [[statistics]], [[history]], [[law]], etc.) reveal their contingent character as a social and ideological construction. Thus, a "realist" or "rationalist" interpretation is subjected to criticism.  Kincheloe's political and pedagogical notion (above) has emerged as a central articulation of the concept.

While recognizing the constructedness of reality, many representatives of this critical paradigm deny philosophy the task of the creative construction of reality.  They eagerly criticize realistic judgments, but they do not move beyond analytic procedures based on subtle [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].  They thus remain in the critical paradigm and consider it to be a standard of scientific philosophy per se.

===Genetic epistemology===
{{main|Genetic epistemology}}
[[James Mark Baldwin]] invented this expression, which was later popularized by [[Jean Piaget]]. From 1955 to 1980, Piaget was Director of the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva.

==Criticisms==
Numerous criticisms have been leveled at Constructivist epistemology. The most common one is that it either explicitly advocates or implicitly reduces to [[relativism]]. This is because it takes the concept of truth to be a socially "constructed" (and thereby socially relative) one. This leads to the charge of [[Self-refuting idea|self-refutation]]: if what is to be regarded as "true" is relative to a particular social formation, then this very conception of [[truth]] must itself be only regarded as being "true" in this society. In another social formation, it may well be false. If so, then social constructivism itself would be false in that social formation. Further, one could then say that social constructivism could be both true and false simultaneously.

Another criticism of constructivism is that it holds that the concepts of two different social formations be entirely different and incommensurate. This being the case, it is impossible to make comparative judgements about statements made according to each worldview. This is because the criteria of judgement will themselves have to be based on some worldview or other. If this is the case, then it brings into question how communication between them about the truth or falsity of any given statement could be established.

Social Constructivists{{Who|date=July 2009}} often argue that constructivism is liberating because it either (1) enables oppressed groups to reconstruct "the World" in accordance with their own interests rather than according to the interests of dominant groups in society, or (2) compels people to respect the alternative worldviews of oppressed groups because there is no way of judging them to be inferior to dominant worldviews. As the [[Wittgenstein]]ian philosopher [[Gavin Kitching]]&lt;ref&gt;Kitching, G. 2008. ''The Trouble with Theory: The Educational Costs of Postmodernism''. Penn State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argues, however, constructivists usually implicitly presuppose a [[deterministic]] view of language which severely constrains the minds and use of words by members of societies: they are not just "constructed" by language on this view, but are literally "determined" by it. Kitching notes the contradiction here: somehow the advocate of constructivism is not similarly constrained. While other individuals are controlled by the dominant concepts of society, the advocate of constructivism can transcend these concepts and see through them.

==History==

Discussion on the brain's criticality have been done since 1950, with the paper on the imitation game for a Turing test.&lt;ref&gt;Turing, A. M. Computing machinery and intelligence. Mind 59, 433–460 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Herz and Hopfield noted that self-organized criticality (SOC) models for earthquakes were mathematically equivalent to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, and speculated that perhaps SOC would occur in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Herz, A. V. &amp; Hopfield, J. J. Earthquake cycles and neural reverberations: collective oscillations in systems with pulse-coupled threshold elements. Physical Review Letters 75, 1222 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously Stassinopoulos and  Bak proposed a simple neural network model working at criticality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stassinopoulos|first=Dimitris|last2=Bak|first2=Per|date=1995-05-01|title=Democratic reinforcement: A principle for brain function|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.51.5033|journal=Physical Review E|volume=51|issue=5|pages=5033–5039|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.51.5033|bibcode=1995PhRvE..51.5033S}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was expanded latter by Chialvo and Bak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chialvo|first=D.R.|last2=Bak|first2=P.|title=Learning from mistakes|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(98)00472-2|journal=Neuroscience|volume=90|issue=4|pages=1137–1148|doi=10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00472-2|arxiv=adap-org/9707006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the hypothesis found experimental support by Beggs and Plenz&lt;ref&gt;Beggs, J.

The software is designed to help developing countries achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and work towards [[sustainable development]]. The software package was developed by members of the Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators (CGSDI),&lt;ref&gt;Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators.

'''''Dastūr al-Mulūk''''' ({{lang-fa|دستور الملوک}})&lt;ref&gt;Variants: ''Dastur al-Moluk'', ''Dastur-ol-Moluk'', ''Dastur-ul-Muluk'', ''Dastūr-ul-Mulūk''.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of only three surviving [[administrative handbook]]s from early 18th-century [[Safavid]] [[Iran]] and an important research tool for scholars in [[Iranology]]. The Persian manuscript was edited during the 1960s by the Iranian scholar [[Mohammad Taqi Danesh Pajouh]].

A Russian translation by Dr Vil'danova appeared in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]], in the 1990s. In 2002, an annotated English translation ({{ISBN|983-9379-26-7}}), which contains also a facsimile of what was then thought among scholars to be the complete manuscript, was published and translated into English for the first time by the German scholar [[:de:Christoph Marcinkowski|Christoph Marcinkowski]], based on his dissertation. 

Already in 2000, this dissertation was awarded by then Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]] the First Prize for Best Research on Iranian Culture Award for the Year 2000 (International Category) by the Iranian Ministry of Culture. A Persian translation of Marcinkowski's 2002 study by Ali Kordabadi and Mansur Sefatgol appeared in 1385 AH solar (2006 CE) in Tehran at Markaz-e Asnad va Tarikh-e Diplomasi (published by the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs). 

Subsequently, the Iranian scholar [[Iraj Afshar]] discovered and edited the remainder of the manuscript. This part, too, was translated into English and discussed by Dr. Marcinkowski in the ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'', the journal of the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]] (see below).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23841">The '''dear enemy effect''' or '''dear enemy recognition''' is an [[ethological]] phenomenon in which two neighbouring [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] [[animals]] become less aggressive toward one another once territorial borders are well-established.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, J., {1954}. Evolution and bird sociality. In: ''Evolution As a Process'' (Huxley, J., Hardy, A. and Ford, E., eds). London, Allen and Unwin. pp. 71-83&lt;/ref&gt; As territory owners become accustomed to their neighbours, they expend less time and energy on defensive behaviors directed toward one another. However, aggression toward unfamiliar neighbours remains the same.&lt;ref name="Alcock" &gt;{{cite book | last = Alcock | first = John | title = Animal Behavior, 9th Ed. | publisher = Sinauer Associates | pages = 281–282 | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-87893-225-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors have suggested the dear enemy effect is territory residents displaying lower levels of aggression toward familiar neighbours compared to unfamiliar individuals who are non-territorial "floaters".&lt;ref name="Bee"&gt;Bee, M.A., (2003).  A test of the "dear enemy effect" in the strawberry dart-poison frog (''Dendrobates pumilio''). Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 54: 601-610&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosell and Bjørkøyli" /&gt;

The dear enemy effect has been observed in a wide range of animals including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates.

The behavioural effect can be modulated by factors such as the location of the familiar and unfamiliar animal, the season, and the presence of females.

The dear enemy effect is the converse of the [[nasty neighbour effect]] in which some species are more aggressive towards their neighbours than towards unfamiliar strangers.

==Function==
The ultimate function of the dear enemy effect is to increase the individual [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the animal expressing the behaviour.  This increase in fitness is achieved by reducing the time, energy or risk of injury unnecessarily incurred by defending a territory or its resources (e.g. mate, food, space) against a familiar animal with its own territory; the territory-holder already knows about the abilities of the neighbour, and also knows that the neighbour is unlikely to try to take over the territory because it already has one.

==Mechanism==
The interaction between two neighbours can be modelled as an iterated [[Prisoner’s dilemma|prisoner's dilemma]] game. In this view, a territory owner that acts non-aggressively towards a neighbour can be thought of as [[Cooperation|cooperating]], while a territory owner that acts aggressively towards its neighbour can be considered to have defected. A necessary condition for the prisoner’s dilemma game to hold is that an aggressive individual should enjoy greater benefits than a non-aggressive individual when each is faced with a non-aggressive opponent. This stipulation is plausible, as an aggressive individual might enlarge their territory or steal food or matings from a non-aggressive individual.&lt;ref name="Akçay" /&gt;  When cooperation involves a cost, a possible mechanism for achieving stable co-operation is [[reciprocal altruism]], where pairs of individuals trade bouts of cooperative behaviour with one another.  Dear enemy cooperation could be explained by reciprocal altruism if territorial neighbours use conditional strategies such as [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]]. In the tit-for-tat strategy, a subject will cooperate when its partner (neighbour) cooperates and defect when the partner defects.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, J., (2002).  Conditional strategies in territorial defense: do Carolina wrens play tit-for-tat?  Behavioral Ecology, 13: 664-669. DOI: 10.1093/beheco/13.5.664&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==

===In mammals===
[[File:Badger-badger.jpg|right|thumb|Eurasian badgers respond less aggressively to the scent of familiar conspecifics than unfamiliar]]
Territorial [[Eurasian beaver]]s (''Castor fiber'') presented with a two-way [[Preference tests (animals)|choice]] sniffed both castoreum and anal gland secretion from a stranger longer than from a neighbour.  Furthermore, beavers responded aggressively (stood on the mound on their hind feet, pawing and/or overmarking) longer to castoreum, but not to anal gland secretion, from a stranger than from a neighbour. When the mounds containing the scents were allowed to remain overnight and the beavers' responses measured the following morning, the beavers' responses were stronger to both castoreum and anal gland secretion from a stranger than from a neighbour.&lt;ref name="Rosell and Bjørkøyli"&gt;Rosell, F. and Bjørkøyli, T. (2002). A test of the dear enemy phenomenon in the Eurasian beaver. Animal Behaviour, 63: 1073–1078&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurasian badger]]s (''Meles meles'') can discriminate between self-, neighbour- and unfamiliar- group faeces near their main [[sett]]. Badgers show heightened behavioural responses towards unfamiliar- compared with self-group scents, but there is no difference in response to neighbour- relative to self-group scents. The relative responses towards unfamiliar-group scents are greatest during the breeding seasons, but there is no seasonal differences in the responses to neighbour-group versus self-group scents. In badger populations, levels of aggression between neighbouring territory-holders are likely to be kept relatively low through neighbour recognition. However, increased levels of aggression will be shown towards dispersing or itinerant (alien) badgers, especially during periods such as the breeding season when the potential threats to the long-term fitness of territory owners are greatest.&lt;ref&gt;Palphramand1, K.L. and White, P.C.L., (2007).  Badgers, Meles meles, discriminate between neighbour, alien and self scent.  Animal Behaviour, 74: 429–436&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red squirrels]] are able to discriminate the odours of familiar neighbours and strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Vaché, M., Ferron, J. and Gouat, P., (2001). The ability of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to discriminate conspecific olfactory signatures. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 79: 1296-1300&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this discrimination may be used by males to avoid unnecessary chases and fights by becoming known to their neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Tamiasciurus_hudsonicus/|title=Animal Diversity Web -''Tamiasciurus hudsonicus'' red squirrel|author=Rubin, C.|year=2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
[[File:Mochuelo Común ( Athene noctua )(1).jpg|thumb|right|upright|The little owl hoots less intensively at familiar neighbours than unfamiliar]]

Audio playback studies are often used to test the dear enemy effect in birds.  These studies have demonstrated several bird species respond more aggressively to played back songs of strangers than to songs of neighbours including the [[alder flycatcher]] (''Empidonax alnorum''),&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, S.F. (2004). Neighbor-stranger discrimination by song in a suboscine bird, the alder flycatcher, ''Empidonax alnorum''. Behavioral Ecology, 15: 799-804  DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arh082&lt;/ref&gt; male [[Dendragapus|blue grouse]],&lt;ref&gt;Falls, J.B. and McNicholl, M.K., (1979). Neighbor-stranger discrimination by song in male blue grouse. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 57: 457-462&lt;/ref&gt; [[European robin]] (''Erithacus rubecula''),&lt;ref&gt;Brindley, E.L., (1991). Response of European robins to playback of song: neighbor recognition and overlapping. Animal Behaviour, 41: 503-512&lt;/ref&gt; and male [[banded wren]] (''Thryothorus pleurostictus'').&lt;ref&gt;Mollesf, L.E. and Vehrencamp, S.L., (2001). Neighbour recognition by resident males in the banded wren, Thryothorus pleurostictus, a tropical songbird with high song type sharing.  Animal Behaviour, 61: 119–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbouring male [[song sparrow]]s (''Melodia melospiza'') differ individually in their aggressiveness. Increased aggression by residents towards intruders indicates that residents not only respond to intrinsic aggressiveness of their neighbours, but also to short-term changes in aggression levels.&lt;ref name="Akçay"&gt;Akçay, C. et al., (2009). Good neighbour, bad neighbour: song sparrows retaliate against aggressive rivals. Animal Behaviour, 78: 97–102&lt;/ref&gt;

Although neighbour–stranger discrimination has been reported in many [[passerine]] birds, it has seldom been investigated in territorial non-passerine species. The nocturnal [[Bird of prey|raptor]], the [[little owl]] (''Athene noctua''), hoots to defend its territory.  Male little owls respond less to their neighbour's hoots played back from the usual location. However, responses to playback of a neighbour from an unusual location are similar to responses to playback of a stranger's hoots from either location.&lt;ref&gt;Hardouin, L.A., Tabel, P. and Bretagnolle, V., (2006).  Neighbour–stranger discrimination in the little owl, ''Athene noctua''. Animal Behaviour, 72: 105–112&lt;/ref&gt;

During the breeding season of the [[skylark]] (''Alauda arvensis''), particular common sequences of syllables (phrases) are produced by all males established in the same location (neighbours), whereas males of different locations (strangers) share only few syllables. Playback experiments provided evidence for neighbour–stranger discrimination consistent with the dear enemy effect, indicating that shared sequences were recognized and identified as markers of the group identity.&lt;ref name="Briefer"&gt;Briefer, E., Aubin, T., Lehongre, K. and Rybak, F., (2008).  How to identify dear enemies: the group signature in the complex song of the skylark ''Alauda arvensis''. Journal of Experimental Biology, 211: 317-326. DOI: 10.1242/jeb.013359&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that the dear enemy effect changes during the breeding season of the skylark.  Playbacks of neighbour and stranger songs at three periods of the breeding season show that neighbours are dear enemies in the middle of the season, when territories are stable, but not at the beginning of the breeding season, during settlement and pair formation, nor at the end, when bird density increases due to the presence of young birds becoming independent. In song sparrows, where neighbours are most often the sires of extra-pair offspring&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=C |title=Extra-pair paternity, song, and genetic quality in song sparrows. |journal=Behavioural Ecology |date=2011 |volume=22 |page=73-81}}&lt;/ref&gt;, males will alter their aggression toward neighbouring males with their female's fertility status. When presented with simulated stranger and neighbour intruders during their female's pre-fertile and post-fertile periods, males displayed the dear enemy effect&lt;ref name="Moser-Purdy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moser-Purdy |first1=C |last2=MacDougall-Shackleton |first2=E |last3=Mennill |first3=D. J. |title=Enemies are not always dear: male song sparrows adjust dear enemy effect expression in response to female fertility |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2017 |volume=126 |page=17-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, when presented with simulated stranger and neighbour intruders during their female's fertile period, males exhibited an equal response to both stimuli, likely in order to protect their paternity&lt;ref name="Moser-Purdy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moser-Purdy |first1=C |last2=MacDougall-Shackleton |first2=E |last3=Mennill |first3=D. J. |title=Enemies are not always dear: male song sparrows adjust dear enemy effect expression in response to female fertility |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2017 |volume=126 |page=17-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, the dear enemy relationship is not a fixed pattern but a flexible one likely to evolve with social and ecological circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Briefer, E., Rybak, F. and Aubin, T., (2008).  When to be a dear enemy: flexible acoustic relationships of neighbouring skylarks, Alauda arvensis.  Animal Behaviour, 76: 1319–1325&lt;/ref&gt;

===In reptiles===
[[File:Anolis sagrei sagrei (displaying).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A brown anole displaying with its [[dewlap]]]]
Males of a territorial lizard, the tawny dragon (''[[Ctenophorus]] decresii''), reduced their aggression levels in repeat interactions with familiar rivals and increased their aggression levels towards unfamiliar males. The time taken for interactions to be settled was also lower towards familiar than unfamiliar males.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, L., (2005).  Rival recognition in the territorial tawny dragon (Ctenophorus decresii).  Acta Ethologica, 8: 45-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Another territorial lizard, the [[common collared lizard]] (''Crotaphytus collaris''), can individually recognize neighbours and will increase aggression towards them as the threat to territorial ownership increases. Resident males treat familiar neighbours that had been moved to the opposite boundary to the shared boundary as equally aggressive as strangers. However, residents responded more aggressively towards strangers than towards neighbours on natural territories and also in neutral arena encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Husakf, J.F. and Fox, S.F., (2003).  Adult male collared lizards, Crotaphytus collaris, increase aggression towards displaced neighbours.  Animal Behaviour, 65: 391–396&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[brown anole]] lizard (''Anolis sagrei''), dyads of males behave differently
depending on whether the lizards are prior neighbours, with prior neighbours exhibiting fewer bobbing relative to nodding forms of headbob displays than non-neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;McMann, S. and Paterson, A.V., (2012).  Display behavior of resident brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) during close encounters with neighbors and nonneighbors. Herpetological Conservation and Biology, 7(1): 27−37&lt;/ref&gt;

===In amphibians===

Males of the territorial breeding [[agile frog]] (''Rana dalmatina''), have a large variability in call characteristics and are able to discriminate between neighbouring and unfamiliar conspecifics. Calling is of the longest duration in response to an unfamiliar acoustic stimulus; in contrast, the response to a familiar conspecific call does not show any difference from solitary vocalisations.&lt;ref&gt;Lesbarrèresa, D. and Lodéa, T., (2002). Variations in male calls and responses to an unfamiliar advertisement call in a territorial breeding anuran, Rana dalmatina: evidence for a “dear enemy” effect. Ethology, Ecology &amp; Evolution, 14: 287-295. DOI:10.1080/08927014.2002.9522731&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial red-backed salamanders, ''Plethodon cinereus'', defend territories under rocks and logs on the forest floor in the eastern USA.  Individuals are more aggressive to unfamiliar salamanders than to familiar individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, R. G., (1981).  Dear enemy recognition and the costs of aggression between salamanders.  American Naturalist 117: 964-972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fish===

The dear enemy effect in male variegated pupfish (''[[Cyprinodon]] variegatus'') is dependent on the presence of females.  Reduced aggression consistent with dear enemy recognition occurs between conspecific neighbours in the absence of females, but the presence of a female in a male's territory instigates comparably greater aggression between the neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Leiser, J.K., (2003). When are neighbours ‘dear enemies’ and when are they not? The responses of territorial male variegated pupfish, Cyprinodon variegatus, to neighbours, strangers and heterospecifics. Animal Behaviour, 65: 453–462&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have staged three-way contests between male [[convict cichlid]]s (''Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum'') to examine the dear enemy effect. When faced with a familiar neighbour and an unfamiliar intruder simultaneously, residents preferentially confronted the unfamiliar opponent. That is, the establishment of dear enemy recognition between a resident and a neighbour allowed the resident to direct his aggression to the greater competitive threat, i.e. the intruder.&lt;ref&gt;Leiser, J.K. and Itzkowitz, M., (1989).  The benefits of dear enemy recognition in three-contender convict cichlid (Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum) contests. Behaviour, 136: 983-1003&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual recognition of noises produced males of the bicolor [[damselfish]] (''Pomacentrus partitus'') have been demonstrated in the field. Playbacks of non-resident sounds from a given fish's territory elicit a greater response from its nearest neighbour than playbacks of the resident's sound. Testing also included switching the sounds of the two nearest neighbours relative to each respective male's territory. Results demonstrated that all males in the colony individually recognize the sounds of their two nearest neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Myrberg, A.A. and Riggio, R.J., (1985).  Acoustically mediated individual recognition by a coral reef fish (Pomacentrus partitus). Animal Behaviour, 33: 411–416&lt;/ref&gt;

===In invertebrates===

The home ranges of colony living ants often overlap the ranges of other conspecific colonies and colonies of other species. In laboratory experiments, the frequency and severity of agonistic interactions among workers from different colonies increases with the distance between their nests; this has been reported for ''[[Leptothorax nylanderi]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hkinzk, J., Foitzik, S., Hippert, A. and Hölldobler, B., (1996).  Apparent dear-enemy phenomenon and environment-based recognition cues in the ant Leptothorax nylanderi. Ethology, 102: 510–522. DOI: 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1996.tb01143.x&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pheidole]]'' ants.&lt;ref&gt;Langen, T.A., Tripet, F. and Nonacs, P., (2000).  The red and the black: habituation and the dear-enemy phenomenon in two desert ''Pheidole'' ants.  Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 48: 285-292&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild, male bees of the species ''[[Xylocopa micans]]'' have been known to slowly fly into the territory of an adjacent male territory holder in order to test and establish the mutual boundary of their two territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Territorial Behavior in Male Xylocopa micans (Hymenoptera: Anthophoridae)|jstor = 25083909|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|date = 1979-04-01|pages = 313–323|volume = 52|issue = 2|first = Gordon W.|last = Frankie|first2 = S. B.|last2 = Vinson|first3 = Alcinda|last3 = Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dear enemy effect has been reported in colonies of the fungus-growing termite [[Macrotermitinae|''Macrotermes falciger'']]. Behavioural tests with workers reveal no alarm behaviour or mortality in pairings of workers from the same colony but a full range from no alarm to overt aggression, with associated death, when individuals were paired from different colonies. The level of mortality increases with differences in the composition of [[Cuticle|cuticular]] [[hydrocarbons]] between colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Kaib1, M., Franke, S., Francke, W. and Brand, R., (2002).  Cuticular hydrocarbons in a termite: phenotypes and a neighbour–stranger effect. Physiological Entomology, 27, 189–198. DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-3032.2002.00292.x&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crabby Fiddler - Flickr - Andrea Westmoreland.jpg|thumb|right|Male sand fiddler crabs attract mates by waving]]Male sand fiddler crabs (''[[Uca pugilator]]'') defend territories that consist of a breeding burrow and a display area where they wave their claw to attract females. Burrow-holding males engage in agonistic contests with both intruding males that attempt burrow take-overs and with other territory-holding neighbours that apparently attempt to limit waving or other surface activities of rivals. Contests consist of one or more behavioural elements that range from no claw contact to use of the claw to push, grip, or flip an opponent.  In the field, contests with intruders begin at higher intensities and escalate more rapidly than those with neighbours. However, resident-resident contests increase in intensity when burrows are close, neighbours faced each other when exiting burrows, and neighbours were of similar size. Proximity and orientation determine the ease with which a neighbour may be engaged.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, A.E. and McLain, D.K., (2006).  How dear is my enemy: Intruder-resident and resident-resident encounters in male sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator). Behaviour, 143: 597-617&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nasty neighbour effect or no effect==

A range of studies have found evidence of an effect opposite to the dear enemy effect, i.e. more aggression is shown toward neighbours than strangers.  This has been termed the "nasty neighbour" effect.

[[File:Oophaga pumilio Zoo.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Strawberry dart-poison frog]]
{{Listen|filename=Oophaga_pumilio_call.ogg|left|title=Listen to the strawberry dart-poison frog|description=Male advertisement call|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Colonies of the [[weaver ant]] (''Oecophylla smaragdina'') are able to recognize a greater proportion of workers from neighbouring colonies as non-colony members.  When recognized as non-colony members, more aggression is exhibited toward neighbours than non-neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Newey, P.S., Robson, S.K. and Crozier, R.H., (2010).  Weaver ants Oecophylla smaragdina encounter nasty neighbors rather than dear enemies.  Ecology, 91(8):2366-72&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Banded mongoose]] (''Mungos mungo'') groups vocalize more and inspect more scent samples in response to olfactory cues of neighbours than strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, C.A. and Manser, M.B., (2007). ‘Nasty neighbours’ rather than ‘dear enemies’ in a social carnivore. Proc. R. Soc. B., 274: 959-965&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that increased aggression towards neighbours is more common in social species with intense competition between neighbours, as opposed to reduced aggression towards neighbours typical for most solitary species.  Furthermore, animals may respond in this way when encounters with intruders from non-neighbouring colonies are rare and of little consequence.

Female [[New Zealand bellbird]]s (''Anthornis melanura'') are more aggressive toward the songs of neighbouring females. This is opposite to the dear enemy phenomenon and suggests that neighbouring females pose a greater threat than strangers in his species.&lt;ref&gt;Brunton, D.H., Evans, B., Cope, T. and Ji, W. (2008).  A test of the dear enemy hypothesis in female New Zealand bellbirds (Anthornis melanura): female neighbors as threats. Behavioral Ecology, 19 (4): 791-798. DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arn027 [http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/arn027v1]&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of studies have found no evidence of the dear enemy effect showing the effect is not universal. Territorial males of the strawberry dart-poison frog (''Dendrobates pumilio'')&lt;ref name="Bee" /&gt; and the [[spotted antbird]] (''Hylophylax naevioides'')&lt;ref&gt;Bard, S., Hau, M., Wikelski, M. and Wingfield, J.C. (2002).  Vocal distinctiveness and response to conspecific playback in the spotted antbird. Condor, 104: 387-394&lt;/ref&gt; do not discriminate behaviourally between the calls of neighbours and strangers, and female collared lizards show no difference in their behaviour to neighbouring or unfamiliar females.&lt;ref&gt;Husak, J.F. and Fox, S.F., (2003).  Spatial organisation and the dear enemy phenomenon in adult female collared lizards.,  Journal of Herpetology, 37, 211-215 [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1565856?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102326133101]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guinea baboon]] (''Papio papio'') males which live in gangs do not differ in their response behaviour toward neighbouring and stranger males and largely ignore any non-gang member, irrespective of familiarity; that is, they neither show a “dear enemy” nor “nasty neighbour” effect.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej, P., Patzelt, A., Ndao, I., Hammerschmidt, K. and Julia Fischer, J., (2013).  Social monitoring in a multilevel society: a playback study with male Guinea baboons. Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol., 67(1): 61–68. DOI: 10.1007/s00265-012-1425-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Digital do MaiN's power amplifiers use V-FET technology transistors. Initially developed by [[Yamaha|Nippon Gakki Seizo K.K.]] in the 1970s (US Patent 4,216,038&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wikipatents.org/patent/US4216038A-semiconductor-device-and-manufacturing-process-thereof | author=[[Junichi Nishizawa|Nishizawa, Jun-ichi]] |author2=Mochida, Yasunori |author3=Nonaka, Terumoto |author4=Hotta, Tadahiko |author5= Yamashita, Shin  | title=US Patent 4,216,038 | work=[[Yamaha Corporation|Nippon Gakki Seizo Kabushiki Gaisha]] | publisher=Wikipatents | accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;), technology was improved, and 2SK77B transistor had been released.

'''Diodorus Siculus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|d|ɔː|r|ə|s|_|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|j|ʊ|l|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Διόδωρος Σικελιώτης}} ''Diodoros Sikeliotes'') ({{fl.}}&amp;nbsp;1st century BC) or '''Diodorus of Sicily''' was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]]. He is known for writing the monumental [[universal history]] ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', much of which survives, between 60 and 30 BC. It is arranged in three parts. The first covers mythic history up to the destruction of [[Troy]], arranged geographically, describing regions around the world from Egypt, India and Arabia to Greece and Europe. The second covers the [[Trojan War]] to the death of [[Alexander the Great]]. The third covers the period to about 60 BC. ''Bibliotheca'', meaning 'library', acknowledges that he was drawing on the work of many other authors.

==Life==
According to his own work, he was born at [[Agira|Agyrium]] in [[Sicily]] (now called Agira).&lt;ref&gt;Diod. ''History'' 1.4.4.&lt;/ref&gt; With one exception, [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] affords no further information about his life and doings beyond in his work. Only [[Jerome]], in his ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' under the "year of [[Abraham]] 1968" (49 BC), writes, "Diodorus of Sicily, a writer of Greek history, became illustrious". However, his [[English language|English]] translator, [[Charles Henry Oldfather]], remarks on the "striking coincidence"&lt;ref&gt;''Diodorus of Sicily In Twelve Volumes'' by [[Charles Henry Oldfather]] (1977), Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; that one of only two known Greek inscriptions from Agyrium (''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' XIV, 588) is the tombstone of one "Diodorus, the son of Apollonius".&lt;ref&gt;''Ctesias' Persian History: Introduction, text, and translation by Ctesias'' by Jan P. Stronk (2010), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

[[File:Bibliotheca historica.tif|thumb|''Bibliotheca historica'', 1746]]
Diodorus' [[universal history]], which he named ''Bibliotheca historica'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἱστορικὴ Βιβλιοθήκη}}, "Historical Library"), was immense and consisted of 40 books, of which 1–5 and 11–20 survive:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164108/Diodorus-Siculus "Diodorus Siculus" entry in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''].&lt;/ref&gt; fragments of the lost books are preserved in [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] and the excerpts of [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus]].

It was divided into three sections. The first six books treated the mythic history of the non-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] and Hellenic tribes to the destruction of Troy and are geographical in theme, and describe the history and culture of [[Ancient Egypt]] (book I), of [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], [[Scythia]], and [[Arabia]] (II), of [[North Africa]] (III), and of [[Greece]] and Europe (IV–VI).

In the next section (books VII&amp;ndash;XVII), he recounts the history of the world from the [[Trojan War]] down to the [[death of Alexander the Great]]. The last section (books XVII to the end) concerns the historical events from the [[Diadochi|successors of Alexander]] down to either 60 BC or the beginning of [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars]]. (The end has been lost, so it is unclear whether Diodorus reached the beginning of the Gallic War as he promised at the beginning of his work or, as evidence suggests, old and tired from his labours he stopped short at 60 BC.) He selected the name "Bibliotheca" in acknowledgment that he was assembling a composite work from many sources. Identified authors on whose works he drew include [[Hecataeus of Abdera]], [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], [[Ephorus]], [[Theopompus]], [[Hieronymus of Cardia]], [[Duris of Samos]], [[Diyllus]], [[Philistus]], [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], [[Polybius]], and [[Posidonius]].

His account of [[gold mining]] in [[Nubia]] in eastern [[Egypt]] is one of the earliest extant texts on the topic, and describes in vivid detail the use of [[slave labour]] in terrible working conditions. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] wrote a Commentary on Diodorus's ''Analemma''. The now lost ''Analemma'' applied geometrical constructions in a plane to solve some astronomy-related problems of spherical geometry. It contained, for example, a discussion of sundial theory.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Jones, Introduction, ''Pappus of Alexandria Book 7 of the Collection: Part 1. Introduction, Text, and Translation'' (2013) ed., Tr. &amp; commentary by Alexander Jones, ''Sources in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences 8''&lt;/ref&gt;

He also gave an account of the [[Gauls]]:
"The Gauls are terrifying in aspect and their voices are deep and altogether harsh; when they meet together they converse with few words and in riddles, hinting darkly at things for the most part and using one word when they mean another; and they like to talk in superlatives, to the end that they may extol themselves and depreciate all other men. They are also boasters and threateners and are fond of pompous language, and yet they have sharp wits and are not without cleverness at learning." (Book 5)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5B*.html|title=LacusCurtius • Diodorus Siculus — Book V Chapters 19‑40|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem Functional Types &lt;ref name="Paruelo2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2006"/&gt; are defined as groups of [[ecosystems]] or patches of the land surface that share similar dynamics of matter and energy exchanges between the [[Environment (biophysical)|biota and the physical environment]]. The EFT concept is analogous to the [[Plant functional type|Plant Functional Types]] (PFTs) concept, but defined at a higher level of the [[biological organization]]. As plant species can be grouped according to common functional characteristics, ecosystems can be grouped according to their common functional behavior.

One of the most used approaches to implement this concept has been the identification of EFTs from the satellite-derived dynamics of [[primary production]],&lt;ref name="Paruelo2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2006"/&gt; an essential and integrative descriptor of ecosystem functioning.&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Virginia|title=Principles of ecosystem function.

== History ==

In 1992, Soriano and Paruelo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Soriano|author2=Paruelo|last-author-amp=yes|title=Biozones: vegetation units defined by functional characters identifiable with the aid of satellite sensor images.|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters|date=1992|pages=82–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the concept of Biozones to identify vegetation units that share ecosystem functional characteristics using [[time-series]] of satellite images of spectral vegetation indices. Biozones were later renamed to EFTs by Paruelo et al. (2001),&lt;ref name="Paruelo2001"/&gt; using an equivalent definition and methodology.

Shugart (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shugart|first1=H.H.|title=Plant and ecosystem functional types. Plant functional types: their relevance to ecosystem properties and global change (ed. by T.M. Smith, H.H. Shugart and F.I. Woodward),|journal=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|pages=20–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first authors that used the term EFT as “aggregated components of ecosystems whose interactions with one another and with the environment produce differences in patterns of ecosystem structure and dynamics”. Walker (1997) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=B.H.|title=Functional types in non-equilibrium ecosystems. Plant functional types: their relevance to ecosystem properties and global change (ed. by T.M. Smith, H.H. Shugart and F.I. Woodward)|journal=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|pages=91–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the use of a similar term, vegetation functional types, for groups of PFTs in sets that constitute the different states of [[ecological succession|vegetation succession]] in non-equilibrium ecosystems. The same term was applied by Scholes et al. (1997) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scholes|title=Plant functional types in African savannas and grasslands.

Several studies have applied hierarchy and patch dynamic theories &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aber|title=Group report: hydrological and biogeochemical processes in complex landscapes — what is the role of temporal and spatial ecosystem dynamics?Integrating hydrology, ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemistry in complex landscapes|date=1999|publisher=|editor=J.D.

== EFTs identification ==

The functional classification of EFTs developed by Paruelo et al. (2001)&lt;ref name="Paruelo2001"/&gt; and Alcaraz-Segura et al. (2006, 2013)  &lt;ref name="Alcaraz2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2013"/&gt; uses time series of spectral vegetation indexes to capture the carbon gains dynamics, the most integrative indicator of ecosystem functioning.&lt;ref name="Virginia"/&gt; To build EFTs, these authors derive three descriptors or metrics from the seasonal dynamics (annual curve) of spectral vegetation indexes (VI) that capture most of the variance in the time series (Fig.2):&lt;ref name="Paruelo2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2013"/&gt; [[File:AnualDynamics EVI 3vars.png|Fig.2: Annual curve of spectral vegetation indexes (VI: Enhanced Vegetation Index (MODIS-EVI)|thumbnail|350px]]

* Annual mean of VI (VI_Mean): estimator of annual [[primary production]], one of the most essential and integrative descriptors of ecosystem functioning. 
* Intra-annual coefficient of variation of VI (VI_sCV): descriptor of [[seasonality]] or differences in carbon gains between the growing and non growing seasons.
* Date of maximum VI value (VI_DMAX): [[Phenology|phenological]] indicator of when in the year does the growing season take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pettorelli|title=Using the satellite-derived NDVI to assess ecological responses to environmental change.|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=2005|volume=20|pages=503–510|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcaraz2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alcaraz-Segura|title=Baseline characterization of major Iberian vegetation types based on the NDVI dynamics.|journal=Plant Ecology|date=2009|volume=202|pages=13–29|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1007/s11258-008-9555-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of values of each VI metric is divided into four intervals, giving the potential number of 4x4x4=64 EFTs. Each EFT is assigned a code of two letters and a number (three characters). The first letter of the code (capital) corresponds to the VI_Mean level, ranging from A to D for low to high (increasing) VI_Mean or productivity. The second letter (small) shows the seasonal CV, ranging from a to d for high (decreasing) to low VI_sCV or seasonality. The numbers refer to DMAX or phenology and indicate the season of maximum VI (1–4: spring, summer, autumn and winter).

An '''electrical enclosure''' is a [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] for [[electrical equipment|electrical]] or [[electronic equipment]] to mount [[switch]]es, [[Control knob|knobs]] and [[Display device|displays]] and to prevent [[electrical shock]] to equipment users and protect the contents from the environment. The enclosure is the only part of the equipment which is seen by users. It may be designed not only for its utilitarian requirements, but also to be pleasing to the eye. Regulations may dictate the features and performance of enclosures for [[electrical equipment in hazardous areas]], such as petrochemical plants or coal mines. [[Electronic packaging]] may place many demands on an enclosure for heat dissipation, [[radio frequency interference]] and [[electrostatic discharge]] protection, as well as functional, esthetic and commercial constraints.

==Standards==

In the United States, the [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] (NEMA) publishes [[NEMA enclosure type]] standards for the performance of various classes of electrical enclosures.  The NEMA standards cover corrosion resistance, ability to protect from rain and submersion, etc.

For [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] member countries, standard [[IEC 60529]] classifies the [[IP Code|ingress protection rating (IP Codes)]] of enclosures.

==Materials==
Electrical enclosures are usually made from rigid plastics, or metals such as steel, stainless steel, or aluminum. Steel cabinets may be painted or galvanized. Mass-produced equipment will generally have a customized enclosure, but standardized enclosures are made for custom-built or small production runs of equipment. For plastic enclosures ABS is used for indoor applications not in harsh environments. Polycarbonate, glass-reinforced, and fiberglass boxes are used where stronger cabinets are required, and may additionally have a gasket to exclude dust and moisture. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iscsales.com/electrical-enclosures-10-essential-factors-to-consider/ |title="Electrical Enclosures (10 Essential Factors to Consider)" |publisher=Iscsales.com |date=2018-07-12 |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal cabinets may meet the conductivity requirements for electrical safety bonding and shielding of enclosed equipment from electromagnetic interference. Non-metallic enclosures may require additional installation steps to ensure metallic conduit systems are properly bonded. 

===Stainless steel and carbon steel===
[[Carbon steel]] and [[stainless steel]] are both used for enclosure construction due to their high durability and corrosion resistance. These materials are also moisture resistant and chemical resistant. They are the strongest of the construction options. 

Stainless steel enclosures are suited for medical, pharma, and food industry applications since they are bacterial and fungal resistant due to their non-porous quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adalet.com/nema-type-4x-single-door |title="Stainless Steel Electrical Enclosures Product Reference" |publisher=Adalet.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stainless steel enclosures may be specified to permit wash-down cleaning in, for example, food manufacturing areas. 

=== Aluminum ===
Aluminum is chosen because of its light weight, relative strength, low cost, and corrosion resistance. It performs well in harsh environments and it is sturdy, capable of withstanding high impact with a high malleable strength. [[Aluminium alloy|Aluminum]] also acts as a shield against electromagnetic interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iscsales.com/enclosures/aluminum-enclosures/ |title="Aluminum Enclosures Product Reference" |publisher=Iscsales.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polycarbonate===
[[Polycarbonate]] used for electrical enclosures is strong but light, non-conductive and non-magnetic. It is also resistant to corrosion and some acidic environments; however, it is sensitive to abrasive cleaners. Polycarbonate is the easiest material to modify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iscsales.com/enclosures/polycarbonate-enclosures/ |title="Polycarbonate Enclosures Product Reference" |publisher=Iscsales.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiberglass===

[[Fiberglass]] enclosures resist chemicals in corrosive applications. The material can be used over all indoor and outdoor temperature ranges. Fiberglass can be installed in environments that are constantly wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://enclosurehub.com/collections/fiberglass-enclosure-solutions |title="Fiberglass Electrical Enclosures Product Reference" |publisher=Enclosurehub.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Enclosures for some purposes have partially punched openings (knockouts) which can be removed to accommodate [[Electrical cable|cables]], [[electrical connector|connectors]], or [[Electrical conduit|conduits]]. Where they are small and primarily intended to conceal electrical junctions from sight, or protect them from tampering, they are also known as [[junction box]]es, street cabinets or technically as [[serving area interface]].

==Telecommunications==

[[Telcordia Technologies]] has proposed generic requirements for telecommunication equipment cabinets. These requirements were developed with the input of United States service providers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-487&amp; |title=GR-487, ''Generic Requirements for Electronic Equipment Cabinets'' |publisher=Telecom-info.telcordia.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are intended to provide a suitable environment for telecommunication companies’ electronic and passive equipment that is housed in
above-ground cabinets or enclosures (typically pad- or pole-mounted) in an outside
plant environment. The proposed standard includes functional design criteria, generic mechanical and environmental requirements, desired features, and performance tests.

Telecommunication huts are fully assembled or modular field-assembled transportable structures capable of housing an electronic communications system. These huts provide a controlled internal environment for the communications equipment and occasional craftspersons. The huts are designed with locks, security, and alarms to discourage access by unauthorized persons.  Huts can be provided with a decorative facade to comply with local building requirements. Telecommunications huts are designed to withstand climate conditions existing throughout the USA including rain, snow, sleet, high winds, ice, sand storms, earthquakes and lightning.

{{Governance}}

'''Environmental governance''' is a concept in [[political ecology]] and [[environmental policy]] that advocates [[sustainability]] ([[sustainable development]]) as the supreme consideration for [[Management|managing]] all human activities—[[Politics|political]], [[social]] and [[Economy|economic]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 8. The Soft Path in a Nutshell. (2005). Oliver M Brandes and David B Brooks. University of Victoria, Victoria, BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Governance includes government, business and civil society, and emphasizes whole [[Systems management|system management]]. To capture this diverse range of elements, environmental governance often employs alternative systems of governance, for example watershed-based management.&lt;ref&gt;IPlanet U, R. Michael M'Gonigle, Justine Starke&lt;/ref&gt;

It views [[natural resource]]s and the environment as global [[public goods]], belonging to the category of [[goods]] that are not diminished when they are shared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-gouvernance.org/en/analyse/fiche-analyse-317.html Launay, Claire, Mouriès, Thomas, '' Les différentes catégories de biens '', summary and excerpt from Pierre Calame’s book, ’’La démocratie en miettes’’, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that everyone benefits from for example, a breathable [[atmosphere]], stable [[climate]] and stable [[biodiversity]].

Public goods are non-rivalrous—a natural resource enjoyed by one person can still be enjoyed by others—and non-excludable—it is impossible to prevent someone consuming the good (breathing). Nevertheless, public goods are recognized as beneficial and therefore have value. The notion of a global public good thus emerges, with a slight distinction: it covers necessities that must not be destroyed by one person or state.

The non-rivalrous character of such goods calls for a management approach that restricts public and private actors from damaging them. One approach is to attribute an [[economic value]] to the resource. [[Water]] is possibly the best example of this type of good.

As of 2013 environmental governance is far from meeting these imperatives. “Despite a great awareness of environmental questions from [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], there is [[environmental degradation]] and the appearance of new environmental problems. This situation is caused by the parlous state of global environmental governance, wherein current global environmental governance is unable to address environmental issues due to many factors. These include fragmented governance within the [[United Nations]], lack of involvement from financial institutions, proliferation of environmental agreements often in conflict with [[trade]] measures; all these various problems disturb the proper functioning of global environmental governance. Moreover, divisions among northern countries and the persistent gap between developed and developing countries also have to be taken into account to comprehend the institutional failures of the current global environmental governance."

==Definitions==
'''What is Environmental Governance?'''

Environmental governance refers to the processes of [[decision-making]] involved in the control and management of the environment and [[natural resource]]s. [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), define environmental governance as the 'multi-level interactions (i.e., local, national, international/global) among, but not limited to, three main actors, i.e., state, [[market (economics)|market]], and civil society, which interact with one another, whether in formal and informal ways; in formulating and implementing policies in response to environment-related demands and inputs from the society; bound by rules, procedures, processes, and widely accepted behavior; possessing characteristics of “good governance”; for the purpose of attaining environmentally-[[sustainable development]]' (IUCN 2014)

Key principles of environmental governance include:

* Embedding the environment in all levels of decision-making and action
* Conceptualizing cities and communities, economic and political life as a subset of the environment
* Emphasizing the connection of people to the ecosystems in which they live
* Promoting the transition from open-loop/cradle-to-grave systems (like garbage disposal with no recycling) to closed-loop/[[cradle-to-cradle]] systems (like [[permaculture]] and [[zero waste]] strategies).

'''Neoliberal Environmental Governance''' – is an approach to the theory of environmental governance framed by a perspective on [[neoliberalism]] as an ideology, policy and practice in relation to the biophysical world. There are many definitions and applications of neoliberalism, e.g. in economic, international relations, etc. However, the traditional understanding of neoliberalism is often simplified to the notion of the primacy of market-led economics through the rolling back of the state, [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]]. Neoliberalism has evolved particularly over the last 40 years with many scholars leaving their ideological footprint on the neoliberal map. [[Hayek]] and [[Friedman]] believed in the superiority of the free market over state intervention. As long as the market was allowed to act freely, the supply/demand law would ensure the ‘optimal’ price and reward. In [[Karl Polanyi]]’s opposing view this would also create a state of tension in which self-regulating [[free market]]s disrupt and alter social interactions and “displace other valued means of living and working”.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. (2007) ‘Neoliberal ecologies’, in Nik Heynen, James McCarthy, Scott Prudham and Paul Robbins (eds.) Neoliberal environments, London: Routledge, p.  281.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to the notion of an unregulated market economy there has also been a “paradoxical increase in [state] intervention”&lt;ref&gt;Jessop B. (2002) ‘Liberalism, Neo-Liberalism and Urban Governance: A State Theoretical Perspective’, Antipode, 34 (3), p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; in the choice of economic, legislative and social policy reforms, which are pursued by the state to preserve the neoliberal order. This contradictory process is described by Peck and Tickell as roll back/roll out neoliberalism in which on one hand the state willingly gives up the control over resources and responsibility for social provision while on the other, it engages in “purposeful construction and consolidation of neoliberalised state forms, modes of governance, and regulatory relations".&lt;ref&gt;Peck, J. and Tickell, A. (2002) ‘Neoliberalising Space’, Antipode, 34(3): p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a growing interest in the effects of neoliberalism on the politics of the non-human world of environmental governance. Neoliberalism is seen to be more than a homogenous and monolithic ‘thing’ with a clear end point.&lt;ref&gt;Heynen N and Robins P. (2005) ‘The neoliberalisation of nature: Governance, privatization, enclosure and valuation’, Capitalism Nature Socialism, 16(1): p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a series of path-dependent, spatially and temporally “connected neoliberalisation” processes which affect and are affected by nature and environment that “cover a remarkable array of places, regions and countries”.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. (2007) ‘Neoliberal ecologies’, in Nik Heynen, James McCarthy, Scott Prudham and Paul Robbins (eds.) Neoliberal environments, London: Routledge, p.  283.&lt;/ref&gt;  Co-opting neoliberal ideas of the importance of private property and the protection of individual (investor) rights, into environmental governance can be seen in the example of recent multilateral trade agreements (see in particular the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]). Such neoliberal structures further reinforce a process of nature enclosure and primitive accumulation or “accumulation by dispossession” that serves to privatise increasing areas of nature.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J. (2004) ‘Privatizing conditions of production: trade agreements as neoliberal environmental governance’, Geoforum, 35(3), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership-transfer of resources traditionally not privately owned to free market mechanisms is believed to deliver greater efficiency and optimal return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;Swyngedouw, E. (2005) ‘Dispossessing H20: The contested terrain of water privatisation’, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, 16(1): pp. 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar examples of neo-liberal inspired projects include the enclosure of minerals, the fisheries quota system in the North Pacific&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, B. (2004) ‘Rules of Privatization: Contradictions in Neoliberal Regulation of North Pacific Fisheries’ Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 94(3): pp. 565–584.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[water privatization|privatisation of water supply]] and [[sewage treatment]] in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, K. (2004) An uncooperative commodity: privatizing water in England and Wales, Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; All three examples share neoliberal characteristics to “deploy markets as the solution to environmental problems” in which scarce natural resources are commercialized and turned into commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, K. (2004) An uncooperative commodity: privatizing water in England and Wales, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.431&lt;/ref&gt; The approach to frame the ecosystem in the context of a price-able commodity is also present in the work of neoliberal geographers who subject nature to price and supply/demand mechanisms where the earth is considered to be a [[quantifiable]] resource ([[Robert Costanza|Costanza]], for example, estimates the earth [[ecosystem services|ecosystem's service]] value to be between 16 and [[orders of magnitude (currency)#1 trillion to 100 trillion|54 trillion dollars]] per year&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al., (1997) ‘The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital’, Nature 387(6630): pp. 255&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Environmental issues==

===Main drivers of environmental degradation===

''[[Economic growth]]'' – The development-centric vision that prevails in most countries and international institutions advocates a headlong rush towards more economic growth. Environmental economists on the other hand, point to a close correlation between economic growth and [[environmental degradation]], arguing for qualitative development as an alternative to growth. As a result, the past couple of decades has seen a big shift towards sustainable development as an alternative to neo-liberal economics. There are those, particularly within the alternative globalization movement, who maintain that it is feasible to change to a [[degrowth]] phase without losing social efficiency or lowering the [[quality of life]].

''[[Consumption (economics)|Consumption]]'' – The growth of consumption and the cult of consumption, or [[consumerist]] ideology, is the major cause of economic growth. Overdevelopment, seen as the only alternative to poverty, has become an end in itself. The means for curbing this growth are not equal to the task, since the phenomenon is not confined to a growing middle class in developing countries, but also concerns the development of irresponsible lifestyles, particularly in northern countries, such as the increase in the size and number of homes and cars per person.

''Destruction of [[biodiversity]]'' – The complexity of the planet’s ecosystems means that the loss of any species has unexpected consequences. The stronger the impact on biodiversity, the stronger the likelihood of a chain reaction with unpredictable negative effects. Another important factor of environmental degradation that falls under this destruction of biodiversity, and must not be ignored is [[deforestation]]. Despite all the damage inflicted, a number of ecosystems have proved to be [[Resilience (ecology)|resilient]]. Environmentalists are endorsing a precautionary principle whereby all potentially damaging activities would have to be analyzed for their [[environmental impact]].

''[[Population growth]]'' – Forecasts predict 8.9 billion people on the planet in 2050. This is a subject which primarily affects developing countries, but also concerns northern countries; although their demographic growth is lower, the environmental impact per person is far higher in these countries. Demographic growth needs to be countered by developing education and family planning programs and generally improving women’s status.

"[[Pollution]]" - Pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels is another driver of environmental destruction. The burning of carbon-based fossil fuels such as coal and oil, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One of the major impacts of this is the climate change that is currently taking place on the planet, where the earth's temperature is gradually rising. Given that fuels such as coal and oil are the most heavily used fuels, this a great concern to many environmentalists.

"Agricultural practices" - Destructive agricultural practices such as overuse of fertilizers and [[overgrazing]] lead to land degradation. The soil gets [[soil erosion|eroded]], and leads to silting in rivers and reservoirs. Soil erosion is a continuous cycle and ultimately results in [[desertification]] of the land. Apart from [[land degradation]], [[water pollution]] is also a possibility; chemicals used in farming can [[surface runoff|run-off]] into rivers and [[water contamination|contaminate the water]].

===Challenges===

The crisis by the impact of human activities on nature calls for governance. Which includes responses by international institutions, governments and citizens, who should meet this crisis by pooling the experience and knowledge of each of the agents and institutions concerned.

The [[environmental protection]] measures taken remain insufficient. The necessary reforms require time, energy, money and diplomatic negotiations. The situation has not generated a unanimous response. Persistent divisions slow progress towards global environmental governance.

The global nature of the crisis limits the effects of national or sectoral measures. Cooperation is necessary between actors and institutions in international trade, sustainable development and [[peace]].

Global, continental, national and local governments have employed a variety of approaches to environmental governance. Substantial positive and negative spillovers limit the ability of any single jurisdiction to resolve issues.

Challenges facing environmental governance include:

* Inadequate continental and global agreements
* Unresolved tensions between maximum development, sustainable development and maximum protection, limiting funding, damaging links with the economy and limiting application of [[Multilateral Environment Agreement]]s (MEAs).
* Environmental funding is not self-sustaining, diverting resources from problem-solving into funding battles.
* Lack of integration of sector policies
* Inadequate institutional capacities
* Ill-defined priorities
* Unclear objectives
* Lack of coordination within the UN, governments, the private sector and civil society
* Lack of shared vision
* Interdependencies among development/sustainable economic growth, trade, agriculture, health, peace and security.
* International imbalance between environmental governance and trade and finance programs, e.g., [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).
* Limited credit for organizations running projects within the Global Environment Facility (GEF)
* Linking [[UNEP]], [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[World Bank]] with MEAs
* Lack of government capacity to satisfy MEA obligations
* Absence of the gender perspective and equity in environmental governance
* Inability to influence public opinion&lt;ref name="inforesources2005"&gt;[http://www.inforesources.ch/pdf/focus_3_05_e.pdf Global Conventions and Environmental Governance; Inforesources Focus No. 3, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unep&gt;UNEP; International Environmental Governance and the Reform of the United Nations, XVI Meeting of the Forum of Environment Ministers of Latin America and the Caribbean;  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/civil_society/PDF_docs/3rdGCSF_CS_Statement_IEG.pdf Civil Society Statement on International Environmental Governance; Seventh special session of the UNEP Governing Council/GMEF; Cartagena, Colombia; February 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Time lag between human action and environmental effect, sometimes as long as a generation&lt;ref name="Underdal, A 2010, pp.386-393"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Underdal | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Complexity and challenges of long term environmental governance | url = | journal = Global environmental change | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 386–393 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental problems being embedded in very complex systems, of which our understanding is still quite weak&lt;ref name="Underdal, A 2010, pp.386-393"/&gt;

All of these challenges have implications on governance, however international environmental governance is necessary. The IDDRI claims that rejection of [[multilateralism]] in the name of efficiency and protection of national interests conflicts with the promotion of international law and the concept of global public goods. Others cite the complex nature of environmental problems.

On the other hand, The [[local Agenda 21|Agenda 21]] program has been implemented in over 7,000 communities.&lt;ref&gt;7,000 municipalities is very few, in view of the fact that over a million municipalities exist on the planet and that initial forecasts were for local agenda 21 actions being adopted in 500,000 municipalities in 1996 and throughout the rest of the planet in 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental problems, including global-scale problems, may not always require global solutions. For example, marine pollution can be tackled regionally, and ecosystem deterioration can be addressed locally. Other global problems such as climate change benefit from local and regional action.

Bäckstrand and Saward wrote, “sustainability and environmental protection is an arena in which innovative experiments with new hybrid, plurilateral forms of governance, along with the incorporation of a transnational civil society spanning the public-private divide, are taking place.”&lt;ref name=Saward&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p58974_index.html Bäckstrand, Karin; Saward, Michel; Democratizing Global Governance: Stakeholder Democracy at the World Summit for Sustainable Development; Document presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association; Chicago; 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local governance===
A 1997 report observed a global consensus that sustainable development implementation should be based on local level solutions and initiatives designed with and by the local communities.&lt;ref name="Leach, M. 1997 pp 1"&gt;Leach, M., Mearns, R and Scoones, I. (1997), Challenges to community based sustainable development, in IDS Bulletin Vol 28:4, pp 1&lt;/ref&gt; Community participation and partnership along with the decentralisation of government power to local communities are important aspects of environmental governance at the local level. Initiatives such as these are integral divergence from earlier environmental governance approaches which was “driven by state agendas and resource control”&lt;ref name="Leach, M. 1997 pp 1"/&gt; and followed a top-down or trickle down approach rather than the bottom up approach that local level governance encompasses. The adoption of practices or interventions at a local scale can, in part, be explained by [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion of innovation]] theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Michael B.|last2=Mills|first2=Morena|title=When conservation goes viral: The diffusion of innovative biodiversity conservation policies and practices|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12442/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/conl.12442|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania and in the Pacific, researchers have illustrated that aspects of the intervention, of the adopter, and of the social-ecological context all shape why community-centered conservation interventions spread through space and time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Local level governance shifts decision making power away from the state and/or governments to the grassroots. Local level governance is extremely important even on a global scale. Environmental governance at the global level is defined as international and as such has resulted in the marginalisation of local voices. Local level governance is important to bring back power to local communities in the global fight against environmental degridation.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"&gt;Elliot, L. (1956), Global Environmental Governance, in Hughes, S. and Wilkinson, R. (eds), Global Governance: Critical Perspectives, London: Routledge, ch. 4, pp. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  Pulgar Vidal observed a “new institutional framework, [wherein] decision-making regarding access to and use of natural resources has become increasingly decentralized.”&lt;ref name=pv&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/uploads/user-S/11304196171GAD-espanol.pdf Pulgar Vidal, Manuel; Gobernanza Ambiental Descentralizada (Decentralized Environmental Governance); 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; He noted four techniques that can be used to develop these processes:

* formal and informal regulations, procedures and processes, such as consultations and participative democracy;
* social interaction that can arise from participation in development programs or from the reaction to perceived injustice;
* regulating social behaviours to reclassify an individual question as a [[public matter]];
* within-group [[participation (decision making)|participation]] in decision-making and relations with external actors.

He found that the key conditions for developing decentralized environmental governance are:

* access to [[social capital]], including local knowledge, leaders and local shared vision;
* democratic access to information and decision-making;
* local government activity in environmental governance: as facilitator of access to natural resources, or as policy maker;
* an institutional framework that favours decentralized environmental governance and creates forums for social interaction and making widely accepted agreements acceptable.&lt;ref name=pv/&gt;

The legitimacy of decisions depends on the local population's participation rate and on how well participants represent that population.&lt;ref name=poats&gt;[http://www.portalces.org/content/view/85/100000022/lang,Spanish Suárez, David; Poats, Susan V.; Procesos de Gobernanza Ambiental en el Manejo Participativo de Áreas Protegidas en Carchi (Environmental Governance Processes in the Participative Management of Carchi Protected Areas); Symposium; 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;
With regard to public authorities, questions linked to biodiversity can be faced by adopting appropriate policies and strategies, through exchange of knowledge and experience, the forming of partnerships, correct management of land use, monitoring of biodiversity and optimal use of resources, or reducing consumption, and promoting environmental certifications, such as EMAS and/or ISO 14001. Local authorities undoubtedly have a central role to play in the protection of biodiversity and this strategy is successful above all when the authorities show strength by involving stakeholders in a credible environmental improvement project and activating a transparent and effective communication policy (Ioppolo et al., 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo G., Saija G., Salomone R. 2013. From coastal management to environmental management: The sustainable eco-tourism program for the mid-western coast of Sardinia (Italy). Land Use Policy (31), 460-471&lt;/ref&gt;

===State governance===
States play a crucial role in environmental governance, because "however far and fast international economic integration proceeds, political authority remains vested in national governments".&lt;ref&gt;Cable, V. 1999, ''Globalisation and global governance'', Chatham House Papers, London&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that governments should respect and support the commitment to implementation of international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;WHAT 2000, "Governance for a sustainable future", Reports of the Commissions of the World Humanity Action Trust, viewed 22 April 2014, http://www.stakeholderforum.org/policy/governance/future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

At the state level, [[environmental management]] has been found to be conducive to the creation of roundtables and committees. In France, the ''Grenelle de l’environnement''&lt;ref&gt;Operational Committee No. 24 "Institutions and stakeholder representativity" (introduced by Bertrand Pancher); Final report to the Prime Minister, senior Minister, Minister for the Ecology, Sustainable Development and Territorial Planning; 2008, also known as the Rapport Pancher.&lt;/ref&gt; process:

* included a variety of actors (e.g. the state, political leaders, unions, businesses, not-for-profit organizations and environmental protection foundations);
* allowed stakeholders to interact with the legislative and executive powers in office as indispensable advisors;
* worked to integrate other institutions, particularly the [[French Economic, Social and Environmental Council|Economic and Social Council]], to form a pressure group that participated in the process for creating an environmental governance model;
* attempted to link with environmental management at regional and local levels.

If environmental issues are excluded from e.g., the economic agenda, this may delegitimize those institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eauxglacees.com/Gouvernance-environnementale-vers Laime, Marc; Gouvernance environnementale: vers une meilleure concertation ? (Environmental Governance: towards better consultation?); 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

“In southern countries, the main obstacle to the integration of intermediate levels in the process of territorial environmental governance development is often the dominance of developmentalist inertia in states’ political mindset. The question of the environment has not been effectively integrated in national development planning and programs. Instead, the most common idea is that environmental protection curbs economic and social development, an idea encouraged by the frenzy for exporting raw materials extracted using destructive methods that consume resources and fail to generate any added value.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/es/sobre/union/secretaria/oficinas/sudamerica/sur_trabajo/sur_pgam.cfm IUCN; Gobernanza ambiental para un desarrollo sostenible (Environmental Governance for Sustainable Development).]&lt;/ref&gt; Of course they are justified in this thinking, as their main concerns are social injustices such as poverty alleviation. Citizens in some of these states have responded by developing empowerment strategies to ease poverty through sustainable development. In addition to this, policymakers must be more aware of these concerns of the global south, and must make sure to integrate a strong focus on social justice in their policies.

=== Global Governance ===
At the global level there are numerous important actors involved in environmental governance and "a range of institutions contribute to and help define the practice of global environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"/&gt; The idea of global environmental governance is to govern the environment at a global level through a range of nation states and non state actors such as national governments, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and other international organisations such as UNEP ([[United Nations Environment Programme]]). Global environmental governance is the answer to calls for new forms of governance because of the increasing complexity of the international agenda. It is perceived to be an effective form of multilateral management and essential to the international community in meeting goals of mitigation and the possible reversal of the impacts on the global environment.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"&gt;Elliot, L. (1956), Global Environmental Governance, in Hughes, S. and Wilkinson, R. (eds), Global Governance: Critical Perspectives, London: Routledge, ch. 4, pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt; However, a precise definition of global environmental governance is still vague and there are many issues surrounding global governance.&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;
Elliot argues that “the congested institutional terrain still provides more of an appearance than a reality of comprehensive global governance.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;  This meant that there are too many institutions within the global governance of the environment for it to be completely inclusive and coherent leaving it merely portraying the image of this to the global public. Global environmental governance is about more than simply expanding networks of institutions and decision makers. “It is a political practice which simultaneously reflects, constitutes and masks global relations of power and powerlessness.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt; State agendas exploit the use of global environmental governance to enhance their oven agendas or wishes even if this is at the detriment of the vital element behind global environmental governance which is the environment. Elliot states that global environmental governance “is neither normatively neutral nor materially benign.”&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 58"/&gt;
As explored by Newell, report notes by The Global Environmental Outlook noted that the systems of global environmental governance are becoming increasingly irrelevant or impotent due to patterns of globalisation such as; imbalances in productivity and the distribution of goods and services, unsustainable progression of extremes of wealth and poverty and population and economic growth overtaking environmental gains.&lt;ref name="Newell, P. 2008 pp 508"&gt;Newell, P.(2008). The political economy of global environmental governance. Review of International Studies, 34, pp 508&lt;/ref&gt; Newell states that, despite such acknowledgements, the “managing of global environmental change within International Relations continues to look to international regimes for the answers.”&lt;ref name="Newell, P. 2008 pp 508"/&gt;

=== Issues of scale ===

==== Multi-tier governance ====

The literature on governance scale shows how changes in the understanding of [[environmental issues]] have led to the movement from a local view to recognising their larger and more complicated scale. This move brought an increase in the diversity, specificity and complexity of initiatives. Meadowcroft pointed out innovations that were layered on top of existing structures and processes, instead of replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meadowcroft|first=James|title=Politics and scale: some implications for environmental governance|journal=Landscape and urban planning|year=2002|volume=61|issue=2–4|pages=169–179|doi=10.1016/s0169-2046(02)00111-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lafferty and Meadowcroft give three examples of multi-tiered governance: [[internationalisation]], increasingly comprehensive approaches, and involvement of multiple governmental entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafferty|first=William|title=Implementing Sustainable Development|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|author2=Meadowcroft, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lafferty and Meadowcroft described the resulting multi-tiered system as addressing issues on both smaller and wider scales.

==== Institutional fit ====

[[Hans Bruyninckx]] claimed that a mismatch between the scale of the environmental problem and the level of the policy intervention was problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruyninckx|first=Hans|title=Environmental evaluation practices and the issue of scale|journal=New directions for evaluation|year=2009|volume=122|pages=31–39|doi=10.1002/ev.293|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/234737/1/newdirectionsevaluation-HB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young claimed that such mismatches reduced the effectiveness of interventions.&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Oran|title=The globalization of socio-ecological systems: An agenda for scientific research|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2006|volume=16|issue=3|pages=304–316|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the literature addresses the level of [[governance]] rather than ecological scale.

[[Elinor Ostrom]], amongst others, claimed that the mismatch is often the cause of unsustainable management practices and that simple solutions to the mismatch have not been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Folke|first=C|title=The problem of fit between ecosystems and institutions: ten years later|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2007|volume=12|issue=1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrem|first=Elinor|title=A diagnostic approach for going beyond panaceas|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2007|volume=104|issue=39|pages=15181–15187|doi=10.1073/pnas.0702288104|bibcode=2007PNAS..10415181O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable debate has addressed the question of which level(s) should take responsibility for fresh water management. Development workers tend to address the problem at the local level. National governments focus on policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lebel|first=L |author2=Garden, L |author3=Imamura, M|title=The Politics of Scale, Position and Place in the Governance of Water Resources in the Mekong Region|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2005|volume=10|issue=2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can create conflicts among states because rivers cross borders, leading to efforts to evolve governance of  [[river basins]].&lt;ref name="Elliot, L. 1956 pp. 57"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zagg|first=V|author2=Gupta, J|title=Scale issues in the governance of water storage projects|journal=Water Resources Research|year=2008|volume=44|issue=10|pages=W10417|bibcode=2008WRR....4410417V|doi=10.1029/2007WR006364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental governance issues==

===Soil deterioration===

[[soil degradation|Soil]] and [[land degradation|land deterioration]] reduces its [[field capacity|capacity]] for capturing, [[water storage|storing]] and recycling water, energy and food. [[Alliance 21]] proposed solutions in the following domains:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article514.html Alliance 21’s Proposal Paper “Save our Soils to Sustain our Societies”]&lt;/ref&gt;

* include [[Soil regeneration|soil rehabilitation]] as part of conventional and popular education
* involve all stakeholders, including policymakers and authorities, producers and land users, the scientific community and civil society to manage incentives and enforce regulations and laws
* establish a set of binding rules, such as an international convention
* set up mechanisms and incentives to facilitate transformations
* gather and share knowledge;
* mobilize funds nationally and internationally

===Climate change===
The scientific consensus on [[climate change]] is expressed in the reports of [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and also in the statements by all major scientific bodies in the United States such as [[National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Oreskes, N 2004, "Beyond the ivory tower", Science, vol. 306, no. 5702, pp, 1686.&lt;/ref&gt;

The drivers of climate change can include
- Changes in [[solar irradiance]]
- Changes in atmospheric [[trace gas]] and [[aerosol]] concentrations
Evidence of climate change can be identified by examining
- Atmospheric concentrations of [[Green House Gas]]es (GHGs) such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO2)
- Land and sea surface temperatures
- Atmospheric water vapor
- [[Precipitation]]
- The occurrence or strength of extreme weather and climate events
- [[Glacier]]s
- Rapid sea [[ice loss]]
- Sea level&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter01_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suggested by climate models that the changes in temperature and sea level can be the causal effects of human activities such as [[fuel consumption|consumption]] of fossil fuels, [[deforestation]], increased [[agricultural production]] and production of [[xenobiotic]] gases.&lt;ref&gt;Pernetta, JC &amp; Elder, DL 1992 Climate, Sealevel rise and the coastal zone: management and planning of global changes, Ocean and coastal management, vol 18, pp- 113-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been increasing actions in order to mitigate climate change and reduce its impact at national, regional and international levels. [[Kyoto protocol]] and [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) plays the most important role in addressing climate change at an international level.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/pages/gateway/the-negotiations/the-un-climate-change-convention-and-the-kyoto-protocol&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of combating climate change led to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] by 191 states, an agreement encouraging the reduction of [[greenhouse gases]], mainly {{CO2}}. Since developed economies produce more emissions per capita, limiting emissions in all countries inhibits opportunities for emerging economies, the only major success in efforts to produce a global response to the phenomenon.

Two decades following the [[Brundtland Report]], however, there has been no improvement in the key indicators highlighted.

===Biodiversity===

Environmental governance for protecting the [[biodiversity]] has to act in many levels. Biodiversity is fragile because it is threatened by almost all human actions. To promote conservation of biodiversity, agreements and laws have to be created to regulate agricultural activities, [[urban growth]], [[industrialization]] of countries, [[resource use|use of natural resources]], control of [[invasive species]],  the correct use of water and protection of [[air quality]]. Before making any decision for a region or country decision makers, politicians and community have to take into account what are the potential impacts for biodiversity, that any project can have.

[[Population growth]] and [[urbanization]] have been a great contributor for deforestation. Also, population growth requires more intense agricultural areas use, which also results in necessity of new areas to be deforested. This causes [[habitat loss]], which is one of the major threats for biodiversity. Habitat loss and  [[habitat fragmentation]] affects all species, because they all rely on limited resources, to feed on and to breed.&lt;ref&gt;Steffan-Dewenter &amp; Tscharntkae, 2000 ‘Butterfly community structure in fragmented habitats’  Ecology Letters, vol. 3, pp. 449-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

‘''Species are genetically unique and irreplaceable their loss is irreversible. Ecosystems vary across a vast range of parameters, and similar ecosystems (whether wetlands, forests, coastal reserves etc) cannot be presumed to be interchangeable, such that the loss of one can be compensated by protection or restoration of another''’.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2010 ‘Environmental Governance’ viewed 28 May 2014, www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/environmental_law/elp_work/elp_work_issues/elp_work_governance&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid habitat loss, and consequently biodiversity loss, politicians and lawmakers should be aware of the precautionary principle, which means that before approving a project or law all the pros and cons should be carefully analysed. Sometimes the impacts are not explicit, or not even proved to exist. However, if there is any chance of an irreversible impact happen, it should be taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2007 ‘Guidelines for applying the precautionary principle to biodiversity conservation and  natural resource management’ viewed 28 May 2014, cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/ln250507_ppguidelines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote environmental governance for biodiversity protection there has to be a clear articulation between values and interests while negotiating environmental management plans.&lt;ref&gt;Sampford, C 2002 ‘Environmental governance for biodiversity’ Environmental Science &amp; Policy, vol. 5, pp. 79-90.&lt;/ref&gt; International agreements are good way to have it done right.

The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) was signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 human activities. The CBD’s objectives are: “to conserve biological diversity, to use biological diversity in a sustainable fashion, to share the benefits of biological diversity fairly and equitably.” The Convention is the first global agreement to address all aspects of biodiversity: genetic resources, species and ecosystems. It recognizes, for the first time, that the conservation of biological diversity is “a common concern for all humanity”. The       Convention encourages joint efforts on measures for scientific and technological cooperation, access to genetic resources and the transfer of clean environmental technologies.

The Convention on Biological Diversity most important edition happened in 2010 when the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Targets, were launched. These two projects together make the United Nations decade on Biodiversity. It was held in Japan and has the targets of ‘''halting and eventually reversing the loss of biodiversity of the planet''’.&lt;ref name="cbd.int"&gt;Convention on Biodiversity 2010 ‘Strategic Goals &amp; Targets for 2020’ viewed 28  May 2014, www.cbd.int/2011-2020/goals/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity has the goal to ‘''promote its overall vision of living in harmony with nature''’ As result (...) ‘''mainstream biodiversity at different levels. Throughout the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity, governments are encouraged to develop, implement and communicate the results of national strategies for implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity''’.&lt;ref name="cbd.int"/&gt; According to the CBD &lt;ref name="cbd.int"/&gt; the five Aichi targets are:
#‘''Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society'';
#''Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use'';
#''Improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and [[genetic diversity]]'';
#''Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and [[ecosystem services]]'';
#''Enhance implementation through [[participatory planning]], [[knowledge management]] and [[capacity building]]''.’

=== Water ===

The 2003 [[UN World Water Development Report]] claimed that the amount of water available over the next twenty years would drop by 30%.{{update|date=September 2013}}
In the same report, it is indicated that in 1998, 2.2 million people died from diarrhoeal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2003). ''World Water Development Report 1: "Water for People, Water for Life"''. Retrieved from: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001297/129726e.pdf#page=27&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the UK’s [[WaterAid]] charity reported that one child died every 15 seconds from water-linked diseases.

According to Alliance 21&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article501.html Proposals Related to the Water Issue]&lt;/ref&gt; “All levels of water supply management are necessary and independent. The integrated approach to the catchment areas must take into account the needs of [[irrigation]] and those of towns, jointly and not separately as is often seen to be the case....The governance of a water supply must be guided by the principles of sustainable development.”

[[Australia]]n [[water resources]] have always been variable but they are becoming increasingly so with changing climate conditions. Because of how limited water resources are in Australia, there needs to be an effective implementation of environmental governance conducted within the country. Water restrictions are an important policy device used in Australian environmental governance to limit the amount of water used in urban and agricultural environments (Beeton et al. 2006). There is increased pressure on surface water resources in Australia because of the uncontrolled growth in [[groundwater]] use and the constant threat of drought. These increased pressures not only affect the quantity and quality of the waterways but they also negatively affect biodiversity. The government needs to create policies that preserve, protect and monitor Australia’s inland water. The most significant environmental governance policy imposed by the Australian government is environmental flow allocations that allocate water to the natural environment. The proper implementation of water trading systems could help to conserve water resources in Australia. Over the years there has been an increase in demand for water, making Australia the third largest per capita user of water in the world (Beeton et al. 2006). If this trend continues, the gap between supply and demand will need to be addressed. The government needs to implement more efficient water allocations and raise water rates (UNEP, 2014). By changing public perception to promote the action of reusing and recycling water some of the stress of water shortages can be alleviated.  More extensive solutions like desalination plants, building more dams and using aquifer storage are all options that could be taken to conserve water levels but all these methods are controversial. With caps on surface water use, both urban and rural consumers are turning to groundwater use; this has caused groundwater levels to decline significantly. Groundwater use is very hard to monitor and regulate. There is not enough research currently being conducted to accurately determine sustainable yields. Some regions are seeing improvement in groundwater levels by applying caps on bores and the amount of water that consumers are allowed to extract. There have been projects in environmental governance aimed at restoring vegetation in the riparian zone. Restoring riparian vegetation helps increase biodiversity, reduce salinity, prevent soil erosion and prevent riverbank collapse. Many rivers and waterways are controlled by weirs and locks that control the flow of rivers and also prevent the movement of fish. The government has funded fish-ways on some weirs and locks to allow for native fish to move upstream. Wetlands have significantly suffered under restricted water resources with water bird numbers dropping and a decrease in species diversity. The allocation of water for bird breeding through environmental flows in [[Macquarie Marshes]] has led to an increase in breeding (Beeton et al. 2006). Because of dry land salinity throughout Australia there has been an increase in the levels of salt in Australian waterways. There has been funding in salt interception schemes which help to improve in-stream salinity levels but whether river salinity has improved or not is still unclear because there is not enough data available yet. High salinity levels are dangerous because they can negatively affect larval and juvenile stages of certain fish. The introduction of invasive species into waterways has negatively affected native aquatic species because invasive species compete with native species and alter natural habitats. There has been research in producing [[daughterless carp]] to help eradicate carp. Government funding has also gone into building in-stream barriers that trap the carp and prevent them from moving into floodplains and wetlands.  Investment in national and regional programmes like the Living Murray (MDBC), Healthy Waterways Partnership and the Clean Up the Swan Programme are leading to important environmental governance. The Healthy Rivers programme promotes restoration and recovery of environmental flows, riparian re-vegetation and aquatic pest control.  The Living Murray programme has been crucial for the allocation of water to the environment by creating an agreement to recover 500 billion litres of water to the Murray River environment. Environmental governance and water resource management in Australia must be constantly monitored and adapted to suit the changing environmental conditions within the country (Beeton et al. 2006). If environmental programmes are governed with transparency there can be a reduction in policy fragmentation and an increase in policy efficiency (Mclntyre, 2010). In Arab countries, the extensive use of water for agriculture also needs critical attention since agriculture in this region has less contribution for its national income.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ozone layer===

On 16 September 1987 the United Nations General Assembly signed the [[Montreal Protocol]] to address the declining [[ozone layer]]. Since that time, the use of [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (industrial refrigerants and aerosols) and farming fungicides such as [[methyl bromide]] has mostly been eliminated, although other damaging gases are still in use.&lt;ref&gt;Gareau, Brian J. From Precaution to Profit: Contemporary Challenges to Global Environmental Protection in the Montreal Protocol (2013, Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear risk===

The [[Nuclear non-proliferation treaty]] is the primary multilateral agreement governing nuclear activity.

===Transgenic organisms===
[[Genetically modified organisms]] are not the subject of any major multilateral agreements. They are the subject of various restrictions at other levels of governance. GMOs are in widespread use in the US, but are heavily restricted in many other jurisdictions.

Controversies have ensued over [[golden rice]], [[AquAdvantage salmon|genetically modified salmon]], [[Monsanto#Seeds|genetically modified seeds]], disclosure and other topics.

=== Precautionary principle ===

The [[precautionary principle]] or precautionary approach states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is harmful, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action. As of 2013 it was not the basis of major multilateral agreements.
The Precautionary Principle is put into effect if there is a chance that proposed action may cause harm to the society or the environment. Therefore, those involved in the proposed action must provide evidence that it will not be harmful, even if scientists do not believe that it will cause harm. It falls upon the policymakers to make the optimal decision, if there is any risk, even without any credible scientific evidence. However, taking precautionary action also means that there is an element of cost involved, either social or economic. So if the cost was seen as insignificant the action would be taken without the implementation of the precautionary principle.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, BD 2000, 'Applying the precautionary principle to the environment', Bulletin Of The World Health Organization, 78, 9, p. 1159, Health Business Elite, EBSCOhost, viewed 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; But often the cost is ignored, which can lead to harmful repercussions. This is often the case with industry and scientists who are primarily concerned with protecting their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;European Report 25 Jan. 2013"ENVIRONMENT : PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE: EEA REPORT DAMNING TO INDUSTRY."Academic OneFile. Web. 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-environmental conflicts ===
Leading experts have emphasized on the importance of taking into account the security aspects the environment and natural resources will cause. The twenty-first century is looking into a future with an increase in mass migrations of refugees, wars and praetorian regimes caused by the effect of environmental degradation such as water scarcity, deforestation and soil erosion, air pollution and, climate change effects such as rising sea levels. For a long time, foreign-policy challenges have focused on social causes as being the only reason for social and political changes. However, it is a crucial moment to understand and take into consideration the security implications that environmental stress will bring to the current political and social structure around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert D.|date=February 1994|title=The Coming Anarchy: How scarcity, crime, overpopulation,tribalism, and disease are rapidly destroying the social fabric of our planet.|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=GLOBAL|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreements==

===Conventions===

The main multilateral conventions, also known as Rio Conventions, are as follows:

[[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) (1992–1993): aims to conserve biodiversity. Related agreements include the [http://www.cbd.int/doc/legal/cartagena-protocol-en.pdf Cartagena Protocol] on biosafety.

[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCC) (1992–1994): aims to stabilize concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that would [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|stabilize the climate system]] without threatening food production, and enabling the pursuit of sustainable economic development; it incorporates the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD) (1994–1996): aims to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought and desertification, in developing countries (Though initially the convention was primarily meant for Africa).

Further conventions:
* [http://www.ramsar.org Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance] (1971–1975)
* [http://whc.unesco.org UNESCO World Heritage Convention]  (1972–1975)
* [http://www.cites.org Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES)] (1973–1975)
* [http://www.cms.int Bonn Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species] (1979–1983)
* [http://www.unece.org/env/water Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention)] (1992–1996)
* [http://www.basel.int Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal] (1989–1992)
* [http://www.pic.int Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedures for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade]
* [http://www.pops.int Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (COP)] (2001–2004)

The Rio Conventions are characterized by:

* obligatory execution by signatory states
* involvement in a sector of global environmental governance
* focus on the fighting poverty and the development of sustainable living conditions;
* funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for countries with few financial resources;
* inclusion of a for assessing ecosystem status&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millenniumassessment.org/fr/index.aspx Millennium assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental conventions are regularly criticized for their:

* rigidity and verticality: they are too descriptive, homogenous and top down, not reflecting the diversity and complexity of environmental issues. Signatory countries struggle to translate objectives into concrete form and incorporate them consistently;
* duplicate structures and aid: the sector-specific format of the conventions produced duplicate structures and procedures. Inadequate cooperation between government ministries;
* contradictions and incompatibility: e.g., “if reforestation projects to reduce {{CO2}} give preference to monocultures of exotic species, this can have a negative impact on biodiversity (whereas natural regeneration can strengthen both biodiversity and the conditions needed for life).”&lt;ref name="inforesources2005"/&gt;

Until now, the formulation of environmental policies at the international level has been divided by theme, sector or territory, resulting in treaties that overlap or clash. International attempts to coordinate environment institutions, include the Inter-Agency Coordination Committee and the [[Commission for Sustainable Development]], but these institutions are not powerful enough to effectively incorporate the three aspects of sustainable development.{{sfn|Kanie|Haas|2004}}

===Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs)===

MEAs are agreements between several countries that apply internationally or regionally and concern a variety of environmental questions. As of 2013 over 500 Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), including 45 of global scope involve at least 72 signatory countries.&lt;ref name=inomata&gt;Inomata, Tadanori; Management Review of Environmental Governance within the United Nations System; United Nations; Joint Inspection Unit; Geneva; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Prue|title=Multilateral Environmental Agreement Negotiator’s Handbook: Pacific Region 2013|date=2013|publisher=Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme / New Zealand Centre for Environmental Law, University of Auckland|location=Samoa / New Zealand|isbn=978-982-04-0475-5|url=http://www.sprep.org/attachments/Publications/EMG/MEA_Handbook_2013.pdf|author2=Stroud, Lucy |author3=Peteru, Clark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further agreements cover regional environmental problems, such as [[deforestation in Borneo]] or pollution in the Mediterranean. Each agreement has a specific mission and objectives ratified by multiple states.

Many Multilateral Environmental Agreements have been negotiated with the support from the United Nations Environmental Programme and work towards the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals as a means to instil sustainable practices for the environment and its people.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"&gt;Steiner, A &amp; Oviir, M (2010) ‘Auditing the Implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs): A Primer for Auditors’, United Nations Environment Programme, pp. 1-136&lt;/ref&gt; Multilateral Environmental Agreements are considered to present enormous opportunities for greener societies and economies which can deliver numerous benefits in addressing food, energy and water security and in achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"/&gt; These agreements can be implemented on a global or regional scale, for example the issues surrounding the disposal of hazardous waste can be implemented on a regional level as per the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Waste within Africa which applies specifically to Africa, or the global approach to hazardous waste such as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal which is monitored throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Steiner, A 2010 pp. 1-136"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;African Union, (2010) ‘Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes within Africa’, African Union, accessed on 16 May 2014 via &lt;http://www.au.int/en/content/bamako-convention-ban-import-africa-and-control-transboundary-movement-and-management-hazard&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basil Action Network (2011) ‘The Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal’, Basil Action Network, accessed on 16 May 2014 via &lt;http://ban.org/about_basel_conv/treaty_text.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

“The environmental governance structure defined by the Rio and Johannesburg Summits is sustained by [http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#International_institutions UNEP], MEAs and developmental organizations and consists of assessment and policy development, as well as project implementation at the country level.

"The governance structure consists of a chain of phases:

* a) assessment of environment status;
* b) international policy development;
* c) formulation of MEAs;
* d) policy implementation;
* e) policy assessment;
* f) enforcement;
* g) sustainable development.

"Traditionally, UNEP has focused on the normative role of engagement in the first three
phases. Phases (d) to (f) are covered by MEAs and the sustainable development phase involves developmental organizations such as UNDP and the World Bank.”&lt;ref name=inomata/&gt;

Lack of coordination affects the development of coherent governance. The report shows that donor states support development organizations, according to their individual interests. They do not follow a joint plan, resulting in overlaps and duplication. MEAs tend not to become a joint frame of reference and therefore receive little financial support. States and organizations emphasize existing regulations rather than improving and adapting them.&lt;ref name=inomata/&gt;

==Background==

The risks associated with nuclear fission raised global awareness of environmental threats. The 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] prohibiting atmospheric nuclear testing was the beginning of the globalization of environmental issues. Environmental law began to be modernized and coordinated with the [[Stockholm Conference]] (1972), backed up in 1980 by the Vienna Convention on the [[Law of treaties|Law of Treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;Di Mento, Josep; The Global Environment and International law, University of Texas Press; 2003; p 7..&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] was signed and ratified in 1985. In 1987, 24 countries signed the [[Montreal Protocol]] which imposed the gradual withdrawal of CFCs.

The [[Brundtland Report]], published in 1987 by the [[Earth Summit|UN Commission on Environment and Development]], stipulated the need for economic development that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the capacity of future generations to meet their needs.

===Rio Conference (1992) and reactions===

The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), better known as the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], was the first major international meeting since the end of the [[Cold War]] and was attended by delegations from 175 countries. Since then the biggest international conferences that take place every 10 years guided the global governance process with a series of MEAs. Environmental treaties are applied with the help of [[secretariats]].

Governments created international treaties in the 1990s to check global threats to the environment. These treaties are far more restrictive than global protocols and set out to change non-sustainable production and consumption models.&lt;ref name=boug&gt;Bouguerra, Larbi; La consommation assassine. Comment le mode de vie des uns ruine celui des autres, pistes pour u ne consommation responsible (Consumption Kills. How some people’s lifestyles ruin other people’s lives. Ideas for responsible consumption) ; Éditions Charles Léopold Mayer; 2005; adaptation of State of the World. Special Focus - The Consumer Society; The Worldwatch Institute; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agenda 21===

[[Agenda 21]] is a detailed plan of actions to be implemented at the global, national and local levels by UN organizations, member states and key individual groups in all regions. Agenda 21 advocates making sustainable development a legal principle law. At the local level, local Agenda 21 advocates an inclusive, territory-based strategic plan, incorporating sustainable environmental and social policies.

The Agenda has been accused of using [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles, including free trade to achieve environmental goals. For example, chapter two, entitled “International Cooperation to Accelerate Sustainable Development in Developing Countries and Related Domestic Policies” states, “The international economy should provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals by: promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization.”

==Actors==

===International institutions===

====United Nations Environment Program====
{{main|United Nations Environment Program}}
The UNEP has had its biggest impact as a monitoring and advisory body, and in developing environmental agreements. It has also contributed to strengthening the institutional capacity of environment ministries.

In 2002 UNEP held a conference to focus on product lifecycle impacts, emphasizing the fashion, advertising, financial and retail industries, seen as key agents in promoting sustainable consumption.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

According to Ivanova, UNEP adds value in environmental monitoring, scientific assessment and information sharing, but cannot lead all environmental management processes. She proposed the following tasks for UNEP:

* initiate a strategic independent overhaul of its mission;
* consolidate the financial information and transparency process;
* restructure organizing governance by creating an operative executive council that balances the omnipresence of the overly imposing and fairly ineffectual Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum (GMEF).

Other proposals offer a new mandate to “produce greater unity amongst social and environmental agencies, so that the concept of ‘environment for development’ becomes a reality. It needs to act as a platform for establishing standards and for other types of interaction with national and international organizations and the United Nations. The principles of cooperation and [http://www.amisdelaterre.org/Des-responsabilites-communes-mais.html common but differentiated responsibilities] should be reflected in the application of this revised mandate.”&lt;ref&gt;Reforming International Environmental Governance: Statement representing views expressed at two meetings of stakeholders held at the 24th Session of the UNEP Governing Council/GMEF 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman proposed principles to strengthen UNEP:

* obtain a social consensus on a long-term vision;
* analyze the current situation and future scenarios;
* produce a comprehensive plan covering all aspects of sustainable development;
* build on existing strategies and processes;
* multiply links between national and local strategies;
* include all these points in the financial and budget plan;
* adopt fast controls to improve process piloting and identification of progress made;
* implement effective participation mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/62/issues/environmentalgov/Statement%20on%20IEG%20by%20civil%20society.pdf Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future, et al (comp.); Options for Strengthening the Environment Pillar of Sustainable Development. Compilation of Civil Society Proposals on the Institutional Framework for the United Nations' Environmental Activities; 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group stated, “Consider the specific needs of developing countries and respect of the fundamental principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. Developed countries should promote technology transfer, new and additional financial resources, and capacity building for meaningful participation of developing countries in international environmental governance. Strengthening of international environmental governance should occur in the context of sustainable development and should involve civil society as an important stakeholder and agent of transformation.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stakeholderforum.org/policy/ieg/SubmissionsToThePanel/BRAZILIANFORUMOFNGOS.pdf Submission by the Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for the Environment and the Development to the Panel Consultation with Civil Society; June 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Environment Facility (GEF)====
{{main|Global Environment Facility}}
Created in 1991, the Global Environment Facility is an independent financial organization initiated by donor governments including Germany and France. It was the first financial organization dedicated to the environment at the global level. As of 2013 it had 179 members. Donations are used for projects covering biodiversity, climate change, international waters, destruction of the ozone layer, soil degradation and [[persistent organic pollutant]]s.

GEF's institutional structure includes UNEP, UNDP and the World Bank. It is the funding mechanism for the four environmental conventions: climate change, biodiversity, persistent organic pollutants and desertification. GEF transfers resources from developed countries to developing countries to fund UNDP, UNEP and World Bank projects. The World Bank manages the annual budget of US$561.10 million.&lt;ref name=young2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Zoë |first=Young |title=A new green order: The World Bank and the politics of the global environmental facility |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London |year=2002 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GEF has been criticized for its historic links with the World Bank, at least during its first phase during the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Andler, Lydia; The Secretariat of the Global Environment Facility: From Network to Bureaucracy; "Global Governance Working Paper", no. 24; Amsterdam et al.; The Global Governance Project; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and for having favoured certain regions to the detriment of others.&lt;ref&gt;Werksman, Jake; Consolidating global environmental governance: New lessons from the GEF?; in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view sees it as contributing to the emergence of a global "green market". It represents “an adaptation (of the World Bank) to this emerging world order, as a response to the emergence of environmental movements that are becoming a geopolitical force.”{{sfn|Zoë2002|p=3}}  Developing countries demanded financial transfers to help them protect their environment.

GEF is subject to economic profitability criteria, as is the case for all the [http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#Conventions conventions]. It received more funds in its first three years than the UNEP has since its creation in 1972. GEF funding represents less than 1% of development aid between 1992 and 2002.{{sfn|Zoë2002|p=3}}

====United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD)====
{{main|Commission on Sustainable Development}}
This intergovernmental institution meets twice a year to assess follow-up on Rio Summit goals. The CSD is made up of 53 member states, elected every three years and was reformed in 2004 to help improve implementation of Agenda 21. It meets twice a year, focusing on a specific theme during each two-year period: 2004-2005 was dedicated to water and 2006-2007 to climate change. The CSD has been criticized for its low impact, general lack of presence and the absence of Agenda 21 at the state level specifically, according to a report by the [[World Resources Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wri.org/pubs/pubs_pdf.cfm?PubID=3764 World Resources Institute; World Resources 2002–2004: Decisions for the Earth: Balance, Voice and Power; Washington DC; 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission focuses on sequencing actions and establishing agreements puts it in conflict with institutions such as UNEP and OECD.&lt;ref name=Najam&gt;[http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2006/geg.pdf Najam, A., Papa, M. and Taiyab, N. Global Environmental Governance. A Reform Agenda; IISD; 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Environment Organization (WEO)====
{{main|United Nations Environment Organization}}
A proposed World Environment Organization, analogous to the [[World Health Organization]] could be capable of adapting treaties and enforcing international standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.coredem.info/wiki/Environmental_governance#Proposals proposals]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union, particularly France and Germany, and a number of NGOs favour creating a WEO. The United Kingdom, the US and most developing countries prefer to focus on voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iddri.org/Publications/Collections/Syntheses/Gouvernance-internationale-de-l'environnement-les-prochaines-etapes Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B.; Gouvernance internationale de l'environnement: les prochaines étapes (International Environmental Governance; the next stages)]; in "Synthèse", 2005, no. 01, Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales (IDDRI).&lt;/ref&gt; WEO partisans maintain that it could offer better political leadership, improved legitimacy and more efficient coordination. Its detractors argue that existing institutions and missions already provide appropriate environmental governance; however the lack of coherence and coordination between them and the absence of clear division of responsibilities prevents them from greater effectiveness.{{sfn|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;

====World Bank====
{{main|World Bank}}
The World Bank influences environmental governance through other actors, particularly the GEF. The World Bank’s mandate is not sufficiently defined in terms of environmental governance despite the fact that it is included in its mission. However, it allocates 5 to 10% of its annual funds to environmental projects. The institution's capitalist vocation means that its investment is concentrated solely in areas which are profitable in terms of cost benefits, such as climate change action and ozone layer protection, whilst neglecting other such as adapting to climate change and desertification. Its financial autonomy means that it can make its influence felt indirectly on the creation of standards, and on international and regional negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Marschinski, Robert; Behrle, Steffen; The World Bank: Making the Business Case for the Environment; "Global Governance Working Paper No 21"; Amsterdam et al; The Global Governance Project; 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following intense criticism in the 1980s for its support for destructive projects which, amongst other consequences, caused deforestation of tropical forests, the World Bank drew up its own environment-related standards in the 1990s so it could correct its actions. These standards differ from UNEP’s standards, meant to be the benchmark, thus discrediting the institution and sowing disorder and conflict in the world of environmental governance. Other financial institutions, regional development banks and the private sector also drew up their own standards. Criticism is not directed at the World Bank’s standards in themselves, which Najam considered as “robust”,&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt; but at their legitimacy and efficacy.

===== GEF =====

The [[Global Environment Facility|GEF]]'s account of itself as of 2012 [http://www.thegef.org/gef/whatisgef] is as "the largest public funder of projects to improve the global environment", period, which "provides grants for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer, and persistent organic pollutants."  It claims to have provided "$10.5 billion in grants and leveraging $51 billion in co-financing for over 2,700 projects in over 165 countries [and] made more than 14,000 small grants directly to civil society and community-based organizations, totaling $634 million."  It serves as mechanism for the:
*[[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD)
*[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC)
*[[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] (POPs)
*[[Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD)
*implementation of [[Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer]] in some countries with "economies in transition" [http://www.thegef.org/gef/whatisgef]
This mandate reflects the restructured GEF as of October 2011 [http://www.thegef.org/gef/instrument].

====World Trade Organization (WTO)====
{{main|World Trade Organization}}
The WTO’s mandate does not include a specific principle on the environment. All the problems linked to the environment are treated in such a way as to give priority to trade requirements and the principles of the WTO’s own trade system. This produces conflictual situations. Even if the WTO recognizes the existence of MEAs, it denounces the fact that around 20 MEAs are in conflict with the WTO’s trade regulations. Furthermore, certain MEAs can allow a country to ban or limit trade in certain products if they do not satisfy established environmental protection requirements. In these circumstances, if one country’s ban relating to another country concerns two signatories of the same MEA, the principles of the treaty can be used to resolve the disagreement, whereas if the country affected by the trade ban with another country has not signed the agreement, the WTO demands that the dispute be resolved using the WTO’s trade principles, in other words, without taking into account the environmental consequences.

Some criticisms of the WTO mechanisms may be too broad.  In a recently dispute over labelling of [[dolphin safe label]]s for [[tuna]] between the US and Mexico, the ruling was relatively narrow and did not, as some critics claimed,

====International Monetary Fund (IMF)====
{{main|International Monetary Fund}}
The IMF’s mission is "''to ensure the stability of the international monetary system''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/about.htm/|title=IMF -- About|website=www.imf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "most of the 24 directors ... told Strauss-Kahn that climate was not part of the IMF's mandate and that SDR allocations are a reserve asset never intended for development issues."&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

==== UN ICLEI ====

{{main|International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives}}

The UN's main body for coordinating municipal and urban decision-making&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclei.org/ ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; is named the [[International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives]]. Its slogan is "Local Governments for Sustainability".
This body sponsored the concept of [[full cost accounting]] that makes environmental governance the foundation of other governance.

ICLEIs projects and achievements include:
*Convincing thousands of municipal leaders to sign the [[World Mayors and Municipal Leaders Declaration on Climate Change]] (2005) which notably requests of other levels of government that:
:Global trade regimes, credits and banking reserve rules be reformed to advance debt relief and incentives to implement policies and practices that reduce and mitigate climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

ICLEI promotes [[best practice exchange]] among municipal governments globally, especially [[green infrastructure]], [[sustainable procurement]].

====Other secretariats====
Other international institutions incorporate environmental governance in their action plans, including:

* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), promoting development;
* [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) which works on the climate and atmosphere;
* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]  (FAO) working on the protection of agriculture, forests and fishing;
* [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) which focuses on nuclear security.

Over 30 UN agencies and programmes support environmental management, according to Najam.&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt; This produces a lack of coordination, insufficient exchange of information and dispersion of responsibilities. It also results in proliferation of initiatives and rivalry between them.

====Criticism====

According to Bauer, Busch and Siebenhüner,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glogov.org Bauer, Steffen; Busch, Per-Olof; Siebenhüner, Bernd; Administering International Governance: What Role for Treaty Secretariats? "Global Governance Working Paper" No 29. Amsterdam et al; The Global Governance Project; 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; the different conventions and multilateral agreements of global environmental regulation is increasing their secretariats' influence. Influence varies according to bureaucratic and leadership efficiency, choice of technical or client-centered.

The United Nations is often the target of criticism, including from within over the multiplication of secretariats due to the chaos it produces. Using a separate secretariat for each MEA creates enormous overhead given the 45 international-scale and over 500 other agreements.

===States===

====Environmental governance at the state level====

Environmental protection has created opportunities for mutual and collective monitoring among neighbouring states. The European Union provides an example of the institutionalization of joint regional and state environmental governance. Key areas include information, led by the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA), and the production and monitoring of norms by states or local institutions.
See also the [[Environmental policy of the European Union]].

====State participation in global environmental governance====

US refusal to ratify major environment agreements produced tensions with ratifiers in Europe and Japan.

The World Bank, IMF and other institutions are dominated by the developed countries and do not always properly consider the requirements of developing countries.

===Business===

Environmental governance applies to business as well as government. Considerations are typical of those in other domains:

*  values (vision, mission, principles);
*  policy (strategy, objectives, targets);
*  oversight (responsibility, direction, training, communication);
*  process (management systems, initiatives, internal control, monitoring and review, stakeholder dialogue, transparency, environmental accounting, reporting and verification);
*  performance (performance indicators, benchmarking, eco-efficiency, reputation, compliance, liabilities, business development).&lt;ref name=white&gt;[http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO0904BKFE-e-e.pdf White, Andrew; Klernan, Matthew; Corporate Environment Governance. A Study into the Influence of Environmental Governance and the Financial Performance; Environment Agency (United Kingdom Government); 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

White and Klernan among others discuss the correlation between environmental governance and financial performance. This correlation is higher in sectors where environmental impacts are greater.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

Business environmental issues include emissions, biodiversity, historical liabilities, product and material waste/recycling, energy use/supply and many others.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

Environmental governance has become linked to traditional corporate governance as an increasing number of shareholders are corporate environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallacepartners.net/governance.html |title=Environmental Governance |publisher=Wallace Partners |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate governance is the set of [[Business process|processes]], customs, [[policies]], laws, and institutions affecting the way a [[corporation]] (or [[company]]) is managed. Corporate [[governance]] is affected by the relationships among [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. These stakeholders research and quantify performance to compare and contrast the environmental performance of thousands of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallacepartners.net/stakeholders.html |title=Priority Stakeholders |publisher=Wallace Partners |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large corporations with global supply chains evaluate the environmental performance of business partners and suppliers for marketing and ethical reasons. Some consumers seek environmentally friendly and sustainable products and companies.

===Non-governmental organizations===
{{Main|Non-governmental organizations}}
According to Bäckstrand and Saward,&lt;ref name=Saward/&gt; “broader participation by non-state actors in multilateral environmental decisions (in varied roles such as agenda setting, campaigning, lobbying, consultation, monitoring, and implementation) enhances the democratic legitimacy of environmental governance.”

Local activism is capable of gaining the support of the people and authorities to combat environmental degradatation. In Cotacachi, Ecuador, a social movement used a combination of education, direct action, the influence of local public authorities and denunciation of the mining company’s plans in its own country, Canada, and the support of international environmental groups to influence mining activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bebbington, Anthony; et al.; Los movimientos sociales frente a la minería: disputando el desarrollo territorial andino (Social Movements and Mining: disputes over territorial development in the Andes); in J. Bengoa (ed.) "Movimientos sociales y desarrollo territorial rural en América Latina" (Social Movements and Territorial Rural Development in Latin America). Catalonia; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher cites cases in which multiple strategies were used to effect change.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher, Dana R.; Civil Society Protest and Participation: Civic Engagement Within the Multilateral Governance Regime pp. 176-201; in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She describes civil society groups that pressure international institutions and also organize local events. Local groups can take responsibility for environmental governance in place of governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/hawaii/howwework/community-based-marine-conservation.xml |title=Community-Based Marine Conservation &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flacso.org.ec/docs/WP_005_AndradeM_01_2.pdf Andrade Mendoza, Karen; La gobernanza ambiental en el Ecuador: El conflicto alrededor de la licencia Ambiental en el bloque 31, en el parque nacional Yasuní (Environmental Governance in Ecuador:  the conflict concerning the environmental license for block 31 in the Yasuní National Park); FLACSO; Observatorio Socioambiental; Quito; 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bengoa,&lt;ref&gt;Bengoa, José; et al. Movimientos sociales, gobernanza ambiental y desarrollo territorial (Social Movements, Environmental Governance and Territorial Development) ; Catalonia; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; “social movements have contributed decisively to the creation of an institutional platform wherein the fight against poverty and exclusion has become an inescapable benchmark.” But despite successes in this area, “these institutional changes have not produced the processes for transformation that could have made substantial changes to the opportunities available to rural inhabitants, particularly the poorest and those excluded from society.” He cites several reasons:

* conflict between in-group cohesion and openness to outside influence;
* limited trust between individuals;
* contradiction between social participation and innovation;
* criticisms without credible alternatives to environmentally damaging activities

A successful initiative in Ecuador involved the establishment of stakeholder federations and management committees (NGOs, communities, municipalities and the ministry) for the management of a protected forest.&lt;ref name=poats/&gt;

The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] proposed an agenda for global governance. These objectives are:&lt;ref name=Najam/&gt;

* expert leadership;
* positioning science as the authoritative basis of sound environmental policy;
* coherence and reasonable coordination;
* well-managed institutions;
* incorporate environmental concerns and actions within other areas of international policy and action

=== Coherence and coordination ===

Despite the increase in efforts, actors, agreements and treaties, the global environment continue to degrade at a rapid rate. From the big hole in Earth’s ozone layer to over-fishing to the uncertainties of climate change, the world is confronted by several intrinsically global challenges.&lt;ref name="ProsConsMultiplicity"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the environmental agenda becomes more complicated and extensive, the current system has proven ineffective in addressing and tackling problems related to trans-boundary externalities and the environment is still experiencing degradation at unprecedented levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Rorden | title = Global governance : critical perspectives | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780203302804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inforesources&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforesources.ch/pdf/focus_3_05_e.pdf ''Global Conventions and Environmental Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt; identifies four major obstacles to global environmental governance, and describes measures in response. The four obstacles are:

* parallel structures and competition, without a coherent strategy
* contradictions and incompatibilities, without appropriate compromise
* competition between multiple agreements with incompatible objectives, regulations and processes
* integrating policy from macro- to micro- scales.

Recommended measures:

* MDGs (Millennium Development Goals)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ UN Millenium Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; and conventions, combining sustainability and reduction of poverty and equity;
* country-level approach linking global and local scales
* coordination and division of tasks in a multilateral approach that supports developing countries and improves coordination between donor countries and institutions
* use of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/prsp.aspx Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; in development planning
* transform conflicts into tradeoffs, synergies and win-win options

Contemporary debates surrounding global environmental governance have converged on the idea of developing a stronger and more effective institutional framework. The views on how to achieve this, however, still hotly debated. Currently, rather than teaming up with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), international environmental responsibilities have been spread across many different agencies including: a) specialised agencies within the UN system such as the World Meteorological Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation and others; b) the programs in the UN system such as the UN Development Program; c) the UN regional economic and social commission; d) the Bretton Woods institutions; e) the World Trade Organisation and; f) the environmentally focused mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility and close to 500 international environmental agreements.&lt;ref name="ProsConsMultiplicity"/&gt;

Some analysts also argue that multiple institutions and some degree of overlap and duplication in policies is necessary to ensure maximum output from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there are various arguments for and against a WEO, the key challenge, however, remains the same: how to develop a rational and effective framework that will protect the global environment efficiently.

=== Democratization ===

Starting in 2002, Saward&lt;ref name=Saward/&gt; and others began to view the [[Earth Summit]] process as capable opening up the possibility of stakeholder democracy. The summits were deliberative rather than simply participative, with NGOs, women, men, indigenous peoples and businesses joining the decision-making process alongside states and international organizations, characterized by:

* the importance given to scientific and technical considerations
* the official and unofficial participation of many actors with heterogeneous activity scopes
* growing uncertainty
* a new interpretation of [[international law]] and social organization models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Behnassi | first1 = Mohamed |title= Les négociations environnementales multilatérales: Vers une gouvernance environnementale mondiale (Multilateral Environmental Negotiations: towards world environmental governance) |journal= C Durable: Doctoral thesis summary paper|date= 2003|url=http://cdurable.info/Les-Negociations-Environnementales-Multinationales-NEM-vers-une-Gouvernance-Environnementale-Mondiale-GEM,1136.html|location=Casablanca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the absence of joint rules for composing such fora leads to the development of non-transparent relations that favour the more powerful stakeholders. Criticisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Johal | first1 = Surjinder | last2 = Ulph | first2 = Alistair | title = Globalization, lobbying, and international environmental governance | journal = Review of International Economics | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–403 | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/1467-9396.00339 | date = August 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9396.00339 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; assert that they act more as a lobbying platform, wherein specific interest groups attempt to influence governments.

===Institutional reform===

Actors inside and outside the United Nations are discussing possibilities for global environmental governance that provides a solution to current problems of fragility, coordination and coherence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UN/UNPAN021755.pdf Resolution 60/1 of the United Nations General Assembly.]&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberation is focusing on the goal of making UNEP more efficient. A 2005 resolution recognizes “the need for more efficient environmental activities in the United Nations system, with enhanced coordination, improved policy advice and guidance, strengthened scientific knowledge, assessment and cooperation, better treaty compliance, while respecting the legal autonomy of the treaties, and better integration of environmental activities in the broader sustainable development framework.”

Proposals include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/62/issues/environmentalgov/resolution230708.pdf UN environmental governance report]&lt;/ref&gt;

* greater and better coordination between agencies;
* strengthen and acknowledge UNEP’s scientific role;
* identify MEA areas to strengthen coordination, cooperation and teamwork between different agreements;
* increase regional presence;
* implement the [[Bali Strategic Plan]] on improving technology training and support for the application of environmental measures in poor countries;
* demand that UNEP and MEAs participate formally in all relevant WTO committees as observers.
* strengthen its financial situation;
* improve secretariats’ efficiency and effectiveness.

One of the main studies addressing this issue proposes:

* clearly divide tasks between development organizations, UNEP and the MEAs
* adopt a political direction{{clarify|date=September 2013}} for environmental protection and sustainable development
* authorize the UNEP Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum to adopt the UNEP medium-term strategy
* allow Member States to formulate and administer MEAs an independent secretariat for each convention
* support UNEP in periodically assessing MEAs and ensure coordination and coherence
* establish directives for setting up national/regional platforms capable of incorporating MEAs in the Common Country Assessment (CCA) process and [[United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)]]&lt;ref&gt;The CCA is the main diagnostic tool available for teams working in UN countries and their partners. It is used to assess and create a shared understanding of the underlying challenges facing a country during its development. The UNDAF is a product of the CCA analysis and collaboration process and provides the basis for UN cooperation programmes. (Source: ISDR; Words into Action: A Guide for Implementing the Hyogo Framework; United Nations; 2007; chapter 4; p. 81-120).&lt;/ref&gt;
* establish a global joint planning framework
* study the aptitude and efficiency of environmental activities’ funding, focusing on differential costs
* examine and redefine the concept of funding differential costs as applicable to existing financial mechanisms
* reconsider remits, division of tasks and responsibilities between entities that provide services to the multipartite conferences. Clearly define the services that UN offices provide to MEA secretariats
* propose measures aiming to improve personnel provision and geographic distribution for MEA secretariats
* improve transparency resource use for supporting programmes and in providing services to MEAs. Draw up a joint budget for services supplied to MEAs.

===Education===

A 2001 Alliance 21 report proposes six fields of action:&lt;ref&gt;Ziaka, Yolanda; Robicon, Philippe; Souchon, Christian; Environmental Education: Six Proposals for Citizens’ Action. Proposal Paper, [http://www.alliance21.org Alliance for a Responsible, Plural and United World]; 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

* strengthen citizens' critical faculties to ensure greater democratic control of political orientations
* develop a global and critical approach
* develop civic education training for teachers
* develop training for certain socio-professional groups
* develop environmental education for the entire population;
* assess the resulting experiences of civil society

===Transform daily life===

Individuals can modify consumption, based on [[voluntary simplicity]]: changes in purchasing habits, simplified lifestyles (less work, less consumption, more socialization and constructive leisure time). But individual actions must not replace vigilance and pressure on policies.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt; Notions of responsible consumption developed over decades, revealing the political nature of individual purchases, according to the principle that consumption should satisfy the population’s basic needs. These needs comprise the physical wellbeing of individuals and society, a healthy diet, access to drinking water and plumbing, education, healthcare and physical safety.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt; The general attitude centres on the need to reduce consumption and reuse and recycle materials. In the case of food consumption, local, organic and fair trade products which avoid ill treatment of animals has become a major trend.

Alternatives to the personal automobile are increasing, including public transport, car sharing and bicycles and alternative propulsion systems.

Alternative energy sources are becoming less costly.

Ecological industrial processes turn the waste from one industry into raw materials for another.

Governments can reduce subsidies/increase taxes/tighten regulation on unsustainable activities.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

The [[Community Environmental governance Global Alliance]] encourages holistic approaches to environmental and economic challenges, incorporating indigenous knowledge. [[Okotoks]], [[Alberta]] capped population growth based on the carrying capacity of the Sheep River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okotoks.ca/default.aspx?cid=208&amp;lang=1 |title=Okotoks - 1. Water Management |publisher=Okotoks.ca |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fraser Basin Council Watershed Governance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraserbasin.bc.ca/ |title=Fraser Basin Council - Home |publisher=Fraserbasin.bc.ca |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in British Columbia, Canada, manages issues that span municipal jurisdictions. [[Smart Growth]] is an international movement that employs key tenets of Environmental governance in [[urban planning]].

===Policies and regulations===

Establish policies and regulations that promote “infrastructures for well being” whilst addressing the political, physical and cultural levels.

Eliminate subsidies that have a negative environmental impact and tax pollution

Promoting workers’ personal and family development.&lt;ref name=boug/&gt;

===Coordination===

A programme of national workshops on synergies between the three Rio Conventions launched in late 2000, in collaboration with the relevant secretariats. The goal was to strengthen coordination at the local level by:

* sharing information
* promoting political dialogue to obtain financial support and implement programmes
* enabling the secretariats to update their joint work programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sommetjohannesburg.org/initiatives/gouvernance-environnementale.html Diallo, Hama Arba; La gouvernance environnementale et la synergie entre les trois conventions globales (Environmental Governance and the Synergy between the Three Global Conventions); Johannesburg Summit document; 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Campbell,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Laura B.; The Effectiveness of WTO and WIPO: Lessons for Environmental Governance? in {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; “In the context of globalization, the question of linking up environmental themes with other subjects, such as trade, investment and conflict resolution mechanisms, as well as the economic incentives to participate in and apply agreements would seem to provide an important lesson for the effective development of environmental governance structures.” Environmental concerns would become part of the global economic system. “These problems also contain the seeds of a new generation of international conflicts that could affect both the stability of international relations and collective security. Which is why the concept of ‘collective security’ has arisen.”

Moving local decisions to the global level is as important as the way in which local initiatives and best practices are part of a global system. Kanie&lt;ref&gt;Kanie, Norichika; Global Environmental Governance in Terms of Vertical Linkages;  pp. 86-113 {{harvnb|Kanie|Haas|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that NGOs, scientists, international institutions and stakeholder partnerships can reduce the distance that separates the local and international levels.

By analogy to evidence-based medicine (EBM),&lt;ref name=eddy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=D.M.|title=Evidence-Based Medicine: A Unified Approach|journal=Health Aff|year=2005|volume=24|issue=1|pages=9–17|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.9|pmid=15647211}}&lt;/ref&gt; the umbrella term evidence-based toxicology (EBT) has been coined to group all approaches intended to better implement the above-mentioned evidence-based principles in toxicology in general and in toxicological decision-making in particular. Besides systematic reviews, the core evidence-based tool, such approaches include ''inter alia'' the establishment and universal use of a common ontology, justified design and rigorous conduct of studies, consistently structured and detailed reporting of experimental evidence, probabilistic uncertainty and risk assessment, and the development of synthesis methodology to integrate evidence from diverse evidence streams, e.g. from human observational studies, animal studies, in vitro studies and in silico modeling. A main initial impetus for translating evidence-based approaches to toxicology was the need to improve the performance assessment of toxicological test methods.&lt;ref name=hoff05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=S.|author2=Hartung, T|title=Diagnosis: toxic!  Trying to apply approaches of clinical diagnostics and prevalence in toxicology considerations|journal=Toxicol Sci|year=2005|volume=85|pages=422–428|doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfi099}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. National Research Council (NRC) concurs that new means of assessment are needed to keep pace with recent advances in the development of toxicological test methods, capitalizing on enhanced scientific understanding through modern biochemistry and molecular biology.&lt;ref name=nrc&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council|title=Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy|year=2007|publisher=The National Academies Press,|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
A key tool in evidence-based medicine that holds promise for EBT is the systematic review.  Historically, authors of reviews assessing the results of toxicological studies on a particular topic have searched, selected, and weighed the scientific evidence in a non-systematic and non-transparent way.  Due to their narrative nature, these reviews tend to be subjective, potentially biased, and not readily reproducible.&lt;ref name=hoff06 /&gt;  Two examples highlighting these deficiencies are the risk assessments of trichloroethylene and bisphenol A (BPA).  Twenty-seven different risk assessments of the evidence that trichloroethylene causes cancer have come to substantially different conclusions.&lt;ref name=ruden03&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rudén|first=C.|title=The use and evaluation of primary data in 29 trichloroethylene carcinogen risk assessments|journal=Regul Toxicol Pharmacol|year=2001|volume=34|pages=3–16|doi=10.1006/rtph.2001.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessments of BPA range from low risk of harm to the public to potential risks (for some populations), leading to different political decisions.&lt;ref name=whaley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whaley|first=P.|author2=Halsall, C. |author3=Ågerstrand, R.A. |author4=Aiassa, E. |title=Implementing systematic review techniques in chemical risk assessment: Challenges, opportunities and recommendations.|journal=Environ Int|year=2016|volume=92-93|pages=556–64|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2015.11.002|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic reviews can help reducing such divergent views.&lt;ref name=stephens13 /&gt; In contrast with narrative reviews, they reflect a highly structured approach to reviewing and synthesizing the scientific literature while limiting bias.&lt;ref name=stephens13 /&gt;  The steps to carrying out a systematic review include framing the question to be addressed; identifying and retrieving relevant studies; determining if any retrieved studies should be excluded from the analysis; and appraising the included studies in terms of their methodological quality and risk of bias.  Ultimately the data should be synthesized across studies, if possible by a meta-analysis.  A protocol of how the review will be conducted is prepared ahead of time and ideally should be registered and/or published.

Scientists have made progress in their efforts to apply the systematic review framework to evaluating the evidence for associations between environmental toxicants and human health risks.  To date, researchers have shown that important elements of the framework established in evidence-based medicine can be adapted to toxicology with little change, and some studies have been attempted.&lt;ref name=Navas-Acien05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Navas-Acien|first=A.|author2=Sharrett, A.

== Background ==

Evidence-based approaches were first conceived as a means of anchoring policy decisions, not to current practices or the beliefs of experts, but to experimental evidence.&lt;ref name=Eddy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=D.M.|title=Practice Policies:  Guidelines for Methods.|journal=JAMA|year=1990|volume=263|issue=13|pages=1839–1841|doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03440130133041}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) was launched slightly later. Its rise as a distinct discipline is generally credited to the work and advocacy of Scottish epidemiologist Archie Cochrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=D.|title=Essential Evidence-Based Medicine|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] named in his honor was launched at Oxford University in 1993 to promote evidence-based reviews of clinical medical literature. More recently, EBM expanded to encompass [[evidence-based health care]] (EBHC).

EBM/HC involves the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients taking patients' preferences into account.&lt;ref name=Sackett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sackett|first=D.L.|author2=Rosenberg, W.M. |author3=Gray, J.A. |author4=Haynes, R.B. |title=Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't|journal=BMJ|year=1996|volume=312|pages=71–72|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to EBM, medical decisions about diagnosis, prevention, treatment or harm were often made without a rigorous evaluation of the alternatives.  Research in the 1970s and 1980s showed that different physicians regularly recommended different treatments and tests for patients with ailments that were essentially the same, and that large proportions of procedures being performed by physicians were considered inappropriate by the standards of medical experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wennberg|first=J.E.|author2=Gittelsohn, A.|title=Small Area Variations in Health Care Delivery|journal=Science|year=1973|volume=182|issue=4117|pages=1102–1108|doi=10.1126/science.182.4117.1102|pmid=4750608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chassin|first=M.R.|author2=Kosecoff J. |author3=Solomon D.H. |author4=Brook R.H. |title=How Coronary Angiography Is Used: Clinical Determinants of Appropriateness|journal=JAMA|year=1987|volume=258|issue=18|pages=2543–2547|doi=10.1001/jama.258.18.2543 |pmid=3312657}}&lt;/ref&gt;
EBM/HC supporters stress that while evidence always has been important to the practice of medicine, EBM/HC provides an enhanced approach of identifying, assessing, and summarizing evidence.  EBT's supporters make a similar argument.&lt;ref name="stephens13" /&gt;

The idea of translating evidence-based approaches from medicine to toxicology has been percolating for two decades, with proponents in both medicine and toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buckley|first=N.A.|author2=Smith, A. J.|title=Evidence-based medicine in toxicology: where is the evidence?|journal=Lancet|year=1996|volume=347|pages=1167–1169|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(96)90615-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodes|first=J.E.|title=The amalgam controversy – an evidence-based analysis|journal=J Am Dent Assoc|year=2001|volume=132|pages=348–356|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2001.0178|pmid=11258092|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three research papers published in 2005 and 2006 catalyzed what eventually became known as EBT by suggesting that EBM's established tools and concepts might serve as a prototype of evidence-based decision-making in toxicology.&lt;ref name=hoff06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hoff05 /&gt;&lt;ref name=guzelian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guzelian|first=P.S.|author2=Victoroff, M.S. |author3=Halmes, N.C. |title=Evidence-based toxicology: a comprehensive framework for causation|journal=Hum Exp Toxicol|year=2005|volume=24|pages=161–201|doi=10.1191/0960327105ht517oa|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process and progress ==

The First International Forum Toward Evidence-Based Toxicology was held in 2007.&lt;ref name=Hoffman07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=S.|author2=Griesinger, C. |author3=Coecke, S. |author4=Kinser, A. |title=1st International Forum Towards Evidence-Based Toxicology.|journal=ALTEX|year=2007|volume=24|pages=354–355.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forum was organized by the European Commission and attended by 170 scientists from more than 25 European, American, and Asian countries.  The goal was to explore the available concepts of EBT, and to launch an initiative to formally implement evidence-based assessment methods in toxicology.

The starting point for the discussions were two research papers suggesting that the tools and concepts established in evidence-based medicine could serve as a prototype of evidence-based decision-making for evaluating toxicological data.&lt;ref name=hoff06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hoff05 /&gt;  Apparent fundamental differences between medicine and toxicology were carefully considered during these discussions.  Forum participants attempted to bridge the two disciplines in order to make use of the accrued wisdom and apply this approach to toxicology.  (See http://www.ebtox.org/resources/evidence-based-toxicology-explained/ .)

The proceedings of this forum were published as a special issue in ''Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings of the 1st International Forum  Towards Evidence-Based Toxicology|journal=Hum Exp Toxicol|year=2009|volume=28|issue=2-3|pages=71–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EBT's proponents include experts in EBM, public health, and toxicology who believe that EBT can help toxicologists to better serve the goals of health protection and safety assurance.&lt;ref name=silberalt13 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephens16" /&gt; They argue that EBT's methodologies for collecting, appraising, and pooling evidence can help ensure that all available information on a given topic is evaluated in a transparent, unbiased, and reproducible manner. They contend that EBT's concept of the systematic review could prove particularly helpful for the standardization and quality assurance of novel methodologies for evaluating toxicity, as well as for their formal validation.  In this regard, EBT may prove particularly useful for assessing the performance of newer non-animal “21st century” toxicology tools.  EBT can also help scientists integrate new toxicological test methods into test strategies being implemented across the globe.

In 2010, a group of EBT supporters joined together to convene a workshop titled “21st Century Validation for 21st Century Tools.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rudacille|first=D.|title=Summary of the July 2010 Workshop, "21st Century Validation Strategies for 21st Century Tools"|journal=ALTEX|year=2010|volume=27|issue=2|pages=279–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The session on the potential for evidence-based approaches to assess the performance of the new generation of non-animal test methods inspired the formation of the EBTC.   The EBTC was officially launched in the U.S. in 2011 at a Society of Toxicology conference&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Conference Report:  Evidence-based Toxicology Collaboration  Kick-off Meeting|journal=Altex|year=2011|volume=28|issue=2|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and convened its first workshop in 2012.&lt;ref name=stephens13 /&gt;  The EBTC's EU branch was officially opened during the 2012 Eurotox conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=S.|date=|title=Kick-off of the Evidence-Based Toxicology Collaboration Europe.|url=|journal=ALTEX|volume=29|pages=456|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the EBTC hosted a workshop on ‘The Emergence of Systematic Review and Related Evidence-based Approaches in Toxicology“ with speakers representing US and European organizations that are implementing and promoting the use of systematic reviews for toxicological questions.  The experts noted that the structured approach of systematic reviews increases objectivity and transparency but also made clear that the approach requires a substantial time investment, which is a challenge to its more widespread adoption. Consequently, the participants called for close collaboration of interested organizations, which they determined to be a pre-requisite for the broad and efficient introduction of systematic reviews in toxicology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications of EBT ==

=== Regulatory decision-making ===

Some scientists and policymakers would like EBT to help them combine information from various sources.  Toxicological evidence can be assigned to evidence streams, sets of studies representing the same type or level of evidence, such as human (observational) studies, animal studies, in vitro or mechanistic studies.  EBT can be applied both within one evidence stream, and it is especially well-suited to be applied across multiple evidence streams.  Regulators often designate one study as “the lead study,” then use later studies as additional information.  Many perceive this as unsatisfying, but objective approaches to combine study results are lacking. The EBM concept of the systematic review has promise for this application, and some structured reviews serve as forerunners for this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Navas-Ancien|first=A.|author2=Guallar, E. |author3=Silbergeld, E. K. |author4=Rothenberg, S. J. |title=Lead exposure and cardiovascular disease--a systematic review|journal=Environ Health Perspect|year=2007|volume=115|pages=472–482 |doi=10.1289/ehp.9785 |pmid=17431501 |pmc=1849948}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientific Opinion on the risk assessment peri- and post-menopausal women taking food supplements containing isoflavones.|journal=EFSA Journal|year=2015|volume=13|issue=10|pages=4246–4588doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4246|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Systematic literature review on the effects of fluoride on learning and memory in animal studies.|url=https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/ohat/pubs/ntp_rr/01fluoride_508.pdf|publisher=National Toxicology Program|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluating effects of environmental exposures ===

The U.S. National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) has started to use  systematic review methodology for the program's evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/ohat/pubs/handbookjan2015_508.pdf|title=Handbook for Conducting a Literature-Based Health Assessment Using Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Approach for Systematic Review and Evidence Integration|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=National Toxicology Program|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first systematic review was completed in 2016, reviewing the effects of fluoride on learning and memory in animal studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  OHAT’s approach is tailored to its mandate, but its seems especially appropriate for substances with substantial yet conflicting literature, and hence the need for a systematic reviews to sort out somewhat confusing situations.

=== Causation ===

One application of EBT focuses on causation.&lt;ref name=guzelian /&gt;  It addresses the challenge of tracing a health effect back to a toxicant, such as lung cancer to smoking.  This approach is similar to legal arguments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodricks|first=J.V.|title=Evaluating disease causation in humans exposed to toxic substances|journal=J Law Policy|year=2006|volume=41|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some experts warn that this approach could increase the evidence burden for proving causation, and thereby increase the difficulty involved in banning toxic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rudén|first=C.|author2=Hansson, S. O.|title=Evidence-based toxicology: "sound science" in new disguise|journal=Int J Occup Environ Health|year=2008|volume=14|pages=299–306|doi=10.1179/oeh.2008.14.4.299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical toxicology ===

Practitioners of clinical toxicology, which is concerned with the treatment of patients known to be exposed to toxic substances, are also beginning to use an EBM-style approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dargan|first=P.I.|author2=Wallace, C. I. |author3=Jones, A. L. |title=An evidence based flowchart to guide the management of acute salicylate (aspirin) overdose|journal=Emerg Med J|year=2002|volume=19|pages=206–209|doi=10.1136/emj.19.3.206|pmid=11971828|pmc=1725844}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=C..I.|author2=Dargan, P. I. |author3=Jones, A. L. |title=Paracetamol overdose: an evidence based flowchart to guide management|journal=Emerg Med J|year=2002|volume=19|pages=202–205|doi=10.1136/emj.19.3.202|pmc=1725876}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guidance documents based on this approach have already been published.

=== 21st century toxicology ===

The National Research Council's (NRC) landmark 2007 publication, Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century, has also been an impetus for EBT. EBT provides new tools for assessing test method performance.  Also, as the focus of 21st century toxicology shifts from animal biology to human biology, EBT provides a method for comparatively evaluating the results gleaned from new methods of investigating the effects of chemical exposure.&lt;ref name="hart09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartung|first=T.|year=2009|title=Food for thought... on evidence-based toxicology|journal=ALTEX|volume=26|issue=2|pages=75–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and challenges ==

The specific differences between toxicology and medicine/health care cause challenges for implementing EBT.&lt;ref name=silberalt13 /&gt; Evidence-based methodology of clinical research has been focused on a single type of study—randomized, controlled clinical trials, which are a direct measure of the effectiveness of the health care intervention under scrutiny.  In contrast, toxicology employs a variety of different kinds of studies in three distinct evidence streams:  human (observational) studies, animal studies, and non-animal studies.  Because human evidence is frequently lacking, most evidence is obtained by using animal and non-animal models, which—by definition—is more difficult to generalize and extrapolate to humans.  This methodological heterogeneity complicates evidence integration within an evidence stream, such as when inconsistent evidence is obtained from different animal species, but even more so across evidence streams.  Adding to the difficulty is the reality that much toxicological evidence, more so than in medicine and health care, is not readily accessible in the literature.&lt;ref name=stephens13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=silberalt13 /&gt;  Moreover, the role of expert judgment, especially in systematic reviews, needs to be clearly defined, as it is a common misperception that evidence-based approaches leave no room for it.  Systematic reviews should strive to make expert judgments clear along with the scientific basis for those judgments in developing conclusions for a systematic review.  Further issues to be worked out include exposures to multiple substances, the multitude of outcomes observed in some animal studies, and challenges in improving the experimental designs and reporting of studies.

'''Fault tolerance''' is the property that enables a [[system]] to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some (one or more faults within) of its components. If its operating quality decreases at all, the decrease is proportional to the severity of the failure, as compared to a native designed system in which even a small failure can cause total breakdown. Fault tolerance is particularly sought after in [[high-availability]] or [[life-critical system]]s.  The ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as '''graceful degradation'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1186&amp;context=cs_faculty_pubs Adaptive Fault Tolerance and Graceful Degradation], Oscar González et al., 1997, University of Massachusetts - Amherst&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fault-tolerant design''' enables a system to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system [[failure|fails]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B. W. (1984). "Fault-Tolerant Microprocessor-Based Systems", IEEE Micro, vol. 4, no. 6, pp. 6–21&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly used to describe [[computer system]]s designed to continue more or less fully operational with, perhaps, a reduction in [[throughput]] or an increase in [[response time (technology)|response time]] in the event of some partial failure. That is, the system as a whole is not stopped due to problems either in the [[computer hardware|hardware]] or the [[software]]. An example in another field is a motor vehicle designed so it will continue to be drivable if one of the tires is punctured, or a structure that is able to retain its integrity in the presence of damage due to causes such as [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[corrosion]], manufacturing flaws, or impact.

Within the scope of an ''individual'' system, fault tolerance can be achieved by anticipating exceptional conditions and building the system to cope with them, and, in general, aiming for [[self-stabilization]] so that the system converges towards an error-free state. However, if the consequences of a system failure are catastrophic, or the cost of making it sufficiently reliable is very high, a better solution may be to use some form of duplication. In any case, if the consequence of a system failure is so catastrophic, the system must be able to use reversion to fall back to a safe mode. This is similar to roll-back recovery but can be a human action if humans are present in the loop.

==Terminology==

[[Image:Graceful Degradation of Transparency.png|thumb|256px|right|An example of graceful degradation by design in an image with transparency. The top two images are each the result of viewing the composite image in a viewer that recognises transparency. The bottom two images are the result in a viewer with no support for transparency. Because the transparency mask (center bottom) is discarded, only the overlay (center top) remains; the image on the left has been designed to degrade gracefully, hence is still meaningful without its transparency information.]]
A highly fault-tolerant system might continue at the same level of performance even though one or more components have failed.  For example, a building with a backup electrical generator will provide the same voltage to wall outlets even if the grid power fails.

A system that is designed to [[fail safe]], or fail-secure, or '''fail gracefully''', whether it functions at a reduced level or fails completely, does so in a way that protects people, property, or data from injury, damage, intrusion, or disclosure.  In computers, a program might fail-safe by executing a [[graceful exit]] (as opposed to an uncontrolled crash) in order to prevent data corruption after experiencing an error.  A similar distinction is made between "failing well" and "[[failing badly]]".

[[Fail-deadly]] is the opposite strategy, which can be used in weapon systems that are designed to kill or injure targets even if part of the system is damaged or destroyed.

A system that is designed to experience '''graceful degradation''', or to '''fail soft''' (used in computing, similar to "fail safe"&lt;ref&gt;Stallings, W (2009): Operating Systems. Internals and Design Principles'', sixth edition&lt;/ref&gt;) operates at a reduced level of performance after some component failures.  For example, a building may operate lighting at reduced levels and elevators at reduced speeds if grid power fails, rather than either trapping people in the dark completely or continuing to operate at full power.  In computing an example of graceful degradation is that if insufficient network bandwidth is available to stream an online video, a lower-resolution version might be streamed in place of the high-resolution version.  [[Progressive enhancement]] is an example in computing, where web pages are available in a basic functional format for older, small-screen, or limited-capability web browsers, but in an enhanced version for browsers capable of handling additional technologies or that have a larger display available.

In [[fault-tolerant computer system]]s, programs that are considered [[Robustness (computer science)|robust]] are designed to continue operation despite an error, exception, or invalid input, instead of crashing completely.  [[Software brittleness]] is the opposite of robustness.  [[Resilience (network)|Resilient networks]] continue to transmit data despite the failure of some links or nodes; [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilient buildings and infrastructure]] are likewise expected to prevent complete failure in situations like earthquakes, floods, or collisions.

A system with high [[failure transparency]] will alert users that a component failure has occurred, even if it continues to operate with full performance, so that failure can be repaired or imminent complete failure anticipated.  Likewise, a [[fail-fast]] component is designed to report at the first point of failure, rather than allow downstream components to fail and generate reports then.  This allows easier diagnosis of the underlying problem, and may prevent improper operation in a broken state.

==Redundancy==
{{main article|Redundancy (engineering)}}
Redundancy is the provision of functional capabilities that would be unnecessary in a fault-free environment.&lt;ref&gt;Laprie, J. C. (1985). "Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance: Concepts and Terminology", Proceedings of 15th International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing (FTSC-15), pp. 2–11&lt;/ref&gt;
This can consist of backup components that automatically "kick in" if one component fails. For example, large cargo trucks can lose a tire without any major consequences. They have many tires, and no one tire is critical (with the exception of the front tires, which are used to steer, but generally carry less load, each and in total, than the other four to 16, so are less likely to fail).
The idea of incorporating redundancy in order to improve the reliability of a system was pioneered by [[John von Neumann]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, J. (1956). "Probabilistic Logics and Synthesis of Reliable Organisms from Unreliable Components", in Automata Studies, eds. C. Shannon and J. McCarthy,  Princeton University Press, pp. 43–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Two kinds of redundancy are possible:&lt;ref&gt;Avizienis, A. (1976). "Fault-Tolerant Systems", IEEE Transactions on Computers, vol. 25, no. 12, pp. 1304–1312&lt;/ref&gt; space redundancy and time redundancy. Space redundancy provides additional components, functions, or data items that are unnecessary for fault-free operation.  Space redundancy is further classified into hardware, software and information redundancy, depending on the type of redundant resources added to the system.  In time redundancy the computation or data transmission is repeated and the result is compared to a stored copy of the previous result. The current terminology for this kind of testing is referred to as 'In Service Fault Tolerance Testing or ISFTT for short.

==Criteria==
Providing fault-tolerant design for every component is normally not an option. Associated redundancy brings a number of penalties: increase in weight, size, power consumption, cost, as well as time to design, verify, and test. Therefore, a number of choices have to be examined to determine which components should be fault tolerant:&lt;ref&gt;Dubrova, E. (2013). "Fault-Tolerant Design", Springer, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-4614-2112-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''How critical is the component?''' In a car, the radio is not critical, so this component has less need for fault tolerance.
* '''How likely is the component to fail?''' Some components, like the drive shaft in a car, are not likely to fail, so no fault tolerance is needed.
* '''How expensive is it to make the component fault tolerant?''' Requiring a redundant car engine, for example, would likely be too expensive both economically and in terms of weight and space, to be considered.

An example of a component that passes all the tests is a car's occupant restraint system. While we do not normally think of the ''primary'' occupant restraint system, it is [[gravity]]. If the vehicle rolls over or undergoes severe g-forces, then this primary method of occupant restraint may fail. Restraining the occupants during such an accident is absolutely critical to safety, so we pass the first test. Accidents causing occupant ejection were quite common before [[seat belt]]s, so we pass the second test. The cost of a redundant restraint method like seat belts is quite low, both economically and in terms of weight and space, so we pass the third test. Therefore, adding seat belts to all vehicles is an excellent idea. Other "supplemental restraint systems", such as [[airbag]]s, are more expensive and so pass that test by a smaller margin.

Another excellent and long-term example of this principle being put into practice is the braking system: whilst the actual brake mechanisms are critical, they are not particularly prone to sudden (rather than progressive) failure, and are in any case necessarily duplicated to allow even and balanced application of brake force to all wheels. It would also be prohibitively costly to further double-up the main components and they would add considerable weight. However, the similarly critical systems for actuating the brakes under driver control are inherently less robust, generally using a cable (can rust, stretch, jam, snap) or hydraulic fluid (can leak, boil and develop bubbles, absorb water and thus lose effectiveness). Thus in most modern cars the footbrake hydraulic brake circuit is diagonally divided to give two smaller points of failure, the loss of either only reducing brake power by 50% and not causing as much dangerous brakeforce imbalance as a straight front-back or left-right split, and should the hydraulic circuit fail completely (a relatively very rare occurrence), there is a failsafe in the form of the cable-actuated parking brake that operates the otherwise relatively weak rear brakes, but can still bring the vehicle to a safe halt in conjunction with transmission/engine braking so long as the demands on it are in line with normal traffic flow. The culmulatively unlikely combination of total footbrake failure with the need for harsh braking in an emergency will likely result in a collision, but still one at lower speed than would otherwise have been the case.

In comparison with the footpedal activated service brake, the parking brake itself is a less critical item, and unless it is being used as a one-time backup for the footbrake, will not cause immediate danger if it is found to be nonfunctional at the moment of application. Therefore, no redundancy is built into it per se (and it typically uses a cheaper, lighter, but less hardwearing cable actuation system), and it can suffice, if this happens on a hill, to use the footbrake to momentarily hold the vehicle still, before driving off to find a flat piece of road on which to stop. Alternatively, on shallow gradients, the transmission can be shifted into Park, Reverse or First gear, and the transmission lock / engine compression used to hold it stationary, as there is no need for them to include the sophistication to first bring it to a halt.

On motorcycles, a similar level of fail-safety is provided by simpler methods; firstly the front and rear brake systems being entirely separate, regardless of their method of activation (that can be cable, rod or hydraulic), allowing one to fail entirely whilst leaving the other unaffected. Secondly, the rear brake is relatively strong compared to its automotive cousin, even being a powerful disc on sports models, even though the usual intent is for the front system to provide the vast majority of braking force; as the overall vehicle weight is more central, the rear tyre is generally larger and grippier, and the rider can lean back to put more weight on it, therefore allowing more brake force to be applied before the wheel locks up. On cheaper, slower utility-class machines, even if the front wheel should use a hydraulic disc for extra brake force and easier packaging, the rear will usually be a primitive, somewhat inefficient, but exceptionally robust rod-actuated drum, thanks to the ease of connecting the footpedal to the wheel in this way and, more importantly, the near impossibility of catastrophic failure even if the rest of the machine, like a lot of low-priced bikes after their first few years of use, is on the point of collapse from neglected maintenance.

==Requirements==

The basic characteristics of fault tolerance require:

# No [[single point of failure]] – If a system experiences a failure, it must continue to operate without interruption during the repair process.
# [[Fault isolation]] to the failing component – When a failure occurs, the system must be able to isolate the failure to the offending component. This requires the addition of dedicated failure detection mechanisms that exist only for the purpose of fault isolation. Recovery from a fault condition requires classifying the fault or failing component. The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) categorizes faults based on locality, cause, duration, and effect.{{Where|date=June 2017}}{{clarify|date=June 2017}}
# Fault containment to prevent propagation of the failure – Some failure mechanisms can cause a system to fail by propagating the failure to the rest of the system. An example of this kind of failure is the "rogue transmitter" that can swamp legitimate communication in a system and cause overall system failure. [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]]s or other mechanisms that isolate a rogue transmitter or failing component to protect the system are required.
# Availability of [[Reversion (software development)|reversion modes]]{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

In addition, fault-tolerant systems are characterized in terms of both planned service outages and unplanned service outages. These are usually measured at the application level and not just at a hardware level. The figure of merit is called [[availability]] and is expressed as a percentage. For example, a [[5 nines|five nines]] system would statistically provide 99.999% availability.

Fault-tolerant systems are typically based on the concept of redundancy.

==Replication==

Spare components address the first fundamental characteristic of fault tolerance in three ways:
* [[Replication (computer science)|Replication]]: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system or subsystem, directing tasks or requests to all of them in [[parallel computing|parallel]], and choosing the correct result on the basis of a [[quorum]];
* [[Redundancy (engineering)|Redundancy]]: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system and switching to one of the remaining instances in case of a failure ([[failover]]);
* Diversity: Providing multiple ''different'' implementations of the same specification, and using them like replicated systems to cope with errors in a specific implementation.

All implementations of [[RAID]], [[RAID|redundant array of independent disks]], except RAID 0, are examples of a fault-tolerant [[data storage device|storage device]] that uses [[data redundancy]].

A [[lockstep (computing)|lockstep]] fault-tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel. At any time, all the replications of each element should be in the same state. The same inputs are provided to each [[replication (computing)|replication]], and the same outputs are expected. The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit. A machine with two replications of each element is termed [[dual modular redundancy|dual modular redundant]] (DMR). The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods. A machine with three replications of each element is termed [[triple modular redundancy|triple modular redundant]] (TMR). The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two-to-one vote is observed. In this case, the voting circuit can output the correct result, and discard the erroneous version. After this, the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two, and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode. This model can be applied to any larger number of replications.

[[Lockstep (computing)|Lockstep]] fault-tolerant machines are most easily made fully [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronous]], with each gate of each replication making the same state transition on the same edge of the clock, and the clocks to the replications being exactly in phase. However, it is possible to build lockstep systems without this requirement.

Bringing the replications into synchrony requires making their internal stored states the same. They can be started from a fixed initial state, such as the reset state. Alternatively, the internal state of one replica can be copied to another replica.

One variant of DMR is '''pair-and-spare'''. Two replicated elements operate in lockstep as a pair, with a voting circuit that detects any mismatch between their operations and outputs a signal indicating that there is an error. Another pair operates exactly the same way. A final circuit selects the output of the pair that does not proclaim that it is in error. Pair-and-spare requires four replicas rather than the three of TMR, but has been used commercially.

==Disadvantages==
Fault-tolerant design's advantages are obvious, while many of its disadvantages are not:

* '''Interference with fault detection in the same component.''' To continue the above passenger vehicle example, with either of the fault-tolerant systems it may not be obvious to the driver when a tire has been punctured. This is usually handled with a separate "automated fault-detection system". In the case of the tire, an air pressure monitor detects the loss of pressure and notifies the driver. The alternative is a "manual fault-detection system", such as manually inspecting all tires at each stop.
* '''Interference with fault detection in another component.''' Another variation of this problem is when fault tolerance in one component prevents fault detection in a different component. For example, if component B performs some operation based on the output from component A, then fault tolerance in B can hide a problem with A. If component B is later changed (to a less fault-tolerant design) the system may fail suddenly, making it appear that the new component B is the problem. Only after the system has been carefully scrutinized will it become clear that the root problem is actually with component A.
* '''Reduction of priority of fault correction.''' Even if the operator is aware of the fault, having a fault-tolerant system is likely to reduce the importance of repairing the fault. If the faults are not corrected, this will eventually lead to system failure, when the fault-tolerant component fails completely or when all redundant components have also failed.
* '''Test difficulty.''' For certain critical fault-tolerant systems, such as a [[nuclear reactor]], there is no easy way to verify that the backup components are functional. The most infamous example of this is [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], where operators tested the emergency backup cooling by disabling primary and secondary cooling. The backup failed, resulting in a core meltdown and massive release of radiation.
* '''Cost.''' Both fault-tolerant components and redundant components tend to increase cost. This can be a purely economic cost or can include other measures, such as weight. [[Human spaceflight|Manned spaceships]], for example, have so many redundant and fault-tolerant components that their weight is increased dramatically over unmanned systems, which don't require the same level of safety.
* '''Inferior components.''' A fault-tolerant design may allow for the use of inferior components, which would have otherwise made the system inoperable.  While this practice has the potential to mitigate the cost increase, use of multiple inferior components may lower the reliability of the system to a level equal to, or even worse than, a comparable non-fault-tolerant system.

==Examples==
Hardware fault tolerance sometimes requires that broken parts be taken out and replaced with new parts while the system is still operational (in computing known as ''[[hot swapping]]''). Such a system implemented with a single backup is known as '''single point tolerant''', and represents the vast majority of fault-tolerant systems. In such systems the [[mean time between failure]]s should be long enough for the operators to have time to fix the broken devices ([[mean time to repair]]) before the backup also fails. It helps if the time between failures is as long as possible, but this is not specifically required in a fault-tolerant system.

Fault tolerance is notably successful in computer applications. [[Tandem Computers]] built their entire business on such machines, which used single-point tolerance to create their [[NonStop]] systems with [[uptime]]s measured in years.

Fail-safe architectures may encompass also the computer software, for example by process [[replication (computer science)|replication]].

Data formats may also be designed to degrade gracefully. [[HTML]] for example, is designed to be [[forward compatibility|forward compatible]], allowing new HTML entities to be ignored by [[Web browser]]s that do not understand them without causing the document to be unusable.

==Related terms==
There is a difference between fault tolerance and systems that rarely have problems. For instance, the [[Western Electric]] [[Crossbar switch|crossbar]] systems had failure rates of two hours per forty years, and therefore were highly ''fault resistant''. But when a fault did occur they still stopped operating completely, and therefore were not ''fault tolerant''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">The '''Globe of Matelica''' (Globo of Matelica) is an ancient Roman [[sundial]] sculpted on a marble ball. The artifact was found during the 1985 reconstruction of the medieval Palazzo Pretorio, presently Museo Civico Archeologico, of [[Matelica]] in the region of [[Marche]], Italy.

==Description==
The globe measures nearly 29&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter an appears to be sculpted from a cristalline marble originating near [[Ephesus]] in present-day Turkey. It is thought to date from the first two centuries CE. There is one similar item, identified in 1939 by [[Carl William Blegen]] in a Museum in [[Nafplio]], Greece.

All that remains is the stone component, it is engraved with a variety or lines and letter sare inscribed. The sphere is bisected by a center line while on its top are three concentric circles of various diameters, intersected by an arc of a circle and on which words in ancient Greek alphabet are still visible, and 13 holes, each marked by a Greek letter. In these holes were probably metallic insertions that delineated the hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiqui.it/archeoastronomia/globo.htm Description of Astronomical calculus of globe], by  Andrea Carusi and Danilo Baldini, from l'Astronomia n. 92 (October 1989) pp. 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lower part there is a large conical depression which ends with a big rectangular hole maybe made to secure the base. Other theories for the sphere are that it was used for astronomical calculations, thus as an [[armillary sphere]] or for use in [[spherical astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismo.marche.it/Turismi/Cultura-The-genius-of-Marche/The-best-of/Title/Globo-di-Matelica/IdPOI/3677/C2/31/T/16?page=1 Tourism Office of the Region of Marche], entry on globe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Graduation Pledge of Social and Environmental Responsibility''' has been offered since 1987 at [[college]]s and [[University|universities]] throughout the [[United States]] and the world. The Pledge states: ''I pledge to explore and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job I consider and will try to improve these aspects of any organizations for which I work.'' The purpose of the Pledge is to encourage graduating students to be mindful of the social and environmental impacts of their [[employment]] as they enter the workforce or continue their [[education]]. It is up to students to define for themselves what socially and environmentally responsible means. Over one hundred Universities and colleges as well as some high schools use the pledge to some extent. There are several different types of schools involved, including the following:

* Liberal arts colleges such as [[Manchester University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.edu/common/graduation/gpa.htm |title=Graduation Pledge |website=Manchester.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juniata College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.juniata.edu/services/provost/commencement/pledge.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209233740/http://www.juniata.edu/services/provost/commencement/pledge.html |archivedate=2011-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhlenberg College]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/campuslife/sye/GPA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225221825/http://www.muhlenberg.edu/main/campuslife/sye/GPA.html |archivedate=2011-12-25 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hartwick College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartwick.edu/about-us/centers-and-institutes/the-pine-lake-institute-for-environmental-and-sustainability-studies/sustainability-at-hartwick/graduation-pledge |title=Pine Lake Institute for Environmental &amp; Sustainability Studies - Hartwick College |website=Hartwick.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who voluntarily sign the pledge seek out employment that reflects their values, sometimes turning down jobs with which they do not feel comfortable. Others work to make changes after they are on the job. Some examples include promoting [[recycling]] at their workplace, removing discriminatory language from training materials, working for [[gender equality]] in athletics, and helping to convince employers to reject contracts that would clearly have negative impacts on society or the environment.

The Pledge was first established at [[Humboldt State University]], [[California]], in 1987. Manchester University in [[Indiana]] hosted the effort from 1996 to 2007, at which time [[Bentley University]] near [[Boston]] became the host. The project takes shape in different ways depending on the institution. At some colleges, for example, students sign wallet-sized cards with the Pledge written on them that they can keep as a reminder of the commitment they've made. Some institutions put the Pledge into the formal program for their Commencement ceremonies. At other institutions, pledge signers wear green ribbons or green tassels at Commencement to signify their commitment (some schools use a different color of ribbon). At Bentley University the pledge is a "capstone" of its four-year Civic Leadership Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.bentley.edu/alliance/BCLP/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209232933/http://legacy.bentley.edu/alliance/BCLP/ |archivedate=2011-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Humboldt State University, the student government funds a student Pledge coordinator internship.
The Pledge serves to promote social and environmental responsibility on three different levels: Students and alumni who are making choices about employment; schools including values and citizenship in their curriculum as opposed to just knowledge and skills; and the workplaces and wider society being concerned about issues beyond just the bottom line. The Graduation Pledge Alliance maintains a web site for campus organizers and those who have signed the Pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graduationpledge.org |title=Graduation Pledge Alliance &amp;#124; Social and Environmental Responsibility Works |website=Graduationpledge.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9038">'''Heliotropism''', a form of [[tropism]], is the [[diurnal motion]] or seasonal motion of plant parts (flowers or leaves) in response to the direction of the sun. 
The habit of some plants to move in the direction of the sun was already known by the Ancient Greeks. They named one of those plants after that property [[Heliotropium]], meaning ''sun turn''. The Greeks assumed it to be a passive effect, presumably the loss of fluid on the illuminated side, that did not need further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/18/5/1110.full |title=Phototropism: Bending towards Enlightenment |first=Craig W. |last=Whippo |journal=The Plant Cell |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages= 1110–1119 |year=2006 |accessdate=2012-08-08 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.039669 |pmid=16670442 |pmc=1456868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's logic that plants are passive and immobile organisms prevailed. In the 19th century, however, botanists discovered that growth processes in the plant were involved, and conducted increasingly ingenious experiments. [[A. P. de Candolle]] called this phenomenon in ''any'' plant ''heliotropism'' (1832).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=nl&amp;id=9T76HvJfH4AC&amp;dq=heliotropism+growth++candolle+-wikipedia&amp;q=candolle#v=snippet&amp;q=candolle&amp;f=false | author=Hart, J.W.| title=Plant Tropisms: And other Growth Movements| page=36| publisher=Springer|year=1990 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed [[phototropism]] in 1892, because it is a response to light rather than to the sun, and because the phototropism of algae in lab studies at that time strongly depended on the brightness (positive phototropic for weak light, and negative phototropic for bright light, like sunlight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ige.tohoku.ac.jp/outou/outou-e/Phototropism-e.html |title=Phototropism and photomorphogenesis of Vaucheria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nevsljDiCYC&amp;pg=PA673 |author1=Donat-Peter Häder |author2=Michael Lebert | title=Photomovement| page=676| publisher=Elsevier|year=2001 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A botanist studying this subject in the lab, at the cellular and subcellular level, or using artificial light, is more likely to employ the more abstract word phototropism. The French scientist [[Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan]] was one of the first to study heliotropism when he experimented with the ''[[Mimosa pudica]]'' plant.
==Floral heliotropism==
Heliotropic flowers track the sun's motion across the sky from east to west. During the night, the flowers may assume a random orientation, while at dawn they turn again toward the east where the sun rises. The motion is performed by [[motor cell]]s in a flexible segment just below the flower, called a [[pulvinus]]. The motor cells are specialized in pumping [[potassium]] [[ion]]s into nearby tissues, changing their [[turgor pressure]]. The segment flexes because the motor cells at the shadow side elongate due to a ''turgor rise''. This is considered to be turgor-mediated heliotropism. For plant organs that lack pulvini, heliotropism can occur through irreversible cell expansion producing particular growth patterns. This form of heliotropism is considered to be growth-mediated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenbrink|first=Joshua P.|last2=Brown|first2=Evan A.|last3=Harmer|first3=Stacey L.|last4=Blackman|first4=Benjamin K.|date=July 2014|title=Turning heads: The biology of solar tracking in sunflower|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/J.PLANTSCI.2014.04.006|journal=Plant Science|volume=224|pages=20–26|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.04.006|issn=0168-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heliotropism is a response to light from the sun.

Several hypotheses have been proposed for the occurrence of heliotropism in flowers:
* The pollinator attraction hypothesis holds that the warmth associated with full [[insolation]] of the flower is a direct reward for [[pollinators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hocking B. |author2=Sharplin D. |title= Flower basking by arctic insects |journal=Nature |volume=206 |pages=206–215 |year=1965 |doi=10.1038/206215b0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v206/n4980/pdf/206215b0.pdf |issue=4980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The growth promotion hypothesis assumes that effective [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of solar energy and the consequent rise in temperature has a favourable effect on [[pollen germination]], growth of the [[pollen tube]] and [[Seed|seed production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kevan, P.G. |title= Sun-tracking solar furnaces in high arctic flowers: significance for pollination and [[insects]]. |journal=Science |volume=189 |issue=4204|pages=723–726 |year=1975 |doi=10.1126/science.189.4204.723}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The cooling hypothesis, appropriate to flowers in hot climates, assumes that the position of flowers is adjusted to avoid overheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lang A.R.G. |author2=Begg J.E. |title= Movements of Helianthus annuus leaves and heads |journal= J Appl Ecol |volume=16 |pages=299–305 |year=1979 |doi=10.2307/2402749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, flower heliotropism could increase reproductive success by increasing [[pollination]], [[fertilization]] success, and/or seed development,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Some solar tracking plants are not purely heliotropic: in those plants the change of orientation is an innate circadian motion triggered by light, which continues for one or more periods if the light cycle is interrupted.

[[Tropical]] [[convolvulaceous]] flowers show a preferred orientation, pointing in the general direction of the sun but not exactly tracking the sun. They demonstrated no [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] heliotropism but strong [[seasonal]] heliotropism. If solar tracking is exact, the sun’s rays would always enter the [[corolla tube]] and warm the [[gynoecium]], a process which could be dangerous in a [[tropical climate]]. However, by adopting a certain angle away from the solar angle, this is prevented. The trumpet shape of these flowers thus acts as a [[parasol]] shading the gynoecium at times of maximum [[solar radiation]], and not allowing the rays to impinge on the [[gynoecium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patiño, S. |author2=Jeffree, C. |author3=Grace, J. |title=The ecological role of orientation in tropical convolvulaceous flowers |journal=Oecologia |volume=130 |pages=373–379 |year=2002 |doi=10.1007/s00442-001-0824-1 |url=http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/plant/PDF/2002/Patino-2002-373.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of [[sunflower]], a common [[List of common misconceptions|misconception]] is that sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky. The uniform alignment of the flowers does result from heliotropism in an earlier development stage, the [[bud]] stage, before the appearance of flower heads.  The apical bud of the plant will track the sun during the day from east to west, and then will quickly move west to east overnight as a result of the plant's circadian clock.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenbrink|first=Joshua P.|last2=Brown|first2=Evan A.|last3=Harmer|first3=Stacey L.|last4=Blackman|first4=Benjamin K.|title=Turning heads: The biology of solar tracking in sunflower|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.04.006|journal=Plant Science|volume=224|pages=20–26|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buds are heliotropic until the end of the bud stage, and finally face east. Phototropic bending can be catalyzed in the hypocotyls of juvenile sunflower seedlings while heliotropic bending in the shoot apex does not start occurring until the later developmental stages of the plant, showing a difference between these two processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The flower of the sunflower preserves the final orientation of the bud, thus keeping the mature flower facing east.

==Leaf heliotropism==
Leaf heliotropism is the solar tracking behavior of plant leaves. Some plant species have leaves that orient themselves perpendicularly to the sun's rays in the morning (''[[diaheliotropism]]''), and others have those that orient themselves parallel to these rays at midday (''[[paraheliotropism]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nevsljDiCYC&amp;pg=PA676|title=Photomovement|first1=D.-P.|last1=Häder|first2=M.|last2=Lebert|date=19 June 2001|publisher=Elsevier|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Floral heliotropism is not necessarily exhibited by the same plants that exhibit leaf heliotropism.

[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - Siebold Collection - Herbarium book.jpg|thumb|Herbarium book with Japanese plants, Siebold collection Leiden, 1825]]
A '''herbarium''' (plural: '''herbaria''') is a collection of preserved [[plant]] specimens and associated data used for scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/herbarium/what-is-a-herbarium|title=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh - What is a herbarium|last=Edinburgh|first=Royal Botanic Garden|website=www.rbge.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

The specimens may be whole plants or plant parts; these will usually be in dried form mounted on a sheet of paper (called "''exsiccatae''") but, depending upon the material, may also be stored in boxes or kept in alcohol or other preservative.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-12.pdf|title=Preparing and Storing Herbarium Specimens|last=|first=|date=November 2009|website=Conserve O Gram|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specimens in a herbarium are often used as reference material in describing plant [[taxon|taxa]]; some specimens may be [[Type (botany)|types]].

The same term is often used in [[mycology]] to describe an equivalent collection of preserved [[fungi]], otherwise known as a '''fungarium'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fungarium|url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/collections/fungarium|website=www.kew.org|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''[[xylarium]]''' is a herbarium specialising in specimens of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wood collection (xylarium)|url=http://www.kew.org/kew-science/collections/economic-botany/explore-collection/wood-collection-xylarium|website=www.kew.org|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''hortorium''' (as in the [[Liberty Hyde Bailey|Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium]]) has occasionally been applied to a herbarium specialising in preserving material of [[horticulture|horticultural]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium|url=https://plantbio.cals.cornell.edu/hortorium|website=plantbio.cals.cornell.edu|publisher=Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The oldest traditions of making herbarium collection or ''Hortus sicci'' have been traced to Italy. Luca Ghini and his students created herbaria of which the oldest extant one is that of [[Gherardo Cibo]] from around 1532.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1931.tb00596.x|title=The Herbal of Leonhart Fuchs|journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Botany|volume=48|issue=325|pages=545|year=1931|last1=Sprague|first1=T. A.|last2=Nelmes|first2=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the early herbaria were prepared with sheets bound into books, [[Carl_Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]] came up with the idea of maintaining them on free sheets that allowed their easy re-ordering within cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller-Wille|first=Staffan|date=2006-06-01|title=Linnaeus' herbarium cabinet: a piece of furniture and its function|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160932706000330|journal=Endeavour|volume=30|issue=2|pages=60–64|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2006.03.001|pmid=16600379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specimen preservation ==
[[File:HerbPrepLG.jpg|thumb|right|Preparing a plant for mounting]]
Commensurate with the need of wildlife conservation, it is often desirable to include in a herbarium sheet as much of the plant as possible (e.g., flowers, stems, leaves, seed, and fruit), or at least representative parts of them in the case of large specimens.&lt;ref name=Chater/&gt; To preserve their form and colour, plants collected in the field are carefully arranged and spread flat between thin sheets, known as 'flimsies', (equivalent to sheets of newsprint) and dried, usually in a [[plant press]], between blotters or absorbent paper.&lt;ref name=Chater/&gt; During the drying process the specimens are retained within their flimsies at all times to minimise damage, and only the thicker, absorbent drying sheets are replaced. For some plants it may prove helpful to allow the fresh specimen to wilt slightly before being arranged for the press. An opportunity to check, rearrange and further lay out the specimen to best reveal the required features of the plant occurs when the damp absorbent sheets are changed during the drying/pressing process.  

The specimens, which are then mounted on sheets of stiff white paper, are labelled with all essential data, such as date and place found, description of the plant, altitude, and special habitat conditions. The sheet is then placed in a protective case. As a precaution against insect attack, the pressed plant is frozen or poisoned, and the case disinfected.

Certain groups of plants are soft, bulky, or otherwise not amenable to drying and mounting on sheets. For these plants, other methods of preparation and storage may be used. For example, [[conifer cone]]s and [[Arecaceae|palm]] fronds may be stored in labelled boxes. Representative flowers or fruits may be pickled in [[formaldehyde]] to preserve their three-dimensional structure.  Small specimens, such as [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s, are often air-dried and packaged in small paper envelopes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

No matter the method of preservation, detailed information on where and when the plant was collected, habitat, color (since it may fade over time), and the name of the collector is usually included.

The value of a herbarium is much enhanced by the possession of “types”, that is, the original specimens on which the study of a species was founded. Thus the herbarium at the [[British Museum]], which is especially rich in the earlier collections made in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, contains the types of many species founded by the earlier workers in [[botany]]. It is also rich in types of Australian plants from the collections of [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and Robert Brown, and contains in addition many valuable modern collections. &lt;ref&gt; "Herbarium", Parkstone Press International 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections management ==
[[Image:Field fg15.jpg|thumb|A large herbarium may have hundreds of cases filled with specimens.]]
Most herbaria utilize a standard system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases.  Specimen sheets are stacked in groups by the [[species]] to which they belong and placed into a large lightweight [[File folder|folder]] that is labelled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger, heavier folders by [[genus]]. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic [[family (biology)|family]] according to the standard system selected for use by the herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.kew.org/herbcat/gotoWhatIsHerbarium.do|title=HerbWeb - What is a Herbarium|website=apps.kew.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locating a specimen filed in the herbarium requires knowing the [[botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]] and [[scientific classification|classification]] used by the herbarium.  It also requires familiarity with possible name changes that have occurred since the specimen was collected, since the specimen may be filed under an older name.

Modern herbaria often maintain electronic databases of their collections. Many herbaria have initiatives to [[Digitizing|digitize]] specimens to produce a [[virtual herbarium]]. These records and images are made publicly accessible via the [[Internet]] when possible.

== Uses ==
Herbarium collections can have great significance and value to science, and have a large number of uses.&lt;ref name="Funk2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Funk|first1=Vicki|title=The Importance of Herbaria|journal=Plant Science Bulletin|date=January 2003|volume=49|issue=3|pages=94|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245183622|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Funk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Vicki|title=100 Uses for an Herbarium (Well at Least 72)|url=http://peabody.yale.edu/sites/default/files/documents/botany/100_uses.pdf|website=peabody.yale.edu|publisher=The Yale University Herbarium|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Herbaria are essential for the study of [[plant taxonomy]], the study of geographic distributions, and the stabilizing of nomenclature. 
[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]'s herbarium now belongs to the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] in England.

Specimens housed in herbaria may be used to catalogue or identify the [[flora]] of an area.  A large collection from a single area is used in writing a field guide or manual to aid in the identification of plants that grow there.  With more specimens available, the author of the guide will better understand the variability of form in the plants and the natural distribution over which the plants grow.

Herbaria also preserve a historical record of change in [[vegetation]] over time.  In some cases, plants become [[Extinction|extinct]] in one area or may become extinct altogether.  In such cases, specimens preserved in a herbarium can represent the only record of the plant's original distribution.  Environmental scientists make use of such data to track changes in [[climate]] and human impact.

Herbaria have also proven very useful as sources of plant [[DNA]] for use in taxonomy and [[molecular systematics]]

Many kinds of scientists and naturalists use herbaria to preserve voucher specimens; representative samples of plants used in a particular study to demonstrate precisely the source of their data, or to enable confirmation of identification at a future date.&lt;ref name="Chater"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chater|first1=Arthur O.|title=Collecting and Pressing Specimens|url=http://bsbi.org.uk/Collecting.pdf|website=www.bsbi.org.uk|publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They may also be a repository of viable seeds for rare species.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119311319/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Wiley online library]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iCivics, inc.''' (formerly Our Courts) is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] in the United States that provides [[Educational game|educational online games]] and lesson plans to promote [[civics]] education and encourage students to become active citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; iCivics was founded in 2008 by retired [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. iCivics’s stated mission is to “ensure every student receives a high-quality civic education, and becomes engaged in – and beyond – the classroom.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

iCivics, inc. is supported by private donations and grants and had annual expenses of $2.2 million in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Among the top contributors were the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] and the [[John D. and Catherine T.

==Mission==
Justice O’Connor initially envisioned Our Courts as a response to a perceived misunderstanding of the justice system in America.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As keynote speaker at the [[National Council for the Social Studies|NCSS]] annual conference in 2007, she noted “that while two-thirds of Americans know at least two judges on FOX Television’s ‘American Idol’ reality program, less than one in 10 can name the Chief Justice of the United States.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/law_matters_home/oconnor.html|title=Law Matters Winter 2008 {{!}} Justice O'Connor Addresses NCSS Conference|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, ourcourts.org maintains this mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ourcourts.org/our-approach/|title=Our Approach - Our Courts America|website=ourcourts.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but iCivics has a broader mission incorporating education on the legislative and executive branches of government as well as civics at a local level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/profile/38-3796793|title=iCivics - GuideStar Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=www.guidestar.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25|quote=Self-reported}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization focuses on broadly improving civics education but also on closing the civics [[Achievement gap in the United States|education gap]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; O'Connor saw the state of civics education as a result of the failure of traditional education methods, as well as funding cuts and lower graduation requirements imposed by the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/38146.htm|title=Courting Kids|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Courts collaborator [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]], a professor of literacy at Arizona State University, convinced her that educational games were the key to civics education, due to their capacity to teach problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/technology/sandra-day-oconnor-supreme-court-video-games.html|title=A Supreme Court Pioneer, Now Making Her Mark on Video Games|last=Singer|first=Natasha|date=2016-03-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iCivics games have been evaluated for their educational effectiveness in a handful of research studies. ''Branches of Power'' was shown to be both engaging and educational for a majority of students in a test group.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Carrie, Jason Lancaster, Wilhelmina Savenye, and Nancy Haas. "A Formative Evaluation of the Balance of Power Game and Curriculum." ''The Journal of Applied Instructional Design'' 3, no. 3 (December 2013): 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of students also play the games again at home, greatly increasing absorption of concepts and improving test scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trevorowens.org/portfolio/owens_Effects%20of%20learning%20from%20a%20civics%20video%20game.doc|title=Effects of learning from a civics video game|last=Owens|first=Trevor|date=December 2010|website=Trevor Owens|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general iCivics curriculum has been shown to be an effective mechanism for education on civics topics as measured by scores on the US citizenship test. It was particularly effective among younger students in grades 4-6 and less effective among high school seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeCompte|first=Karen|last2=Moore|first2=Brandon|last3=Blevins|first3=Brooke|date=Fall 2011|title=The Impact of iCivics on Students’ Core Civic Knowledge|url=|journal=Research in the Schools|volume=18|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive writing exercise Drafting Board also improved [[persuasive writing]] skills among 8th graders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://civicyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/WP_76_KawashimaGinsberg.pdf|title=Summary of Findings from the Evaluation of iCivics’ Drafting Board Intervention|last=Kawashima-Ginsberg|first=Kei|date=December 2012|website=CIRCLE|publisher=THE CENTER FOR INFORMATION &amp; RESEARCH ON CIVIC LEARNING &amp; ENGAGEMENT|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is currently working on extending its curriculum to high school and reaching more high school educators. It currently serves one in four high school government and history teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/profile/38-3796793|title=iCivics - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Information School''' (sometimes abbreviated '''I-school''' or '''iSchool''') is a [[university]]-level institution committed to understanding the role of [[information]] in nature and human endeavors. Synonyms include "School of Information", "Department of Information Studies", or "Information Department". Information Schools [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] conduct research into the fundamental aspects of information and [[Information technology|related technologies]].  In addition to granting [[academic degree]]s, information schools educate information professionals, researchers, and scholars for an [[Information revolution|increasingly information-driven world]]. 

Information school can also refer, in a more restricted sense, to the [[List of Information Schools|members of the iSchools organization]] (formerly the "iSchools Project"), as governed by the iCaucus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischools.org/site/about_icaucus/ About the iCaucus, governing body of the iSchools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928172227/http://www.ischools.org/site/about_icaucus/ |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischools.org/site/ischoolsnews_article/the_ischools_welcome_nanjing_and_tampere_as_new_additions_now_boast_33_memb/ The iSchools Welcome Nanjing and Tampere as New Additions; Now Boast 33 Members Worldwide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204074445/http://www.ischools.org/site/ischoolsnews_article/the_ischools_welcome_nanjing_and_tampere_as_new_additions_now_boast_33_memb/ |date=2011-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this group share a fundamental interest in the relationships between people, information, technology, and science.  These schools, colleges, and departments have been either newly established or have evolved from programs focused on [[information systems]], [[library science]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[computer science]], [[library and information science]] and [[information science]].
 
Information schools promote an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the opportunities and challenges of [[information management]], with a core commitment to concepts like [[Universal design|universal access]] and [[User-centered design|user-centered]] organization of information. The field is concerned broadly with questions of design and preservation across information spaces, from digital and virtual spaces like online communities, the World Wide Web, and databases to physical spaces such as libraries, museums, archives, and other repositories. Information school degree programs include course offerings in areas such as  [[information architecture]], [[Information design|design]],  [[Information economics|economics]], [[Information policy|policy]], [[Information retrieval|retrieval]], [[Information security|security]], and [[telecommunication]]s; [[knowledge management]], [[user experience design]], and [[usability]]; [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] and [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]], including [[digital preservation]]; librarianship and [[Library management|library administration]]; the [[Information society|sociology of information]]; and [[human–computer interaction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">Across the many fields concerned with '''interactivity''', including [[information science]], [[computer science]], [[human-computer interaction]], [[communication]], and [[industrial design]], there is little agreement over the meaning of the term "interactivity", although all are related to [[interaction]] with computers and other machines with a [[user interface]].

Multiple views on interactivity exist. In the "contingency view" of interactivity, there are three levels: 
#Not interactive, when a message is not related to previous messages; 
#Reactive, when a message is related only to one immediately previous message; and
#Interactive, when a message is related to a number of previous messages and to the relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheizaf Rafaeli]] defined Interactivity as "an expression of the extent that in a given series of communication exchanges, any third (or later) transmission (or message) is related to the degree to which previous exchanges referred to even earlier transmissions. Rafaeli, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

One body of research has made a strong distinction between interaction and interactivity. As the suffix 'ity' is used to form nouns that denote a quality or condition, this body of research has defined interactivity as the 'quality or condition of interaction'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sedig | first=K. | last2=Parsons | first2=P. | last3=Babanski | first3=A. | year=2012 | title=Towards a characterization of interactivity in visual analytics | journal= Journal of Multimedia Processing and Technologies, Special Issue on Theory and Application of Visual Analytics | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=12–28 | url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pparsons/papers/JMPT2012.pdf | accessdate=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Parsons | first=P. | last2=Sedig | first2=K. | year=2014 | title=Adjustable properties of visual representations: Improving the quality of human-information interaction | journal= Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume=65 | issue=3 | pages=455–482 | doi=10.1002/asi.23002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Liang | first=H.-N. | last2=Parsons | first2=P. | last3=Wu | first3=H.-C. | last4=Sedig | first4=K. | year=2010 | title=An exploratory study of interactivity in visualization tools: 'Flow' of interaction | journal= Journal of Interactive Learning Research | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=5–45 | url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pparsons/papers/JILR2010.pdf | accessdate=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers suggest that the distinction between interaction and interactivity is important since interaction may be present in any given setting, but the quality of the interaction varies from low and high.

==Human to human communication==
Human communication is the basic example of [[interactive communication]] which involves two different processes; human to human interactivity and human to computer interactivity. Human-Human interactivity is the communication between people.

On the other hand, human to computer communication is the way that people communicate with [[new media]]. According to Rada Roy, the "[[Human Computer interaction]] model might consists of 4 main components which consist of HUMAN, COMPUTER, TASK ENVIRONMENT and MACHINE ENVIRONMENT. The two basic flows of information and control are assumed. The communication between people and computers; one must understand something about both and about the tasks which people perform with computers. A general model of human - computer interface emphasizes the flow of information and control at the human computer interface."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Rada | first1 = R. | last2 = Michailidis | first2 = Antonios | title = Interactive media | year = 1995 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | isbn = 0-387-94485-0 | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human to Human interactivity consists of many conceptualizations which are based on anthropomorphic definitions. For example, complex systems that detect and react to human behavior are sometimes called interactive. Under this perspective, interaction includes responses to human physical manipulation like movement, body language, and/or changes in [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]]s.

Media theorist Fernando Arturo Torres defined interactivity as, "a particular medium's ability to facilitate the properties necessary in an ideal conversation" ("Towards A Universal Theory Of Media Interactivity:  Developing A Proper Context," 1995, "Definition of Interactivity," para. 1).  His research determined that interactivity should be defined by "how well a medium facilitates two-way communication rather than by the technology of the medium."

==Human to artifact communication==
In the context of communication between a human and an [[Cultural artifact|artifact]], interactivity refers to the artifact’s interactive behaviour as experienced by the human user. This is different from other aspects of the artifact such as its visual appearance, its internal working, and the meaning of the signs it might mediate. For example, the interactivity of an [[iPod]] is not its physical shape and colour (its so-called "[[design]]"), its ability to play music, or its storage capacity—it is the behaviour of its [[user interface]] as experienced by its user. This includes the way the user moves their finger on its input wheel, the way this allows the selection of a tune in the playlist, and the way the user controls the volume.

An artifact’s interactivity is best perceived through use. A bystander can imagine how it would be like to use an artifact by watching others use it, but it is only through actual use that its interactivity is fully experienced and "felt". This is due to the [[kinesthetic]] nature of the interactive experience. It is similar to the difference between watching someone drive a car and actually driving it. It is only through the driving that one can experience and "feel" how this car differs from others.

New Media academic Vincent Maher defines interactivity as "the relation constituted by a symbolic interface between its referential, objective functionality and the subject."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nml.ru.ac.za/maher/?p=7 Vincent Maher - Media in Transition » Towards a definition of interactivity suitable for Critical Theory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computing science ==
The term "[[look and feel]]" is often used to refer to the specifics of a computer system's [[user interface]]. Using this [[metaphor]], the "look" refers to its visual design, while the "feel" refers to its interactivity. Indirectly this can be regarded as an informal definition of interactivity.

For a more detailed discussion of how interactivity has been conceptualized in the human-computer interaction literature, and how the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the French philosopher [[Merleau-Ponty]] can shed light on the user experience, see (Svanaes 2000).

In [[computer science]], interactive refers to software which accepts and responds to input from people—for example, data or commands. Interactive software includes most popular programs, such as [[word processor]]s or [[spreadsheet]] [[application software|applications]]. By comparison, '''noninteractive''' programs operate without human contact; examples of these include [[compiler]]s and [[batch processing]] applications. If the response is complex enough it is said that the system is conducting social interaction and some systems try to achieve this through the implementation of [[social interface]]s.

Also, there is the notion of kinds of user interaction, like the [[Rich UI]].

==Creating interactivity==
Web page authors can integrate [[JavaScript]] coding to create interactive web pages. Sliders, date pickers, drag and dropping are just some of the many enhancements that can be provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://friendlybit.com/js/improving-interactivity-with-javascript/ |title=Improving interactivity with Javascript |publisher=Friendly Bit |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various authoring tools are available for creating various kinds of interactivities. Some common platforms for creating interactivities include [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Microsoft Silverlight]]. Notable authoring tools for creating interactivities include Harbinger's [[Elicitus]].

eLearning makes use of a concept called an [[interaction model]]. Using an interaction model, any person can create interactivities in a very short period of time. Some of the interaction models presented with authoring tools fall under various categories like games, puzzles, simulation tools, presentation tools, etc., which can be completely customized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10622">'''Irrealism''' is a term that has been used by various writers in the fields of philosophy, literature, and art to denote specific modes of unreality and/or the problems in concretely defining reality.  While in philosophy the term specifically refers to a position put forward by the American philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]], in literature and art it refers to a variety of writers and movements.  If the term has nonetheless retained a certain consistency in its use across these fields and would-be movements, it perhaps reflects the word’s position in general English usage: though the standard dictionary definition of ''irreal'' gives it the same meaning as ''unreal'', ''irreal'' is very rarely used in comparison with ''unreal''.  Thus, it has generally been used to describe something which, while unreal, is so in a very specific or unusual fashion, usually one emphasizing not just the "not real," but some form of estrangement from our generally accepted sense of reality.

==Irrealism in Literature==

In literature, the term irrealism was first used extensively in the United States in the 1970s to describe the post-realist "new fiction" of writers such as [[Donald Barthelme]] or [[John Barth]].  More generally, it described the notion that all forms of writing could only "offer particular versions of reality rather than actual descriptions of it," and that a story need not offer a clear resolution at its end.  [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]], in ''The Art of Fiction'', cites in this context the work of Barthelme and its "seemingly limitless ability to manipulate [literary] techniques as modes of apprehension [which] apprehend nothing."&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;   Though Barth, in a 1974 interview, stated, "irrealism—not antirealism or unrealism, but irrealism—is all that I would confidently predict is likely to characterize the prose fiction of the 1970s," &lt;ref&gt;(Bellamy 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; this did not prove to be the case.  Instead writing in the United States quickly returned to its realist orthodoxy and the term irrealism fell into disuse.

In recent years, however, the term has been revived in an attempt to describe and categorize, in literary and philosophical terms, how it is that the work of an irrealist writer differs from the work of writers in other, non-realistic genres (e.g., the fantasy of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], the magical realism of [[Gabriel García Márquez]]) and what the significance of this difference is.  This can be seen in Dean Swinford's essay ''Defining irrealism: scientific development and allegorical possibility''.[http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review1a.htm]  Approaching the issue from a structuralist and narratological point of view, he has defined irrealism as a "peculiar mode of postmodern allegory" that has resulted from modernity’s fragmentation and dismantling of the well-ordered and coherent medieval system of symbol and allegory.  Thus a lion, when presented in a given context in medieval literature, could only be interpreted in a single, approved way.  Contemporary literary theory, however, denies the attribution of such fixed meanings.  According to Swinford, this change can be attributed in part to the fact that "science and technical culture have changed perceptions of the natural world, have significantly changed the natural world itself, thereby altering the vocabulary of symbols applicable to [[epistemological]] and allegorical attempts to understand it."  Thus irreal works such as [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''Cosmicomics'' and [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''Ficciones'' can be seen as an attempt to find a new allegorical language to explain our changed perceptions of the world that have been brought about by our scientific and technical culture, especially concepts such as quantum physics or the theory of relativity.  "The Irrealist work, then, operates within a given system," writes Swinford, "and attests to its plausibility, despite the fact that this system, and the world it represents, is often a mutation, an aberration."

The online journal ''[[The Cafe Irreal]]'' [http://www.cafeirreal.com/], on the other hand, has defined irrealism as being a type of existentialist literature in which the means are continually and absurdly rebelling against the ends that we have determined for them.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, G.S. and Alice Whittenburg, "After Kafka: Kafka Criticism and Scholarship as a Resource in an Attempt to Promulgate a New Literary Genre," ''Journal of the Kafka Society of America'', 31/32(1+2):18-26.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this would be [[Franz Kafka]]'s story ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', in which the salesman [[Gregor Samsa]]'s plans for supporting his family and rising up in rank by hard work and determination are suddenly thrown topsy-turvy by his sudden and inexplicable transformation into a man-sized insect.  Such fiction is said to emphasize the fact that human consciousness, being finite in nature, can never make complete sense of, or successfully order, a universe that is infinite in its aspects and possibilities.  Which is to say: as much as we might try to order our world with a certain set of norms and goals (which we consider our real world), the paradox of a finite consciousness in an infinite universe creates a zone of irreality ("that which is beyond the real") that offsets, opposes, or threatens the real world of the human subject.  Irrealist writing often highlights this irreality, and our strange fascination with it, by combining the unease we feel because the real world doesn't conform to our desires with the narrative quality of the dream state (where reality is constantly and inexplicably being undermined); it is thus said to communicate directly, "by feeling rather than articulation, the uncertainties inherent in human existence or, to put it another way... the irreconcilability between human aspiration and human reality." [http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/what_is_irr.htm]  If the irreal story can be considered an allegory, then, it would be an allegory that is "so many pointers to an unknown meaning," in which the meaning is felt more than it is articulated or systematically analyzed.

==Irrealism in Art==

Various writers have addressed the question of Irrealism in Art.  Many salient observations on Irrealism in Art are found in Nelson Goodman's ''Languages of Art''.  Goodman himself produced some multimedia shows, one of which inspired by hockey and is entitled ''Hockey Seen: A Nightmare in Three Periods and Sudden Death''.

Garret [[Rowlan]], writing in ''[[The Cafe Irreal]]'', writes that the malaise present in the work of the Italian artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]], "which recalls Kafka, has to do with the sense of another world lurking, hovering like the long shadows that dominate de Chirico's paintings, which frequently depict a landscape at twilight's uncertain hour. Malaise and mystery are all by-products of the interaction of the real and the unreal, the rub and contact of two worlds caught on irrealism's shimmering surface." [http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review4a.htm]

The writer Dean Swinford, whose concept of irrealism was described at length in the section "Irrealism in Literature", wrote that the artist Remedios Varos, in her painting ''The Juggler'', "creates a personal allegorical system which relies on the predetermined symbols of Christian and classical iconography. But these are quickly refigured into a personal system informed by the scientific and organized like a machine...in the Irreal work, allegory operates according to an altered, but constant and orderly iconographic system."

Artist Tristan Tondino has made a number of claims about Irrealism.  Most of his claims are found in his paintings, many of which are [[Lettrist]] Abstractions. "There is no specific style to Irrealist Art.  It is the result of awareness that every human act is the result of the limitations of the world of the actor." &lt;ref&gt;Tondino 2003, ''Zot - Giving a Painter Crap...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the art journal ''the art life'' has recently detected the presence of a "New Irrealism" among the painters of that country, which is described as being an "approach to painting that is decidedly low key, deploying its effects without histrionic showmanship, while creating an eerie other world of ghostly images and abstract washes." What exactly constituted the "old" irrealism, they do not say.

== Irrealist Art, Film and Music Edition ==

Irrealist Art Edition is a publishing company created in the 90s by contemporary plastic artist [[Frédéric Iriarte]]. Together with the Estonian poet, writer and art critic [[Ilmar Laaban]], they developed their concept of Irrealism through several essays, exhibitions, projects, manifest and a book, "Irréalisation".

The '''John C. Stennis Space Center''' ('''SSC''') is a [[NASA]] rocket testing facility. It is located in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] ([[United States]]), on the banks of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi–Louisiana)|Pearl River]] at the [[Mississippi]]–[[Louisiana]] border. {{as of|2012}}, it is NASA's largest [[rocket engine test facility]]. There are over 30 local, state, national, international, private, and public companies and agencies using SSC for their rocket testing facilities.

== History ==
The initial requirements for NASA's proposed rocket testing facility required the site to be located between the rockets' manufacturing facility at [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] in eastern [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and the launch facility at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida.  Also, the site required barge access as the rocket motors to be tested for Apollo were too large for overland transport. Additionally, the Apollo motors were too loud to be tested at [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]'s existing test stands near [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. A more isolated site was needed.

After an exhaustive site selection process that included reviews of other coastal locations including [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in Florida plus islands in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, NASA announced formation of the Mississippi Test Facility (now known as Stennis Space Center) on Oct. 25, 1961, for testing engines for the Apollo Program. A high-terrace area bordering the East Pearl River in Hancock County, Miss., was selected for its location. NASA entrusted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with the difficult task to procure each land parcel either by directly purchasing the land or through acquisition of a perpetual easement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/centers/stennis/pdf/697602main_October_12_Lagniappe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The selected area was thinly populated and met all other requirements; however before construction began, five small communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth ([[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]]), and a combined population of 700 families had to be completely relocated off the facility. The effort acquired more than 3,200 parcels of privately owned land – 786 residences, 16 churches, 19 stores, three schools and a wide assortment of commercial buildings, including nightclubs and community centers.  Remnants of the communities, including city streets and a one-room school house, still exist within the facility.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The  {{convert|13500|acre|km2|0}} site was selected on October 25, 1961 on the '''Mississippi Test Facility''' or Pearl River Site.  On December 18, 1961 NASA officially designated the facility as NASA '''Mississippi Test Operations'''.  The test area (officially known as the Fee Area) is surrounded by a 125,000 acre (506&amp;nbsp;km²) acoustical [[buffer zone]]. The facility's large concrete and metal rocket propulsion test stands were originally used to test-fire the first and second stages of the [[Saturn V]] rockets. The facility was renamed again to '''Mississippi Test Facility''' on July 1, 1965, became a part of the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]

Starting in 1971, all [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s were flight-certified at Stennis.  On June 14, 1974 the site was renamed '''National Space Technology Laboratories''', a name that continued until May 20, 1988 when it was renamed for Mississippi senator and space program supporter [[John C. Stennis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=May 1961 speech leads to Stennis facility|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/stennis/pdf/546006main_May_11_Lagniappe.pdf|newspaper=Lagniappe|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of the Apollo and Shuttle programs, use of the base decreased, with economic impact to the surrounding communities. Over the years other government organizations and commercial entities have moved to and left from the facility, in the balance providing a major economic benefit to the communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The Rocket Propulsion Test Complex is a rocket testing complex which was built in 1965 as a component of the John C. Stennis Space Center. The Rocket Propulsion Test Complex played an important role in the development of the [[Saturn V]] rocket. The A-1, A-2 and B-1/B-2 test stands were declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Rocket Propulsion Test Complex / A-1/A-2 B-1/B-2 Test Stands|url={{NHLS url|id=85002805}} |format=pdf|date=May 15, 1984 |author=Harry A.

=== A-1/A-2 Test stand ===

 [[File:Aerial View SSC A-1, A-2 and B test stands 2004.jpg|thumb|left|A-1 test stand(foreground), A-2 (mid-ground)  and B1/B2 (background)]]
The smaller two of the original three test stands at Stennis Space Center, the A-1 and A-2 stands were built to test and flight-certify the second stage of the [[Saturn V]], the [[S-II]] (pronounced "ess two"), the launch vehicle for the [[Apollo program]]. The two stands are similar steel and concrete structures are roughly {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, and capable of withstanding thrust loads of more than 1 million pounds and temperature of up to {{convert|6,000|F|C|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Each test stand can provide liquid [[Hydrogen]] (LH2) and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) in addition to support fluids, gaseous [[helium]] (GHe), gaseous [[hydrogen]] (GH2) and gaseous [[nitrogen]] (GN2) as [[purge]] or [[pressurizing]] gasses.

Construction began in 1963 and was finished in 1966. The A Test Complex also includes a Test Control Center, observation bunkers, and various technical and support systems.

==== 1960s ====

On 23 April 1966 workmen at the A-2 test stand  successfully captive-fired for 15 seconds the S-II-T, Structural and Dynamic Test Vehicle for the Saturn V second stage, in an all-systems test. This was the first test of a flight-weight S-II stage. The stage, largest and most powerful liquid oxygen-liquid hydrogen stage known, developed one million pounds of thrust from its five [[Rocketdyne J-2]] engines. This test also marked the first operational use of the A-2 stand.&lt;ref name=ESDTest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Press Release No. 66-83, Apr. 21, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

The first full-duration firing of the S-II flight stage occurred 20 May 1966 when S-II-T test-fired on the A-2 test stand for 354.5 seconds. LOX cutoff sensors initiated cutoff automatically. The firing passed all major test objectives with the exception of the propellant utilization system. This was the fourth static firing of the S-II-T. The stage developed one million pounds of thrust from its five hydrogen-oxygen-powered J-2 engines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V QPR, Apr. 1-June 30, 1966, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== S-II-T rupture ====

A static test version of the Saturn V second stage S-II-T ruptured during pressure tests at SSC on 28 May 1966, and five North American Aviation technicians monitoring the test received minor injuries. The accident occurred when the hydrogen fuel tank failed under pressure. S-II-T, which had five hydrogen-oxygen J-2 engines capable of generating one million pounds of thrust, had been tested May 25 in ground firing but stopped firing after 195 seconds when a hydrogen link leak caused automatic cutoff. At time of the explosion, technicians were trying to determine cause for the hydrogen leak. No hydrogen was in the tank when the explosion occurred. Under the direction of MSFC, a Board of Inquiry headed by Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director of Kennedy Space Center, convened on the night of May 28. Immediate investigation revealed that the second shift crew, not knowing that the liquid hydrogen pressure sensors and switches had been disconnected, had attempted to pressurize the tank. Believing that a liquid hydrogen vent valve was leaking, the technicians closed the facility by blocking valves. This had caused the vehicle tank to become over-pressurized and burst. On 30 May 1966 the board released its findings after two days of inquiry. The fuel tank of the S-II stage had been pressurized beyond design limits. There was a need for tighter controls over MTF test procedure. Following the destruction of S-II-T, NASA extended the S-II battleship program until July 1967&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt;

S-II-1, the first flight S-II stage scheduled for static firing at MTF, left Seal Beach on July 31, 1966.

The first flight model (S-II-1) of the Saturn V vehicle's second stage arrived August 13, 1966 at MTF completing its 4,000-mile voyage from Seal Beach. Workmen immediately moved the stage into the S-II stage service and checkout building for inspection and preparation for static firing.

At MTF on December 1, 1966 North American Aviation conducted a successful 384-second captive firing of five J-2 engines, the first flight hydrogen-fueled engines, developing a total one million pounds of thrust. During the test, number 2 and 4 engine SLAM arms did not drop, resulting in the successful gimballing of engines 1 and 3 only. The test included the recording of about 800 measurements of the stage's performance, including propellant tank temperatures, engine temperatures, propellant flow rates, and vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Press Release No. 66-228, Nov. 30, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 1966, MSFC technicians at the MTF test stand conducted a static firing of the first flight version of the Saturn V second stage, S-II-1. This second test firing, like an earlier firing, lasted more than six minutes.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC, MAF Hist. Report, Jan. 1-Dec. 31, 1966, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1967 ====

On January 11, 1967 initial post-static checkout of the S-II-1 stage ended at MTF.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V Semiannual Prog. Report, Jan. 1-June 30, 1967, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

on January 27, 1967 the S-II-2 stage left Seal Beach, California, to pass through the Panama Canal and on to MTF. After its journey lasting 16 days, the S-II would arrive at MTF for two static tests.

The S-II-2 stage arrived on dock at MTF on February 11, 1967. The S-II-2 stage, part of the second Saturn V vehicle (AS-502) scheduled for launch from KSC late in 1967, was scheduled for testing at MTF late in March 1967.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1967"&gt;MTF, Historical Report, Jan. 1-Dec. 31, 1967, (draft)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Saturn V Weekly Report, No. 8," Feb. 21, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 1967 the first full-duration test of a cluster of uprated J-2 engines, S-II battleship test No. 041, lasted 360 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V Semiannual Prog. Report, Jan. 1-June 30, 1967, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 1967 workmen at MTF completed construction of the S-II A-1 test stand, and the Corps of Engineers accepted beneficial occupancy with exceptions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1967"/&gt;

On March 17, 1967 technicians fired the S-II battleship stage for a mainstage duration of 29 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[Test Lab., Monthly Progress Report, Mar. 1967, p. 19.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, failure of a prevalve to close caused program officials at MTF to scrub the first attempt to static fire the S-II-2 stage.&lt;ref&gt;[ "Saturn IB Weekly Notes 13-67," April 3, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

Battleship testing of the S-II battleship test stage equipped with five uprated J-2 engines ended in late March 1967 with a full-duration test of approximately 360 seconds mainstage operation.&lt;ref&gt;[NAA S&amp;ID, S-II Quarterly Progress Report, April–June 1967, p. II-6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Summary ====

These two test stands tested and flight-certified S-II stages and J-2 engines until the end of the Apollo program in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=ESDTest&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sscfreedom.ssc.nasa.gov/esd/ESDTestFacilitiesA1.asp | title = A-1 Test Stand | publisher = NASA | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090320094910/http://sscfreedom.ssc.nasa.gov/esd/ESDTestFacilitiesA1.asp | archivedate = 2009-03-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1970s ====

It was announced in 1971 that the center would be performing tests on the engines for the new [[Space Shuttle]] program (called the [[SSME]]). The A-1 and A-2 test stands, originally designed to accommodate the much larger S-II engines, were modified to accept the smaller SSME, and testing officially began on May 19, 1975 when the first such engine was tested on the A-1 stand. The center continued to test engines for the duration of the shuttle program, on the A-1 and A-2 stands with the final scheduled test occurred on July 29, 2009 on the A-2 stand.

==== 2010s ====

As the shuttle program is phased out, the A-1 and A-2 test stands are seeing new use testing the next generation of rocket engines, including the [[J-2X]] engine designed to power the SLS upper stage, with the first such test occurring on December 18, 2007.

Stennis is continuing to test Aerojet Rocketdyne AJ26 rocket engines for Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles, Va., which has partnered with NASA to provide commercial cargo flights to the International Space Station. Orbital's maiden flight to the space station launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia Sept. 18. Orbital's Antares rocket was powered by a pair of AJ26 engines.&lt;ref name=13-311/&gt;

=== B-1/B-2 Test stand ===
The B-1/B-2 test stand is a dual-position, vertical, static-firing stand supporting a maximum dynamic load of  11M lbf. It was originally built in the 1960s to simultaneously test the five [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] engines of a complete Saturn-V S1-C first stage from 1967 to 1970. During the shuttle era it was modified to test the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] (SSME). Stennis now leases the B-1 test position to [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne]] for testing of [[RS-68]] engines for the [[Delta IV]] launch vehicle. NASA is preparing the B-2 test position to test the core stage of NASA's [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) in late 2016 and early 2017. The SLS core stage, with four [[RS-25D]] rocket engines, will be installed on the stand for propellant fill and drain testing and two hot-fire tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/multimedia/gallery/b2stand_3.html | title=B1/B2 Test Stand | publisher=NASA | date=29 April 2013 | accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1966 MSFC shipped its S-IC all-system test booster, S-IC-T, to SSC for use in checkout of a static test stand and for use in static firings. Workmen loaded the huge booster aboard the barge Poseidon for the 1,000-mile river journey. Six days later the S-IC-T reached SSC. All future firings would be accomplished at the B-2 stand at MTF.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V Semiannual Prog. Report, July 1-Dec. 31, 1966, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

An all-systems test version of Apollo/Saturn V first stage, S-IC-T, went into the B-2 test stand at the Mississippi Test Facility on December 17, 1966. Stage electrical and mechanical hook-up to the test stand began immediately. Static firing would occur in early 1967 to demonstrate the facility checkout system.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Press Release No. 66-294, Dec. 13, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1967 ====

On 13 February 1967 Corps of Engineers personnel completed construction of the S-IC B-2 test stand at MTF.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1967"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memo, Sneed to NASA Headquarters, "Saturn V Weekly Report, No. 8," Feb. 21, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an extensive systems, subsystems, and total integrated systems checkout of the B-2 test stand at MTF on March 3, 1967, workmen successfully fired the S-IC battleship/all-systems stage (S-IC-T) for 15 seconds. This S-IC-T test, the first MTF S-IC firing, proved the total compatibility of stage, mechanical support equipment, and S-IC test facilities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1967"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V Semiannual Prog. Report, Jan. 1-June 30, 1967, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second S-IC-T firing lasted for 60 seconds on March 17, 1967. This firing validated the flame-bucket-water-flow pattern of the B-2 test stand and ended the facilities checkout test series at MTF.&lt;ref&gt;[MTF, Historical Report, Jan. 1-Dec. 31, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V Semiannual Prog. Report, Jan. 1-June 30, 1967, p. 19.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing personnel removed the S-IC-T from test stand B-2 at MTF on March 24, 1967, following post-static checkout, test stand refurbishment, and facilities modification.&lt;ref&gt;[NAA S&amp;ID, S-II Quarterly Progress Report, Jan.-Mar. 1967, p. II-16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A-3 Test stand ===
NASA has begun construction of the new A-3 test stand at SSC.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title = NASA's Stennis Space Center Marks New Chapter in Space Exploration | url = http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/aug/HQ_07180_Stennis_groundbreaking.html | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A-3 stand was to be used for testing [[J-2X]] engines under vacuum conditions simulating high altitude operation. A-3 will also be operable as a sea-level test facility.&lt;ref name="stennis-assess"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the Constellation Program was cancelled in 2010, the stand is expected to be unused after its completion. The A-3 stand may however, be able to be refurnished to test a new mission when needed. In 2014, journalists writing for [[Bloomberg News]] and the [[Washington Times]] criticized the continued construction work on the $350 million A-3 Test stand, and characterized it as a wasteful [[earmark (politics)|earmark]] by Mississippi U.S. Senator [[Roger F. Wicker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-08/congress-makes-nasa-finish-useless-350-million-structure.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Jonathan D | last=Salant | title=Congress Makes NASA Finish Useless $350 Million Structure | date=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/30/golden-hammer-350-million-nasa-project-to-be-compl/|title=Golden Hammer: $350 million NASA project to be completed, then mothballed because of lack of need|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E Test stand complex ===
[[File:E Test Stand at SSC.jpg|thumb|left|E test stand complex in 2005]]
In the 1990s, a new test complex named "E" was constructed to test a variety of new small engine and single/multiple components and concepts. The E test stand complex consists of four distinct test stands

==== E1 Test stand ====

As of early June 2014, the E-1 test stand is non-operational pending the completion of an investigation into a rocket engine failure on the test stand on 22 May 2014.&lt;ref name=nsf20140610/&gt;

===== History =====

In 2012, [[Blue Origin]] tested the thrust chamber assembly at the E-1 test cell for its new {{convert|100000|lbf|kN}} thrust [[BE-3]] liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engine. As part of Blue's Reusable Booster System (RBS), the engines are designed eventually to launch the biconic-shaped Space Vehicle{{clarify|date=October 2013}}&lt;!-- is this a proper noun? yes --&gt; the company is developing.&lt;ref name=13-311 &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2013/october/nasa-administrator-visits-stennis-to-commend-employee-efforts/#.Um4CSRAt2M0 |title=NASA Administrator Visits Stennis to Commend Employee Efforts &amp;#124; NASA |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sn20131025/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/blue-origin-be3.html |title=NASA - Blue Origin Tests Rocket Engine Thrust Chamber |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2014, an [[NK-33#Aerojet AJ26|AJ26]] rocket engine under test on the Stennis E-1 test stand, for a future [[Orbital Sciences]] [[Antares (rocket)|Antares]] launch, failed and caused major damage to the E-1 test stand.  As of 10 June, neither NASA, Orbital, nor [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] have released any additional information on the extent of the damage, nor time frame when the three test cells in the E-1 test stand will return to operational status.&lt;ref name=nsf20140610&gt;

In June 2015, [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] signed a contract with NASA to upgrade the E-1 test stand so that the "multi-element pre-burner and main injector" of the [[AR-1 (rocket engine)|AR-1]] rocket engine could be tested there, with a goal of first flight of the new AR-1 engine after 2019.&lt;ref name=si20150619&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA signs SAA with Aerojet Rocketdyne to use Stennis test stand for AR1 engine|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-centers/stennis-space-center/nasa-signs-saa-with-aerojet-rocketdyne-to-use-stennis-test-stand-for-ar1-engine/|accessdate=23 June 2015|work=Spaceflight Insider|date=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Description =====
The stand is composed of three individual test "cells":{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
:*E1 Cell 1 can handle liquid-propellant and hybrid based test articles up to {{convert|750000|lbf|kN}} of thrust in a horizontal position.
:*E1 Cells 2 and 3 are designed to support LOX and LH2 turbopump assemblies for testing with high-pressure propellant feeds.

==== E2 Test stand ====
The E2 test facility at Stennis is a multi-position cell that supports two separate test stands (Cell 1 and Cell 2), one for testing horizontally mounted engines and one for vertically mounted vehicle stages and/or engines.  Cell 1 can support engines with up to {{convert|100000|lbf|kN}} of thrust while Cell 2 can support vehicle stages with up to {{convert|324000|lbf|kN}} of thrust.&lt;ref name=sn20131025/&gt; 
The facility can provide Liquid Oxygen, Liquid Nitrogen, Liquid Hydrogen, Liquid Methane, Refined Petroleum (RP1), H2O, Gaseous Hydrogen, "Hot" Gaseous Hydrogen, Gaseous Oxygen and Gaseous Nitrogen.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;http://pdf.aiaa.org/downloads/2005/CDReadyMJPC2005_1177/2005_4419.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

E2 Cell 1, originally known as the High Heat Flux Facility (HHFF), was constructed in 1993 to support materials development for the [[National Aerospace Plane]] (NASP).&lt;ref name=sn20131025/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

The E2 test stand will be modified after 2013 to support [[liquid methane]] engine testing, with funds being provided by [[SpaceX]], the [[Mississippi Development Authority]] ({{US$|500,000}} using funding from state bond issues), and NASA (up to {{US$|600,000}}).  {{asof|2013|10}}, the SpaceX funding commitment to the methane modification project has not yet been disclosed, as the [[Space Act Agreement|contract]] has not yet been finalized and executed.  The methane modifications will become a permanent part of the Stennis test infrastructure and will be available to other users of the test facility after the SpaceX facility lease is completed.&lt;ref name=sn20131025&gt;

The most recent test completed on the E2 test stand, {{asof|2013|10|lc=y}}, was a 2012 NASA test of chemical [[steam generator]]s.&lt;ref name=sn20131025/&gt;

Beginning in 2014, [[SpaceX]] conducted tests of their liquid methane/liquid oxygen [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor]] rocket engine on the E2 test stand. Initial testing is limited to components of the Raptor engine, since the test stand is not large enough to test the full Raptor engine, which is rated to generate more than {{convert|661000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} vacuum thrust.&lt;ref name=13-311/&gt;&lt;ref name=sn20131025/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa201509/&gt;

==== E3 Test stand ====
The E3 test stand consists of two test cells for component and pilot scale combustion device testing:
*E3 Cell 1 can support devices up to {{convert|60000|lbf}} thrust in a horizontal position. Propellant supports includes LOX or gaseous oxygen/hydrocarbon, gaseous oxygen/gaseous hydrogen and [[hybrid rocket|hybrid]].
*E3 Cell 2 can support devices up to {{convert|25000|lbf}} thrust in a vertical position. Propellent configurations are similar to E3 Cell 1 with the addition of [[hydrogen peroxide]] based devices.

A series of tests conducted in the late 1990s eventually led to the commercialization of [[hybrid rocket]] motors.

=== H-1 Test stand ===
In 2001 the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization proposed construction of a $140 million facility at Stennis H-1 test stand to test its proposed Space-Based Laser (SBL) to begin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002. The facility was to be used to evaluate beam quality, efficiency, and power levels for a prototype megawatt-class hydrogen fluoride laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff2001/stennis.html |title=Stennis Space Center |publisher=Spinoff.nasa.gov |date=2011-05-01 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssc.nasa.gov/environmental/pdf/ER1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, British manufacturer [[Rolls-Royce plc]] has been operating an outdoor aero-engine test facility built on the old H1 test area. Rolls-Royce constructed the facility due to noise pollution concerns at its [[United Kingdom|UK]] testing facility at [[Hucknall Airfield]] near its headquarters in [[Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einpresswire.com/article/56324314/rolls-royce-opens-new-outdoor-jet-engine-testing-facility |title=Rolls-Royce Opens New Outdoor Jet Engine Testing Facility |publisher=Einpresswire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land reclamation''', usually known as '''reclamation''', and also known as '''land fill''' (not to be confused with a [[landfill]]), is the process of creating new [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]] from [[ocean]], [[Stream bed|riverbeds]], or [[lake beds]]. The land reclaimed is known as '''reclamation ground''' or '''land fill'''.

In a number of other jurisdictions, including parts of the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asmr.us | title=American Society for Mining and Reclamation | accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "reclamation" can refer to returning disturbed lands to an improved state. In [[Alberta]], Canada, for example, reclamation is defined by the provincial government as "The process of reconverting disturbed land to its former or other productive uses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Powter | first = Chris | title = Glossary of Reclamation and Remediation Terms used in Alberta | publisher = Government of Alberta | year = 2002 | url = http://environment.gov.ab.ca/info/library/6843.pdf | isbn = 0-7785-2156-7 | accessdate = 2012-04-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120409204116/http://environment.gov.ab.ca/info/library/6843.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Oceania]] it is frequently referred to as [[land rehabilitation]].

== Methods ==
Land reclamation can be achieved with a number of different methods. The most simple method involves simply filling the area with large amounts of heavy rock and/or [[cement]], then filling with clay and dirt until the desired height is reached. The process is called "infilling"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lambi, Cornelius Mbifung|year=2001|title=Environmental issues: problems and prospects|location=Bamenda, Cameroon|publisher=Unique Printers|page=152|isbn=978-9956-11-005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the material used to fill the space is generally called "infill".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Supplement Engineering Field Handbook Chapter 16: Streambank and Shoreline Protection|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|page=16–WI–36|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_024948.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Road Maintenance ESA Program, Part 2: Best Management Practices|publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation|page=2.42|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/nr/rdonlyres/f70e7937-f4dd-4ecc-9909-0c108c97c37a/0/part2.pdf|access-date=2014-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611025636/http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/F70E7937-F4DD-4ECC-9909-0C108C97C37A/0/Part2.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Draining of submerged [[wetland]]s is often used to reclaim land for [[Agriculture|agricultural]] use. [[Deep cement mixing]] is used typically in situations in which the material displaced by either [[dredging]] or draining may be contaminated and hence needs to be contained. Land dredging is also another method of land reclamation. It is the removal of sediments and debris from the bottom of a body of water. It is commonly used for maintaining reclaimed land masses as sedimentation, a natural process, fills channels and harbors naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/dredging.html|title=What is dredging?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest large scale projects was the [[Beemster|Beemster Polder]] in the Netherlands, realized in 1612 adding {{convert|70|km2}} of land. In Hong Kong the [[Praya Reclamation Scheme]] added {{convert|50|to|60|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land in 1890 during the second phase of construction. It was one of the most ambitious projects ever taken during the [[Colonial Hong Kong]] era.&lt;ref name="Bard"&gt;Bard, Solomon.  [2002] (2002). Voices from the Past: Hong Kong 1842–1918. HK University press. {{ISBN|962-209-574-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 20% of land in the [[Tokyo Bay]] area has been reclaimed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Petry| first = Anne K.| title = Geography of Japan| publisher = Japan Digest, [[Indiana University]]| date = July 2003| url = http://iis-db.stanford.edu/docs/129/geo.pdf| accessdate = 2009-07-30| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928055810/http://iis-db.stanford.edu/docs/129/geo.pdf| archivedate = 2011-09-28| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably [[Odaiba]] artificial island.	[[Fontvieille, Monaco|Le Portier]], [[Monaco]] and [[Gibraltar]] are also expanding due to land reclamation. The city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] was largely built on reclaimed land, as was [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].

[[Artificial island]]s are an example of land reclamation. Creating an artificial island is an expensive and risky undertaking. It is often considered in places with high population density and a scarcity of flat land. [[Kansai International Airport]] (in [[Osaka]]) and [[Hong Kong International Airport]] are examples where this process was deemed necessary. The [[Palm Islands]], [[The World (archipelago)|The World]] and hotel [[Burj al-Arab]] off [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] are other examples of artificial islands (although there is yet no real "scarcity of land" in Dubai), as well as the [[Flevopolder]] in the [[Netherlands]] which is the largest artificial island in the world.

== Agriculture ==
[[File:Bingzhou Peninsula area - land reclamation - DSCF9204.JPG|thumb|Land reclamation in progress in Bingzhou (丙州) Peninsula (formerly, island) of the Dongzui Bay (东咀港). [[Tong'an District]], [[Xiamen]], China]]
Agriculture was a drive for land reclamation before [[industrialisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel R. |last=Curtis |title=Into the frontier: medieval land reclamation and the creation of new societies. Comparing Holland and the Po Valley, 800–1500 |url=https://academia.edu/1932594/Into_the_frontier_medieval_land_reclamation_and_the_creation_of_new_societies._Comparing_Holland_and_the_Po_Valley_800-1500 |publisher=Academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In South China, farmers reclaimed [[paddy field]]s by enclosing an area with a stone wall on the [[sea shore]] near a [[river mouth]] or [[river delta]].  The species of rice that grow on these grounds are more [[salt]] tolerant.  Another use of such enclosed land is the creation of [[fish pond]]s.  It is commonly seen on the [[Pearl River Delta]] and [[Hong Kong]].  These reclaimed areas also attract species of [[bird migration|migrating birds]].

A related practice is the [[drainage|draining]] of swampy or seasonally submerged [[wetland]]s to convert them to [[Farmland (farming)|farmland]]. While this does not create new land exactly, it allows commercially productive use of land that would otherwise be restricted to [[wildlife]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat.]] It is also an important method of [[mosquito control]].

Even in the post-industrial age, there have been land reclamation projects intended for increasing available agricultural land.  For example, the village of [[Ōgata, Akita|Ogata]] in [[Akita, Japan]], was established on land reclaimed from [[Lake Hachirogata]] (Japan's second largest lake at the time) starting in 1957. By 1977, the amount of land reclaimed totalled {{convert|172.03|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogata.or.jp/english/history.html |title=The History of Ogata-Mura &amp;#124; Ogata-mura |publisher=Ogata.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924055244/http://www.ogata.or.jp/english/history.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beach restoration ==
{{Main|Beach nourishment}}
Beach rebuilding is the process of repairing [[beach]]es using materials such as [[sand]] or [[mud]] from inland. This can be used to build up beaches suffering from [[beach starvation]] or erosion from [[longshore drift]]. It stops the movement of the original beach material through longshore drift and retains a natural look to the beach. Although it is not a long-lasting solution, it is cheap compared to other types of [[Coastal management|coastal defences]]. An example of this is the city of Mumbai.&lt;ref name="Mumbai"/&gt;

== Landfill ==
As [[human overpopulation|human overcrowding of developed areas]] intensified during the 20th century, it has become important to develop land re-use strategies for completed [[landfill]]s.  Some of the most common usages are for parks, [[golf course]]s and other sports fields. Increasingly, however, office buildings and industrial uses are made on a completed landfill. In these latter uses, [[methane]] capture is customarily carried out to minimize explosive hazard within the building.

An example of a [[Class A office space|Class A office building]] constructed over a landfill is the [[Dakin Building]] at [[Sierra Point, Brisbane, California|Sierra Point]], [[Brisbane, California]]. The underlying fill was deposited from 1965 to 1985, mostly consisting of construction debris from [[San Francisco]] and some municipal wastes. [[Aerial photograph]]s prior to 1965 show this area to be [[wikt:tideland|tideland]]s of the San Francisco Bay. A clay cap was constructed over the debris prior to building approval.&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Awosika and Marc Papineau, ''Phase One [[Environmental Site Assessment]], 7000 Marina Boulevard, Brisbane, California'', prepared for [[Argentum International]] by Certified.  Engineering &amp; Testing Company, Boston, Massachusetts, July 15, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable example is [[Sydney Olympic Park]], the primary venue for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, which was built atop an industrial wasteland that included landfills.

Another strategy for landfill is the incineration of landfill trash at high temperature via the [[Plasma arc waste disposal|plasma-arc gasification process]], which is currently used at two facilities in [[Japan]], and will be used at a planned facility in [[St. Lucie County]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-09-09-fla-county-trash_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=Florida county plans to vaporize landfill trash |date=2006-09-09 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
[[File:bay area fill.jpg|thumb|Parts (highlighted in brown) of the [[San Francisco Bay]] were reclaimed from wetlands for urban use.]]
Draining wetlands for ploughing, for example, is a form of [[habitat destruction]]. In some parts of the world, new reclamation projects are restricted or no longer allowed, due to [[environmental movement|environmental protection]] laws. Reclamation projects have strong negative impacts on coastal populations, although some species can take advantage of the newly created area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Kim|first2=Kyungmin|last3=Heo|first3=Kyongman|last4=Jablonski|first4=Piotr G.|last5=Jang|first5=Yikweon|title=Impact of land reclamation and agricultural water regime on the distribution and conservation status of the endangered Dryophytes suweonensis|journal=PeerJ|date=4 October 2017|volume=5|page=e3872|doi=10.7717/peerj.3872|url=https://peerj.com/articles/3872/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental legislation ===
[[File:Hong Kong reclamation.png|thumb|A map of reclaimed land in Hong Kong: Grey (built), red (proposed or under development). Many of the urban areas of Hong Kong are on reclaimed land.]]
The State of California created a state commission, the [[San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission]], in 1965 to protect San Francisco Bay and regulate development near its shores.  The commission was created in response to growing concern over the shrinking size of the bay.

Hong Kong legislators passed the [[Protection of the Harbour Ordinance]], proposed by the [[Society for Protection of the Harbour]], in 1997 in an effort to safeguard the increasingly threatened [[Victoria Harbour]] against encroaching land development.&lt;ref name="bill"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallis |first=Keith |title=Bill seeks to protect harbour |date=February 12, 1996 |publisher=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong Standard]] |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=23201&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19960212&amp;sear_year=1996 |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604140503/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=23201&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19960212&amp;sear_year=1996 |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several large reclamation schemes at Green Island, West Kowloon, and [[Kowloon Bay]] were subsequently shelved, and others reduced in size.

== Dangers ==
Reclaimed land is highly susceptible to [[soil liquefaction]] during earthquakes,&lt;ref name=abag&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/liquefac/Lq_rept.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723055040/http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/liquefac/Lq_rept.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can amplify the amount of damage that occurs to buildings and infrastructure. [[Subsidence]] is another issue, both from [[soil compaction]] on filled land, and also when wetlands are enclosed by [[levee]]s and drained to create [[Polder]]s. Drained marshes will eventually sink below the surrounding water level, increasing the danger from [[flood]]ing.

== Land amounts added ==

Commonly called a [[branch]]. It develops from [[axillary bud]]s on the stem's surface, extending laterally from the [[Plant stem|plant's stem]].

A lateral shoot is a part of a plant's [[shoot]] system.
==Importance to photosynthesis==
As a plant grows it requires more energy, it also is required to out-compete nearby plants for this energy. One of the ways a plant can compete for this energy is to increase its height, another is to increase its overall surface area. That is to say, the more lateral shoots a plant develops, the more foliage the plant can support increases how much [[photosynthesis]] the plant can perform as it allows for more area for the plant to uptake [[carbon dioxide]] as well as sunlight. 

==Genes, transcription factors, and growth==

Through testing with [[Arabidopsis thaliana]] (A plant considered a [[model organism]] for plant genetic studies) genes including MAX1 and MAX2 have been found to affect growth of lateral shoots. [[Gene knockout]]s of these genes cause abnormal proliferation of the plants affected, implying they are used for repressing said growth in [[wild type]] plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stirnberg|first=Petra|last2=Sande|first2=Karin van de|last3=Leyser|first3=H.

These [[mutant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s cause slower growth and improper formation of lateral shoots, which could also mean that lateral shoots are important to florigen's function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hiraoka|first=Kazuhisa|last2=Yamaguchi|first2=Ayako|last3=Abe|first3=Mitsutomo|last4=Araki|first4=Takashi|title=The Florigen Genes FT and TSF Modulate Lateral Shoot Outgrowth in Arabidopsis thaliana|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcs168|journal=Plant and Cell Physiology|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=352–368|doi=10.1093/pcp/pcs168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with general growth there are also [[Transcription factor|transcription factors]] that directly effect the production of additional lateral shoots like the TCP family (also known as Teosinte branched 1/cycloidea/proliferating cell factor) which are plant specific proteins that suppress lateral shoot branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-800854-6.00016-6|title=The Role of TCP Transcription Factors in Shaping Flower Structure, Leaf Morphology, and Plant Architecture|last=Nicolas|first=Michael|last2=Cubas|first2=Pilar|pages=249–267|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-800854-6.00016-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the TCP family has been found to be partially responsible for inhibiting the cell's [[Growth hormone–releasing hormone|Growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRF)]] which means it also inhibits cell proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0070-2153(10)91007-7|title=Control of Tissue and Organ Growth in Plants|last=Breuninger|first=Holger|last2=Lenhard|first2=Michael|pages=185–220|doi=10.1016/s0070-2153(10)91007-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lead paint''' or '''lead-based paint''' is [[paint]] containing [[lead]]. As pigment, [[lead(II) chromate]] ([[Lead|Pb]] [[Chromium|Cr]] [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], "[[chrome yellow]]"), [[Lead(II,IV) oxide]], ([[Lead|Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], "red lead"), and [[lead(II) carbonate]] ([[Lead|Pb]] [[Carbon|C]] [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], "[[white lead]]") are the most common forms.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Völz, Hans G. ''et al.''|title=Pigments, Inorganic|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a20_243.pub2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lead is added to paint to accelerate [[drying oil|drying]], increase durability, maintain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion. It is one of the main health and [[environmental issues with paint|environmental hazards associated with paint]]. In some countries, lead continues to be added to paint intended for domestic use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE57O64G20090825 | work=Reuters | title=Lead-laden paint still widely sold around the world | date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas countries such as the [[Lead-based paint in the United States|U.S.]] and the [[Lead-based paint in the United Kingdom|UK]] have regulations prohibiting this, although lead paint may still be found in older properties painted prior to the introduction of such regulations. Although lead has been banned from household paints in the United States since 1978, paint used in road markings may still contain it. Alternatives such as water-based, lead-free traffic paint are readily available, and many states and federal agencies have changed their purchasing contracts to buy these instead.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==History==
[[White lead|Lead white]] was being produced during the 4th century BC; the process is described by [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Vitruvius]] and the ancient Greek author [[Theophrastus]].

The traditional method making the pigment was called the stack process. Hundreds or thousands of earthenware pots containing vinegar and lead were embedded in a layer of either [[tan bark]] or cow [[feces]]. The pots were designed so that the vinegar and lead were in separate compartments, but the lead was in contact with the vapor of the vinegar. The lead was usually coiled into a spiral, and placed on a ledge inside the pot. The pot was loosely covered with a grid of lead, which allowed the carbon dioxide formed by the [[fermentation]] of the tan bark or the dung to circulate in the pot.   Each layer of pots was covered by a new layer of tan, then another layer of pots. the heat created by the fermentation, [[acetic acid]] vapor and carbon dioxide within the stack did their work, and within a month the lead coils were covered with a crust of white lead.  This crust was separated from the lead, washed and ground for pigment.  This was an extremely dangerous process for the workmen.  Medieval texts warned of the danger of "[[apoplexy]], [[epilepsy]], and paralysis" from working with lead white.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel V. Thompson, ''The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting'', p. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the risks, the pigment was very popular with artists because of its density and opacity; a small amount could cover a large surface. It was widely used by artists until the 19th century, when it was replaced by [[zinc white]] and [[titanium white]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball (2000), ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dangers of lead paint were considered well-established by the beginning of the 20th century. In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication, [[Sherwin-Williams]] reported the dangers of paint containing lead, noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint "poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors".&lt;ref name="SWP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066401898;view=1up;seq=110 |title=Dangers of White Lead |last1=Guenther |first1=Richard |date=1904-02-24 |website=[[Hathitrust]] |publisher=Sherwin Williams Co. |accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1886, German health laws prohibited women and children from working in factories processing lead paint and [[lead sugar]].&lt;ref name=ayass&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ayaß |editor1-first=Wolfgang |editor1-link=:de:Wolfgang Ayaß |date=1999-01-01 |title=Quellensammlung zur Geschichte der deutschen Sozialpolitik 1867 bis 1914, II.

Lead paint is hazardous. It can cause [[nervous system]] damage, stunted growth, [[kidney]] damage, and delayed development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=93&amp;tid=22|title=ToxFAQs™ for Lead|date=August 2007|last=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|publisher=Center for Disease Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dangerous to children because it tastes sweet,{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} therefore encouraging children to put lead chips and toys with lead dust in their mouths. Lead paint is dangerous to adults and can cause reproductive problems in men or women. Decreases in sperm production in men have been noted. Lead is considered a possible and likely carcinogen. High levels may result in death.

==Regulation==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=May 2012}}
The [[European Union]] has passed a directive controlling lead paint use.

In Canada, regulations were first enacted under the Hazardous Products Act in 1976 that limited lead content of paints and other liquid coatings on furniture, household products, children's products, and exterior and interior surfaces of any building frequented by children to 0.5% by weight.&lt;ref name="healthcanada-leadfaq"&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/contaminants/lead-plomb/asked_questions-questions_posees-eng.php Some Commonly Asked Questions About Lead and Human Health], Health Canada&lt;/ref&gt; New regulations on surface coating materials, which came into force in 2005, further limit lead to its background level for both interior and exterior paints sold to consumers. Canadian paint manufacturers have been conforming to this background level in their interior and exterior consumer paints since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead and Health|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/contaminants/lead-plomb-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=3 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603023707/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/contaminants/lead-plomb-eng.php|archivedate=3 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a Canadian company, Dominion Colour Corporation, is "the largest manufacturer of lead-based paint pigments in the world" and has faced public criticism for obtaining permission from the [[European Chemicals Agency]] to continue to export lead chromate paints from its Dutch subsidiary to countries where its uses are not tightly regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-company-s-lead-based-products-a-danger-to-world-health-critics-say-1.3340853 |title=Toronto company's lead-based products a danger to world health, critics say |last=Fowler |first=Jennifer |date=1 December 2015 |work=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) banned lead paint in 1977 in residential properties and public buildings (16 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 1303), along with toys and furniture containing lead paint. The cited reason was "to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children who may ingest paint chips or peelings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml77/77096.html|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|title=CPSC Announces Final Ban On Lead-Containing Paint|date=2 September 1977|last=Office of Information and Public Affairs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819015700/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/prhtml77/77096.html|archivedate=19 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For manufacturers, the CPSC instituted the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008]], which changed the cap on lead content in paint from 0.06% to 0.009% starting August 14, 2009.  In 2018 the State of Delaware banned the use of lead paint on outdoor structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?legislationId=26820|title=HB 456 AN ACT TO AMEND TITLES 14, 16, 17, 26, AND 29 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO THE USE OF LEAD PAINTS ON OUTDOOR STRUCTURES.|last=State of Delaware|first=General Assembly|date=29 August 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] required that all renovators working in homes built before 1978 and disturbing more than six square feet of lead paint inside the home or 20 square feet outside the home be certified. EPA's Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule (RRP Rule) lowers the risk of lead contamination from home renovation activities. It requires that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in homes, child care facilities and pre-schools (any child occupied facility) built before 1978 be certified by EPA and use certified renovators who are trained by EPA-approved training providers to follow lead-safe work practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/getleadsafe/|title=U.S. EPA Renovation, Repair and Painting Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, there are an estimated 37 million homes and apartments with lead paint in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Charles |url=https://undark.org/article/lead-testing-child-blood-levels/ |title=America’s Misguided War on Childhood Lead Exposures |work=Undark |date=2018-03-21 |accessdate=2018-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines banned lead paint in 2013, but in 2017, 15% of the paint still was not certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mogensen|first1=Jackie Flynn|title=You’ll Probably Never Save as Many Lives as This Guy Who Got the Philippines to Stop Using Lead Paint|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/04/youll-probably-never-save-as-many-lives-as-this-guy-who-got-the-philippines-to-stop-using-lead-paint/|accessdate=23 April 2018|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead paint is not prohibited in India. A 2015 study found that over 31% of household paints in India had lead concentration above 10,000 parts per million (ppm), which far exceeds the [[Bureau of Indian Standards|BIS]] standard of 90 ppm for lead in paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Over 31 percent paints have alarming levels of lead: study |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/over-31-percent-paints-have-alarming-levels-of-lead-study/ |journal=[[Press Trust of India]] |via=[[The Indian Express]] |accessdate=18 April 2016|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Africa]], the Hazardous Substances Act of 2009 classifies lead as a hazardous substance and limits its use in paint to 600 parts per million (ppm). A proposed amendment will modify this to 90 ppm, thereby almost completely eradicating lead from paint. The amendment would also include all industrial paints, which were previously excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/proposed-amendment-to-legislation-set-to-eliminate-lead-in-paint-2018-06-15|title=Proposed amendment to legislation set to eliminate lead in paint|last=Bulbulia|first=Tasneem|work=Engineering News|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lead paint in art==

===Oil paints===
In art, [[white lead|white lead paint]] is known as "flake white" or "Cremnitz white". It is valued for the ease of handling and resilience the lead confers to [[oil paint]]s. Lead white paint dries relatively quickly to form a strong, flexible paint film. Lead-based white is one of the oldest manufactured pigments. It was the only white pigment available to artists in appreciable quantities until the twentieth century, when zinc-white and titanium-white became available.&lt;ref name="Mayer 1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Ralph|title=The artist's handbook of materials and techniques|year=1991|publisher=Viking|location=New York City|isbn=0670837016|edition=5. ed., rev. and updated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrially produced lead white, the typical pigment from the 19th century until its ban, was thought to be inferior to traditionally fabricated forms, which had larger "flake" particles that conferred ease of handling.

Titanium and zinc whites are far less toxic than lead white and have largely supplanted it in most fine arts applications.  Safety regulations have also made lead white more expensive and difficult to obtain in some regions, such as the EU.  However, lead white oil paints are still produced and in use by artists who prefer their unique handling, mixing, and structural qualities.&lt;ref name="Mayer 1991"/&gt;

Flake white has various drawbacks, including a tendency to become transparent over time. It also blackens in the presence of certain atmospheric pollutants, although this can be reversed.

===Water-based paints===
Lead is not a traditional pigment in water mediums, as zinc is superior for works on paper, as is [[calcium hydroxide]] (slaked lime) for [[frescos]]. Lead-based paints, when used on paper, often cause the work to become discolored after long periods of time; the paint's lead carbonate reacts with [[hydrogen sulfide]] in the air and with acids, which often come from fingerprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| volume= 4

==Substitutes==

===Titanium===
Paint manufacturers have replaced white lead with a less toxic substitute, [[titanium white]] (based on the pigment [[titanium dioxide]]), which was first used in paints in the 19th century. Titanium dioxide is considered safe enough to use as a [[food coloring]] and in [[toothpaste]]. It is also a common ingredient in [[sunscreen]]. When used in paints today, it is often coated with [[silicon]] or [[aluminum oxide]]s for durability. Titanium white has far greater opacity and tinting strength than lead white, and it can easily overpower most other pigments if not mixed carefully.  Titanium white has been criticized for leading to "chalkiness" in mixtures, and for allegedly decreasing the permanence of organic pigments mixed with it due to its high [[refractive index]].

===Zinc===
[[Zinc white]] is less opaque and weaker in tinting strength than either titanium white or lead white. It is commonly used to lighten mixtures subtly while maintaining transparency.  Although zinc white is the standard white in watercolors, its structural soundness in oils has been debated. Zinc white dries slowly and creates a relatively inflexible paint film.  Critics of the pigment argue that its use leads to excessive cracking and delamination, even when used sparingly.&lt;ref name="naturalpigments"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zinc White –  Problems in Oil Paint?|url=http://naturalpigments.com/education/article.asp?ArticleID=127|publisher=Natural Pigments LLC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206110619/http://naturalpigments.com/education/article.asp?ArticleID=127|archivedate=2011-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIASE''' is a registered project of the [[Minimum Information Standards|MIBBI]] (minimum information for biological and biomedical investigations).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mibbi.org/ Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The MIASE project was launched in 2007 by Dagmar Köhn and Nicolas Le Novère and first presented on the [http://sbml.org/Events/Workshops/The_12th_SBML_Forum_Meeting 12th SBML Forum Meeting] in October 2007. Since then, MIASE was discussed on various meetings, not only within the SBML community. MIASE has become a community effort involving people from various standardisation communities as well as developers of simulation tools.
In April 2009, MIASE was part of the "[[CellML]], [[SBGN]], [[Systems Biology Ontology|SBO]], [[BioPAX]], and MIASE [http://www.cellml.org/community/events/workshop/2009 Super-Workshop 2009]".

== The guidelines ==
The MIASE Guidelines are composed of the following parts: Information about the models to use, information about the simulation steps, and Information about the output:

=== Information about the models to use ===
All models used in the experiment must be identified, accessible, and fully described.
# The description of the simulation experiment must be provided together with the models necessary for the experiment, or with a precise and unambiguous way of accessing those models.
# The models required for the simulations must be provided with all governing equations, parameter values, and necessary conditions (initial state and/or boundary conditions).
# If a model is not encoded in a standard format, then the model code must be made available to the user. If a model is not encoded in an open format or code, its full description must be provided, sufficient to re-implement it.
# Any modification of a model (pre-processing) required before the execution of a step of the simulation experiment must be described.

=== Information about the simulation steps ===
A precise description of the simulation steps and other procedures used by the experiment must be provided.
# All simulation steps must be clearly described, including the simulation algorithms to be used, the models on which to apply each simulation, the order of the simulation steps, and the data processing to be done between the simulation steps.
# All information needed for the correct implementation of the necessary simulation steps must be included through precise descriptions or references to unambiguous information sources.
# If a simulation step is performed using a computer program for which source code is not available, all information needed to reproduce the simulation, and not just repeat it, must be provided, including the algorithms used by the original software and any information necessary to implement them, such as the discretization and integration methods.
# If it is known that a simulation step will produce different results when performed in a different simulation environment or on a different computational platform, an explanation must be given of how the model has to be run with the specified environment/platform in order to achieve the purpose of the experiment.

=== Information about the output ===
All information necessary to obtain the desired numerical results must be provided.
# All post-processing steps applied on the raw numerical results of simulation steps in order to generate the final results have to be described in detail. That includes the identification of data to process, the order in which changes were applied, and also the nature of changes.
# If the expected insights depend on the relation between different results, such as a plot of one against another, the results to be compared have to be specified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6442">'''Occupational (or industrial) toxicology''' is the application of the principles and methodology of [[toxicology]] to understanding and managing chemical and biological hazards encountered at work. The objective of the occupational toxicologist is to prevent adverse health effects in workers that arise from exposures in their work environment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Casarett and Doull’s ,TOXICOLOGY, The Basic Science of Poisons&lt;/ref&gt;

The science of [[toxicology]] has many applications. One of these, relates to [[Radiant exposure|exposure]] of people to noxious or hazardous agents during the course of their work. Field of occupational toxicology is the study of the adverse effects of agents that may be encountered by.workers during the course of their [[employment]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Occupational Toxicolog, 2nd EDITION, Edited by Chris Winder and Neill Stacey&lt;/ref&gt;

The work environment has played a significant role in the occurrence of adverse human health effects due to chemical and biological hazards for centuries. Occupational health specialists, including toxicologists, rely upon human and animal data to determine safe exposure levels. If effects observed in workers can be reproduced in a laboratory animal, it becomes possible to investigate the mechanisms that might reasonably be expected to produce such effects. On the other hand, shedding light on the mechanism by which a designated effect is produced in a test animal species may make it easier to find ways to prevent such effects from occurring in humans. Such an understanding may also help to identify subtle or delayed effects that have not been observed in workers, but to which health professionals should be alerted.&lt;ref&gt;PRINCIPLES OF TOXICOLOGY , Environmental and Industrial Applications , SECOND EDITION , Edited by Phillip L. Williams,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure==
Occupational exposures involve situations ranging، for example from a secretary using typewriter correction fluid to the loading and off-loading of tanker trucks with thousands of gallons of gasoline.

== History ==

Early writings by Ulrich Ellenbog (1435–1499), [[Georgius Agricola|Agricola]] (1494–1555), and [[Paracelsus]] (1492–1541) revealed the toxic nature of exposures in [[mining]], [[smelting]], and [[metallurgy]].
A systematic treatise by [[Ramazzini]] (1633–1714) described the hazards as they applied to miners, chemists, metal workers, [[Driver (series)|tanners]], [[pharmacists]], grain sifters, stonecutters, sewage workers, and even corpse bearers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==How is occupational toxicology used?==
*Role in decision making within hierarchical control
*Role in setting exposure standards for workplace chemicals
*Role in biological monitoring for chemical exposure&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Biological monitoring ==
The [[measurement]] of a chemical, its [[metabolite]], or a [[biochemical]] effect in a biologic [[Biological specimen|specimen]] for the purpose of assessing [[Exposure assessment|exposure]]. Biologic [[Biomonitoring|monitoring]] is an important [[tool]] to identify the nature and amount of chemical exposures in [[occupational]] and [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;CURRENT Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine,fourth edition Edited by Joseph LaDou&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Heavy metals]]==
[[Metal]]s with a [[density]] of more than 5 g/cm3 and [[toxic]] effects.
Including [[arsenic]], [[cobalt]], [[lead]], [[lithium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[thorium]], have documented ototoxic potential.
The metals represent a different aspect of toxicology in that they do not undergo breakdown to other metals (to do so would be transmutation of the elements, an old alchemical principle still not possible without huge sources of energy, and a particle accelerator!). The absorption, disposition and excretion of metals are largely dependent on physical factors, such as solubility, ionisation, particle size and chemical species (for metal salts). About 70–80 elements in the periodic table are considered metals. Groups Ia and IIa, the‘s block’ metals, form monovalent and divalent cations respectively. Groups IIIb to VIb constitute the ‘p block’ elements, which include metals that can have ions of different valencies. These are called the transition elements. Of the metal elements, about 40 are considered to be ‘common’ metals. However, less than 30 have compounds that have been reported to produce toxicity. Metals are probably some of the oldest toxicants known to humans. Health effects such as colic were reported following exposure to lead, arsenic and mercury over 2000 years ago. On the other hand, metals such as cadmium, chromium and nickel belong to the modern era. The importance of some of the rarer metals may become apparent with emerging changes in technology, such as microelectronics and superconductors. The toxicity of a metal is only partially related to its position in the periodic table. Toxicity decreases with the stability of the configuration of electrons in the atomic nuclei. This produces a number of properties that can affect toxicity&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Toxicolog, 2nd EDITION, Edited by Chris Winder and Neill Stacey&lt;/ref&gt;.

Most permafrost is located in high [[latitude]]s (in and around the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic regions]]), but at lower latitudes '''alpine permafrost''' occurs at higher [[elevation]]s. Ground ice is not always present, as may be in the case of non-porous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and it may be in amounts exceeding the potential hydraulic saturation of the ground material. Permafrost accounts for 0.022% of total water on Earth&lt;ref&gt;

Permafrost is [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[sediment]] that is frozen for more than two consecutive years. In areas not overlain by ice, it exists beneath a layer of soil, rock or sediment, which freezes and thaws annually and is called the "active layer".&lt;ref name = "Definition"&gt;

Active layer thickness varies with the season, but is 0.3 to 4 meters thick (shallow along the Arctic coast; deep in southern Siberia and the [[Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau]]).

The deepest depth of permafrost occurs where geothermal heat maintains a temperature above freezing.

===Continuity of coverage===
Permafrost typically forms in any [[climate]] where the mean annual air temperature is less than the freezing point of [[water]]. Exceptions are found in moist-wintered forest climates, such as in Northern Scandinavia and the North-Eastern part of European Russia west of the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], where snow acts as an insulating blanket. Glaciated areas may be exceptions. Since all glaciers are warmed at their base by geothermal heat, [[Glacier#Types|temperate glaciers]], which are near the [[Pressure melting point|pressure-melting]] point throughout, may have liquid water at the interface with the ground and are therefore free of underlying permafrost.&lt;ref&gt;

====Discontinuous permafrost====
Typically, the below-ground temperature varies less from season to season than the air temperature, with mean annual temperatures tending to increase with depth as a result of the geothermal crustal gradient. Thus, if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered—usually with a northerly [[aspect (geography)|aspect]]—creating ''discontinuous permafrost''. Usually, permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between {{convert|-5|and|0|C|F}}. In the moist-wintered areas mentioned before, there may not be even discontinuous permafrost down to {{convert|-2|°C|°F}}. Discontinuous permafrost is often further divided into ''extensive discontinuous permafrost'', where permafrost covers between 50 and 90 percent of the landscape and is usually found in areas with mean annual temperatures between {{convert|-2|and|-4|C|F}}, and ''sporadic permafrost'', where permafrost cover is less than 50 percent of the landscape and typically occurs at mean annual temperatures between {{convert|0|and|-2|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="BrownPéwé"&gt;

=== Subsea permafrost ===
Subsea permafrost occurs beneath the seabed and exists in the continental shelves of the polar regions.&lt;ref name=IPA/&gt; These areas formed during the last ice age, when a larger portion of Earth's water was bound up in ice sheets on land and when sea levels were low. As the ice sheets melted to again become seawater, the permafrost became submerged shelves under relatively warm and salty boundary conditions, compared to surface permafrost. Therefore, subsea permafrost exists in conditions that lead to its diminishment. According to Osterkamp, subsea permafrost is a factor in the "design, construction, and operation of coastal facilities, structures founded on the seabed, artificial islands, sub-sea pipelines, and wells drilled for exploration and production."&lt;ref name=Osterkamp&gt;

===Massive ground ice===
[[File:Permafrost - Massive buried ice (blue).png|thumb|Massive blue ground ice exposure on the north shore of Herschel Island, Yukon, Canada.]]

When the ice content of a permafrost exceeds 250 percent (ice to dry soil by mass) it is classified as ''massive'' ice. Massive ice bodies can range in composition, in every conceivable gradation from icy mud to pure ice. Massive icy beds have a minimum thickness of at least 2 m, a short diameter of at least 10 m.&lt;ref name = Mackay1973&gt;

Buried surface ice may derive from snow, frozen lake or sea ice, [[aufeis]] (stranded river ice) and—probably the most prevalent—buried glacial ice.&lt;ref&gt;Astakhov, 1986; Kaplanskaya and Tarnogradskiy, 1986; Astakhov and Isayeva, 1988; French, 1990; Lacelle et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrasedimental ice forms by in-place freezing of subterranean waters and is dominated by segregational ice which results from the crystallizational differentiation taking place during the freezing of wet sediments, accompanied by water migrating to the freezing front.&lt;ref name=Shumskiy-Vtyurin1966/&gt;

Intrasedimental or constitutional ice has been widely observed and studied across Canada and also includes intrusive and injection ice.&lt;ref name=French2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shumskiy-Vtyurin1966/&gt;&lt;!----ref&gt;Shumskiy and Vtyurin, 1966; Mackay, 1971, 1973, 1989; Harry et al., 1988; French and Harry, 1990; Pollard, 1990; Mackay and Dallimore, 1992; French, 1998; Pollard, 1991; Murton et al., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Russian investigators including I.A. Lopatin, B. Khegbomov, S. Taber and G. Beskow formulated the original theories for ice inclusions in freezing soils.&lt;ref&gt;Shumskiy and Vtyurin, 1966&lt;/ref----&gt;

Additionally, ice wedges—a separate type of ground ice—produce recognizable patterned ground or tundra polygons. Ice wedges form in a pre-existing geological substrate and were first described in 1919.&lt;ref name=French2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shumskiy-Vtyurin1966/&gt;&lt;!----ref&gt;Popov, 1962; Shumskiy and Vtyurin, 1966; Pewe, 1966b; French et al., 1982; Michel, 1990&lt;/ref----&gt;

===Carbon cycle in permafrost===
The [[permafrost carbon cycle]] (Arctic Carbon Cycle) deals with the transfer of carbon from permafrost soils to terrestrial vegetation and microbes, to the atmosphere, back to vegetation, and finally back to permafrost soils through burial and sedimentation due to cryogenic processes. Some of this carbon is transferred to the ocean and other portions of the globe through the global carbon cycle. The cycle includes the exchange of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]] between terrestrial components and the atmosphere, as well as the transfer of carbon between land and water as methane, [[dissolved organic carbon]], [[dissolved inorganic carbon]], particulate inorganic carbon and particulate organic carbon.&lt;ref name=mcguire&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1890/08-2025.1 |author=McGuire, A.D., Anderson, L.G., Christensen, T.R., Dallimore, S., Guo, L., Hayes, D.J., Heimann, M., Lorenson, T.D., Macdonald, R.W., and Roulet, N. |title=Sensitivity of the carbon cycle in the Arctic to climate change |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=523–555 |year=2009 |url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/08-2025.1|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-000E-D87B-C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change effects==
Arctic permafrost has been diminishing for many centuries. The consequence is thawing soil, which may be weaker, and release of methane, which contributes to an increased rate of global warming as part of a feedback loop.

===Historical changes===

The ground can consist of many substrate materials, including bedrock, sediment, organic matter, water or ice. Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.

By definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grosse, G. |author2=Romanovsky, V. |author3=Nelson, F.E. |author4=Brown, J. |author5=Lewkowicz, A.G. |title=Why Permafrost Is Thawing, Not Melting |journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union]] |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=87 |date=March 2010 |doi=10.1029/2010EO090003 |url=http://permafrost.gi.alaska.edu/sites/default/files/Grosse%20et%20al%202010%20EOS.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=2010EOSTr..91...87G}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analogy is when a freezer door is left open, although the ice in the freezer may change phase to a liquid, the food solids will not experience a phase change. In aggregate, the food ''thaws'' but does not ''melt''. ''Melting'' implies the phase change of all solids to liquid. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the [[Drunken trees|random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation]] in permafrost areas.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite web|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE6D8163DF93BA2575BC0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|title=Dead Trees and Shriveling Glaciers as Alaska Melts|last=Stevens|first=William K.|date=1998-08-18|accessdate=2007-12-19|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=Here and there, roadside utility poles destabilized by the melting tilt at crazy angles.

===Effect on slope stability===
Over the past century, an increasing number of alpine rock slope failure events in mountain ranges around the world have been recorded. It is expected that the high number of structural failures is due to permafrost thawing, which is thought to be linked to climate change. Permafrost thawing is thought to have contributed to the 1987 [[Val Pola landslide]] that killed 22 people in the Italian Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=F.|first=Dramis,|last2=M.|first2=Govi,|last3=M.|first3=Guglielmin,|last4=G.|first4=Mortara,|date=1995-01-01|title=Mountain permafrost and slope instability in the Italian Alps: The Val Pola Landslide|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/ppp.3430060108/abstract|journal=Permafrost and Periglacial Processes|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1002/ppp.3430060108|issn=1099-1530|pages=73–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mountain ranges, much of the structural stability can be attributed to glaciers and permafrost. As climate warms, permafrost thaws, which results in a less stable mountain structure, and ultimately more slope failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In the northern circumpolar region, permafrost contains 1700 billion tons of organic material equaling almost half of all organic material in all soils.&lt;ref name="Tarnocai 2009"/&gt; This pool was built up over thousands of years and is only slowly degraded under the cold conditions in the Arctic.

Formation of permafrost has significant consequences for ecological systems, primarily due to constraints imposed upon rooting zones, but also due to limitations on den and [[burrow]] geometries for [[fauna]] requiring subsurface homes. Secondary effects impact [[species]] dependent on plants and animals whose habitat is constrained by the permafrost. One of the most widespread examples is the dominance of [[Black Spruce]] in extensive permafrost areas, since this species can tolerate rooting pattern constrained to the near surface.&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Predicted rate of change in the Arctic===
{{See also|Arctic methane release}}

According to [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] there is high confidence that permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions since the early 1980s. Observed warming was up to 3&amp;nbsp;°C in parts of Northern Alaska (early 1980s to mid-2000s) and up to 2&amp;nbsp;°C in parts of the Russian European North (1971–2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://templatelab.com/climatechange-WGIAR5-SPM-Approved-27Sep2013/|title=Working Group I Contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report Climate Change 2013 - Summary for Policymakers - Template Lab|date=10 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Yukon]], the zone of continuous permafrost might have moved {{convert|100|km}} poleward since 1899, but accurate records only go back 30 years.

==Other issues==
The [[International Permafrost Association]] (IPA) is an integrator of issues regarding permafrost. It convenes International Permafrost Conferences, undertakes special projects such as preparing databases, maps, bibliographies, and glossaries, and coordinates international field programmes and networks. Among other issues addressed by the IPA are: Problems for construction on permafrost owing to the change of soil properties of the ground on which structures are placed and the biological processes in permafrost, e.g. the preservation of organisms frozen ''in situ''.

===Construction on permafrost===
Building on permafrost is difficult because the heat of the building (or [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]) can thaw the permafrost and destabilize the structure. Three common solutions include: using [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] on wood [[Deep foundation|piles]]; building on a thick [[gravel]] pad (usually 1–2 metres/3.3–6.6 feet thick); or using [[anhydrous ammonia]] [[heat pipe]]s.&lt;ref name="ASCE"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] uses [[Heat pipe#Permafrost cooling|heat pipes built into vertical supports]] to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the [[Qingzang railway]] in [[Tibet]] employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool, both in areas with [[Frost heaving#Frost-susceptible soils|frost-susceptible soil]]. Permafrost may necessitate special enclosures for buried utilities, called "[[Utility tunnel#In Arctic towns|utilidors]]".

The ''Permafrost Research Institute'' in [[Yakutsk]], found that the sinking of large buildings into the ground can be prevented by using pile foundations extending down to {{convert|15|m}} or more. At this depth the temperature does not change with the seasons, remaining at about {{convert|-5|C}}.

===Revival of organisms preserved in permafrost===
In 2012, Russian researchers proved that permafrost can serve as a natural repository for ancient life forms by reviving of ''[[Silene stenophylla]]'' from 30,000 year old tissue found in an [[Ice Age]] squirrel burrow in the [[Siberian]] permafrost. This is the oldest plant tissue ever revived. The plant was fertile, producing white flowers and viable seeds. The study demonstrated that tissue can survive ice preservation for tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[File:Simplified photorespiration diagram.jpg|thumb|Simplified photorespiration and Calvin cycle]]
'''Photorespiration''' (also known as the '''oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle''', or '''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis''') refers to a process in [[plant physiology|plant metabolism]] where the [[enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] oxygenates [[RuBP]], causing some of the energy produced by photosynthesis to be wasted. The desired reaction is the addition of [[carbon dioxide]] to RuBP ([[carboxylation]]), a key step in the [[Calvin–Benson cycle]], however approximately 25% of reactions by RuBisCO instead add oxygen to RuBP ([[Oxygenase|oxygenation]]), creating a product that cannot be used within the Calvin–Benson cycle. This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis, potentially reducing photosynthetic output by 25% in [[C3 carbon fixation|{{C3}} plants]].&lt;ref name="Sharkey"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sharkey, Thomas |title=Estimating the rate of photorespiration in leaves |journal=Physiologia Plantarum |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=147–152 |year=1988 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1988.tb09205.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Photorespiration involves a complex network of enzyme reactions that exchange metabolites between [[chloroplast]]s, leaf [[peroxisome]]s and [[mitochondria]].

The oxygenation reaction of RuBisCO is a wasteful process because [[3-Phosphoglyceric acid|3-phosphoglycerate]] is created at a reduced rate and higher metabolic cost compared with [[Calvin cycle|RuBP carboxylase activity]]. While photorespiratory carbon cycling results in the formation of [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate|G3P]] eventually, there is still a net loss of carbon (around 25% of carbon fixed by photosynthesis is re-released as {{CO2}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leegood | first1 = R. C. | year = 2007 | title = A welcome diversion from photorespiration | url = | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 539–540 | doi=10.1038/nbt0507-539 | pmid=17483837}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nitrogen, as [[ammonia]]. [[Ammonia]] must be detoxified at a substantial cost to the cell. Photorespiration also incurs a direct cost of one [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and one [[NAD(P)H]].

While it is common to refer to the entire process as photorespiration, technically the term refers only to the metabolic network which acts to rescue the products of the oxygenation reaction (phosphoglycolate).

==Photorespiratory reactions==

Addition of molecular oxygen to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate produces [[3-phosphoglycerate]] (PGA) and 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG, or PG). PGA is the normal product of carboxylation, and productively enters the [[Calvin cycle]]. Phosphoglycolate, however, inhibits certain enzymes involved in photosynthetic carbon fixation (hence is often said to be an 'inhibitor of photosynthesis').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peterhansel | first1 = C. | last2 = Krause | first2 = K. | last3 = Braun | first3 = H. -P. | last4 = Espie | first4 = G.

Glycerate reenters the chloroplast and by the same transporter that exports glycolate. A cost of 1 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is associated with conversion to 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) ([[Phosphorylation]]), within the [[chloroplast]], which is then free to re-enter the Calvin cycle.

There are several costs associated with this metabolic pathway; one being the production of [[hydrogen peroxide]] in the peroxisome (associated with the conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate). Hydrogen peroxide is a dangerously strong oxidant which must be immediately broken down into water and oxygen by the enzyme [[catalase]]. The conversion of 2× 2Carbon [[glycine]] to 1 C3 [[serine]] in the mitochondria by the enzyme glycine-decarboxylase is a key step, which releases {{CO2}}, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces NAD to NADH. Thus, 1 {{chem|CO|2}} molecule is produced for every 2 molecules of {{chem|O|2}} (two deriving from the activity of RuBisCO, the third from peroxisomal oxidations). The assimilation of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; occurs via the [[Glutamine synthetase|GS]]-[[Glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase|GOGAT]] cycle, at a cost of one ATP and one NADPH.

[[Cyanobacteria]] have three possible pathways through which they can metabolise 2-phosphoglycolate. They are unable to grow if all three pathways are knocked out, despite having a carbon concentrating mechanism that should dramatically reduce the rate of photorespiration [[#Biological adaptation to minimize photorespiration|(see below)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Eisenhut | first1 = M. | last2 = Ruth | first2 = W. | last3 = Haimovich | first3 = M. | last4 = Bauwe | first4 = H. | last5 = Kaplan | first5 = A. | last6 = Hagemann | first6 = M. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0807043105 | title = The photorespiratory glycolate metabolism is essential for cyanobacteria and might have been conveyed endosymbiontically to plants | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 105 | issue = 44 | pages = 17199–204 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18957552| pmc = 2579401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substrate specificity of RuBisCO==
The oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle reaction is [[catalyst|catalyzed]] by [[RuBisCO|RuBP oxygenase]] activity:

:[[Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate|RuBP]] + {{chem|O|2}} &amp;rarr; Phosphoglycolate + [[Glycerate 3-phosphate|3-phosphoglycerate]] + 2{{chem|H|+}}

[[File:RuBisCO reaction O2.svg|thumb|350px|Oxygenase activity of RuBisCO]]
During the catalysis by RuBisCO, an 'activated' intermediate is formed (an enediol intermediate) in the RuBisCO active site. This intermediate is able to react with either {{chem|CO|2}} or {{chem|O|2}}. It has been demonstrated that the specific shape of the RuBisCO active site acts to encourage reactions with {{chem|CO|2}}. Although there is a significant "failure" rate (~25% of reactions are oxygenation rather than carboxylation), this represents significant favouring of {{chem|CO|2}}, when the relative abundance of the two gases is taken into account: in the current atmosphere, {{chem|O|2}} is approximately 500 times more abundant, and in solution {{chem|O|2}} is 25 times more abundant than {{chem|CO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2006"&gt;Griffiths, H. (2006). Designs on Rubisco" ''Nature'' 441(7096), 940–941. Retrieved from http://www.rsbs.anu.edu.au/profiles/graham_farquhar/documents/233TcherkezPNASNaturecommentary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The ability of RuBisCO to specify between the two gases is known as its selectivity factor (or Srel), and it varies between species,&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2006"/&gt; with angiosperms more efficient than other plants, but with little variation among the [[vascular plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Ehleringer 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ehleringer, J. R. |author2=Sage, R. F. |author3=Flanagan, L. B. |author4=Pearcy, R. W. |year=1991 |title=Climate change and the evolution of {{C4}} photosynthesis |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=95–99 |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/0169-5347(91)90183-X |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(91)90183-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A suggested explanation into RuBisCO's inability to discriminate completely between {{chem|CO|2}} and {{chem|O|2}} is that it is an evolutionary relic:{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The early atmosphere in which primitive plants originated contained very little oxygen, the early evolution of [[RuBisCO]] was not influenced by its ability to discriminate between {{chem|O|2}} and {{chem|CO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Ehleringer 1991"/&gt;

==Conditions which effect photorespiration==
Photorespiration rates are increased by:

===Altered substrate availability: lowered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or increased O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
Factors which influence this include the atmospheric abundance of the two gases, the supply of the gases to the site of fixation (i.e. in land plants: whether the [[stomata]] are open or closed), the length of the liquid phase (how far these gases have to diffuse through water in order to reach the reaction site). For example, when the stomata are closed to prevent water loss during [[drought]]: this limits the {{CO2}} supply, while {{chem|O|2}} production within the leaf will continue. In algae (and plants which photosynthesise underwater); gases have to diffuse significant distances through water, which results in a decrease in the availability of {{CO2}} relative to {{chem|O|2}}. It has been predicted that the increase in [[wikt:ambient|ambient]] {{CO2}} concentrations predicted over the next 100 years may reduce the rate of photorespiration in [[C3 carbon fixation|most plants]] by around 50%{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}.

===Increased temperature===
At higher temperatures RuBisCO is less able to discriminate between {{CO2}} and {{chem|O|2}}. This is because the enediol intermediate is less stable. Increasing temperatures also reduce the solubility of {{CO2}}, thus reducing the concentration of {{CO2}} relative to {{chem|O|2}} in the [[chloroplast]].

==Biological adaptation to minimize photorespiration==
Certain species of plants or [[algae]] have mechanisms to reduce uptake of molecular oxygen by RuBisCO. These are commonly referred to as [[Photosynthesis#Carbon concentrating mechanisms|Carbon Concentrating Mechanisms]] (CCMs), as they increase the concentration of {{chem|link=CO2|CO|2}} so that RuBisCO is less likely to produce glycolate through reaction with {{chem|O|2}}.

===Biochemical carbon concentrating mechanisms===
Biochemical CCMs concentrate carbon dioxide in one temporal or spatial region, through [[metabolite]] exchange. C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CAM photosynthesis both use the enzyme [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase]] (PEPC) to add {{chem|CO|2}} to a 3-Carbon sugar. PEPC is faster than RuBisCO, and more selective for {{chem|CO|2}}.

====C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;====
[[File:Field, corn, Liechtenstein, Mountains, Alps, Vaduz, sky, clouds, landscape.jpg|thumb|Maize uses the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pathway, minimizing photorespiration.]]
[[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] plants capture carbon dioxide in their mesophyll cells (using an enzyme called [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase]] which catalyzes the combination of carbon dioxide with a compound called phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)), forming oxaloacetate. This oxaloacetate is then converted to malate and is transported into the bundle sheath cells (site of carbon dioxide fixation by RuBisCO) where [[oxygen]] concentration is low to avoid photorespiration. Here, carbon dioxide is removed from the malate and combined with RuBP by RuBisCO in the usual way, and the [[Calvin Cycle]] proceeds as normal. The {{chem|CO|2}} concentrations in the Bundle Sheath are approximately 10–20 fold higher than the concentration in the mesophyll cells.&lt;ref name="Ehleringer 1991" /&gt;

This ability to avoid photorespiration makes these plants more hardy than other plants in dry and hot environments, wherein stomata are closed and internal carbon dioxide levels are low. Under these conditions, photorespiration does occur in C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants, but at a much reduced level compared with C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants in the same conditions. C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants include [[sugar cane]], [[maize|corn (maize)]], and [[sorghum]].

====CAM (Crassulacean acid metabolism)====
[[File:CAMplantgraph.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Overnight graph of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbed by a CAM plant]]
CAM plants, such as [[cacti]] and [[succulent plant]]s, also use the enzyme PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide, but only at night. [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]] allows plants to conduct most of their gas exchange in the cooler night-time air, sequestering carbon in 4-carbon sugars which can be released to the photosynthesizing cells during the day. This allows CAM plants to reduce water loss ([[transpiration]]) by maintaining closed stomata during the day. CAM plants usually display other water-saving characteristics, such as thick cuticles, stomata with small apertures, and typically lose around 1/3 of the amount of water per {{chem|CO|2}} fixed.&lt;ref&gt;''Plant Physiology'', Fifth Edition - Sinauer Associates, Inc. Taiz and Zeiger. 2010. Chapter 8, Page 222&lt;/ref&gt;

====Algae====
There have been some reports of algae operating a biochemical CCM: shuttling metabolites within single cells to concentrate {{CO2}} in one area. This process is not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Biophysical carbon-concentrating mechanisms===
This type of carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) relies on a contained compartment within the cell into which {{CO2}} is shuttled, and where RuBisCO is highly expressed. In many species, biophysical CCMs are only induced under low carbon dioxide concentrations. Biophysical CCMs are more evolutionarily ancient than biochemical CCMs. There is some debate as to when biophysical CCMs first evolved, but it is likely to have been during a period of low carbon dioxide, after the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] (2.4 billion years ago). Low {{chem|CO|2}} periods occurred around 750, 650, and 320–270 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Raven | first1 = J.

====Eukaryotic algae====
In nearly all species of [[Algae|eukaryotic algae]] (''[[Chloromonas]]'' being one notable exception), upon induction of the CCM, ~95% of RuBisCO is densely packed into a single subcellular compartment: the [[pyrenoid]]. Carbon dioxide is concentrated in this compartment using a combination of {{CO2}} pumps, [[Carbonic acid|bicarbonate]] pumps, and [[carbonic anhydrase]]s. The pyrenoid is not a membrane bound compartment, but is found within the chloroplast, often surrounded by a starch sheath (which is not thought to serve a function in the CCM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Villarejo | first1 = A. | last2 = Martinez | first2 = F. | last3 = Pino Plumed | first3 = M. | last4 = Ramazanov | first4 = Z. | title = The induction of the {{CO2}} concentrating mechanism in a starch-less mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3054.1996.tb06687.x | journal = Physiologia Plantarum | volume = 98 | issue = 4 | pages = 798–802 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hornworts====
Certain species of [[hornwort]] are the only land plants which are known to have a biophysical CCM involving concentration of carbon dioxide within [[Pyrenoid|pyrenoids]] in their chloroplasts.

====Cyanobacteria====
[[Cyanobacteria]]l CCMs are similar in principle to those found in eukaryotic algae and hornworts, but the compartment into which carbon dioxide is concentrated has several structural differences. Instead of the pyrenoid, cyanobacteria contain [[carboxysome]]s, which have a protein shell, and linker proteins packing RuBisCO inside with a very regular structure.
Cyanobacterial CCMs are much better understood than those found in [[eukaryote]]s, partly due to the ease of genetic manipulation of [[prokaryote]]s.

==Possible purpose of photorespiration==
Reducing photorespiration may not result in increased growth rates for plants. Photorespiration may be necessary for the assimilation of nitrate from soil. Thus, a reduction in photorespiration by genetic engineering or because of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (due to fossil fuel burning) may not benefit plants as has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rachmilevitch S, Cousins AB, Bloom AJ |title=Nitrate assimilation in plant shoots depends on photorespiration |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.&lt;!-- to "US" per [[WP:NOTUSA]]? --&gt; |volume=101 |issue=31 |pages=11506–10 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15272076 |pmc=509230 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0404388101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several physiological processes may be responsible for linking photorespiration and nitrogen assimilation. Photorespiration increases availability of NADH, which is required for the conversion of [[nitrate]] to [[nitrite]]. Certain nitrite transporters also transport [[bicarbonate]], and elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been shown to suppress nitrite transport into chloroplasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bloom | first1 = A.

Although photorespiration is greatly reduced in C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; species, it is still an essential pathway{{snd}}mutants without functioning 2-phosphoglycolate metabolism cannot grow in normal conditions. One mutant was shown to rapidly accumulate glycolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zabaleta | first1 = E. | last2 = Martin | first2 = M. V. | last3 = Braun | first3 = H.

Although the functions of photorespiration remain controversial,&lt;ref name="Foyer"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Foyer, C. H. |author2=Bloom, A. J. |author3=Queval, G. |author4=Noctor, G. |year=2009|title=Photorespiratory Metabolism: Genes, Mutants, Energetics, and Redox Signaling|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|volume=60|issue=1|pages=455–484|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.091948|doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.091948|pmid=19575589}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is widely accepted that this pathway influences a wide range of processes from bioenergetics, photosystem II function, and carbon metabolism to nitrogen assimilation and respiration. The photorespiratory pathway is a major source of [[hydrogen peroxide]] ({{chem|H|2|O|2}}) in photosynthetic cells. Through {{chem|H|2|O|2}} production and pyrimidine nucleotide interactions, photorespiration makes a key contribution to cellular redox homeostasis. In so doing, it influences multiple signalling pathways, in particular, those that govern plant hormonal responses controlling growth, environmental and defense responses, and programmed cell death.&lt;ref name="Foyer"/&gt;

Another theory postulates that it may function as a "safety valve",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stuhlfauth, t. |author2=Scheuermann, R |author3=Fock, H. P. |year= 1990|title=Light Energy Dissipation under Water Stress Conditions|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=92|pages=1053–1061|pmc=1062415|doi=10.1104/pp.92.4.1053|pmid=16667370|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; preventing the excess of reductive potential coming from an overreduced [[NADPH]]-pool from reacting with oxygen and producing [[free radicals]], as these can damage the metabolic functions of the cell by subsequent oxidation of membrane lipids, proteins or nucleotides.

A '''pulsar''' (from ''pulse'' and ''-ar'' as in [[quasar]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pulsar|title=Definition of PULSAR|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a highly magnetized rotating [[neutron star]] that emits a beam of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. This radiation can be observed only when the beam of emission is pointing toward Earth (much like the way a [[lighthouse]] can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer), and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. Neutron stars are very [[density|dense]], and have short, regular rotational [[Period (physics)|period]]s. This produces a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. Pulsars are believed to be one of the candidates for the source of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s (see also [[centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]).

The periods of pulsars make them very useful tools. Observations of a pulsar in a [[PSR B1913+16|binary neutron star system]] were used to indirectly confirm the existence of [[gravitational wave|gravitational radiation]]. The first [[exoplanet|extrasolar planet]]s were discovered around a pulsar, [[PSR B1257+12]]. Certain types of pulsars rival [[atomic clock]]s in their accuracy in keeping time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/09/us/pulsar-termed-most-accurate-clock-in-sky.html|title=PULSAR TERMED MOST ACCURATE 'CLOCK' IN SKY|last=Sullivan|first=Walter|publisher=The New York Times|website=NY Times|date=February 9, 1983|access-date=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[PSR B1919+21|first pulsar]] was observed on November 28, 1967, by [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]] and [[Antony Hewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Pranab Ghosh, ''Rotation and accretion powered pulsars''. World Scientific, 2007, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Longair, ''Our evolving universe''. CUP Archive, 1996, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Longair, ''High energy astrophysics, Volume 2''. Cambridge University Press, 1994, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; They observed pulses separated by 1.33 seconds that originated from the same location in the sky, and kept to [[sidereal time]]. In looking for explanations for the pulses, the short period of the pulses eliminated most astrophysical sources of radiation, such as [[star]]s, and since the pulses followed [[Sidereal_time|sidereal time]], it could not be man-made [[radio frequency interference]]. When observations with another telescope confirmed the emission, it eliminated any sort of instrumental effects. At this point, Bell Burnell said of herself and Hewish that "we did not really believe that we had picked up signals from another civilization, but obviously the idea had crossed our minds and we had no proof that it was an entirely natural radio emission. It is an interesting problem—if one thinks one may have detected life elsewhere in the universe, how does one announce the results responsibly?"&lt;ref name="cosmic_search"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Even so, they nicknamed the signal  '''LGM-1''', for "[[little green men]]" (a playful name for intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|beings of extraterrestrial origin]]). It was not until a second pulsating source was discovered in a different part of the sky that the "LGM hypothesis" was entirely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 23 April 2004 | volume = 304 | issue = 5670 | page = 489 | author = Bell Burnell, S.

Although CP 1919 emits in [[radio waves|radio wavelengths]], pulsars have subsequently been found to emit in visible light, [[X-ray]], and [[gamma ray]] wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;Courtland, Rachel.

The word "pulsar" is a portmanteau of 'pulsating' and '[[quasar]]', and first appeared in print in 1968:

{{quote|An entirely novel kind of star came to light on Aug. 6 last year and was referred to, by astronomers, as LGM (Little Green Men). Now it is thought to be a novel type between a white dwarf and a neutron [star]. The name Pulsar is likely to be given to it. Dr. A. Hewish told me yesterday: "… I am sure that today every radio telescope is looking at the Pulsars."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph,'' 21/3, 5 March 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The existence of neutron stars was first proposed by [[Walter Baade]] and [[Fritz Zwicky]] in 1934, when they argued that a small, dense star consisting primarily of neutrons would result from a [[supernova]].&lt;ref name="Baade1934"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.46.76.2| title = Remarks on Super-Novae and Cosmic Rays| year = 1934| last1 = Baade | first1 = W.| last2 = Zwicky | first2 = F.| journal = Physical Review| volume = 46| pages = 76|bibcode = 1934PhRv...46...76B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the idea of magnetic flux conservation from magnetic main sequence stars, [[Lodewijk Woltjer]] proposed in 1964 that such neutron stars might contain magnetic fields as large as 10^14 to 10^16 G.&lt;ref name="Woltjer1964"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Woltjer | first1 = L. | title = X-rays and Type I Supernovae | doi = 10.1086/148028 | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 140 | issue = | pages = 1309 | year = 1964 | pmid = | pmc = | bibcode = 1964ApJ...140.1309W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, shortly before the discovery of pulsars, [[Franco Pacini]] suggested that a rotating neutron star with a magnetic field would emit radiation, and even noted that such energy could be pumped into a [[supernova remnant]] around a neutron star, such as the [[Crab Nebula]].&lt;ref name="Pacini1968"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pacini | first1 = F. | title = Energy Emission from a Neutron Star | doi = 10.1038/216567a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 216 | issue = 5115 | pages = 567 | year = 1967 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1967Natur.216..567P }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of the first pulsar, [[Thomas Gold]] independently suggested a rotating neutron star model similar to that of Pacini, and explicitly argued that this model could explain the pulsed radiation observed by Bell Burnell and Hewish.&lt;ref name="Gold1968"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Gold | first1 = T.| title = Rotating Neutron Stars as the Origin of the Pulsating Radio Sources| journal = Nature| volume = 218| pages = 731| year = 1968| doi = 10.1038/218731a0| bibcode=1968Natur.218..731G | issue=5143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the [[Crab pulsar]] later in 1968 seemed to provide confirmation of the rotating neutron star model of pulsars. The Crab pulsar has a 33-[[millisecond]] pulse period, which was too short to be consistent with other proposed models for pulsar emission. Moreover, the Crab pulsar is so named because it is located at the center of the [[Crab Nebula]], consistent with the 1933 prediction of Baade and Zwicky.&lt;ref name="Lyne1998_pp1-7"&gt;Lyne &amp; Graham-Smith, pp. 1–7 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Antony Hewish and [[Martin Ryle]] became the first astronomers to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], with the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] noting that Hewish played a "decisive role in the discovery of pulsars".&lt;ref name="nobel1974"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1974/press.html | title= Press Release: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1974 | accessdate= 2014-01-19 | date = 15 October 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable controversy is associated with the fact that Hewish was awarded the prize while Bell, who made the initial discovery while she was his Ph.D student, was not. Bell claims no bitterness upon this point, supporting the decision of the Nobel prize committee.&lt;ref&gt;Bell Burnell, S. Jocelyn. Little Green Men, White Dwarfs, or Pulsars?

[[Image:Vela Pulsar jet.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Vela Pulsar]] and its surrounding [[pulsar wind nebula]].]]
In 1974, [[Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.]] and [[Russell Hulse]] discovered for the first time a pulsar in a [[binary star|binary system]], [[PSR B1913+16]]. This pulsar orbits another neutron star with an orbital period of just eight hours. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that this system should emit strong [[gravitational radiation]], causing the orbit to continually contract as it loses [[orbital energy]]. Observations of the pulsar soon confirmed this prediction, providing the first ever evidence of the existence of gravitational waves. As of 2010, observations of this pulsar continue to agree with general relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Timing measurements of the relativistic binary pulsar PSR B1913+ 16

In 1982, [[Don Backer]] led a group which discovered [[PSR B1937+21]], a pulsar with a rotation period of just 1.6 milliseconds (38,500 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D. Backer | title = A millisecond pulsar | journal = Nature | volume = 300 | issue = 5893 | pages = 315–318 | date = 1982 | doi = 10.1038/300615a0|bibcode = 1982Natur.300..615B | last2 = Kulkarni | first2 = Shrinivas R. | last3 = Heiles | first3 = Carl | last4 = Davis | first4 = M. M. | last5 = Goss | first5 = W. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations soon revealed that its magnetic field was much weaker than ordinary pulsars, while further discoveries cemented the idea that a new class of object, the "[[millisecond pulsar]]s" (MSPs) had been found. MSPs are believed to be the end product of [[X-ray binary|X-ray binaries]]. Owing to their extraordinarily rapid and stable rotation, MSPs can be used by [[astronomers]] as clocks rivaling the stability of the best [[atomic clocks]] on Earth. Factors affecting the arrival time of pulses at Earth by more than a few hundred [[nanosecond]]s can be easily detected and used to make precise measurements. Physical parameters accessible through pulsar timing include the 3D position of the pulsar, its [[proper motion]], the [[electron]] content of the [[interstellar medium]] along the propagation path, the orbital parameters of any binary companion, the pulsar rotation period and its evolution with time. (These are computed from the raw timing data by [[Tempo (astronomy)|Tempo]], a computer program specialized for this task.) After these factors have been taken into account, deviations between the observed arrival times and predictions made using these parameters can be found and attributed to one of three possibilities: intrinsic variations in the spin period of the pulsar, errors in the realization of [[Terrestrial Time]] against which arrival times were measured, or the presence of background gravitational waves. Scientists are currently attempting to resolve these possibilities by comparing the deviations seen between several different pulsars, forming what is known as a [[pulsar timing array]]. The goal of these efforts is to develop a pulsar-based [[time standard]] precise enough to make the first ever direct detection of gravitational waves.
In June 2006, the astronomer [[John Middleditch]] and his team at [[LANL]] announced the first prediction of [[Glitch (astronomy)|pulsar glitches]] with observational data from the [[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]]. They used observations of the pulsar [[PSR J0537-6910]].

In 1992, [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] discovered the first [[extrasolar planet]]s around [[PSR B1257+12]]. This discovery presented important evidence concerning the widespread existence of planets outside the [[Solar System]], although it is very unlikely that any [[organism|life form]] could survive in the environment of intense radiation near a pulsar.

In 2016, [[AR Scorpii]] was identified as the first pulsar in which the compact object is a white dwarf instead of a neutron star.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buckley|first=D. A.

==Nomenclature==
Initially pulsars were named with letters of the discovering observatory followed by their [[right ascension]] (e.g. CP 1919). As more pulsars were discovered, the letter code became unwieldy, and so the convention then arose of using the letters PSR (Pulsating Source of Radio) followed by the pulsar's right ascension and degrees of [[declination]] (e.g. PSR 0531+21) and sometimes declination to a tenth of a degree (e.g. PSR 1913+16.7). Pulsars appearing very close together sometimes have letters appended (e.g. PSR 0021-72C and PSR 0021-72D).

The modern convention prefixes the older numbers with a B (e.g. PSR B1919+21), with the B meaning the coordinates are for the 1950.0 epoch. All new pulsars have a J indicating 2000.0 coordinates and also have declination including minutes (e.g. PSR J1921+2153). Pulsars that were discovered before 1993 tend to retain their B names rather than use their J names (e.g. PSR J1921+2153 is more commonly known as PSR B1919+21). Recently discovered pulsars only have a J name (e.g. [[PSR J0437-4715]]). All pulsars have a J name that provides more precise coordinates of its location in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Lyne, Andrew G.; Graham-Smith, Francis. ''Pulsar Astronomy.''

[[Image:Pulsar schematic.svg|thumb|right|200px|Schematic view of a pulsar. The sphere in the middle represents the neutron star, the curves indicate the magnetic field lines, the protruding cones represent the emission beams and the green line represents the axis on which the star rotates.]]
The events leading to the formation of a pulsar begin when the core of a massive star is compressed during a [[supernova]], which collapses into a neutron star. The neutron star retains most of its [[angular momentum]], and since it has only a tiny fraction of its progenitor's radius (and therefore its [[moment of inertia]] is sharply reduced), it is formed with very high rotation speed. A beam of [[radiation]] is emitted along the magnetic axis of the pulsar, which spins along with the rotation of the neutron star.  The magnetic axis of the pulsar determines the direction of the electromagnetic beam, with the magnetic axis not necessarily being the same as its rotational axis. This misalignment causes the beam to be seen once for every rotation of the neutron star, which leads to the "pulsed" nature of its appearance.

In rotation-powered pulsars, the beam originates from the [[rotational energy]] of the neutron star, which generates an electrical field from the movement of the very strong magnetic field, resulting in the acceleration of protons and electrons on the star surface and the creation of an electromagnetic beam emanating from the poles of the magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www3.amherst.edu/~gsgreenstein/progs/animations/pulsar_beacon/ | title = Pulsar Beacon Animation | accessdate = 2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/pulsars.html | title = Pulsars | accessdate = 2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rotation slows down over time as [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] power is emitted.  When a pulsar's spin period slows down sufficiently, the radio pulsar mechanism is believed to turn off (the so-called "death line").  This turn-off seems to take place after about 10–100 million years, which means of all the neutron stars born in the 13.6 billion year age of the universe, around 99% no longer pulsate.&lt;ref name="cv.nrao.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/Pulsars.html|title=Pulsars|website=www.cv.nrao.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the general picture of pulsars as rapidly rotating neutron stars is widely accepted, Werner Becker of the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] said in 2006, "The theory of how pulsars emit their radiation is still in its infancy, even after nearly forty years of work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMB6IBUQPE_index_0.html |title= Old Pulsars Still Have New Tricks to Teach Us |publisher=[[European Space Agency|ESA]] |date=26 July 2006 |accessdate=30 April 2013|work=Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Three distinct classes of pulsars are currently known to [[astronomer]]s,  according to the source of the power of the electromagnetic radiation:

*Rotation-powered pulsars, where the loss of rotational energy of the star provides the power,
*[[Accretion-powered pulsar]]s (accounting for most but not all [[X-ray pulsar]]s), where the [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|gravitational potential energy]] of [[accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] matter is the power source (producing X-rays that are observable from the Earth).
*[[Magnetar]]s, where the decay of an extremely strong [[magnetic field]] provides the electromagnetic power.

Although all three classes of objects are neutron stars, their observable behavior and the underlying physics are quite different. There are, however, connections. For example, [[X-ray pulsar]]s are probably old rotationally-powered pulsars that have already lost most of their power, and have only become visible again after their [[binary star|binary companion]]s had expanded and began transferring matter on to the neutron star. The process of accretion can in turn transfer enough [[angular momentum]] to the neutron star to "recycle" it as a rotation-powered [[millisecond pulsar]]. As this matter lands on the neutron star, it is thought to "bury" the magnetic field of the neutron star (although the details are unclear), leaving millisecond pulsars with magnetic fields 1000-10,000 times weaker than average pulsars. This low magnetic field is less effective at slowing the pulsar's rotation, so millisecond pulsars live for billions of years, making them the oldest known pulsars.  Millisecond pulsars are seen in globular clusters, which stopped forming neutron stars billions of years ago.&lt;ref name="cv.nrao.edu"/&gt;

Of interest to the study of the state of the matter in a neutron
star are the ''[[Glitch (astronomy)|glitches]]'' observed in the rotation velocity
of the neutron star. This velocity is decreasing slowly but steadily, except by sudden variations. One model put forward to explain these glitches is that they are the result of "starquakes" that adjust the crust of the neutron star. Models where the glitch is due to a decoupling of the possibly [[superconductivity|superconducting]] interior of the star have also been advanced. In both cases, the star's [[moment of inertia]] changes, but its [[angular momentum]] does not, resulting in a change in rotation rate.

===Disrupted recycled pulsar===
When two massive stars are born close together from the same cloud of gas, they can form a binary system and orbit each other from birth. If those two stars are at least a few times as massive as our sun, their lives will both end in supernova explosions. The more massive star explodes first, leaving behind a neutron star. If the explosion does not kick the second star away, the binary system survives. The neutron star can now be visible as a radio pulsar, and it slowly loses energy and spins down. Later, the second star can swell up, allowing the neutron star to suck up its matter. The matter falling onto the neutron star spins it up and reduces its magnetic field. This is called "recycling" because it returns the neutron star to a quickly-spinning state. Finally, the second star also explodes in a supernova, producing another neutron star. If this second explosion also fails to disrupt the binary, a double neutron star binary is formed. Otherwise, the spun-up neutron star is left with no companion and becomes a "disrupted recycled pulsar", spinning between a few and 50 times per second.&lt;ref&gt;Background material on "Disrupted Recycled Pulsar" in press release on the pulsar found by Einstein@Home {{cite web |url=http://www.aei.mpg.de/pdf/pm_news/2010/PM2010_Einstein_Home_pulsar_engl.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814144713/http://www.aei.mpg.de/pdf/pm_news/2010/PM2010_Einstein_Home_pulsar_engl.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

The discovery of pulsars allowed astronomers to study an object never observed before, the [[neutron star]]. This kind of object is the only place where the behavior of matter at [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] density can be observed (though not directly). Also, millisecond pulsars have allowed a test of [[general relativity]] in conditions of an intense gravitational field.

===Maps===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque sun.svg|thumb|Relative position of the [[Sun]] to the center of the [[Galaxy]] and 14 pulsars with their periods denoted]]
Pulsar maps have been included on the two [[Pioneer Plaque]]s as well as the [[Voyager Golden Record]]. They show the position of the [[Sun]], relative to 14 pulsars, which are identified by the unique timing of their electromagnetic pulses, so that our position both in space and in time can be calculated by potential [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] intelligences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/goldenrec1.html|title=Voyager - The Spacecraft|website=voyager.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because pulsars are emitting very regular pulses of radio waves, its radio transmissions do not require daily corrections. Moreover, pulsar positioning could create a spacecraft navigation system independently, or be used in conjunction with satellite navigation.&lt;ref&gt;Marissa Cevallos, Science News,"HOW TO USE A PULSAR TO FIND STARBUCKS"[http://news.discovery.com/space/pulsar-navigation-gps-space.html], Discovery News,Wed Nov 24, 2010 10:21 AM ET .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Angelo Tartaglia|author2=Matteo Luca Ruggiero|author3=Emiliano Capolongo|doi=10.1016/j.asr.2010.10.023|journal=Advances in Space Research |volume=47|title=A null frame for spacetime positioning by means of pulsating sources|issue=4|pages=645–653|date=2011|arxiv=1001.1068|bibcode = 2011AdSpR..47..645T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precise clocks===

Generally, the regularity of pulsar emission does not rival the stability of [[atomic clocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Colloquium: Comparison of Astrophysical and Terrestrial Frequency Standards

''Timing noise'' is the name for rotational irregularities observed in all pulsars.  This timing noise is observable as random wandering in the pulse frequency or phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saao.ac.za/~wgssa/as4/urama.html|title=African Skies 4 – Radio Pulsar Glitch Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unknown whether timing noise is related to pulsar [[Glitch (astronomy)|glitches]].

===Probes of the interstellar medium===
The radiation from pulsars passes through the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) before reaching Earth. Free [[electron]]s in the warm (8000&amp;nbsp;K), ionized component of the ISM and [[H II region]]s affect the radiation in two primary ways. The resulting changes to the pulsar's radiation provide an important probe of the ISM itself.&lt;ref name=Ferriere&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ferrière |first1=Katia |title=The Interstellar Environment of Our Galaxy |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=1031–1066 |date=2001 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.73.1031|arxiv = astro-ph/0106359 |bibcode = 2001RvMP...73.1031F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersive]] nature of the interstellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], lower-frequency radio waves travel through the medium slower than higher-frequency radio waves. The resulting delay in the arrival of pulses at a range of frequencies is directly measurable as the ''[[dispersion measure]]'' of the pulsar. The dispersion measure is the total [[column density]] of free electrons between the observer and the pulsar,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{DM} = \int_0^D n_e(s) ds,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the pulsar to the observer and &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron density of the ISM. The dispersion measure is used to construct models of the free electron distribution in the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taylor, J. H. |author2=Cordes, J. M. | bibcode=1993ApJ...411..674T |title=Pulsar Distances and the Galactic Distribution of Free Electrons |doi=10.1086/172870 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=411 |date=1993 |page=674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[turbulence]] in the interstellar gas causes density inhomogeneities in the ISM which cause [[scattering]] of the radio waves from the pulsar. The resulting [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]] of the radio waves—the same effect as the twinkling of a star in [[visible light]] due to density variations in the Earth's atmosphere—can be used to reconstruct information about the small scale variations in the ISM.&lt;ref name=Rickett&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rickett, Barney J. |bibcode=1990ARA&amp;A..28..561R |title=Radio Propagation Through the Turbulent Interstellar Plasma |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=28 |date=1990 |pages=561–605|doi = 10.1146/annurev.aa.28.090190.003021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high  velocity (up to several hundred km/s) of many pulsars, a single pulsar scans the ISM rapidly, which results in changing scintillation patterns over timescales of a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rickett, Barney J. |author2=Lyne, Andrew G. |author3=Gupta, Yashwant |bibcode=1997MNRAS.287..739R |title=Interstellar Fringes from Pulsar B0834+06 |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=287 |date=1997 |pages=739–752|doi=10.1093/mnras/287.4.739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probes of space-time===
Pulsars orbiting within the curved [[space-time]] around [[Sagittarius A*|Sgr A*]], the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of the Milky Way, could serve as probes of gravity in the strong-field regime.&lt;ref name="saha10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Angelil | first1 = R. | last2 = Saha | first2 = P. | last3 = Merritt | first3 = D. | author3-link = David Merritt | title = Towards relativistic orbit fitting of Galactic center stars and pulsars | arxiv = 1007.0007 | date=2010 | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/720/2/1303 | volume=720 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | pages=1303–1310 | bibcode=2010ApJ...720.1303A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrival times of the pulses would be affected by [[special relativity|special]]- and [[general relativity|general-relativistic]] [[Doppler shift]]s and by the complicated paths that the radio waves would travel through the strongly curved space-time around the black hole. In order for the effects of general relativity [[Tests of general relativity|to be measurable]] with current instruments, pulsars with orbital periods less than about 10 years would need to be discovered;&lt;ref name=saha10/&gt; such pulsars would orbit at distances inside 0.01 pc from Sgr A*.  Searches are currently underway; at present, five pulsars are known to lie within 100 pc from Sgr A*.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Deneva | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Cordes | first2 = J.

===Gravitational waves detectors===
There are 3 consortia around the world which use pulsars to search for [[gravitational waves]]. In Europe, there is the [[European Pulsar Timing Array]] (EPTA); there is the [[Parkes Pulsar Timing Array]] (PPTA) in Australia; and there is the [[North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves]] (NANOGrav) in Canada and the US.  Together, the consortia form the [[International Pulsar Timing Array]] (IPTA).  The pulses from [[Millisecond Pulsars]] (MSPs) are used as a system of Galactic clocks. Disturbances in the clocks will be measurable at Earth. A disturbance from a passing gravitational wave will have a particular signature across the ensemble of pulsars, and will be thus detected.

'''Secularization''' (or '''secularisation''')&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?q=Secularisation&amp;tbm=bks occurrences] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the transformation of a society from close identification and affiliation with religious values and institutions toward nonreligious values and [[secular]] institutions. The ''secularization thesis'' refers to the [[belief]] that as societies progress, particularly through [[modernization]] and [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], religion loses its authority in all aspects of social life and governance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051208002707/http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~pnorris/ACROBAT/Sacred_and_Secular/Chapter%201.pdf "The Secularization Debate"], chapter 1 (pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dto-P2YfWJIC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22The+Secularization+Debate%22 3]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=dto-P2YfWJIC&amp;pg=PA32 32]) of {{cite book|first1=Pippa |last1=Norris |authorlink1=Pippa Norris |first2=Ronald |last2=Inglehart |authorlink2=Ronald Inglehart |title=Sacred and Secular.

Secularization refers to the historical process in which religion loses social and cultural significance. As a result of secularization the role of religion in modern societies becomes restricted. In secularized societies faith lacks cultural authority, and religious organizations have little social power.

Secularization has many levels of meaning, both as a [[theory]] and a historical process. Social theorists such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Émile Durkheim]], postulated that the modernization of society would include a decline in levels of [[religiosity]]. Study of this process seeks to determine the manner in which, or extent to which religious creeds, practices and institutions are losing social significance. Some theorists argue that the secularization of modern civilization partly results from our inability to adapt broad ethical and spiritual needs of mankind to the increasingly fast advance of the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=472 text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615170139/http://religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=472 |date=2010-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the “modernization” thesis, Christian Smith and others argue that secularization is promoted by intellectual and cultural elites to enhance their own status and influence. Smith believes intellectuals have an inherent tendency to be hostile to their native cultures, causing them to embrace secularism.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Christian. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IbEwDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=info:paCf6RiVs7IJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;ots=F45PpKyvo0&amp;sig=Vn0tlVvnEiybdq2_KmevWlfig-c#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also has additional meanings, primarily historical and religious.&lt;ref&gt;Casanova, Jose (1994).  ''Public Religions in the Modern World''.  University of Chicago Press, pg. 13. {{ISBN|0-226-09535-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Applied to [[Secularization (church property)|church property]], historically it refers to the seizure of monastic lands and buildings, such as [[Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in England and the later acts during the [[French Revolution]] as well as by various [[anti-clerical]] European governments during the 18th and 19th centuries, which resulted in the expulsion and suppression of the religious communities which occupied them. The 19th-century ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' in Germany and Switzerland and similar events in many other countries also were expressions of secularization.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Andrew in: ''Origins of Liberal Dominance: State, Church, and Party in Nineteenth-century Europe'', University of Michigan Press, 1999, p. 82, {{ISBN|978-0-472-11015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still another form of Secularization refers to the act of [[Prince-Bishop]]s or holders of a position in a [[Monastic order|Monastic]] or [[Military order (society)|Military Order]] - holding a combined religious and secular authority under the Catholic Church - who broke away and made themselves into completely secular (typically, [[Protestant]]) hereditary rulers. For example, [[Gotthard Kettler]], the last Master of the [[Livonian Order]], converted to [[Lutheranism]],  secularised (and took to himself) the lands of [[Semigallia]] and [[Courland]] which he had held on behalf of the order - which enabled him to marry and leave to his descendants the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]].

In the 1960s there was a shift toward secularization in Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. This transformation was intertwined with major social factors: economic prosperity, youth rebelling against the rules and conventions of society, women's liberation, radical theology, and radical politics.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Cox, "Secularization and other master narratives of religion in modern Europe." ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte'' (2001): 24-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Secularization is sometimes credited both to the cultural shifts in society following the emergence of [[rationality]] and the development of [[science]] as a substitute for [[superstition]]—[[Max Weber]] called this process the "disenchantment of the world"—and to the changes made by religious institutions to compensate. At the most basic stages, this begins with a slow transition from [[oral tradition]]s to a writing culture that diffuses knowledge. This first reduces the authority of clerics as the custodians of revealed knowledge. As the responsibility for [[education]] has moved from the family and community to the [[Sovereign state|state]], two consequences have arisen:
* ''Collective conscience'' as defined by [[Durkheim]] is diminished
* Fragmentation of communal activities leads to religion becoming more a matter of individual choice rather than an observed social obligation.
A major issue in the study of secularization is the extent to which certain trends such as decreased attendance at places of worship indicate a decrease in religiosity or simply a privatization of religious belief, where religious beliefs no longer play a dominant role in public life or in other aspects of decision making.

The issue of secularization is discussed in various religious traditions. The government of [[Turkey]] is an often cited{{By whom|date=July 2012}} example, following the abolition of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Caliphate]] and foundation of the Turkish republic in 1923. This established popular sovereignty in a secular republican framework, in opposition to a system whose authority is based on religion. As one of many examples of state modernization, this shows secularization and democratization as mutually reinforcing processes {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. USSR, North Korea, and Cuba could be counterexamples to the previous claim|date=November 2010}}, relying on a separation of religion and state. In expressly secular states like [[India]], it has been argued{{By whom|date=July 2012}} that the need was to legislate for toleration and respect between quite different religions, and likewise, the secularization of the West was a response to drastically violent intra-Christian feuds between [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} have therefore argued that Western and Indian secularization is radically different in that it deals with [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] from religious regulation and control. Considerations of both tolerance and autonomy are relevant to any secular state.{{Citation needed|reason=this is a generalised statement.  Are these considerations really relevant to *all* secular states?|date=July 2012}}

==Definitions==
[[C. John Sommerville]] (1998) outlined six uses of the term secularization in the scientific literature. The first five are more along the lines of 'definitions' while the sixth is more of a 'clarification of use':&lt;ref&gt;Somerville, C. J. "Secular Society Religious Population: Our Tacit Rules for Using the Term Secularization''. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 37 (2):249-53. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
# When discussing '''macro social structures''', secularization can refer to ''differentiation'': a process in which the various aspects of society, economic, political, legal, and moral, become increasingly specialized and distinct from one another.
# When discussing '''individual institutions''', secularization can denote the transformation of a religious into a secular institution. Examples would be the evolution of institutions such as [[Harvard University]] from a predominantly religious institution into a secular institution (with a divinity school now housing the religious element illustrating differentiation).
# When discussing '''activities''', secularization refers to the transfer of activities from religious to secular institutions, such as a shift in provision of social services from churches to the government.
# When discussing '''mentalities''', secularization refers to the transition from ''ultimate'' concerns to ''proximate'' concerns. E.g., individuals in the West are now more likely to moderate their behavior in response to more immediately applicable consequences rather than out of concern for ''post-mortem'' consequences. This is a personal religious decline or movement toward a secular lifestyle.
# When discussing '''populations''', secularization refers to broad patterns of societal decline in levels of religiosity as opposed to the individual-level secularization of (4) above. This understanding of secularization is also distinct from (1) above in that it refers specifically to religious decline rather than societal differentiation.
# When discussing '''religion''', secularization can only be used unambiguously to refer to religion in a generic sense. For example, a reference to Christianity is not clear unless one specifies exactly which denominations of Christianity are being discussed.

[[Abdel Wahab Elmessiri]] (2002) outlined two meanings of the term secularization:
# '''Partial Secularization''': which is the common meaning of the word, and expresses "The separation between religion and state".
# '''Complete Secularization''': this definition is not limited to the partial definition, but exceeds it to "The separation between all (religion, moral, and human) values, and (not just the state) but also to (the human nature in its public and private sides), so that the holiness is removed from the world, and this world is transformed into a usable matter that can be employed for the sake of the strong".

==Sociological use and differentiation==
As studied by sociologists, one of the major themes of secularization is that of "differentiation"—i.e.,&amp;nbsp;the tendency for areas of life to become more distinct and specialized as a society becomes modernized. European sociology, influenced by [[anthropology]], was interested in the process of change from the so-called primitive societies to increasingly advanced societies. In the United States, the emphasis was initially on change as an aspect of progress, but [[Talcott Parsons]] refocused on society as a system immersed in a constant process of increased differentiation, which he saw as a process in which new institutions take over the tasks necessary in a society to guarantee its survival as the original monolithic institutions break up. This is a devolution from single, less differentiated institutions to an increasingly differentiated subset of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, David (2005). ''On Secularization: Toward a Revised General Theory''. Ashgate Publishing Company, p. 20. ("Parsons saw differentiation as the separating out of each social sphere from ecclesiastical control: the state, science, and the market, but also law, welfare, and education etc.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Parsons, this concept of differentiation has been widely applied. As phrased by [[José Casanova (sociologist)|José Casanova]], this "core and the central thesis of the theory of secularization is the conceptualization of the process of societal modernization as a process of functional differentiation and emancipation of the secular spheres—primarily the state, the economy, and science—from the religious sphere and the concomitant differentiation and specialization of religion within its own newly found religious sphere". Casanova also describes this as the theory of "privatization" of religion, which he partially criticizes.&lt;ref&gt;Casanova, Jose (1994). ''Public Religions in the Modern World''. University of Chicago Press, p. 19. {{ISBN|0-226-09535-5}} ("Only in the 1980s, after the sudden eruption of religion into the public sphere, did it become obvious that differentiation and the loss of societal functions do not necessarily entail 'privatization.'")&lt;/ref&gt; While criticizing certain aspects of the traditional sociological theory of secularization, however, [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] argues that the concept of social differentiation has been its "most useful element".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues in secularization==
At present, secularization as understood in the West is being debated in the [[sociology of religion]]. In his works ''Legitimacy of the Modern Age'' (1966) and ''The Genesis of the Copernican World'' (1975), [[Hans Blumenberg]] has rejected the idea of a historical continuity – fundamental the so-called 'theorem of secularization'; the [[Modern history#Modern Age|Modern age]] in his view represents an independent epoch opposed to Antiquity and the [[Middle Ages]] by a rehabilitation of human curiosity in reaction to theological absolutism. "Blumenberg targets [[Karl Löwith|Löwith]]'s argument that progress is the secularization of [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and [[Christian]] beliefs and argues to the contrary that the modern age, including its belief in progress, grew out of a new secular self-affirmation of culture against the [[Christian tradition]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cornelius A.|last= Buller|title=The Unity of Nature and History in Pannenberg's Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBwpiVj5skoC&amp;printsec=frontcover|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EBwpiVj5skoC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=%22Hans+Blumenberg+targets+Lowith+'s+argument+that+progress+is+the+secularization+of+Hebrew+and+Christian+beliefs+and+argues+to+the+contrary+that+the+modern+age,+including+its+belief+in+progress,+grew+out+of+a+new+secular+self-affirmation+of+culture+against+the+Christian+tradition%22 95]|year=1996|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|location=[[Lanham, Maryland]]|id={{ISBN|0-822-63055-9}}; {{ISBN|978-08-2263-055-5}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]], a student of Löwith, has continued the debate against Blumenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Wolfhart|last=Pannenberg|chapter=Christianity as the Legitimacy of the Modern Age (1968)|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=dS4mAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pannenberg+%22Christianity+as+the+Legitimacy+of+the+Modern+Age%22+%22The+Idea+of+God+and+Human+Freedom%22|title=The Idea of God and Human Freedom, Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dS4mAQAAMAAJ|pages=178–191|year=1973|publisher=Westminster Press|location=London|id={{ISBN|0-664-20971-8}}; {{ISBN|978-06-6420-971-1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] in "A Secular Age" challenges what he calls 'the subtraction thesis' – that science leads to religion being subtracted from more and more areas of life.

Proponents of "secularization theory" demonstrate widespread declines in the prevalence of religious belief throughout the West, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Steve. God is Dead: Secularization in the West. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Rodney Stark]], [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]]) have argued that levels of religiosity are not declining, while other scholars (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Mark Chaves]], [[N.&amp;nbsp;J. Demerath]]) have countered by introducing the idea of neo-secularization, which broadens the definition of secularization to include the decline of religious authority and its ability to influence society.

In other words, rather than using the proportion of irreligious apostates as the sole measure of secularity, neo-secularization argues that individuals increasingly look outside of religion for authoritative positions. Neo-secularizationists would argue that religion has diminishing authority on issues such as [[birth control]], and argue that religion's authority is declining and secularization is taking place even if religious affiliation may not be declining in the United States (a debate still taking place).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Finally, some claim that demographic forces offset the process of secularization, and may do so to such an extent that individuals can consistently drift away from religion even as society becomes more religious. This is especially the case in societies like [[Israel]] (with the [[Orthodox Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] and religious [[Zionist]]s) where committed religious groups have several times the birth rate of seculars. The [[religious fertility effect]] operates to a greater or lesser extent in all countries, and is amplified in the West by religious immigration. For instance, even as native whites became more secular, [[London]], England, has become more religious in the past 25 years as religious immigrants and their descendants have increased their share of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Eric. 2011.

==Regional developments ==

===United States===

'''1870-1930'''. Christian Smith examined the secularization of American public life between 1870 and 1930. He noted that in 1870 a Protestant establishment thoroughly dominated American culture and its public institutions. By the turn of the 20th century, however, [[positivism]] had displaced the [[Baconian method]] (which had hitherto bolstered [[natural theology]]) and higher education had been thoroughly secularized. In the 1910s "legal realism" gained prominence, de-emphasizing the religious basis for [[law]]. That same decade publishing houses emerged that were independent of the Protestant establishment. During the 1920s secularization extended into popular culture and mass public education ceased to be under Protestant cultural influence. Although the general public was still highly religious during this time period, by 1930 the old Protestant establishment was in "shambles".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Christian. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IbEwDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=info:paCf6RiVs7IJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;ots=F45PpKyvo0&amp;sig=Vn0tlVvnEiybdq2_KmevWlfig-c#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life''] (2012) pp.25-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Key to understanding the secularization, Smith argues, was the rise of an elite intellectual class skeptical of religious orthodoxies and influenced by the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] tradition. They consciously sought to displace a Protestant establishment they saw as standing in their way.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Christian. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IbEwDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=info:paCf6RiVs7IJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;ots=F45PpKyvo0&amp;sig=Vn0tlVvnEiybdq2_KmevWlfig-c#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life] (2012) pp.32-43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2008-2017'''. Annual [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] polls from 2008 through 2015 showed that the fraction of American who did not identify with any particular religion steadily rose from 14.6% in 2008 to 19.6% in 2015. At the same time, the fraction of Americans identifying as [[Christianity in the United States|Christians]] sunk from 80.1% to 75% during the same time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/187955/percentage-christians-drifting-down-high.aspx|title=Percentage of Christians in U.S. Drifting Down, but Still High|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued until 2017 when 21.3% of Americans declared no religious identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/224642/2017-update-americans-religion.aspx|title=2017 Update on Americans and Religion|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that non-Christian religions stayed roughly the same (at about 5% from 2008 to 2015) secularization seems to have affected primarily Christians.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Britain===
====History====

In Britain, secularization came much later than in most of Western Europe. It began in the 1960s as part of a much larger social and cultural revolution. Until then the postwar years had seen a revival of religiosity in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Callum G. Brown, ''The Death of Christian Britain: Understanding Secularisation, 1800-2000'' (2009) pp 170-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists and historians have engaged in vigorous debates over when it started, how fast it happened, and what caused it.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Morris, "Secularization and religious experience: arguments in the historiography of modern British religion." ''Historical Journal'' 55#1 (2012): 195-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sponsorship by royalty, aristocracy, and influential local gentry provided an important support-system for organized religion. The sponsorship faded away in the 20th century, as the local élites were no longer so powerful or so financially able to subsidize their favourite activities. In coal-mining districts, local collieries typically funded local chapels, but that ended{{when|date=March 2016}} as the industry grew distressed and the unionized miners rejected élite interference in their local affairs. This allowed secularizing forces to gain strength.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bruce, "Patronage and secularization: social obligation and church support Patronage and secularization: social obligation and church support," ''British Journal of Sociology'' (2012) 63#3 pp 533-552.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent developments====

Data from the annual [[British Social Attitudes Survey|British Social Attitudes survey]] and the biennial [[European Social Survey]] suggest that the proportion of Britons who identify as Christian fell from 55% (in 1983) to 43% (in 2015). While members of non-Christian religions – principally Muslims and Hindus – quadrupled, the  non-religious ("nones") now make up 53% of the British population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21728600-only-15-call-themselves-anglicans-dont-bet-church-losing-its-official-role-any-time|title=A majority of Britons now follow no religion|last=|first=|date=9 Sep 2017|website=The Economist|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013065031/https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21728600-only-15-call-themselves-anglicans-dont-bet-church-losing-its-official-role-any-time|archive-date=2017-10-13|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than six in 10 “nones” were brought up as Christians, mainly Anglican or Catholic. Only 2% of “nones” were raised in religions other than Christian.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/13/uk-losing-faith-religion-young-reject-parents-beliefs|title=Nearly 50% are of no religion – but has UK hit ‘peak secular’?|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|date=2017-05-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-01|last2=correspondent|first2=religion|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831194722/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/13/uk-losing-faith-religion-young-reject-parents-beliefs|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who were brought up to practise a religion, but who now identifies as having no religion, so-called "non-verts", had different "non-version" rates, namely 14% for Jews, 10% for Muslims and Sikhs and 6% for Hindus. The proportions of the non-religious who convert to a faith are small: 3% now identify as Anglicans, less than 0.5% convert to Catholicism, 2% join other Christian denominations and 2% convert to non-Christian faiths.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== India ===
[[Hinduism]], which is the dominant way of life in [[India]], has been described as a 'culture and civilisation of ancient origin' that is 'intrinsically secular'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/hinduism-is-intrinsically-secular|title=Hinduism is intrinsically secular|website=www.sunday-guardian.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113224444/http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/hinduism-is-intrinsically-secular|archivedate=2014-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], post-independence, has seen the emergence of an assertive secular state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galanter|first=Marc|date=|title=Hinduism, Secularism, and the Indian Judiciary|url=|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=21|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===

One traditional view of Chinese culture sees the teachings of [[Confucianism]] - influential over many centuries - as basically secular.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Chang Pao-min]] summarises perceived historical consequences of very early secularization in China:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The early secularization of Chinese society, which must be recognized as a sign of modernity [...] has ironically left China for centuries without a powerful and stable source of morality and law. All this simply means that the pursuit of wealth or power or simply the competition for survival can be and often has been ruthless without any sense of restraint. [...] Along with the early secularization of Chinese society which was equally early, the concomitant demise of feudalism and hereditary aristocracy, another remarkable development, transformed China earlier than any other country into a unitary system politically, with one single power centre. It also rendered Chinese society much more egalitarian than Western Europe and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this arguably secular setting, the [[Chinese Communist Party]] régime of the [[People's Republic of China]] (in power on the Chinese mainland from 1949) promoted deliberate secularization.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Arab world ===
Many countries in the Arab world show signs of increasing secularization. For instance, in [[Egypt]], support for imposing [[sharia]] (Islamic law) fell from 84% in 2011 to 34% in 2016. Egyptians also pray less: among older Egyptians (55+) 90% prayed daily in 2011. Among the younger generation (age 18-24) that fraction was only 70%. By contrast, in 2016 these numbers had fallen to &lt;80% (55+) and &lt;40% (18-24).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The other age groups were in between these values. In [[Lebanon]] and [[Morocco]], the number of people listening to daily recitals of the quran fell by half from 2011 to 2016.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=4 Nov 2017|title=The new Arab Cosmopolitans.|url=|journal=The Economist|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these developments seem to be driven by need, e.g. by stagnating incomes which force women to contribute to household income and therefore to work. High living costs delay marriage and, as a consequence, seem to encourage pre-marital sex.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, in other countries, such as [[Algeria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], support for sharia and islamist ideas seems to grow. Even in countries in which secularization is growing, there are backlashes. For instance, the president of Egypt, [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi]], has banned hundreds of newspapers and websites who may provoke opposition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Note to anyone who is thinking of making this article self referential: Please do not do this, see the note at top of the recursion article for why --&gt;{{Selfref|For the self-reference template on Wikipedia, see [[Template:Selfref]].}}

[[Image:ouroboros.png|thumb|The [[Ouroboros]], a dragon that continually consumes itself, is used as a symbol for self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soto-Andrade |first1=Jorge |last2=Jaramillo |first2=Sebastian |last3=Gutierrez |first3=Claudio |last4=Letelier |first4=Juan-Carlos |title=Ouroboros avatars: A mathematical exploration of Self-reference and Metabolic Closure |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/alife/0262297140chap115.pdf |publisher=MIT Press |accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Self-reference''' occurs in [[natural language|natural]] or [[formal language|formal languages]] when a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], idea or [[formula]] refers to itself. The reference may be expressed either directly—through some intermediate sentence or formula—or by means of some [[Semantics encoding|encoding]]. In [[philosophy]], it also refers to the ability of a subject to speak of or refer to itself: to have the kind of thought expressed by the first person nominative singular pronoun, [[I (pronoun)|the word "I"]] in English.

Self-reference is studied and has applications in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[computer programming]], and [[linguistics]]. Self-referential statements are sometimes [[paradox]]ical, and can also be considered [[Recursion|recursive]].

==In logic, mathematics and computing ==
In classical [[philosophy]], [[paradoxes]] were created by self-referential concepts such as the [[omnipotence paradox]] of asking if it was possible for a being to exist so powerful that it could create a stone that it could not lift. The [[Epimenides paradox]], 'All Cretans are liars' when uttered by an ancient Greek Cretan was one of the first recorded versions. Contemporary philosophy sometimes employs the same technique to demonstrate that a supposed concept is meaningless or ill-defined.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In [[mathematics]] and [[computability theory]], self-reference (also known as [[Impredicativity]]) is the key concept in proving limitations of many systems. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] uses it to show that no formal consistent system of mathematics can ever contain all possible mathematical truths, because it cannot prove some truths about its own structure. [[The halting problem]] equivalent, in computation theory, shows that there is always some task that a computer cannot perform, namely reasoning about itself. These proofs relate to a long tradition of mathematical paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]] and [[Berry's paradox]], and ultimately to classical philosophical paradoxes.

In [[game theory]] undefined behaviors can occur where two players must model each other's mental states and behaviors, leading to infinite regress.

In [[computer programming]], self-reference occurs in [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]], where a program can read or modify its own instructions like any other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malenfant|first1=J.|last2=Demers|first2=F-N|title=A Tutorial on Behavioral Reflection and its Implementation|url=http://www2.parc.com/csl/groups/sda/projects/reflection96/docs/malenfant/malenfant.pdf|publisher=PARC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous programming languages support reflection to some extent with varying degrees of expressiveness. Additionally, self-reference is seen in [[recursion]] (related to the mathematical [[recurrence relation]]) in [[functional programming]], where a code structure refers back to itself during computation.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker |first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Taming' self-reference from potentially paradoxical concepts into well-behaved recursions has been one of the great successes of [[computer science]], and is now used routinely in, for example, writing [[compilers]] using the 'meta-language' [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. Using a compiler to compile itself is known as [[bootstrapping]]. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible to write (programs which operate on themselves), both with [[Assembly language|assembler]] and with functional languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], but is generally discouraged in real-world programming. Computing hardware makes fundamental use of self-reference in [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], the basic units of digital memory, which convert potentially paradoxical logical self-relations into memory by expanding their terms over time. Thinking in terms of self-reference is a pervasive part of programmer culture, with many programs and acronyms named self-referentially as a form of humor, such as [[GNU]] ('Gnu's not Unix') and [[PINE]] ('Pine is not Elm'). The [[GNU Hurd]] is named for a pair of mutually self-referential acronyms.

[[Tupper's self-referential formula]] is a mathematical curiosity which plots an image of its own formula.

== In life ==
The biology of [[self-replication]] is self-referential, as embodied by [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] replication mechanisms. Models of self-replication are found in the computational [[Game of life]], and have inspired engineering systems such as the [[RepRap]] self-replicating 3d printer.

== In art ==
Self-reference occurs in [[literature]] and [[film]] when an author refers to his or her own work in the context of the work itself. Examples include [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'', [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Tempest]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques le fataliste et son maître]]'', [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[If on a winter's night a traveler]]'', many stories by [[Nikolai Gogol]], ''[[Lost in the Funhouse]]'' by [[John Barth]], [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' and [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]''. Perhaps the earliest example is in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]], where [[Helen of Troy]] laments: "for generations still unborn/we will live in song" (appearing in the song itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homer |others=Translated by Robert Fagles |title=Iliad |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=1-101-15281-8 |page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-reference in art is closely related to the concepts of [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] and [[meta-reference]], which often involve self-reference. The short stories of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] play with self-reference and related paradoxes in many ways. [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Krapp's Last Tape]] consists entirely of the protagonist listening to and making recordings of himself, mostly about other recordings. During the 1990s and 2000s filmic self-reference was a popular part of the [[rubber reality]] movement, notably in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s films [[Being John Malkovich]] and [[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]], the latter pushing the concept arguably to its breaking point as it attempts to portray its own creation.

Various [[creation myths]] invoke self-reference to solve the problem of what created the creator. For example the [[Egyptian creation myth]] has a god swallowing his own semen to create himself. [[Ouroboros]] is a mythical dragon which eats itself.

The [[surrealist]] painter [[René Magritte]] is famous for his self-referential works. His painting ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'', includes the words "this is not a pipe", the truth of which depends entirely on whether the word ''ceci'' (in English, "this") refers to the pipe depicted&amp;mdash;or to the painting or the word or sentence itself.&lt;ref name="NöthBishara2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nöth |first1=Winfried |last2=Bishara |first2=Nina |title=Self-reference in the Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBOFIdchEQYC&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2007 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-019464-7 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[M.C. Escher]]'s art also contains many self-referential concepts such as hands drawing themselves.

== In language ==
A word that describes itself is called an ''[[autological word]]'' (or ''[[autological word|autonym]]''). This generally applies to adjectives, for example [[wikt:sesquipedalian|sesquipedalian]] (i.e. "sesquipedalian" is a sesquipedalian word), but can also apply to other parts of speech, such as [[wikt:TLA|TLA]], as a three-letter [[abbreviation]] for "[[three-letter abbreviation]]".

A sentence which inventories its own letters and punctuation marks is called an [[autogram]].

There is a special case of meta-sentence in which the content of the sentence in the metalanguage and the content of the sentence in the object language are the same. Such a sentence is referring to itself. However some meta-sentences of this type can lead to paradoxes. "This is a sentence." can be considered to be a self-referential meta-sentence which is obviously true. However "This sentence is false" is a meta-sentence which leads to a self-referential [[Liar paradox|paradox]]. Such sentences can lead to problems, for example, in law, where statements bringing laws into existence can contradict one another or themselves. [[Kurt Gödel]] claimed to have found such a paradox in the [[US constitution]] at his citizenship ceremony.

Self-reference occasionally occurs in the [[Broadcast media|media]] when it is required to write about itself, for example the [[BBC]] reporting on job cuts at the BBC. Notable encyclopedias may be required to feature articles about themselves, such as [[Wikipedia]]'s article on Wikipedia.

[[Fumblerules]] are a list of rules of good grammar and writing, demonstrated through sentences that violate those very rules, such as "Avoid cliches like the plague" and "Don't use no double negatives". The term was coined in a published list of such rules by [[William Safire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt-usage-english.org/humorousrules.html alt.usage.english.org's ''Humorous Rules for Writing'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = William |last= Safire |authorlink=William Safire |publication-date=1979-11-04 |title=On Language; The Fumblerules of Grammar |periodical=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/on-language-the-fumblerules-of-grammar.html?sq=Fumblerules&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p |page=SM4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several academic disciplines are sometime required to study themselves in forms of self-reference, for example [[historiography]] (or "[[meta-history]]") is history's study of its own past; [[meta-sociology]] occurs when sociologists study the power structures in their own academic institutions; and [[meta-mathematics]] is the study of mathematics itself as a formal system, using its own methods. In [[law]], self-reference may become an issue when laws are required to regulate the making of new laws, especially around [[constitutional]] issues. (The game of [[nomic]] begins as a model of this process.) The prefix "[[meta]]" is often used to denote this type of self-reference.

==In popular culture==
* [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s books, especially ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' and ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', play with many self-referential concepts and were highly influential in bringing them into mainstream intellectual culture during the 1980s. [[Hofstadter's law]], which specifies that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law"&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]]. ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''. 20th anniversary ed., 1999, p. 152. {{ISBN|0-465-02656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a self-referencing adage. Hofstadter also suggested the concept of a 'Reviews of this book', a book containing only reviews of itself, which has since been implemented using [[wiki|wikis]] and other technologies. Hofstadter's '[[strange loop]]' [[metaphysics]] attempts to map [[consciousness]] onto self-reference, but is a minority position in [[philosophy of mind]].
* The subgenre of "[[recursion|recursive]] [[science fiction]]" or [[metafiction]] is now so extensive that it has fostered a fan-maintained bibliography at the [[New England Science Fiction Association]]'s website; some of it is about [[science-fiction fandom]], some about science fiction and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesfa.org/Recursion/index.htm "Recursive Science Fiction"] New England Science Fiction Association website, last updated 3 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Aberration of light|Stellar aberration]]''' is an astronomical phenomenon "which produces an apparent motion of celestial objects". It can be proven mathematically that stellar aberration is due to the change of the astronomer's [[inertial frame of reference]]. The formula is derived with the use of [[Special relativity#Reference frames.2C coordinates and the Lorentz transformation|Lorentz transformation]] of the star's ''coordinates''.

As the astronomer [[John Herschel]] has already explained in 1844, the stellar aberration does '''not''' depend on the relative velocity of the star towards Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Herschel, John Frederick William|title=Schreiben des Herrn Baronets Herschel an den Herausgeber|journal=Astronomische Nachrichten|volume=22|issue=520|date=1844|pages=249–254|bibcode = 1844AN.....22..249H |doi = 10.1002/asna.18450221702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise [[Binary star#Eclipsing binaries|eclipsing binary stars]] would appear to be separated, in stark contrast to observation: both stars are rotating with high speed —and ever changing and different velocity vectors— around each other, but they appear as ''one'' spot all the time.

==Stellar aberration is only due to the change of the astronomer's inertial frame of reference==

In the year 1926 the astrophysicist [[Robert Emden]] published the article ''Aberration und Relativitätstheorie'' in the journal ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Emden, R.|title=Aberration und Relativitätstheorie|journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|volume=14|issue=16|date=1926|pages=329–335|doi=10.1007/BF01506966|bibcode = 1926NW.....14..329E }} (14. Jahrgang, Heft 16)&lt;/ref&gt; In this article he states that the direction of a light ray isn't influenced by the motion of the star or by the motion of Earth.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;R. Emden's (rhetorical) question "How will the direction of the light rays of stars incident upon Earth be influenced by the motion of Earth and the motion (not the location) of the star at the time of emission?" is answered by him with "Not at all."&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the opponents of the special theory of relativity reasoned that the theory must be flawed, because it would state that the stellar aberration would depend on the relative velocity of the star — which would be in contradiction to observation — and R. Emden's article explains that the special theory of relativity does not predict this. Today, the special theory of relativity isn't contested anymore but there are still articles that suggest that the aberration would depend on the relative velocity of the star.&lt;ref&gt;See for example equation (4) in {{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0203056 |title=Why the Bradley aberration cannot be used to measure absolute speeds. A comment |author1=Klaus Kassner |date=2002 |doi=10.1209/epl/i2002-00443-7 |volume=58 |issue=4 |journal=Europhysics Letters (EPL) |pages=637–638|bibcode=2002EL.....58..637K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a (relativistic) [[velocity-addition formula]] can be used to explain stellar aberration, (see [[Aberration of light#Explanation|Aberration of light]]), another  (relativistic) explanation using only the [[Lorentz transformation]] is also possible, as will be demonstrated. This derivation only uses the star's ''coordinates'' at the time of emission, and therefore has the ''formal'' advantage there is no place for the relative velocity of the star towards the astronomer and therefore it is evident that the observed position doesn't depend on the star's velocity — provided that the resultant change of position is much smaller than the distance between star and Earth.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;I.e. the stars can rotate very fast like eclipsing binary stars as long as the change in position is much smaller than the star-earth distance.&lt;/ref&gt; The observed position of the star wouldn't depend on Earth's motion either, if the astronomer could use the same inertial frame of reference all the time. But of course that is technically impossible,&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;It's easy to (technically) compensate the deviation of the ''direction'' of the axes due to Earth's rotation and earth's orbit but it almost impossible to (technically) compensate a velocity in the order of several 1000&amp;nbsp;m/s. This can only be achieved with help of mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt; the astronomer uses his current rest frame and these current rest frames are different at different times as Earth orbits around the Sun. It is mathematically convenient to declare the position of the source star in the rest frame of the Sun (more exactly: the center of mass of the Solar System) as the "real" position and that the difference to this "real" position derives form the "aberration".&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Of course every inertial frame of reference is physically equal, but the rest system of the barycenter has the mathematical advantage, that it's the ''mean'' frame of reference and since the time of [[Galileo Galilei]] it's the preferred frame of reference&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sample calculation===
[[File:PathLightSignalS.PNG|thumb|left|path of light signal in reference frame S]]
[[File:PathLightSignalSdash.PNG|thumb|path of light signal in reference frame S']]
S and S' are (quasi-)inertial frames of reference and the reference frame S' is in uniform motion with v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5c relative to S, such that in the future the star comes nearer to the origin of the coordinate system (and consequently further afar in the past). The x-,y- and z-axes of both systems ought to be parallel and at time t=t'=0 the origins of both systems ought to coincide. 
Therefore one gets according to Lorentz transformation: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \beta=v/c &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \gamma=1/\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;:  y'=y ; z=z';  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x'=\gamma\cdot(x-\beta\cdot ct)&lt;/math&gt;
 
Suppose now that the star emitted a light signal at time &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c\,t_1=-5\,Ly&lt;/math&gt; at location &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x_1=4\,Ly\;,\;y_1= 3\,Ly\;,\;z_1=0 &lt;/math&gt; (S coordinates) and that this light signal is received by an astronomer at time  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c\,t_2=0&lt;/math&gt; at location &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x_2=0\;,\;y_2=0\;,\;z_2=0&lt;/math&gt;.

In S the star's position and the x-axis form an angle &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tan \delta =3/4 \; \rightarrow \;\delta =36.87^\circ &lt;/math&gt;
But in S' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x_1'=\gamma \cdot (x_1-\beta \cdot c\,t_1)=1,1547\cdot (4 Lj - 0,5\cdot(-5 Lj))=7,50555 Lj; \quad y_1'=y_1=3 Lj&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the angle &lt;math&gt;\delta'&lt;/math&gt; between the star's position and x'-axis&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;The lines of x-axis and x'-axis lie on top of each other&lt;/ref&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tan \delta'=y_1'/x_1'=3/7,50555\;\rightarrow\;\delta' = 21,79^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
 
Calculation with help of the formula in [[aberration of light#Explanation]] gives the same result: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tan (\delta'/2) = \tan (\delta /2) \cdot \sqrt {(1-0,5)/(1+0,5)} = \tan (36,87^\circ/2) \cdot \sqrt{1/3} = 0,19245\;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\;\rightarrow\;\delta'/2= 10,89^\circ\;\rightarrow\;\delta'=21,79^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.

==Two-dimensional problem==

===Derivation of the formula for motion along the x-axis===

For the derivation it is assumed, that the light signal only travels through space regions where the gravitation field is negligible. Hence is suffices to use [[special relativity|'''special''' relativity]] and the path of the light signal is a straight line in any inertial frame of reference.

'''Observation in the [[rest frame]] S of the [[center of mass#Astronomy|center of mass]] of  our Solar System'''

''The rest frame of the center of mass (barycenter) is a very good&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;An even better quasi-inertial frame of reference would be a frame of reference in which the center of mass of the Milky Way would rest or be in uniform motion.&lt;/ref&gt; quasi-inertial frame of reference for periods of time in the order of thousands of years, since our solar system needs about 230 million years ([[galactic year]]) to move completely around the center of the [[Milky Way]]. The space coordinates of this frame of reference form a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].''

In the reference frame S &lt;math&gt;(x_1|y_1|0|c\,t_1)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c\,t_1&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_1|y_1) \ne (0|0)&lt;/math&gt; are the (space-time) coordinates at which the star emits a light signal and &lt;math&gt;(0|0|0|0)&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates at which the astronomer receives the light signal.

In reference frame S the light signal starts at &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and stops at time &lt;math&gt;t_2=0&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the light signal did cover the distance &lt;math&gt;d = c\cdot(0-t_1) = -c\,t_1&lt;/math&gt; .

In S the path of the light signal is a straight line and it forms an angle &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; with the x-axis with: &lt;math&gt;\sin \delta = \frac{y_1}{d}=\frac{y_1}{-c\,t_1}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and &lt;math&gt;\cos\delta=\frac{x_1}{-c\,t_1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Observation in the inertial frame of reference S' which is in uniform motion (relative to S) along the x-axis'''
  
The origin of the reference frame S' is in uniform motion relative to S with &lt;math&gt;(v|0|0)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. moves along the x-axis, and the x-,y- und z-axes of S' and S are parallel to each other and at time &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle t=t'=0&lt;/math&gt; the origins of S and S' coincide. Let &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{v}{c} , \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

S' now is an equally good quasi-inertial frame of reference as S: the space coordinates form a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] and the path of the light signal is a straight line.
 
According to the Lorentz transformation one gets:  &lt;math&gt; x_1' = \gamma \cdot(x_1-\beta \cdot c\,t_1) , y_1'=y_1 , z_1'=0 , c\,t_1' = \gamma \cdot (c\,t_1-\beta \cdot x_1)&lt;/math&gt;

In reference frame S' the light signal starts at &lt;math&gt;t_1'&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and stops at time &lt;math&gt;t_2'=0&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the light signal did cover the distance &lt;math&gt;d\,' = c\cdot(0-t_1') = -c\,t_1'&lt;/math&gt; .

In S' the path of the light signal is a straight line, too. It forms an angle &lt;math&gt;\delta'&lt;/math&gt; with the x'-axis and one gets:

&lt;math&gt; \sin \delta' = \frac{y_1'}{d\,'}=\frac{y_1}{-c\,t_1'}
=\frac{y_1}{-\gamma \cdot (c\,t_1-\beta \cdot x_1)}
=\frac{y_1}{-c\,t_1 \cdot \gamma\cdot \left(1-\beta\cdot\frac{x_1}{c\,t_1}\right)}=\frac{\frac{y_1}{-c\,t_1}}{\gamma\cdot\left(1+\beta\cdot\frac{x_1}{-c\,t_1}\right)}
=\frac{\sin \delta}{\gamma\cdot(1+\beta\cdot\cos\delta)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cos\delta'=\frac{x_1'}{-c\,t_1'}
=\frac{\gamma \cdot(x_1-\beta \cdot c\,t_1)}{-\gamma \cdot (c\,t_1-\beta \cdot x_1)}
=\frac{-c\,t_1 \cdot \gamma \cdot \left ( \frac{x_1}{-c\,t_1}+\beta \right)}{-c\,t_1 \cdot \gamma \cdot \left( 1 + \beta \cdot \frac{x_1}{-c\, t_1} \right) }
=\frac{\frac{x_1}{-c\,t_1}+\beta}{1 + \beta \cdot \frac{x_1}{-c\, t_1}}
=\frac{\cos \delta +\beta}{1 + \beta \cdot \cos \delta}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta' = \frac{\sin \delta'}{\cos \delta'}=\frac{\sin \delta}{\gamma\cdot(\cos \delta +\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the same formulas as in [[aberration of light#Explanation]].

===Approximate formula for motion along the x-axis in case of v/c &lt;&lt;1===

&lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta\;=\;\delta' - \delta\; &lt;/math&gt; is the change of the angle &amp;delta;. As &amp;beta;&lt;&lt;1 this change is also very small.

'''Case I: '''&lt;math&gt;\;\delta\ne\pm 90^\circ\; \rightarrow \;\cos \delta \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

As &amp;Delta;&amp;delta;&lt;&lt;1 one gets: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\tan \delta' - \tan \delta}{\triangle\delta} \approx\frac{d}{d\delta}\tan \delta = \frac{1}{(\cos \delta)^2}\; \rightarrow \; \triangle\delta\;=\;(\cos \delta)^2 \cdot (\tan \delta' - \tan \delta)&lt;/math&gt;

As &amp;beta;&lt;&lt;1 one gets: &lt;math&gt;\tan\delta'=\frac {\sin \delta}{\gamma(\cos \delta +\beta)} \approx \frac {\sin \delta}{\cos \delta +\beta} = \frac{\sin \delta}{\cos \delta \cdot \left(1+\frac{\beta}{\cos \delta}\right)} \approx \tan \delta \cdot \left(1-\frac{\beta}{\cos \delta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta\;=\;(\cos \delta)^2 \cdot (\tan \delta' - \tan \delta) = (\cos \delta)^2 \cdot \tan \delta \left(1-\frac{\beta}{\cos \delta}\;-1\right) = - \cos \delta \cdot \tan \delta \cdot \beta = -\beta \cdot \sin \delta &lt;/math&gt;

'''Case IIa: '''&lt;math&gt;\;\delta\;=90^\circ\;&lt;/math&gt;, hence: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta' =\frac{\sin 90^\circ}{\gamma\cdot(\cos 90^\circ + \beta)}= \frac{1}{\gamma \cdot \beta}\;\approx \frac {1}{\beta} \quad \rightarrow \quad \cot \delta' = \beta \quad \rightarrow \quad \delta' = \arccot \beta \approx \frac{\pi}{2} - \beta &lt;/math&gt;

and therefore: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = \delta' - \delta = -\beta \quad \left(= -\beta \cdot \sin(90^\circ)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Case IIb: '''&lt;math&gt;\;\delta\;=-90^\circ\;&lt;/math&gt;, and hence: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta' = \frac{-1}{\gamma \cdot \beta}\;\approx -\frac {1}{\beta} \quad \rightarrow \quad \cot \delta' = -\beta \quad \rightarrow \quad \delta' = \arccot \beta \approx -\frac{\pi}{2} + \beta \quad&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Here the solution with cot 0 = -&amp;pi;/2 has to be used, see [https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.efunda.com/math/trig_functions/images/arccot_plot.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.efunda.com/math/trig_functions/display.cfm?name%3Darccot&amp;h=329&amp;w=485&amp;sz=3&amp;tbnid=a0hRF-qzOibryM:&amp;tbnh=82&amp;tbnw=121&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__rTZwdunutqIAiG-l4WbgNeG82pY=&amp;docid=KYfggGmcAxqigM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z52XUZTAK6nk4QSDxIEQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ9QEwAw&amp;dur=197 Plot of arccot (x)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = \delta' - \delta = +\beta\quad \left(= -\beta \cdot \sin(-90^\circ)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Conclusion:'''The change of the angle &amp;Delta;&amp;delta; = &amp;delta;'-&amp;delta;  in the case of &amp;beta; = v/c &lt;&lt; 1 can be described by the approximate formula &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = -\frac{v}{c} \cdot \sin \delta\;&lt;/math&gt; resp. in the degree measure &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = -\frac{v}{c} \cdot \sin \delta  \cdot \frac{180^\circ}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetric form of the (exact) formula for motion along the x-axis===

With help of [[tangent half-angle formula]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tan (\alpha/2)=\sin\alpha/(1+\cos\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; one can prove the symmetric form: &lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\delta'}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\cdot\tan\frac{\delta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;  (derivation found in a SR-textbook&lt;ref&gt;''Spezielle Relativitätstheorie für Studienanfänger'', Jürgen Freund, vdf-Verlag (Zürich), 2nd. Ed. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;)

&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\delta'}{2}=\frac{\sin \delta'}{1+\cos \delta'}
=\frac{\frac{\sin \delta}{\gamma\cdot(1+\beta\cdot\cos\delta)}}{\frac{1 + \beta \cdot \cos \delta}{1 + \beta \cdot \cos \delta}+\frac{\cos \delta +\beta}{1 + \beta \cdot \cos \delta}}
=\frac{\sin \delta}{\gamma\cdot(1 + \beta \cdot \cos \delta + \cos \delta +\beta)}=\frac{\sin \delta}{\gamma\cdot(1 + \beta)\cdot(1+ \cos \delta)}
=\frac{\tan \frac{\delta}{2}}{\gamma\cdot(1+ \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;

And as &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\gamma\cdot(1+\beta)}
=\frac{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}{1+\beta}
=\frac{\sqrt{(1+\beta)(1-\beta)}}{1+\beta}
=\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; the symmetric form follows.

===Formula for motion along the y-axis===

Let &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; be the angle between the light ray (=path of the light signal which is a straight line) and the y-axis whereby &amp;theta; is positive if the y-axis would have to rotate counter-clockwise to coincide with the light ray. Then the derivation of the formula of angle &amp;theta;' for the motion along the y-axis is the same as the derivation of the formula of angle &amp;delta;' for the motion along the x-axis.

Hence: &lt;math&gt;\tan\theta\,' = \frac{\sin\theta}{\gamma\cdot(\cos\theta+\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric form is: &lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\theta\,'}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\cdot\tan\frac{\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the approximate formula is: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\theta = -\beta\cdot\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\theta=\delta-90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sin(\delta-90^{\circ})=-\sin(90^\circ-\delta)=-\cos\delta\;,\;\cos(\delta-90^\circ)=\cos(90^\circ-\delta)=\sin\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\tan(\delta-90^\circ)=-\tan(90^\circ-\delta)=-\cot\delta&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; one gets:

&lt;math&gt;\tan(\delta'-90^\circ) = \frac{\sin(\delta-90^\circ)}{\gamma\cdot\left(\cos(\delta - 90 ^\circ)+\beta\right)}&lt;/math&gt; and therefore:&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;-\cot\delta' = \frac{-\cos\delta}{\gamma\cdot(\sin\delta+\beta)}&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\cot\delta' = \frac{\cos\delta}{\gamma\cdot(\sin\delta+\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\cot\delta'=\frac{1}{\tan\delta'}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; one also gets: &lt;math&gt;\tan\delta' = \frac{\gamma\cdot(\sin\delta+\beta)}{\cos\delta}&lt;/math&gt;

And the symmetric form is: &lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\delta'-90^\circ}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\cdot\tan\frac{\delta-90^\circ}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

And as  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\triangle\theta=(\delta'-90^\circ)-(\delta-90^\circ)=\triangle\delta&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; the approximate formula is: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = \triangle\theta =-\beta\cdot\sin(\delta-90^\circ)=+\beta\cdot\cos\delta&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

===Formula for motion along a ray lying in the x-y-plane with direction vector (cos &amp;alpha; | sin &amp;alpha;) ===

With the same reasoning as above one gets the formula: &lt;math&gt;\tan(\delta'-\alpha) = \frac{\sin(\delta-\alpha)}{\gamma\cdot\left(\cos(\delta-\alpha)+\beta\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric form is: &lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\delta'-\alpha}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\cdot\tan\frac{\delta-\alpha}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The approximate formula is: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = - \beta\cdot\sin(\delta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and in the degree measure: &lt;math&gt;\triangle\delta = -\frac{v}{c}\cdot\sin(\delta-\alpha)\cdot\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

==Application: Aberration in astronomy==

The stellar aberration is purely an effect of the change of the reference frame. The astronomer orbits (with Earth) around the Sun and furthermore rotates around the axis of Earth. His current rest frame S' therefore has different velocities relative to the rest frame S of the barycenter of the Solar System at different times. Hence the astronomer observes that the position of the star changes. The formula is derived under the condition that the change of the ''position'' of the star and of Earth is negligible in the period of observation.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;For the star this period lies in the past.&lt;/ref&gt; That is correct for almost all stars: the amplitude of the [[parallax]] of a star, for a distance of ≥ n [[parsec]], is ≤ 1/n&amp;#x202F;".

===Stellar aberration due to the orbit of Earth (around the Sun)===

The mean orbital speed of Earth is &lt;math&gt;v_e = \frac{2 \cdot \pi \cdot 1\,AE}{365,25\,d} = 29,78\,km/s &lt;/math&gt;, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_e}{c} = 0,00009935&lt;/math&gt;.

-&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{v}{c} \cdot \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 20,5^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; k_A= 20,5^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is dubbed ''constant of aberration'' for the annual aberration.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1964SvA.....7..737M The Constant of Aberration and the Solar Parallax]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stellar aberration due to Earth's rotation===

An astronomer at the [[latitude]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; rotates in 24 hours around the axis of Earth. His speed of rotation is therefore &lt;math&gt;v_r= \frac{\cos \varphi \cdot 40000\,km}{1\,d} = \cos \varphi \cdot 463\,m/s&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_r}{c} = \cos \varphi \cdot 1,54\cdot10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;. Form this so called ''diurnal'' aberration one gets an additional contribution of (at max.) &lt;math&gt; \cos \varphi \cdot 0,32^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Stellar aberration due the orbit of our solar system around the center of the Milky Way===

The rest frame of the center of mass of our solar system isn't a perfect inertial frame of reference since our solar system orbits around the center of the [[Milky Way]]. An estimation for the time of period of circulation is 230 million years (estimations vary between 225 and 250 million years).&lt;ref&gt;see [http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/StacyLeong.shtml hypertextbook.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question18.html NASA - StarChild Question of the Month for February 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; As the estimation for the distance between our solar system and the center of the Milky Way is about 28000 [[Light-year|Ly]], the assumed [[orbital speed]] of our solar system is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v = \frac{2\pi \cdot 280000 \cdot 9,461\cdot10^{15}\,m}{230\cdot 10^{6} \cdot 365,25 \cdot 24 \cdot 3600} \approx\, 230\,km/s&lt;/math&gt;. This would cause an aberration ellipse with a major semiaxis of 2,6' ([[minute of arc|arcminutes]]). Therefore, in one year the aberration angle could change (at max.)  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 2,6^\prime \cdot \frac{2 \pi \cdot 1\,a}{230000000\,a}&lt;/math&gt; = 4,3 µas ([[minute of arc|microarcseconds]]). This very small value isn't detectable now, perhaps it's possible with the planned mission of the [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;This is a hint from H.-H. Voigt: ''Abriss der Astronomie'', 6. Auflage. Herausgegeben von H.-J. Röser und W. Tscharnuter. © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA., page 35 of [http://www.science-shop.de/sixcms/media.php/370/Leseprobe.1162646.pdf extract]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sust 'n' Able''' is the [[Woodcraft Folk]]'s programme of education for [[sustainable development]].
[[Image:sustnable.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sust'N'Able Logo]]

The project was the theme of the Woodcraft Folk's 2001 international camp in [[Nottinghamshire]] where 4,000 young people attended. The camp focused on sustainable development education and ran activates for children from five to twenty five around the themes.

At the camp a simulation game took place called '''World on a Tight Rope'', it ran the length of the camp and involved people working for credits to create a more sustainable world. The simulation included two 'Earth Summits' held at the camp to come up with a declaration to the world's leaders at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD). The Earth Summit had "action stations" where people debated the issues to be included in the declaration.

==The declaration and delegation==
The Declaration created as part of the simulation game was presented by a delegation of 11 young people. The delegation attended the [[United Nations]]' [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] including both the civil society and the official political areas of the summit. The group worked with the [[International Falcon Movement - Socialist Education International]] delegation attending the summit.

Delegations from Woodcraft Folk attend all the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] meetings in [[New York City]] which are follow-up meetings to the annual WSSD, with thematic cycles changing every two years.

The object has been detected by numerous [[astronomical survey]]s, so has numerous [[astronomical naming conventions#Catalogues|valid source designations]].

==Neutrino emission==
On September 22, 2017, the [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]] detected a high energy [[muon neutrino]], dubbed '''IceCube-170922A'''.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt; The neutrino carried an energy of ~290 [[Teraelectronvolt|tera–electronvolts]] (TeV); for comparison, the [[Large Hadron Collider]] can generate a maximum energy of 13&amp;nbsp;TeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Webb |first1=Jonathan |title=LHC smashes collision energy record |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-32809636 |accessdate=21 July 2018 |work=BBC News |date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one minute of the neutrino detection, IceCube sent an automated alert to astronomers around the world with coordinates to search for a possible source.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;

A search of this region in the sky, 1.33 degrees across, yielded only one likely source: TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056, a previously-known blazar, which was found to be in a flaring state of high [[gamma ray]] emission.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt; It was subsequently observed at other wavelengths of light across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], including radio, infrared, optical, X-rays and gamma-rays.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finkbeiner|first=Ann|date=2018-04-17|title=Messengers from the Sky|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-era-of-multimessenger-astronomy/|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=318|issue=5|pages=36–41|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0518-36|pmid=29672499|issn=0036-8733|archive-url=https://www.amon.psu.edu/files/2018/04/ScientificAmerican-0518-36-1gikqgt.pdf|archive-date=2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of both neutrinos and light from the same object was an early example of [[multi-messenger astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Castelvecchi2018"/&gt;

A search of archived neutrino data from IceCube found evidence for an earlier flare of lower-energy neutrinos in 2014-2015 (a form of [[precovery]]), which supports identification of the blazar as a source of neutrinos.&lt;ref name=IceCube2018b/&gt; An independent analysis found no gamma-ray flare during this earlier period of neutrino emission, but supported its association with the blazar.&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt; The neutrinos emitted by TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056 are six [[orders of magnitude]] higher in energy than those from any previously-identified [[Neutrino astronomy|astrophysical neutrino]] source.&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt;

The observations of high energy neutrinos and gamma-rays from this source imply that it is also a source of [[cosmic rays]], because all three should be produced by the same physical processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to particle and astroparticle physics (multimessenger astronomy and its particle physics foundations)|first1=Alessandro |last1=De Angelis |first2=Mario |last2=Pimenta |year=2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-78181-5|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-78181-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; though no cosmic rays from TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056 have been directly observed.&lt;ref name="Castelvecchi2018"/&gt; In the blazar, a charged [[pion]] was produced by the interaction of a high-energy proton or nucleus (i.e. a cosmic ray) with the radiation field or with matter.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt; The pion then decayed into a [[lepton]] and the neutrino. The neutrino interacts only weakly with matter, so it escaped the blazar.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt; Upon reaching Earth, the neutrino interacted with the Antarctic ice to produce a [[muon]], which was observed by the [[Cherenkov radiation]] it generated as it moved through the IceCube detector.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12587">The '''transmission-line matrix (TLM) method''' is a space and time discretising method for computation of [[electromagnetic fields]]. It is based on the [[analogy]] between the electromagnetic field and a mesh of [[transmission line]]s. The TLM method allows the computation of complex three-dimensional electromagnetic structures and has proven to be one of the most powerful time-domain methods along with the finite difference time domain ([[FDTD]]) method.

== Basic principle ==

[[File:SingleNode2DTLM.png|thumb|500px|right|2D TLM example: an incident voltage pulse in two consecutive scattering events.]] The TLM method is based on [[Huygens Principle|Huygens' model of wave propagation]] and scattering and the analogy between field propagation and transmission lines. Therefore, it considers the computational domain as a mesh of transmission lines, interconnected at nodes. In the figure on the right is considered a simple example of a 2D TLM mesh with a voltage pulse of amplitude 1 V incident on the central node. This pulse will be partially reflected and transmitted according to the transmission-line theory. If we assume that each line has a characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, then the incident pulse sees effectively three transmission lines in parallel with a total impedance of &lt;math&gt;Z/3&lt;/math&gt;. The reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient are given by

: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{Z/3-Z}{Z/3+Z} = -0.5&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2(Z/3)}{Z/3+Z} = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

The energy injected into the node by the incident pulse and the total energy of the scattered pulses are correspondingly

: &lt;math&gt;E_I = vi\,\Delta t = 1 \left(1/Z\right)\Delta t = \Delta t/Z&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_S = \left[0.5^2+0.5^2+0.5^2+(-0.5)^2\right](\Delta t/Z) = \Delta t/Z&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the [[energy conservation law]] is fulfilled by the model.

The next scattering event excites the neighbouring nodes according to the principle described above. It can be seen that every node turns into a secondary source of spherical wave. These waves combine to form the overall waveform. This is in accordance with Huygens principle of light propagation.

In order to show the TLM schema we will use time and space discretisation. The time-step will be denoted with &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; and the space discretisation intervals with &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;. The absolute time and space will therefore be &lt;math&gt;t = k\,\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x = l\,\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;y = m\,\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z = n\,\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; is the time instant and &lt;math&gt;m,n,l&lt;/math&gt; are the cell coordinates. In case &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta z&lt;/math&gt; the value &lt;math&gt;\Delta l&lt;/math&gt; will be used, which is the [[lattice constant]]. In this case the following holds:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta t=\frac{\Delta l}{c_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is the free space speed of light.

== The 2D TLM node ==

=== The scattering matrix of an 2D TLM node ===

[[File:SeriesTlmNode.png|thumb|400px|right|A 2D series TLM node]]
If we consider an electromagnetic field distribution in which the only non-zero components are &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_z&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. a TE-mode distribution), then Maxwell's equations in [[Cartesian coordinates]] reduce to

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial{H_z}}{\partial{y}} = \varepsilon\frac{\partial{E_x}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial{H_z}}{\partial{x}} = \varepsilon\frac{\partial{E_y}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial{E_y}}{\partial{x}}-\frac{\partial{E_x}}{\partial{y}} = -\mu\frac{\partial{H_z}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

We can combine these equations to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2H_z}{\partial{x}^2}+\frac{\partial^2{H_z}}{\partial{y}^2} = \mu\varepsilon\frac{\partial^2{H_z}}{\partial{t}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The figure on the right presents a structure referred to as a ''series node''. It describes a block of space dimensions &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; that consists of four ports. &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; are the distributed inductance and capacitance of the transmission lines. It is possible to show that a series node is equivalent to a TE-wave, more precisely the mesh current ''I'', the ''x''-direction voltages (ports 1 and 3) and the ''y''-direction voltages (ports 2 and 4) may be related to the field components &lt;math&gt;H_z&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt;. If the voltages on the ports are considered, &lt;math&gt;L_x = L_y&lt;/math&gt;, and the polarity from the above figure holds, then the following is valid

: &lt;math&gt;-V_1+V_2+V_3-V_4 = 2L'\,\Delta l\frac{\partial{I}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta l&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\left(V_3 - V_1\right)-\left(V_4-V_2\right) = 2L'\,\Delta l\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\left[E_x(y+\Delta y)-E_x(y)\right]\,\Delta x-[E_y(x+\Delta x)-E_y(x)]\Delta y = 2L'\,\Delta l\frac{\partial{I}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

and dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x \Delta y&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{E_x(y+\Delta y)-E_x(y)}{\Delta y}-\frac{E_y(x+\Delta x)-E_y(x)}{\Delta x} = 2L'\,\Delta l\frac{\partial{I}}{\partial{t}}\frac{1}{\Delta x \, \Delta y}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta z = \Delta l&lt;/math&gt; and substituting &lt;math&gt;I = H_z \,\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; gives

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta E_x}{\Delta y} - \frac{\Delta E_y}{\Delta x} = 2L'\frac{\partial H_z}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

This reduces to Maxwell's equations when &lt;math&gt;\Delta l \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, using the conditions across the capacitors on ports 1 and 4, it can be shown that the corresponding two other Maxwell equations are the following:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial{H_z}}{\partial{y}} = C'\frac{\partial{E_x}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial{H_z}}{\partial{x}} = C'\frac{\partial{E_y}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

Having these results, it is possible to compute the scattering matrix of a shunt node. The incident voltage pulse on port 1 at time-step ''k'' is denoted as &lt;math&gt;_kV^i_1&lt;/math&gt;. Replacing the four line segments from the above figure with their [[Thevenin equivalent]] it is possible to show that the following equation for the reflected voltage pulse holds:

: &lt;math&gt;_kV^r_1 = 0.5\left(_kV^i_1 + _kV^i_2 + _kV^i_3 - _kV^i_4\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If all incident waves as well as all reflected waves are collected in one vector, then this equation may be written down for all ports in matrix form:

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{V}^r=\mathbf{S}_k\mathbf{V}^i&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{V}^i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{V}^r&lt;/math&gt; are the incident and the reflected pulse amplitude vectors.

For a series node the scattering matrix '''S''' has the following form

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{S}=\frac12\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&amp; 1&amp; 1&amp; -1\\
1&amp; 1&amp; -1&amp; 1\\
1&amp; -1&amp; 1&amp; 1\\
-1&amp; 1&amp; 1&amp; 1
\end{array}
\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Connection between TLM nodes ===

[[File:2DTLMmes.png|272px|thumb|right|A 2D series TLM node]]
In order to describe the connection between adjacent nodes by a mesh of series nodes, look at the figure on the right. As the incident pulse in timestep ''k+1'' on a node is the scattered pulse from an adjacent node in timestep ''k'', the following connection equations are derived:

: &lt;math&gt;_{k+1}V^i_1(x,y)=_{k+1}V^r_3(x,y-1)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;_{k+1}V^i_2(x,y)=_{k+1}V^r_4(x-1,y)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;_{k+1}V^i_3(x,y)=_{k+1}V^r_1(x,y+1)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;_{k+1}V^i_4(x,y)=_{k+1}V^r_2(x+1,y)&lt;/math&gt;

By modifying the scattering matrix &lt;math&gt;\textbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; inhomogeneous and lossy materials can be modelled. By adjusting the connection equations it is possible to simulate different boundaries.

=== The shunt TLM node ===

Apart from the series node, described above there is also the ''shunt TLM node'', which represents a TM-mode field distribution. The only non-zero components of such wave are &lt;math&gt;H_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H_y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E_z&lt;/math&gt;. With similar considerations as for the series node the scattering matrix of the shunt node can be derived.

== 3D TLM models ==

[[File:SymmetricCondensedNode.png|thumb|320px|right|A 3D symmetric condensed node]]
Most problems in electromagnetics require a three-dimensional grid. As we now have structures that describe TE and TM-field distributions, intuitively it seems possible to define a combination of shunt and series nodes providing a full description of the electromagnetic field. Such attempts have been made, but because of the complexity of the resulting structures they proved to be not very useful. Using the analogy that was presented above leads to calculation of the different field components at physically separated points. This causes difficulties in providing simple and efficient boundary definitions. A solution to these problems was provided by Johns in 1987, when he proposed the structure known as the '''symmetrical condensed node''' (SCN), presented in the figure on the right. It consists of 12 ports because two field polarisations are to be assigned to each of the 6 sides of a mesh cell.

The topology of the SCN cannot be analysed using Thevenin equivalent circuits. More general energy and charge conservation principles are to be used.

The electric and the magnetic fields on the sides of the SCN node number ''(l,m,n)'' at time instant ''k'' may be summarised in 12-dimensional vectors

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{E}_{l,m,n}=_k\left[E_1,E_2,\ldots,E_{11},E_{12}\right]^T_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{H}_{l,m,n}=_k\left[H_1,H_2,\ldots,H_{11},H_{12}\right]^T_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

They can be linked with the incident and scattered amplitude vectors via

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{a}_{l,m,n} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{Z_F}}{_k\mathbf{E}}_{l,m,n}+\frac{\sqrt{Z_F}}{2}{_k\mathbf{H}}_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{b}_{l,m,n}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{Z_F}}{_k\mathbf{E}}_{l,m,n}-\frac{\sqrt{Z_F}}{2}{_k\mathbf{H}}_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_F = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\varepsilon}}&lt;/math&gt; is the field impedance, &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{a}_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of the amplitudes of the incident waves to the node, and &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{b}_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of the scattered amplitudes. The relation between the incident and scattered waves is given by the matrix equation

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{b}_{l,m,n} = \mathbf{S}_k\mathbf{a}_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

The scattering matrix '''S''' can be calculated. For the symmetrical condensed node with ports defined as in the figure the following result is obtained

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
0&amp; \mathbf{S}_0&amp; \mathbf{S}^T_0\\
\mathbf{S}^T_0&amp; 0&amp; \mathbf{S}_0\\
\mathbf{S}_0&amp; \mathbf{S}^T_0&amp; 0
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the following matrix was used

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_0 = \frac{1}{2}\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
0&amp; 0&amp; 1&amp; -1\\
0&amp; 0&amp; -1&amp; 1\\
1&amp; 1&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 1&amp; 0&amp; 0
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The connection between different SCNs is done in the same manner as for the 2D nodes.

'''The Graduate School of Education and Information Studies (GSE&amp;IS)''' is one of the professional graduate schools at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Located in [[Los Angeles, California]], the school combines two distinguished departments whose research and doctoral training programs are committed to expanding the range of knowledge in [[education]], [[information science]], and associated disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/ "Welcome to GSE&amp;IS"] UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. Retrieved January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1881, the school is the oldest unit at [[UCLA]], having been founded as a [[normal school]] prior to the establishment of the university. It was incorporated into the [[University of California]] in 1919. The school offers a wide variety of doctoral and master's degrees, including the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[M.Ed.]], [[Master of Library and Information Science|M.L.I.S.]], [[Ed.D.]], and [[Ph.D.]], as well as professional certificates and credentials in education and information studies. It also hosts visiting scholars and a number of research centers, institutes, and programs.

Both of its departments have consistently ranked highly among graduate schools of education and Master's of Library and Information Science by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' in every year in which the magazine has published such rankings. ''U.S. News and World Report'' does not rank doctoral programs in information studies, but the information studies faculty consistently ranks among the most productive and highly cited faculty in its field, according to a standard quadrennial peer-reviewed study by professors within that field.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, Denice and Budd, John. "Scholarly Productivity of U.S. LIS Faculty." ''Library &amp; Information Science Research'' 28.3 (Autumn 2006):374-389, in which UCLA ranks as the 4th most productive and 3rd most highly cited faculty. John Budd is a professor in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies, [[University of Missouri]].In 2000 Budd published rankings in ''[[Library Journal]]'' 70.2 (April 2000):230; UCLA ranked 8th and 3rd respectively. In 1996 Budd published rankings in ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'' 6.1 (1996):1-20; UCLA ranked 1st and 2nd respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; GSE&amp;IS faculty are members of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucla.edu/facultyhonors/art_sci.html UCLA Members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institute of Medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucla.edu/facultyhonors/iom.html UCLA Members of the Institute of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucla.edu/facultyhonors/advance-science.html UCLA Members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Academy of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucla.edu/facultyhonors/na_education.html UCLA Members of the National Academy of Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Because of the school's size, GSE&amp;IS is located in three buildings on the UCLA campus in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California]]. Moore Hall primarily houses the school's administration and education faculty. Built in 1930 and designed by [[George W. Kelham]], Moore Hall is among the most architecturally significant buildings at UCLA, an example of the school's original [[Romanesque Revival]] style. During the campus' expansion during the 1950s, the [[modernist]] architect [[Kemper Nomland]] refurbished Moore Hall. The building was again refurbished by the Los Angeles-based architectural firm Robert Englekirk &amp; Associates in 1993. Moore Hall is located directly south of [[Powell Library]], adjacent to [[Bruin Walk]], Kerkhoff Hall and Ackerman Union, in the middle of campus.&lt;ref name="UCLA Buildings"&gt;[http://www.aim.ucla.edu/prof02/bldgs.pdf UCLA Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mathematical Sciences Building (popularly known as "Math Sciences") houses some of the school's research centers, programs, and institutes, in addition to the administrative and faculty offices of the Mathematical Sciences. The building was built in 1957 and designed by Stanton &amp; Stockwell in the mid-century [[modernist]] style. The Mathematical Sciences Building is located in the middle of campus, directly south of Moore Hall, at the north-west corner of the Court of Sciences.&lt;ref name="UCLA Buildings"/&gt; The GSE&amp;IS Building primarily houses the information studies faculty and computer and research labs. Built in 1991, the building is located in the northern part of the UCLA campus, off [[Sunset Boulevard]], directly adjacent to the [[Charles E. Young Research Library]], UCLA's main research library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.admin.ucla.edu/space_plsql/pkg_gui.home?body=pkg_gui.campus%3Fp_loc_id=366 GSEIS Building]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies can trace its history back to a state legislative act in 1881 that established a "southern branch" of the [[California State Normal School]] in [[Los Angeles]]. When it opened in 1882 (on what is now the site of the Central Library of the [[Los Angeles Public Library]] system), its primary responsibility was teacher training. The Department of Education was established in 1894. The school was renamed the Los Angeles State Normal School in 1914, and in 1917 the school was moved to a larger site on [[Vermont Avenue]] (on what is now the site of [[Los Angeles City College]]). The new facility included an [[elementary school]] where teachers-in-training could practice their teaching technique on children. That same year Ernest Carroll Moore (for whom Moore Hall is named) was appointed its director. The [[University of California]] opened its [[Southern Branch of the University of California|southern branch]] in 1919 by replacing the Los Angeles State Normal School with the University's Teachers College. A southern branch of the College of Letters and Science, which enrolled considerably fewer students than the Teachers College, was also established as part of the campus. Moore became director of the southern campus (later [[Provost (education)|provost]]) and [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the Teachers College, a position he held until 1939. The campus moved to its current location in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood, Los Angeles]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="sunsite.berkeley.edu"&gt;Los Angeles: Schools and Colleges.

[[File:Moore Hall West Side.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Moore Hall west side entrance]]
In 1930 Los Angeles City Librarian Everett R. Perry proposed to the president of the [[University of California]] the establishment of a library school on the Los Angeles campus of the University. By 1935 the School of Librarianship was opened at the University's campus at Berkeley (now the [[UC Berkeley School of Information]]), which was later suspended through [[World War II]]. UCLA University Librarian [[Lawrence Clark Powell]], among other Los Angeles leaders, resumed the prewar interest in a library school at UCLA. The [[Regents of the University of California]] approved the establishment of the school in 1958. Powell (for whom [[Powell Library]] is named) resigned his position as University Librarian to become [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the new school. The school was established with collaboration from the School of Librarianship at Berkeley. The two schools initially created a single alumni association and doctoral students took courses, when appropriate, at either campus.&lt;ref name="sunsite.berkeley.edu"/&gt; From its inception the school hired faculty from other disciplines, namely mathematician [[Robert M. Hayes]]. With innovation in [[information technology]] after [[World War II]], library programs became increasingly multidisciplinary, effectively providing a disciplinary home for the interdisciplinary study of [[information science]]. Many library schools have since been repositioned as [[information schools]], schools of information science, or schools of library and information science. ''See the [[Information science#History|history of information science]].''

The School of Education and the School of Library and Information Science were incorporated into the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies in 1994. UCLA is the only major research university in the country that combines these two areas of study into a single school or college.&lt;ref name="GSE&amp;IS Facts"&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/news/facts.html GSE&amp;IS Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2014, Dean Marcelo Suárez-Orozco became the inaugural Wasserman Dean of Education &amp; Information Studies. The Wasserman Endowed Deanship of Education &amp; Information Studies is made possible by the Wasserman Foundation. It marks a historic milestone for the graduate school and the university as it establishes the very first endowed deanship at UCLA. “This gift from the Wasserman Foundation reflects its investment in both UCLA and Dean Marcelo Suárez-Orozco as transformative leaders in education for greater Los Angeles and beyond,” UCLA Chancellor Gene Block stated.

==Departments==

===Department of Education===

Consistently ranked within the top ten [[Graduate School|graduate]] [[School of Education|schools of education]] by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'',&lt;ref name="GSE&amp;IS Facts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/edu/brief/edurank_brief.php "Top Education Programs"] ''U.S. News and World Report.'' Retrieved January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of Education is committed to understanding and improving education practice in a diverse society. The Department of Education is UCLA's oldest unit, since UCLA was founded as a [[normal school]] for the training of teachers. Divisions within the Department of Education include Urban Schooling, Student Affairs, Educational Leadership, Higher Education and Organizational Change, Human Development and Psychology (formerly Psychological Studies in Education), Social Research Methodology, Social Sciences and Comparative Education, among others. The program offers both a [[Masters degree|Masters]] (awarded after one year of study) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] program. The department is especially known for its research in the study of student testing and assessment, teacher and continuing education and development - particularly in urban, multi-ethnic environments, early childhood development, and issues of access, equity and quality facing higher education.&lt;ref name="GSE&amp;IS Facts"/&gt; The department is home to [[National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing]] (CRESST), the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] (HERI), [[The Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles]] (CRP/PDC), the UC All Campus Consortium On Research and Diversity (UC ACCORD), and the Center for International and Development Education (CIDE), among others.

===Department of Information Studies===

Accredited by the [[American Library Association]] and a founding member of the [[I-Schools]] caucus, the Department of Information Studies ranks the 4th most productive and 3rd most highly cited faculty in the latest Budd survey of "Scholarly Productivity of U.S. LIS Faculty" (as measured per capita of faculty).&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, Denice and Budd, John. "Scholarly Productivity of U.S. LIS Faculty." ''Library &amp; Information Science Research'' 28.3 (Autumn 2006):374-389. John Budd is a professor in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies, [[University of Missouri]]. In 2000 Budd published rankings in ''[[Library Journal]]'' 70.2 (April 2000):230; UCLA ranked 8th and 3rd respectively. In 1996 Budd published rankings in ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'' 6.1 (1996):1-20; UCLA ranked 1st and 2nd respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' ranks the Master's of Library Science program among the top 13 in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/library.html "Top Programs in Library and Information Studies"] ''U.S. News and World Report.'' Retrieved December 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, the Department of Information Studies examines the application, communication, processing, representation and social consequences of technology. It also studies the structure, behavior, and interactions of natural and engineered computational systems. Traditionally, it is concerned with the gathering, manipulation, classification, storage, and retrieval of recorded knowledge. The central notion is the transformation and dissemination of information - whether by computation or communication, whether by organisms or artifacts. In this sense, it is more or less a merge of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computing science, and related fields. The UCLA Department of Information Studies is regarded for its cultural studies and social justice approach to Information Studies.

The department offers an undergraduate program in [[Information Science|Information Studies]]; the [[Masters degree|Masters]] in [[Library and Information Science]] (awarded after two years of study), which has three focus areas: Library Studies, Archival Studies, and [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]]; the [[PhD]] in [[Information Science|Information Studies]]; and the Moving Image Archive Studies [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], an inter-departmental program jointly sponsored by the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]], and the Department of Film, Television and Digital Media in the [[UCLA School of Theater Film and Television]]. The department is home to the California Center for the Book, a division of the [[Center for the Book]], the Center for Information as Evidence, and the California Rare Book School, among many other institutes, programs, and research centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/research/ "Research at GSE&amp;IS."] UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. Retrieved January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is known for having a diverse teaching faculty who come from many countries around the world. There are also many adjunct faculty members who teach at the school which adds some vocational instruction to the highly theoretical program.
