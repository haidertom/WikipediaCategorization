      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8948">'''Artificial imagination''', also called synthetic imagination or machine imagination, is defined as the artificial simulation of [[human]] [[imagination]] by general or special purpose [[computers]] or [[artificial neural networks]].

The term artificial imagination is also used to describe a property of [[machines]] or [[Computer program|programs]]. Some of the traits that researchers hope to simulate include [[creativity]], vision, [[digital art]], [[humor]], and [[satire]].

Artificial imagination research uses tools and insights from many fields, including [[computer science]], [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[creative arts]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], [[affective computing]], [[Artificial Intelligence]], [[cognitive science]], [[computational linguistics|linguistics]], [[operations research]], [[creative writing]], [[probability]] and [[logic]].

Practitioners in the field are researching various aspects of Artificial imagination, such as Artificial ([[visual]]) imagination,&lt;ref&gt;''Visual Information Retrieval Using Synthesized Imagery'' http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1282303&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Artificial ([[aural]]) Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;''AUDIO CONTENT TRANSMISSION'' by Xavier Amatriain &amp; Perfecto Herrera, {{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; modeling/filtering content based on human emotions  and  Interactive Search. Some articles on the topic speculate on how artificial imagination may evolve to create an [[artificial world]] "people may be comfortable enough to escape from the real world".&lt;ref&gt;''Hypertext and “the Hyperreal”'' by Stuart Moulthrop, [[Yale University]] http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=74224.74246&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[researchers]] such as G. Schleis and M. Rizki have focused on using artificial [[neural networks]] to simulate artificial imagination.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning from a random player using the reference neuron model'' in the ''Proceedings of the 2002 Congress on 
Evolutionary Computation, 2002.'' http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1007019&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important project is being led by Hiroharu Kato and Tatsuya Harada at the University of Tokyo in Japan. They have developed a computer capable of translating a description of an object into an image, which could be the easiest way to define what imagination is. Their idea is based on the concept of an image as a series of pixels divided into short sequences that correspond to a specific part of an image. The scientists call this sequences “visual words” and those can be interpreted by the machine using statistical distribution to read an create an image of an object the machine has not encountered.

The topic of artificial imagination has gotten interest from scholars outside the computer science domain, such as noted communications scholar [[Ernest Bormann]], who came up with the [[Symbolic Convergence Theory]] and worked on a project to develop artificial imagination in computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth-Century Roots of Rhetorical 
Studies'', by Jim A. Kuypers and Andrew King, 2001. published by Praeger/Greenwood, page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; An interdisciplinary research seminar on artificial imagination and [[postdigital]] art has been taking place since 2017 at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''Postdigital Artificial Imagination''http://postdigital.ens.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

''How to Build a Mind: Toward Machines with Imagination'' by [[Igor Aleksander]] is an academic book on the topic; ''Artificial Imagination'',&lt;ref&gt;''Artificial Imagination'' https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Imagination-Special-Photostory-Washington/dp/098147621X&lt;/ref&gt; a roman à clef, is a non-academic book supposedly written by an Artificial imagination system.

== Typical artificial imagination ==

The typical application of artificial imagination is for an interactive search. Interactive searching has been developed since the mid-1990s, accompanied by the World Wide Web's development and the optimization of search engines. Based on the first query and feedback from a user, the databases to be searched are reorganized to improve the searching results.

''How artificial imagination can contribute to interactive search''

Artificial imagination allows us to synthesize images and to develop a new image, whether it is in the database, regardless its existence in the real world. For example, the computer shows results that are based on the answer from the initial query. The user selects several relevant images, and then the technology analyzes these selections and reorganizes the images'  ranks to fit the query. In this process, artificial imagination is used to synthesize the selected images and to improve the searching result with additional relevant synthesized images. This technique is based on several algorithms, including the [[Rocchio algorithm]] and the [[evolutionary algorithm]]. The ''Rocchio algorithm'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalton, Gerard,|first=Buckley, Chris|date=June 1, 1990|title=Improving retrieval performance by relevance feedback|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199006)41:4&lt;288::AID-ASI8&gt;3.0.CO;2-H/abstract|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science|volume=41|issue=4|pages=288–297|via=|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199006)41:4&lt;288::AID-ASI8&gt;3.0.CO;2-H}}&lt;/ref&gt; locating a query point near relevant examples and far away from irrelevant examples, is simple and works well in a small system where the databases are arranged in certain ranks. The ''evolutionary synthesis'' is composed of two steps: a standard algorithm and an enhancement of the standard algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=December 2008|title=Using an artificial imagination for texture retrieval|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.330.1562&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Artificial Imagination for Interactive Search|last=|first=|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=19–28|quote=|via=|url=http://press.liacs.nl/publications/An%20artificial%20imagination%20for%20interactive%20search.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through feedback from the user, there would be additional images synthesized so as to be suited to what the user is looking for.

== General artificial imagination ==
Artificial imagination has a more general definition and wide applications. The traditional fields of artificial imagination include visual imagination and aural imagination. More generally, all the actions to form ideas, images and concepts can be linked to imagination. Thus, artificial imagination means more than only generating graphs. For example, moral imagination is an important research subfield of artificial imagination, although classification of artificial imagination is difficult.&amp;nbsp;

Morals are an important part to human beings' logic, while artificial morals are important in artificial imagination and artificial intelligence. A common criticism of artificial intelligence is whether human beings should take responsibility for machines‘ mistakes or decisions and how to develop well-behaved machines. As nobody can give a clear description of the best moral rules, it is impossible to create machines with commonly accepted moral rules. However, recent research about artificial morals circumvent the definition of moral. Instead, machine learning methods are applied to train machines to imitate human morals. As the data about moral decisions from thousands of different people are considered, the trained moral model can reflect widely accepted rules.&amp;nbsp;

Memory is another big field of artificial imagination. Researchers like [[Aude Oliva]] have performed extensive work on artificial memory, especially visual memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/38/14325.short|title=Visual long-term memory has a massive storage capacity for object details|last=Oliva|first=Aude|date=|access-date=|doi=10.1073/pnas.0803390105|volume=105|issue=38|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=14325–14329|year=2008|bibcode=2008PNAS..10514325B|pmc=2533687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to visual imagination, the visual memory focuses more on how machine understand, analyse and store pictures in a human way. In addition, characters like spatial features are also considered. As this field is based on the brains' biological structures, extensive research on neuroscience has also been performed, which makes it a large intersection between biology and computer science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5678">A 1996&amp;ndash;2004 research project in the Computer Science Division of the University of California, Berkeley, the '''Berkeley IRAM project''' explored [[computer architecture]] enabled by the wide bandwidth between memory and processor made possible when both are designed on the same [[integrated circuit]] (chip).&lt;ref&gt;[http://iram.cs.berkeley.edu/overview.html Project history.] Retrieved 2011-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was envisioned that such a chip would consist primarily of [[random-access memory]] (RAM), with a smaller part needed for the [[central processing unit]] (CPU), the research team used the term "Intelligent RAM" (or IRAM) to describe a chip with this architecture.&lt;ref name="Micro 1997"&gt;Patterson, et al. (1997) ''IEEE Micro,'' '''17''' (2), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intelligent RAM (IRAM)|url=http://iram.cs.berkeley.edu/slides/japan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the [[J–Machine]] project at MIT, the primary objective of the research was to avoid the [[Von Neumann bottleneck]] which occurs when the connection between memory and CPU is a relatively narrow [[memory bus]] between separate integrated circuits.

==Theory==
{{main|computational RAM}}

With strong competitive pressures, the technology employed for each component of a computer system&amp;mdash;principally CPU, memory, and offline storage&amp;mdash;is typically selected to minimize the cost needed to attain a given level of performance. Though both microprocessor and memory are implemented as integrated circuits, the prevailing technology used for each differs; microprocessor technology optimizes speed and memory technology optimizes density. For this reason, the integration of memory and processor in the same chip has (for the most part) been limited to [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM), which may be implemented using circuit technology optimized for logic performance, rather than the denser and lower-cost [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM), which is not. Microprocessor access to off-chip memory costs time and power, however, significantly limiting processor performance. For this reason computer architecture employing a hierarchy of memory systems has developed, in which static memory is integrated with the microprocessor for temporary, easily accessible storage (or cache) of data which is also retained off-chip in DRAM.&lt;ref&gt;Hennesey &amp; Patterson (2007) Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Since the on-chip cache memory is redundant, its presence adds to cost and power. The purpose of the IRAM research project was to find if (in some computing applications) a better trade-off between cost and performance could be achieved with an architecture in which DRAM was integrated on-chip with the processor, thus eliminating the need for a redundant static memory cache&amp;mdash;even though the technology used was not optimum for DRAM implementation.

== Contribution ==
While it is fair to say that Berkeley IRAM did not achieve the recognition that [[Berkeley RISC]] received, the IRAM project was nevertheless influential. 
Although initial IRAM proposals focused on trade-offs between CPU and DRAM, IRAM research came to concentrate on vector instruction sets.
Its publications were early advocates of the incorporation of vector processing and vector instruction sets into microprocessors, and several commercial microprocessors, such as the Intel [[Advanced Vector Extensions|AVX]], subsequently adopted vector processing instruction set extensions.

A '''branch''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|r|ɑː|n|tʃ}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|r|æ|n|tʃ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|r|æ|n|tʃ}}) or '''tree branch''' (sometimes referred to in [[botany]] as a '''ramus''') is a woody structural member connected to but not part of the central [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a [[tree]] (or sometimes a [[shrub]]).

While branches can be nearly [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]], [[Vertical direction|vertical]], or [[diagonal]], the majority of trees have upwardly diagonal branches.

The term "[[twig]]" often refers to a terminus, while "bough" refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk.

Because of the enormous quantity of branches in the world, there are a variety of names in [[English language|English]] alone for them. In general however, unspecific words for a branch (such as '''rise''') have been [[archaism|replaced]] by the word branch itself.

===Specific terms===
A bough can also be called a '''limb''' or '''arm''', and though these are arguably [[metaphor]]s, both are widely accepted [[synonym]]s for bough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=limb "limb" on Merriam-Webster.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=arm "arm" on Merriam-Webster.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crotch''' or [[Tree forks|'''fork''']] is an area where a trunk splits into two or more boughs.

A [[twig]] is frequently referred to as a '''sprig''' as well, especially when it has been plucked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861712698 "sprig" on Encarta.]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other words for twig include '''branchlet''', '''spray''', and '''surcle''', as well as the technical terms '''surculus''' and '''ramulus'''.

Branches found under larger branches can be called '''underbranches'''.

Some branches from specific trees have their own names, such as '''osiers''' and '''withes''' or '''[[withy|withies]]''', which come from [[willow]]s. Often trees have certain words which, in English, are naturally [[collocation|collocated]], such as [[holly]] and [[mistletoe]], which usually employ the phrase "sprig of" (as in, a "sprig of mistletoe"). Similarly, the branch of a [[cherry|cherry tree]] is generally referred to as a "cherry branch", while other such formations (i.e., "[[acacia]] branch" or "[[orange (fruit)|orange]] branch") carry no such alliance. A good example of this versatility is [[oak]], which could be referred to as variously an  "oak branch", an "oaken branch", a "branch of oak", or the "branch of an oak [tree]".

Once a branch has been cut or in any other way removed from its source, it is most commonly referred to as a '''stick''', and a stick employed for some purpose (such as [[walking]], [[spanking]], or [[beating up|beating]]) is often called a '''rod'''. Thin, flexible sticks are called '''[[Switch (rod)|switch]]es''', '''wands''', '''shrags''', or '''vimina''' (singular '''vimen''').

===History and etymology===

In [[Old English]], there are numerous words for branch, including ''{{lang|ang|seten}}'', ''{{lang|ang|stofn}}'', ''{{lang|ang|telgor}}'', and ''{{lang|ang|hrīs}}''. 
There are also numerous descriptive words, such as ''{{lang|ang|blēd}}'' (that is, something that has bled, or "bloomed", out), ''{{lang|ang|bōgincel}}'' (literally "little bough"), ''{{lang|ang|ōwæstm}}'' (literally "on growth"), and ''{{lang|ang|tūdornes}}'' (literally "offspringing"). Numerous other words for twigs and boughs abound, including ''{{lang|ang|tān}}'', which still survives as the "-toe" in ''mistletoe''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/M0346400.html "mistletoe" on American Heritage.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502092508/http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/M0346400.html |date=May 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin words for branch are ''ramus'' or ''cladus''. The second term is an affix found in other modern words such as [[cladodonts]] (prehistoric sharks with branched teeth) or [[cladogram]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15151">A '''caption contest''' or '''caption competition''' is a competition between multiple participants, who are required to give the best description for a certain [[image]] offered by the [[Competition|contest]] organizer. Rules and information about the competition process are also given by the competition organizer.

== General information ==
Caption contest participants have to describe a given image as accurately and [[originality|originally]] as possible. Contests may vary by image type ([[photograph|photo]] or [[drawing]]), [[Photo caption|caption]] format ([[description]] of a situation or a [[dialogue]]), as well as [[judgement|judging]] criteria. The competition organizer is required to give information about caption submission rules and other information that is important for the contest.

Caption contests are mainly arranged as an [[amusement]], and they can be organized under different conditions (between separate individuals, in public events, [[mass media]], etc.), as well as using various means (drawn pictures on paper, digital image, printed image, press publication, etc.). Traditionally, the most popular and typical format has been publication of caption contests in [[newspaper]]s or [[magazine]]s, but with the development of modern technologies, it is also very popular to organize caption contests on the [[Internet]].

Caption contests can be used not only as an [[entertainment]] but also for other purposes, such as newspaper promotion, bringing forward a certain [[problem]], or product [[advertising|advertisement]]. An important aspect of caption competition is to look at an object, event or issue from unusual point of view.

The caption, unless competition rules do not restrict, can be in any form of literary expression - [[prose]], [[poetry]], as one [[word]] or a [[word play]]. Usually the submitted captions are judged by the originality and [[wit]], but not always the decisive assessment is [[humour]]. It is generally assumed that the caption has to describe image as precisely as possible, so both humour and precision are equally important.

As caption writing is an [[art]] of words, it is rarely possible to evaluate the superiority of one caption over others accurately and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]]. Consequently, the judging of submitted captions is usually quite [[subjectivity|subjective]]. Sometimes competition rules limit caption size, but usually the caption is no longer than one [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (10 - 20 words). As an exception, the caption can consist of several sentences. Usually it is not allowed to use [[profanity|profane]] or offensive language in submitted captions.

In several caption contests, [[champion|winners]] are awarded with [[prize]]s.

== History ==
It is considered that the origins of caption contests are related to the increase of [[popularity]] of [[cartoon]]s and [[comics]] as well as widespread use of [[illustration]]s and the rise of [[photojournalism]] in printed media at the end of the 19th century. All these areas share the combination of words and images that could be multiplied and made available to a wide audience with the beginnings of mass printing and wide spread of newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/earlier-media-achieved-critical-mass-printing-press-yelling-stop-presses-didn-t.html D. J. R. Bruckner. "How the Earlier Media Achieved Critical Mass." ''The New York Times'', November 20, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From currently available information, the first caption contests in printed media appeared in the [[United States|U.S.]] press of the late 19th century (such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-11-07/ed-1/seq-25/ "$1000.00 in Prizes." ''New-York tribune'', November 07, 1920.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published from year 1883 to 1936). At that time these competitions were called ''picture title'' or ''picture headline'' contests, but their concept and meaning was identical to current caption contests. It must be considered, that the term ''caption'' in its present sense firstly appeared in [[English language]] only in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=caption&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 20th century, at least in the U.S. press (for example, ''[[The San Francisco Call]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1912-01-07/ed-1/seq-17/ "The Sunday Call Will Pay $20 for the Best Title for This Picture." ''The San Francisco call'', January 07, 1912.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily News (New York)|The Daily News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-03-23/ed-1/seq-11/ "What does this Picture mean?"

Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Connecticut Post|The Bridgeport Telegram]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/bridgeport-telegram/1921-12-20/page-30/ "$10 A Week for the Best Titles in Sunday Post Caption Contest" ''Bridgeport Telegram'', December 20, 1921, p.30.] newspaperarchive.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) caption contests were already quite popular. In these competitions drawn pictures and cartoons were mainly used. [[Photo caption]] contests appeared little later with the improvement of printing quality (towards the second quarter of 20th century).

During the course of the 20th century, caption contests were published in printed media in many countries of the world. For example, in Soviet Union one of the first caption contests was published in daily newspaper ''Izvestia'' Sunday supplement ''Nedelya'' (''The Week'') at the beginning of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odnako.org/magazine/material/show_14096/ "Золотой глаз-Геолог и Мальтус".] odnako.org. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Little later a newspaper ''Literaturnaya gazeta'' began to publish caption contests that became very popular and they are part of this newspaper up until now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/ "Что бы это значило?".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620052849/http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/# |date=2012-06-20 }} lgz.ru. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of caption contests increased even more with the emergence of the Internet by the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century. Internet has made the organization of caption contests and participation in them possible for wide audiences across the world.

== Present situation ==
Although a considerable amount of caption contests are now on Internet, caption contests in printed media still exist and are quite popular. A very popular and prominent is a weekly caption contest published in American magazine ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904199404576538831896448132 Russell Adams. "How About Never-Is Never Good for You?" ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 10, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The contest first appeared in 1998 and has been published regularly in each issue since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/02/your-caption-here Your Caption Here] The New Yorker. 2 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Each week several thousand participants take part in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/seven-reasons-why-hard-to-win-caption-contest Seven Reasons It's Hard To Win The Caption Contest] Mankoff, Robert. 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Internet, a very popular is the weekly caption competition on ''[[BBC]]'' website (''[[BBC News Magazine Monitor|Magazine Monitor]]'' section), held since 2006.

Along the traditional caption contests, there have appeared different forms of this [[genre]] such as anti-caption contests&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; for worst submitted caption and reverse caption contests where the most suitable picture must be submitted for a given caption. There are also caption contests devoted to particular themes such as [[history]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.archives.gov/prologue/?p=9388 "Thursday Photo Caption Contest"] blogs.archives.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[association football|football]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footytube.com/forums/funny-football/the-silly-captions-competition-2770/ "The Silly Captions Competition"] footytube.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the website caption.me &lt;ref&gt;http://www.caption.me/&lt;/ref&gt; (then captioncompetition.co.uk) was founded, featuring amusing photos loaded automatically from photo-sharing site [[Flickr]]. Visitors submit captions and vote for others. Caption.Me features a real-time collaborative mind-mapping feature called [http://www.caption.me/forum/discussion/557/maption-is-live#Item_0 Maption]

In 2009, there was released an online multiplayer caption writing game called ''[[Caption That (Game)|Caption That]]'' where players write captions for a given image and then vote for their favourite from the list others have written.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionthat.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219001151/http://www.captionthat.com/ |date=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the iPhone app [http://www.captionit.co Captionit] was released on the Apple App Store. Captionit is a free mobile app that allows people to play and create caption contests on their iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/waste-your-creativity-with-captionits-new-iphone-app-483131.htm/ Waste Your Creativity with Captionit's New Iphone App"] SBWire, March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionit.co/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, mobile phone application [http://tinnbin.com TinnBin] was released for both iPhone and Android. TinnBin users create contests called "Bins" by uploading a picture from their device and selecting how long they would like the contest to run. While the bin is open, users can add and vote on comments, called "Tinns". Once the bin is closed, the winning tinn is appended to the image in the form of a caption. TinnBin is different from most other caption contests as the winner is chosen strictly by users of the application, and not the contest creators, and all the contests are created by users of the application.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tinnbin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Yorker'' magazine, noting the popularity of its cartoon caption contest, has created a caption contest [[board game]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731102549/http://www.familyandpartygames.com/pdf/NY_instructions.pdf/ "The New Yorker Cartoon caption game"] familyandpartygames.com.

Also concerning the ''New Yorker'' caption contest, several scientific studies have been carried out: researchers from [[University of New Mexico]], Department of Anthropology, in 2010 have compared humour ability in males and females in context of this competition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000523/ | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2011.03.006 | volume=39 | title=Humor ability reveals intelligence, predicts mating success, and is higher in males | journal=Intelligence | pages=188–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of ''The New Yorker'' editorial board and [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado Boulder]] [[Leeds School of Business]] in 2011 analysed several thousand entries of this contest to study the concept of humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 Leeds School of Business "What It Takes To Win The New Yorker`s Cartoon Caption Contest"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204013344/http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 |date=December 4, 2012}} leeds.colorado.edu, April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future perspectives ==
The future of caption contests depends on the [[imagination]] and [[creativity]] of their organizers and participants, as well as future development of information and [[Information and communications technology|communication technologies]].

== In popular culture ==
In U.S. TV series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', seventh-season episode ''[[The Search (The Office)|The Search]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/the-office/episode-guide/season-7/42801/the-search/episode-715/281549/ "The Search".] "The Office" episode guide. nbc.com.

In a children's novel ''[[Absolute Zero (novel)|Absolute Zero]]'' by [[Helen Cresswell]] its character Uncle Parker has won a trip to the [[Caribbean]] in a caption contest. The rest of the family immediately enter similar competitions in an attempt to better his prize but, much of the time, beating the others to an entry form is a victory in itself.

In season two of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Bored to Death]]'', George (played by [[Ted Danson]]) struggles to caption a New Yorker cartoon, which portrays a police duck interacting with a suicidal bear.

      <comment>Changed "broadcast" to "transmitted" to more accurately describe a two-way radio signal, as differentiated from broadcasting like a TV station.</comment>

In [[telecommunication]]s, the '''capture effect''', or '''FM capture effect''', is a phenomenon associated with [[Frequency modulation|FM]] reception in which only the stronger of two signals at, or near, the same [[frequency]] or channel will be [[demodulation|demodulated]].  

The capture effect is defined as the complete suppression of the weaker signal at the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] [[limiter]] (if it has one) where the weaker signal is not [[Amplifier|amplified]], but [[attenuate]]d.  When both signals are nearly equal in strength, or are [[fading]] independently, the receiver may [[switch]] from one to the other and exhibit [[picket fencing]].

The capture effect can occur at the signal limiter, or in the [[demodulation]] stage, for circuits that do not require a signal limiter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Some types of [[Detector (radio)|radio receiver circuits]] have a stronger capture effect than others.  The measurement of how well a receiver can reject a second signal on the same frequency is called the capture ratio for a specific receiver. It is measured as the lowest ratio of the power of two signals that will result in the suppression of the smaller signal. 

Amplitude modulation, or [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio]], [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] is not subject to this effect.  This is one reason that the [[Airband|aviation]] industry, and others, have chosen to use AM for communications rather than FM, allowing multiple signals [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitted]] on the same channel to be heard.  Phenomena similar to the capture effect are described in AM when offset carriers of different strengths are present in the passband of a receiver.  For example, the aviation [[glideslope]] vertical guidance clearance beam is sometimes described as a "capture effect" system, even though it operates using AM signals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Amplitude modulation immunity to capture effect ==
In FM demodulation the receiver tracks the modulated frequency shift of the desired carrier while discriminating against any other signal since it can only follow the deviation of one signal at a time. In AM, the receiver tracks the signal strength of the AM signal as the  basis for demodulation. This allows any other signal to be tracked as just another change in amplitude. So it is possible for an AM receiver to demodulate several carriers at the same time, resulting in an audio mix.

If the signals are close but not exactly on the same frequency, the mix will not only include the audio from both carriers, but depending on the carrier separation an audible tone (a beat signal) may be heard at a frequency equal to the difference in the carrier frequencies involved. For instance, if one carrier is at 1000.000 kHz, and the other is at 1000.150 kHz, then a 150 Hz "beat frequency" tone will result.

This mix can also occur when a second AM carrier is received on a channel that is adjacent to the desired channel if the receiver's ultimate bandwidth is wide enough to include the carriers of both signals. In the US AM broadcast bands this occurs at 10 kHz, which is the US channel spacing for the AM broadcast band. Elsewhere it can occur at 9 kHz, a commonly used channel spacing in many locales.

Modern SDR-based receivers can completely eliminate this by utilizing "brick-wall" filters narrower than the channel spacing that reduce signals outside the passband to inconsequential levels. Where such an overlap within the passband occurs, a high pitched whistle at precisely 9 or 10 kHz can be heard. This is particularly common at night when other carriers from adjacent channels are traveling long distances due to atmospheric bounce.

Because AM assumes short term changes in the amplitude to be information, any electrical impulse will be picked up and demodulated along with the desired carrier. Hence lightning causes crashing noises when picked up by an AM radio near a storm. In contrast, FM suppresses short term changes in amplitude and is therefore much less prone to noise during storms and during reception of electrical noise impulses. 

For [[digital modulation]] schemes it has been shown that for properly implemented [[on-off keying]]/[[amplitude-shift keying]] systems, [[co-channel interference|co-channel]] [[electronic selectivity|rejection]] can be better than for [[frequency-shift keying]] systems.

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Branches}}
'''Celestial mechanics''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] that deals with the [[motion (physics)|motion]]s of [[celestial object|objects in outer space]]. Historically, celestial mechanics applies principles of [[physics]] ([[classical mechanics]]) to astronomical objects, such as [[star]]s and [[planet]]s, to produce [[ephemeris]] data.

As an astronomical field of study, celestial mechanics includes the sub-fields of [[orbital mechanics]], which deals with the launching and [[orbit]]s [[artificial satellite]]s, and [[lunar theory]], a specialty which deals with the complications of the [[orbit of the Moon]]. Modern celestial mechanics tends to divide between five broad fields of study:
* trajectories of artificial satellites ([[orbital mechanics|astrodynamics]])
* motions of major planets, minor planets, and natural satellites in the Solar system and other stellar systems and widely spaced multiple-star systems (planetary dynamics)
* the motion of component stars and their planetary systems in closely spaced multiple-star systems and globular clusters (astrodynamics and [[stellar dynamics]])
* flow of stars within and among the bodies of large galaxies, dwarf galaxies, and globular clusters ([[stellar dynamics]] and galactic dynamics)
* motions of galaxies and intergalactic dust and gas within galaxy clusters ([[computational astrophysics]])

All of the above fields overlap, but are sometimes treated as separate, especially the study of the motion of stars within [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[interacting galaxy|interactions between whole galaxies]], which both tend to rely heavily on [[fluid mechanics]] (whole stars being particles of the “fluid”).{{cn | date = August 2018}}

==History==
{{For|early theories of the causes of planetary motion|Dynamics of the celestial spheres}}

Modern analytic celestial mechanics started with [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] of 1687. The name "celestial mechanics" is more recent than that.  Newton wrote that the field should be called "rational mechanics." The term "dynamics" came in a little later with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and over a century after Newton, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] introduced the term "celestial mechanics."  Prior to Kepler there was little connection between exact, quantitative prediction of planetary positions, using [[Greek astronomy#Eudoxan astronomy|geometrical]] or [[Babylonian astronomy#Neo-Babylonian astronomy|arithmetical]] techniques, and contemporary discussions of the physical causes of the planets' motion.

===Johannes Kepler===
{{For|detailed treatments of how his laws of planetary motion can be used|Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian problem}}

[[Johannes Kepler]] (1571&amp;ndash;1630) was the first to closely integrate the predictive geometrical astronomy, which had been dominant from [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century  to [[Copernicus]], with physical concepts to produce a [[Astronomia nova|''New Astronomy, Based upon Causes, or Celestial Physics'']] in 1609.  His work led to the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|modern laws of planetary orbits]], which he developed using his physical principles and the [[planet]]ary observations made by [[Tycho Brahe]]. Kepler's model greatly improved the accuracy of predictions of planetary motion, years before [[Isaac Newton]] developed his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of gravitation]] in 1686.

===Isaac Newton===
[[Isaac Newton]] (25&amp;nbsp;December 1642&amp;ndash;31&amp;nbsp;March 1727) is credited with introducing the idea that the motion of objects in the heavens, such as [[planet]]s, the [[Sun]], and the [[Moon]], and the motion of objects on the ground, like [[cannon]] balls and falling apples, could be described by the same set of [[physical law]]s.  In this sense he unified ''celestial'' and ''terrestrial'' dynamics.  Using [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], proving Kepler's Laws for the case of a circular orbit is simple. Elliptical orbits involve more complex calculations, which Newton included in his [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]].

===Joseph-Louis Lagrange===
After Newton, [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange#Astronomy|Lagrange]] (25&amp;nbsp;January 1736&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;April 1813) attempted to solve the [[three-body problem]], analyzed the stability of planetary orbits, and discovered the existence of the [[Lagrangian points]].  Lagrange also reformulated the principles of [[classical mechanics]], emphasizing energy more than force and developing a [[Lagrangian mechanics|method]] to use a single polar coordinate equation to describe any orbit, even those that are parabolic and hyperbolic. This is useful for calculating the behaviour of planets and [[comet]]s and such.  More recently, it has also become useful to calculate [[spacecraft]] [[trajectory|trajectories]].

===Simon Newcomb===
[[Simon Newcomb]] (12&amp;nbsp;March 1835&amp;ndash;11&amp;nbsp;July 1909) was a Canadian-American astronomer who revised [[Peter Andreas Hansen]]'s table of lunar positions.  In 1877, assisted by [[George William Hill]], he recalculated all the major astronomical constants. After 1884, he conceived with A. M. W. Downing a plan to resolve much international confusion on the subject. By the time he attended a standardisation conference in [[Paris]], France in May 1886, the international consensus was that all ephemerides should be based on Newcomb's calculations. A further conference as late as 1950 confirmed Newcomb's constants as the international standard.

===Albert Einstein===
[[Albert Einstein]] (14&amp;nbsp;March 1879&amp;ndash;18&amp;nbsp;April 1955) explained the anomalous [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|precession of Mercury's perihelion]] in his 1916 paper ''The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity''.  This led astronomers to recognize that [[Newtonian mechanics]] did not provide the highest accuracy.  [[Binary pulsar]]s have been observed, the first in 1974, whose orbits not only require the use of [[General Relativity]] for their explanation, but whose evolution proves the existence of [[gravitational radiation]], a discovery that led to the 1993 Nobel Physics Prize.

==Examples of problems==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Celestial motion, without additional forces such as [[thrust]] of a [[rocket]], is governed by gravitational acceleration of masses due to other masses. A simplification is the [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]], where the problem assumes some number ''n'' of spherically symmetric masses. In that case, the integration of the accelerations can be well approximated by relatively simple summations.

:Examples:
:*4-body problem: spaceflight to Mars (for parts of the flight the influence of one or two bodies is very small, so that there we have a 2- or 3-body problem; see also [[Patched conic approximation|the patched conic approximation]])
:*3-body problem:
:**[[Quasi-satellite]]
:**Spaceflight to, and stay at a [[Lagrangian point]]

In the case that ''n''=2 ([[two-body problem]]), the situation is much simpler than for larger ''n''. Various explicit formulas apply, where in the more general case typically only numerical solutions are possible. It is a useful simplification that is often approximately valid.

:Examples:
:*A [[binary star]], e.g., [[Alpha Centauri]] (approx. the same mass)
:*A [[binary asteroid]], e.g., [[90 Antiope]] (approx. the same mass)

A further simplification is based on the "standard assumptions in astrodynamics", which include that one body, the [[orbiting body]], is much smaller than the other, the [[central body]]. This is also often approximately valid.

:Examples:
:*[[Solar system]] orbiting the center of the [[Milky Way]]
:*A planet orbiting the Sun
:*A moon orbiting a planet
:*A spacecraft orbiting Earth, a moon, or a planet (in the latter cases the approximation only applies after arrival at that orbit)

==Perturbation theory==
{{main|Perturbation theory}}
[[Perturbation theory]] comprises mathematical methods that are used to find an approximate solution to a problem which cannot be solved exactly. (It is closely related to methods used in [[numerical analysis]], which [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|are ancient]].) The earliest use of modern [[perturbation theory]] was to deal with the otherwise unsolveable mathematical problems of celestial mechanics: [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s solution for the orbit of the [[Moon]], which moves noticeably differently from a simple [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]] because of the competing gravitation of the [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]].

[[Perturbation theory|Perturbation methods]] start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is carefully chosen to be exactly solvable. In celestial mechanics, this is usually a [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]], which is correct when there are only two gravitating bodies (say, the [[Earth]] and the [[Moon]]), or a circular orbit, which is only correct in special cases of two-body motion, but is often close enough for practical use.

The solved, but simplified problem is then ''"perturbed"'' to make its [[differential equation|time-rate-of-change equations for the object's position]] closer to the values from the real problem, such as including the gravitational attraction of a third, more distant body (the [[Sun]]). The slight changes that result from the terms in the equations – which themselves may have been simplified yet again – are used as corrections to the original solution. Because simplifications are made at every step, the corrections are never perfect, but even one cycle of corrections often provides a remarkably better approximate solution to the real problem.

There is no requirement to stop at only one cycle of corrections. A partially corrected solution can be re-used as the new starting point for yet another cycle of perturbations and corrections. In principle, for most problems the recycling and refining of prior solutions to obtain a new generation of better solutions could continue indefinitely, to any desired finite degree of accuracy.

The common difficulty with the method is that the corrections usually progressively make the new solutions very much more complicated, so each cycle is much more difficult to manage than the previous cycle of corrections. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the [[Moon]]'s orbit ''"It causeth my head to ache."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Cropper |first1=William H. |title=Great Physicists: The life and times of leading physicists from Galileo to Hawking |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-517324-6 |date=2004 |page=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This general procedure – starting with a simplified problem and gradually adding corrections that make the starting point of the corrected problem closer to the real situation – is a widely used mathematical tool in advanced sciences and engineering. It is the natural extension of the "guess, check, and fix" method [[Methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|used anciently with numbers]].

Research on [[tropical]] [[tuber|tuber crops]] is the primary mandate of CTCRI. Each division of CTCRI concentrate its research programmes on separate aspects of tuber crops. '''Crop improvement division focus''' its activities on collection [[germplasm]] of different tuber crops from different parts of the world and conserving it in field gene bank as well as [[in vitro]]. Development of new varieties of tuber crops with higher yield and other attributes suitable for industrial applications as well as for food purpose is another important activity of this division. '''Crop production division''' is engaged in developing new agro techniques for tropical tuber crops in different agro climatic regions. '''Crop protection division''' develop strategies and products for managing pests and diseases affecting tropical tuber crops. '''Crop utilization division''' concentrates its activities on value addition and post harvest processing of tropical tuber crops. '''Section of Extension and social sciences''' is involved in transferring the technologies developed by CTCRI to its clienteles.

==History==
The CIRC was conceived in 2000 by Professor John Robinson and designed by Peter Busby who excelled in green building designs.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221063617/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/history |archivedate=2012-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, they organized and talked to potential partners which led to Alberto Cayuela, formally an employee of Stantec and now associate director responsible for CIRS, joining the team as program manager.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Once funding and concept was decided, the location was chosen.  Originally, it was to be built on the UBC Point Grey campus, but, because CIRS was an inter-instituational project (UBC leads the project in conjunction with Simon Fraser University, BC Institute of Technology, and Emily Carr University of Art + Design) it was felt that the Great Northern Way campus would be a better position.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  In line with the idea of an inter-institutional project, the new position would expand its scope and breadth.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 2008, the decision to move CIRS back to UBC Point Grey campus was made due to delays to the project timeline brought on by the complexity of building on the Great Northern Campus.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Although, now only one institution (UBC) owned CIRS, other institutions continued to participate through other means.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Construction began in 2009 with excavation and foundation work for the first six months with the building being complete in August 2011.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==Building Benefits==

===Structural Systems===
The CIRS is constructed of wood and allows for various benefits such as reducing ecological impact, sequestering carbon, helping the mitigation of an ecological problem, bringing warmth to the building interiors, and also maximizing daylight and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/structural-systems# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221132359/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/structural-systems# |archive-date=2012-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building Materials===
The primary exterior material is white brick, clear glazing, wood, and neutral colored concrete.  The benefits are the reduction of 'red list' materials, improvement of indoor air quality, reduction of material waste, and reduction of carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/building-materials# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216140017/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/building-materials# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Systems===
The CIRS achieves a net-positive energy performance and reduces UBC's overall energy consumption by over 1 million kilowatt hours per year. The energy system benefits the project by providing a comparison between energy modelling processes, allows for more opportunities for research and system testing, inspire a new approach to energy supply/consumption, reduce heat demand and carbon emissions of neighboring buildings, and provide opportunities for continued learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/energy-systems# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216140005/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/energy-systems# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rainwater System===
CIRS is entirely water self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and stored in a 100-cubic-meter cistern underneath the building.  Around 1,226,000 litres of rainwater is harvested throughout the year, and average demand is 2000 litres per day.  The benefits of a rainwater potable water system is that it creates awareness, educates the public on water supply/consumption, reduces potable water demand, promotes stormwater management, and provides an onsite water source for fire suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/rainwater-system# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216135941/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/rainwater-system# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reclaimed Water===
All the reclaimed water originates either from the CIRS building or sewer system which is treated onsite using a Solar Aquatics wastewater treatment system and reused in the building for toilet flushing and to irrigate the living roof, landscaped areas and the living wall.  The main benefit of this treatment system is awareness and engaging the public in viewing sustainability as a possibility.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/reclaimed-water# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216135953/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/reclaimed-water# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lighting===
Narrow floor plates allowed for daylight penetration and light to enter the building from both sides.  The benefits is that it improves the inhabitant health and comfort, creates a friendly space, reduces energy consumption and cost, and provides a surface for photovoltaic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/lighting# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221132349/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/lighting# |archive-date=2012-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventilation===
The CIRS uses a mixed mode system utilizing mostly passive natural ventilation.  There are two mechanical air handling units that supply fresh filtered air: one to the large auditorium and the other to the rest of the building.  In addition, there are manual operable windows that allows for airflow and temperature control.  This system reduces energy consumption, connects the inhabitants with nature, and improve their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/ventilation# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221132404/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/ventilation# |archive-date=2012-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Recognition==
The CIRS has been publicly recognized by many as "North America's Greenest Building" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.thomasnet.com/green_clean/2011/12/05/university-of-british-columbia-claims-credit-for-north-americas-greenest-building/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317110349/http://news.thomasnet.com/green_clean/2011/12/05/university-of-british-columbia-claims-credit-for-north-americas-greenest-building/ |archivedate=2013-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the greenest buildings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.awaken.com/2012/09/five-of-the-greenest-buildings-in-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently in 2013, the CIRS won the Green Building Award awarded by the Wood WORKS! BC Wood Design Awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/2013-bc-wood-design-awards-announced/1002120145/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guggenheim-bilbao-jan05.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim Museum]] in [[Bilbao]] is an example of a structure used for city marketing&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Monclus|Guardia|2006|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''City marketing''' (related to '''city branding''') is the promotion of a [[city]], or a [[district]] within it, with the aim of encouraging certain activities to take place there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1994|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to alter the external perceptions of a city in order to encourage [[tourism]], attract inward migration of residents, or enable business relocation. A significant feature of city marketing is the development of new landmark, or 'flagship', buildings and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1994|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of cities as a marketable product has led to competition between them for inward investment and government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=1001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often manifested in the attempts by cities to attract international sporting events, such as the [[Olympic Games]]. Competition between cities exists at the regional, national and international level; and is an effect of [[globalisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=1001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some places are associated with certain brands and build on each other, but sometimes the commercial brand is so powerful that eclipses the place brand. An example of this is [[Maranello]], Italy, which uses the Ferrari headquarters as a primary attraction for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maranello.it/en/what-to-do/|title=What To Do|last=|first=|date=April 6, 2017|website=Maranello|archive-url=http://www.maranello.it/en/what-to-do/|archive-date=April 6, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City marketing can occur ''strategically'' or ''organically''. An example of strategic city marketing is  [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Benjamin |last=Spillman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=LVCVA: What works here, stays here |url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/43023617.html |work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |publisher= |date= 2009-04-15|accessdate=15 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is promoted through a variety of efforts with the strategic intent of acquiring cultural and economic bonuses. A case of organic city marketing is [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jerusalem - the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.fek.su.se/en/Research/Subdisciplines/Marketing/Stockholm-Program-of-Place-Branding |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=1 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110612234127/http://www.fek.su.se/en/Research/Subdisciplines/Marketing/Stockholm-Program-of-Place-Branding |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is marketed without a grand strategy, as disorganized stakeholders over the course of centuries have glorified the city and encouraged pilgrimage, yielding cultural and economic bonuses. Both cases demonstrate city marketing, each with varying strategic and organic involvement. Generally, organic marketing occurs alongside strategic marketing, as the [[perception]] of the city is impossible to solely construct with strategic efforts. 

According to [[Scott Cutlip]], "one of the first, if not the first, municipal promotion programs" was led by [[Erastus Brainerd]] for the city of [[Seattle]] beginning in 1896. Seattle was in competition with Portland and Victoria as the preferred city in which to get supplied for the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]. A Bureau of Public Information was established within the city’s [[Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Cutlip (1995) ''Public Relations History'', "Seattle shows the way for cities", pp 166,7&lt;/ref&gt;

Like with any successful marketing effort, cities must be willing to commit to a long-term plan in order for their identity and message to be communicated effectively. A shared vision between stakeholders will help develop a cohesive overarching strategy for a city's image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City Branding|last=Dinnie|first=Keith|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-0-230-24185-5|location=New York|pages=150–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative education''' Comparative education is a discipline in the social sciences which entails the scrutiny and evaluation of different educational systems, such as those in various countries. Professionals in this area of endeavor are absorbed in advancing evocative terminologies and guidelines for education worldwide, enhancing educational structures and producing a context to which the success and effectivity of education programs and initiatives can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=M|date=1995|title=Levels of Comparison in Education Studies.|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=65|pages=472-490|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives and Scope ==
According to [[Harold J. Noah|Harold Noah]] (1985),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and Farooq Joubish (2009),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} comparative education has four purposes:
#To describe educational systems, processes, or outcomes.
#To assist in the development of educational institutions and practices.
#To highlight the relationships between education and society.
#To establish generalized statements about education that are valid in more than one country.
#To help the current generation, understand the nowardays education systems, with reference to the past.
Comparative education is often incorrectly assumed to exclusively encompass studies that compare two or more different countries. In fact, since its early days researchers in this field have often eschewed such approaches, preferring rather to focus on comparisons within a single country over time. Still, some large scale projects, such as the [[PISA]] and [[TIMSS]] studies, have made important findings through explicitly comparative macroanalysis of massive data sets. Recent examples in this regard include studies analyzing intra-European &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2018-03-29|title=Elementary Teacher Education in the Top Performing European TIMSS Countries: A Comparative Study|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ies/article/view/74480|journal=International Education Studies|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=152|doi=10.5539/ies.v11n4p152|issn=1913-9039}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intra-American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2018-04-09|title=Comparing the Costs and Benefits of Attending the Top Three U.S. Elementary Teacher Education Programs|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/hes/article/view/74711|journal=Higher Education Studies|language=en-US|volume=8|issue=2|pages=70|doi=10.5539/hes.v8n2p70|issn=1925-475X}}&lt;/ref&gt; teacher education.

== Rationale for the Field ==
Many important educational questions can best be examined from an international and comparative perspective. For example, in the [[United States]] there is no nationwide certificate of completion of [[secondary education]]. This raises the question of what the advantages and disadvantages are of leaving such certification to each of the 50 states.{{By whom|date=June 2018}} Comparative education draws on the experience of countries such as [[Japan]] and [[France]] to show how a centralized system works, and what the advantages and disadvantages of a centralized certification are.

Critics of comparative education refer to it as Policy Borrowing.{{Definition needed|date=June 2018}}

== Disciplinary Identity ==
Comparative education is closely allied to, and may overlap with, [[international education]], [[international development education]], and [[comparative sociology]].

== Comparative and International Education Society ==
The [[Comparative and International Education Society]] (CIES) was founded in 1956 to foster "cross-cultural understanding, scholarship, academic achievement, and societal development through the international study of educational ideas, systems, and practices."

Because memory is not just an individual, private experience but is also part of the collective domain, '''cultural memory''' has become a topic in both [[historiography]] ([[Pierre Nora]], Richard Terdiman) and [[cultural studies]] (e.g., [[Susan Stewart (poet)|Susan Stewart]]). These emphasize cultural memory’s process (historiography) and its implications and objects (cultural studies), respectively. Two schools of thought have emerged, one articulates that the present shapes our understanding of the past. The other assumes that the past has an influence on our present behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Barry. 1991. "Social Change and Collective Memory: The Democratization of George Washington." American Sociological Review 56: 221-236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (2010). 'Culture and Collective Memory: Two Comparative Perspectives'. In. Hall, J. R.; Grindstaff, L. and Lo, M-C. ''Handbook of Cultural Sociology''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiographical approach==

===Time===

Crucial in understanding cultural memory as a phenomenon is the distinction between memory and [[history]].  This distinction was put forward by [[Pierre Nora]], who pinpointed a niche in-between history and memory.

Scholars disagree as to when to locate the moment representation 'took over'. Nora points to the formation of European [[nation state]]s. For [[Richard Terdiman]], the [[French revolution]] is the breaking point: the change of a political system, together with the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]], made life more complex than ever before. This not only resulted in an increasing difficulty for people to understand the new society in which they were living, but also, as this break was so radical, people had trouble relating to the past ''before'' the revolution. In this situation, people no longer had an implicit understanding of their past. In order to understand the past, it had to be represented through history. As people realized that history was only one version of the past, they became more and more concerned with their own [[cultural heritage]] (in French called ''patrimoine'') which helped them shape a collective and [[national identity]]. In search for an identity to bind a country or people together, governments have constructed collective memories in the form of commemorations which should bring and keep together minority groups and individuals with conflicting agendas. What becomes clear is that the obsession with memory coincides with the fear of [[forgetting]] and the aim for [[Authentication|authenticity]].

However, more recently questions have arisen whether there ever was a time in which 'pure', non-representational memory existed – as Nora in particular put forward. Scholars like [[Tony Bennett (sociologist)|Tony Bennett]] rightly point out that representation is a crucial precondition for human perception in general: pure, organic and objective memories can never be witnessed as such.

===Space===

It is because of a sometimes too contracted conception of memory as just a temporal phenomenon, that the concept of cultural memory has often been exposed to misunderstanding. Nora pioneered connecting memory to physical, tangible locations, nowadays globally known and incorporated as ''lieux de mémoire''. He certifies these in his work as ''mises en abîme''; entities that symbolize a more complex piece of our history. Although he concentrates on a spatial approach to remembrance, Nora already points out in his early historiographical theories that memory goes beyond just tangible and visual aspects, thereby making it flexible and in flux. This rather problematic notion, also characterized by Terdiman as the '[[omnipresence]]' of memory, implies that for instance on a sensory level, a smell or a sound can become of cultural value, due to its commemorative effect.

Either in visualized or abstracted form, one of the largest complications of memorializing our past is the inevitable fact that it is absent. Every memory we try to reproduce becomes – as Terdiman states – a 'present past'. It is this impractical desire for recalling what is gone forever that brings to surface a feeling of [[nostalgia]], noticeable in many aspects of daily life but most specifically in cultural products.

==Cultural studies approach==

===Embodied memory===

Recently, interest has developed in the area of '[[Embodied cognition|embodied]] memory'. According to [[Paul Connerton]] the body can also be seen as a container, or carrier of memory, of two different types of social practice; inscribing and incorporating. The former includes all activities which are helpful for storing and retrieving information: photographing, writing, taping, etc. The latter implies skilled performances which are sent by means of physical activity, like a spoken word or a handshake. These performances are accomplished by the individual in an unconscious manner, and one might suggest that this memory carried in gestures and habits, is more authentic than 'indirect' memory via inscribing.

The first conceptions of embodied memory, in which the past is 'situated' in the body of the individual, derive from late nineteenth century thoughts of [[evolutionist]]s like [[Jean Baptiste Lamarck]] and [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Lamarck’s law of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] and Haeckel's theory of [[recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny]], suggested that the individual is a summation of the whole history that had preceded him or her. (However, neither of these concepts is accepted by current science.)

===Objects===

Memory can, for instance, be contained in objects. [[Souvenir]]s and [[photograph]]s inhabit an important place in the cultural memory discourse. Several authors stress the fact that the relationship between memory and objects has changed since the nineteenth century. Stewart, for example, claims that our culture has changed from a culture of production to a culture of consumption. Products, according to Terdiman, have lost 'the memory of their own process' now, in times of [[mass-production]] and [[commodification]]. At the same time, he claims, the connection between memories and objects has been institutionalized and exploited in the form of trade in souvenirs. These specific objects can refer to either a distant time (an [[antique]]) or a distant (exotic) place. Stewart explains how our souvenirs authenticate our experiences and how they are a survival sign of events that exist only through the invention of [[narrative]].

This notion can easily be applied to another practice that has a specific relationship with memory: [[photography]]. Catherine Keenan explains how the act of taking a picture can underline the importance of remembering, both individually and collectively. Also she states that pictures cannot only stimulate or help memory, but can rather eclipse the actual memory – when we remember in terms of the photograph – or they can serve as a reminder of our propensity to forget. Others have argued that photographs can be incorporated in memory and therefore supplement it.

[[Edward Chaney]] has coined the term 'Cultural Memorials' to describe both generic types, such as obelisks or sphinxes, and specific objects, such as the Obelisk of Domitian, Abu Simbel or 'The Young Memnon', which have meanings attributed to them that evolve over time. Readings of ancient Egyptian artefacts by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], the Collector [[Earl of Arundel]], 18th-century travellers, [[Napoleon]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[William John Bankes|William Bankes]], [[Harriet Martineau]], [[Florence Nightingale]] or Sigmund and Lucian [[Freud]], reveal a range of interpretations variously concerned with reconstructing the intentions of their makers.

==Between culture and memory: experience==

As a contrast to the sometimes generative nature of previously mentioned studies on cultural memory, an alternative 'school' with its origins in [[gender]] and postcolonial studies underscored the importance of the individual and particular memories of those unheard in most collective accounts: women, minorities, homosexuals, etc.

[[Experience]], whether it be lived or imagined, relates mutually to culture and memory. It is influenced by both factors, but determines these at the same time. Culture influences experience by offering mediated perceptions that affect it, as Frigga Haug states by opposing conventional theory on femininity to lived memory. In turn, as historians such as Neil Gregor have argued, experience affects culture, since individual experience becomes communicable and therefore collective.  A memorial, for example, can represent a shared sense of loss.

The influence of memory is made obvious in the way the past is experienced in present conditions, for – according to Paul Connerton, for instance – it can never be eliminated from human practice. On the other hand, it is perception driven by a longing for authenticity that colors memory, which is made clear by a desire to experience the real (Susan Stewart). Experience, therefore, is substantial to the interpretation of culture as well as memory, and vice versa.

==Traumatic memory transmission==
{{Main|Transgenerational trauma}}
Traumatic transmissions are articulated over time not only through social sites or institutions but also through cultural, political, and familial generations, a key social mechanism of continuity and renewal across human groups, cohorts, and communities. The intergenerational transmission of collective trauma is a well-established phenomenon in the scholarly literature on psychological, familial, sociocultural, and biological modes of transmission. Ordinary processes of remembering and transmission can be understood as cultural practices by which people recognize a lineage, a debt to their past, and through which "they express moral continuity with that past."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = State Terrorism and the Politics of Memory in Latin America: Transmissions Across The Generations of Post-Dictatorship Uruguay, 1984–2004|last = Fried Amilivia|first = Gabriela|publisher = Cambria Press|year = 2016|isbn = 9781604979190|location = Amherst, New York|pages = 24, 26|url = http://www.cambriapress.com/books/9781604979190.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intergenerationality|intergenerational preservation]], transformation, and transmutation of traumatic memory such as of [[genocide]] tragic historical legacy can be assimilated, redeemed, and transformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adelman|first1=A.|title=Traumatic memory and the intergenerational transmission of Holocaust narratives|journal=The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|date=1995|volume=50|pages=343–367|issn=0079-7308|doi=10.1080/00797308.1995.11822409|pmid=7480412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Recent research and theorizing in cultural memory has emphasized the importance of considering the content of cultural identities in understanding the study of social relations and predicting cultural attitudes.

The Institute of Germanic &amp; Romance Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London, has developed its MA degree around the above-mentioned topics.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100222220029/http://igrs.sas.ac.uk/postgraduate/mamres-programmes/cultural-memory.html MA in Cultural Memory] has now been running for 10 years. This unique degree explores the many different ways in which culture is based on the construction, manipulation and transmission of memories, and the role played by memory in collective and individual identity formation.

The degree programme is supplemented by a Cultural Memory Seminar and by the [http://modernlanguages.sas.ac.uk new Centre for the Study of Cultural Memory].

In 2008, the first issue of quarterly journal ''[[Memory Studies (journal)|Memory Studies]]'' concerning subjects of and relating to cultural memory was published by [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]].

== Other approaches ==
[[Jan Assmann]] in his book "Das kulturelle Gedächtnis", drew further upon [[Maurice Halbwachs]]'s theory on [[collective memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Assmann, J. (1992) ''Das Kulturelle Gedächtnis: Schrift, Erinnerung und Politische Identität in frühen Hochkulturen.'' Munich: Verlag C.H. Beck&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars like [[Andreas Huyssen]] have identified a general interest in memory and [[mnemonics]] since the early 1980s, illustrated by phenomena as diverse as [[memorial]]s and [[retro]]-culture.  Some might see cultural memory as becoming more democratic, due to liberalization and the rise of [[new media]].  Others see cultural memory as remaining concentrated in the hands of corporations and states.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31163">A '''drought refuge''' is a site that provides permanent [[fresh water]] or moist conditions for plants and animals, acting as a [[Refuge (ecology)|refuge]] habitat when surrounding areas are affected by [[drought]] and allowing [[ecosystem]]s and core species populations to survive until the drought breaks.  Drought refuges are important for conserving ecosystems in places where the effects of climatic variability are exacerbated by human activities.

==Description==
Reliable drought refuges are characterised by the ability to retain sufficient water throughout the drought, having [[water quality]] good enough to maintain the life of the ecosystem that are not subject to physical disturbance and that have access to surrounding habitat, so that refugees can [[recolonise]] the main habitat when the drought ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewater.com.au/drought/refuge_habitats.shtml |title=Refuge habitats |accessdate=2011-09-02 |work=Drought Science |first= |last= |publisher= eWater CRC |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[fish]] and aquatic [[invertebrate]]s a drought refuge may be an isolated permanent pool in a stream that ceases to flow and mostly dries up during a period of drought.&lt;ref name=bond&gt;Bond, N.R.

"Drought refuge is a secure place persisting through a disturbance with the critical criterion being that after the disturbance the refuge provides colonist to allow populations to recover."{{Quote without source|date=September 2018}}

For some species the refuge is their only water source and is necessary for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, P. Sam ''Drought and Aquatic Ecosystems: Effects and Responses''&lt;/ref&gt; For birds and invertebrate taxa, the drought refuge is not only necessary for survival but contribute to their reproductive success. Some organisms that are able to adapt to the environment when there is a drought but adapting traits that will be beneficial for survival in a prolong drought is extremely difficult to accomplish.

==Terms ''refuge'' and ''drought''==
The term ''[[refugium (population biology)|refugium]]'' (plural: ''refugia'') was originally used by evolutionary biologists for refuges that protected entire species from disturbance events of large temporal and spatial scales, such as glaciation or the long-term effects of climate change.&lt;ref name =Robson5&gt;Robson, B. J., Chester, E. T., Mitchell, B. D., &amp; Matthews, T. G. (2013). Disturbance and the role of refuges in mediterranean climate streams. ''Hydrobiologia'', 719(1), 77–91.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] involves a temporary removal of biomass resulting in change in physical environment.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a&gt;Parkos, J. J., Ruetz, C. R., Trexler, J. C. (2011). Disturbance regime and limits on benefits of refuge use for fishes in a fluctuating hydroscape. Oikos, 120(10), 1519-1530.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller-scale [[ecologists]] now use this term synonymously with the simpler term ''[[refuge (population biology)|refuge]]'', to define places that protect populations of plants or animals from smaller-scale disturbances, such as fire, flood, storm, or human impacts.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; [[Refugium (population biology)|Refugia]] are the habitats or environmental factors that give spatial and temporal resistance and resilience to biotic communities impacted by disturbance.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a&gt;Magoulick, D. D., &amp; Kobza, R. M. (2003). The role of refugia for fishes during drought: A review and synthesis. ''Freshwater Biology'', 48, 1186–1198.&lt;/ref&gt; Here negative effects of disturbance are lower than surrounding areas or times.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Refugia buffer species long-term, where as, a refuge buffers species short-term.&lt;ref name=Kath1a&gt;Kath, J., Powell, S., Reardon-Smith, K., El Sawah, S., Jakeman, A. J., Croke, B. F. W., &amp; Dyer, F. J. (2015). Groundwater salinization intensifies drought impacts in forests and reduces refuge capacity. ''Journal of Applied Ecology'', 52, 1116–1125.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other uses of the term ''refuge'', such as for a wildlife reserve or a place free from predators (predation refuge).&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A refuge is a place or situation that provides safety or shelter.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Here, species are minimally affected by changing climate conditions.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt;

Lack of [[precipitation]] causes drying of aquatic ecosystems and leads to a natural disturbance called a [[drought]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; In order for organisms to survive a drought, the disturbance must be minimal or there must be a drought refuge available.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;

The severity of a disturbance is measured by its intensity, duration, and recovery time.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Intensity and duration influence the strength of a disturbance and the likelihood of the survival of [[organisms]] within an area.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Recovery time influences the level of recovery abundance and composition in a disturbed habitat until next [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] forces [[species]] to seek shelter.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  Disturbances, such as drought, influence [[space|spatial]] and [[Time|temporal]] patterns of refuge use, as well as the role of refuges in community dynamics.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  [[Climate variability|Variability]] in patterns of disturbance affect refuge use patterns and community structure.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  Decreased time between disturbances increases refuge usage until a certain frequency is reached and the usage declines as a result of the weakening [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] of a species.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Refuge [[Biodegradation|degradation]] increases mortality for sensitive species during larger disturbance times.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;

Droughts decrease surface area and volume, while increasing [[physical body|physical]] and [[chemical]] water quality extremes, such as, temperature levels, oxygen concentration and water levels.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; This links with interactions that structure the communities of different species and affects mortality, birth and migration rates.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; During a [[drought]], species must seek refuge or have [[adaptations]] that provide refuge.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;

Hydrological extremes, such as [[flood]] and [[drought]], modify habitats.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a&gt;Stubbington, R. (2012). The hyporheic zone as an invertebrate refuge: A review of variability in space, time, taxa and behavior. Marine and Freshwater Research, 63(4), 293-311.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Droughts]] lead to not only the loss of habitats, but also to [[isolation (habitat)|isolated]] habitat patches created by the separation of [[populations]] which together form a [[meta population]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Increased [[density]] of [[organisms]] is another result of droughts.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;  Increased organism density leads to [[resource]] limitations, movement limitations, increased [[competition]], and increased [[predation]] pressure.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Droughts also cause changes in food resources and water quality.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;

==Function and importance of drought refuges==
Drought refuges protect [[plant]] and [[animal]] populations from extreme weather events as [[climate]] trends evolve .&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bateman1&gt;Bateman, B. L., Pidgeon, A. M., Radeloff, V. C., Allstadt, A. J., Akcakaya, H., R., Thogmartin, W. E., Vavrus, S. J., &amp; Heglund, P. J. (2015). The importance of range edges for an irruptive species during extreme weather events. Landscape Ecology, 30(6), 1095-1110.&lt;/ref&gt;  They serve as places that support populations of plants and animals not able to live elsewhere in a [[landscape]] during disturbance events, whether those events are [[seasonal]] and relatively predictable, or otherwise.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A [[habitats]] ability to act as a refuge depends on the disturbance.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;  The ability of a refuge to [[retain]] water becomes essential for the maintenance of most populations.&lt;ref name=Humphries3&gt;Humphries, P., &amp; Baldwin, D. S. (2003). Drought and aquatic ecosystems: An introduction. Freshwater Biology, 48(7), 1141-1146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robson4&gt;Robson, B. J., &amp; Matthews, T. G. (2004). Drought refuges affect algal recolonisation in intermittent streams. River Research and Applications, 20(7), 753-763.&lt;/ref&gt; Refuges of sufficient size and duration maintain populations, sustain [[biodiversity]] and may harbour [[relict]] populations.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; They are of particular importance during increasing [[aridification]] when few other suitable habitats remain.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; [[Biota (ecology)|Biota]] depend heavily on seasonal refuges.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refuges increase survival rate and recovery time of populations experiencing an environmental disturbance.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Refugial effectiveness is the ability of a refuge to fulfill habitat-related criteria.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;  Knowledge of refuges in [[mediterranean]] and [[semi-arid]] streams and rivers has increased during the last decade.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;

The disturbance process and the [[Colonisation (biology)|recolonization]] process are two [[ecological]] processes which are associated with how refuges function.&lt;ref name=Chester2&gt;Chester, E. T., &amp; Robinson, B. J. (2011). Drought refuges, spatial scale and recolonisation by invertebrates in non-perennial streams. Freshwater Biology, 56(10), 2094-2104.&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbance process makes locations into refuges and the recolonization process restocks the wider [[landscape]] once a disturbance has passed.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;   Recolonization is driven by [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]], local survival in drought refuges, or [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], high local [[Death|mortality]] with individuals moving back to streams when conditions improve.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pires3a&gt;Pires, D. F., Pires, A. M., Collares, M. J., &amp; Magalhaes, M. F. (2010). Variation in fish assemblages across dry-season pools in a Mediterranean stream: Effects of pool morphology, physicochemical factors and spatial context. Ecology of Freshwater Fish, 19, 74-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The processes of disturbance, refuge formation, refuge function and recolonization occur at varying temporal and spatial scales.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt;  The [[spatial distribution]] of refuges influences the usage and recolonization.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Spatial factors alone have a small contribution. Refuges vary with [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[physicochemical]] factors as well; contribution is shared.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Refuges can be small or large and can be used for short or long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;

Refugia are relative depending on species [[adaptations]], spatial and temporal scale, and disturbance regime.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;  Many relative influences are unclear as each situation is different.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Drought refuges are important for sustaining biodiversity over larger spatial scales.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;

[[Perennial water]]s are the most important drought refuge.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; As refuges, they require the least investment by stream [[invertebrates]] and have the greatest [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennial surface water is crucial to the survival of [[macroinvertebrate]] and [[fish]].&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Differences in [[longitude|longitudinal]] pattern affect the location and function of perennial water refuges.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;

Refuge occupancy is predictable based on [[species]]' [[Phenotypic trait|traits]], but not all suitable refuges within a system are occupied.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Refuge community structure is mostly constant because the response to a disturbance carries across a species; the same species takes advantage of the same type of refuge.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Refugia play a central role in the structuring of communities.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;  Most non-perennial stream [[taxa]] appear to have more than one potential refuge from drought.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; The primary determinant of which drought refuges a species uses in a landscape are its [[intrinsic]] traits.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;

There are specific regions (refuges) to which individuals move during a drought, and within these regions there are specific characteristics of sites used as refuges by different species.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt; A species may use more than one type of refuge during its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A variation in refuge use is caused by [[topography]], individual species [[susceptible individual|susceptibility]] and response to disturbance.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Patterns of refuge use are influenced by disturbance type, species type, patch size, potential occupants and location.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; These patterns are poorly understood.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt;

Drought refuges form [[patch dynamics|habitat mosaics]] which are prone to increased [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] by flow regulation.&lt;ref name=Robson4 /&gt; Some mosaics are more vulnerable to water [[abstraction]] than others.&lt;ref name=Robson4 /&gt; The drying of pools results in a patchy mosaic of pools in a dry channel which vary in suitability for different species and life stages.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Different species favor different sized pools in different locations with different [[physicochemical]] properties.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Refuges with low abundance of species require less effort to be adequate than diverse refuges.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; The size of a pool influences the set of species, total number of organisms, and assembly structure because of physicochemical factors.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; [[Species richness]] and [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]] are related to pool [[morphology (biology)|morphology]].&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; [[Shade (shadow)|Shade]], [[location (geography)|location]], and [[soil]] composition are all contributing factors.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Heavily shaded pools have colder water, where as lightly shaded pools have increased levels of primary productivity.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Large refuges have increased abundance and enrichment and are likely to persist through long disturbances.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt;

While used infrequently and often containing only few individuals during normal years, range edges may episodically serve as refuges from extreme weather events or conditions such as drought.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt; During these extreme conditions, survival probability, [[reproductive success]] or both is higher at the edge than in the core of its range.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt;

Refuge use is influenced by habitat characteristics, such as hydrolic exchange and [[sediment]] type, active [[Animal migration|migration]] or passive habitat use and species morphology, [[behaviour]] and [[physiology]].&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; A decline in refuge use is due to decreased effectiveness of mortality reduction and reduced time provided for community recovery which leads to reduced time between disturbances.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;

Movement into and out of refuge creates predictable fluxes of [[biomass]] and [[nutrients]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  This is important in [[food web]]s and the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  A dense amount of nutrients in one location during a disturbance means increased [[competition]] and [[predation]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  Rates of mortality, [[birth]], migration, and interactions among components of the biota that have retreated to refugia are affected by the nature of the refuge.&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt; The spatial extent, the rate of drying, and the ambient [[physical body|physical]] and [[chemical]] conditions are all contributors.&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt;

Drought refuges for [[algae]] are wide- spread because most med-river [[taxa]] can survive [[desiccation]] and show little specificity for refuges, provided drying occurs slowly.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; They include dry [[biofilm]] on stones and wood, dry leaf packs and [[perennial]] pools.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refuges for [[macrophytes]] and [[zooplankton]] typically comprise egg and seed banks in med-rivers and are resilient to prolonged drying.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;

==Importance of Refuge Connectivity==

&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;[[Drought]] leads to a shift in refuge spacing and connections at different spatial and temporal scales.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Droughts disrupt hydrological connectivity and impact resident species through loss of water and flow from drying, habitat reduction, and reconfiguration.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Delivery of water is restricted to areas within a stream network.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Habitat patches engineered by members of community serve as refuges that are crucial for other members.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Trails and ponds dug by certain species, like [[alligators]], allow for dispersal into refuges.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; Hydrolic exchange provides movement of [[water]], [[nutrients]], and organisms into a refuge.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Populations of [[sessility (motility)|sessile]] organisms, like [[flora and fauna]] in perennial water refuges, cannot persist indefinitely without hydrological connections among refuges.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Mobile organisms, like fish, will move into a refugia if there are no barriers, like physical obstructions (ex: [[dams]], isolated pools), biotic factors (ex: predation, competition), and physicochemical factors (ex: low dissolved oxygen levels).

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; During smaller scale, shorter term disturbances, populations within refuges are not necessarily cut off from those in other refuges or those in other undisturbed [[landscapes]], and so [[genetic exchange]] can still occur, or will occur during parts of the life cycle not constrained by the disturbance. Under those circumstances, the survival of a species is unlikely to depend upon a single refuge.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Recovery processes need to restore connectivity, so that [[Animal migration|migration]] can occur from refuges to new patches of habitat.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennially flowing streams may act as drought refuges for neighboring streams, even if they are not hydro logically connected to them.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refugees must be connected hydrologically at the appropriate times. For [[insects]], refuges on one stream may support recolonization on adjacent streams that are not hydro logically connected, which may also necessitate conservation planning across catchment boundaries.

The drought from 1996 until 2009 had a great impact on the Murray-Darling Basin, in Northern Australia (Murphy and Timbal 2007; Umenhofer et al. 2009). When this drought occurred, it dried the wetlands and water storages (the drought refuge). For many species of birds and fish, the refuge is the only freshwater available. The body of water serves as food and shelter; therefore, it must be conserved. Drought refuges are likely to sustain biodiversity over larger spatial scales such as groups of streams or whole drainage networks. Chester, E. T. and Robson, B. J. (2011), Drought refuges, spatial scale and recolonization by invertebrates in non-perennial streams. Freshwater Biology, 56: 2094–2104.

==Different Types of Drought Refuge==

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A [[species]] may use more than one type of refuge during its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Refugia can be physical characteristics of organisms like short-term [[behavior]] or a long-term evolutionary [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;[[Animals]] and [[plants]] have mechanisms to increase resistance (survival) and resilience (recovery) to physical disturbance.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; They develop adaptations like [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[physiology]], [[behavior]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Physical organism adaptations include an ability to [[aestivate]], mouth orientation that allows for breathing oxygen at the water surface, body armor, and venomous spines.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;[[Motion (physics)|Mobile]] species' coping methods include refuge-seeking behavior; they seek [[habitat]] patches that relieve physiological stress and reduce mortality.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Reliance on dispersal improves resilience to climate change in the short term, but over longer timescales, it will not protect macro [[invertebrate]] [[biodiversity]] from landscape-scale refuge degradation.

&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; The [[hyporheic zone]], a region along streambeds where groundwater mixes with surface water.&lt;ref name=Robson4 /&gt; It is an important refuge for immobile organisms, like [[algae]].&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; The hyporheic zone protects from freezing, high temperature, and [[pollution]].&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; It reduces displacement, with its relatively stable, slow flow.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; In a hyporheic zone, free water is retained, and invertebrates remain submerged.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; The hyporheic zone has been shown to contribute colonists when surface flows recommence.

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Perennial waters, whether pools, seeps or flowing sections of streams, have repeatedly been shown to be the major refuges.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennially flowing stream sections and perennial pools act as drought refuges for a wider area of the landscape than the stream on which they are located.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refuges of a size sufficient to maintain whole [[populations]], such as perennially flowing reaches, are likely to be most important and may, during [[aridification]], become refugia containing relictual populations.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennial pools and perennially flowing water generally harbor the greatest diversity of macro invertebrate [[taxa]] because they require the least investment by the invertebrates.

==Threats and conservation==
Because [[drought]] refuges may provide the only sites allowing populations to persist during droughts, they are highly vulnerable to factors that affect water quality such as [[water pollution]] and [[sedimentation]] from [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] [[surface runoff|runoff]].  Consequently, in areas subject to intermittent drought, [[habitat conservation]] requires the identification and protection of drought refuges.&lt;ref name=bond/&gt;

&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt;Drought is specific to certain regions and climatic zones.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;[[Climate change]] in many med-regions may prolong dry periods and threaten refuges.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; The capacity for perennial refuges to support [[biodiversity]] may be severely compromised due to increasing water temperatures, reducing the quality of refuges by exceeding the thermal tolerance of [[invertebrates]] or by causing [[anoxic waters|anoxia]] in stream pools and existing environmental degradation of many [[perennial]] water-ways.

Droughts have the ability to reduce agriculture products and be the cause loss of crops and lives. Hence, reserving the refuge is of extreme importance in more ways than one. In order to conserve the drought refuge for these species, action needs to be taken that will effect short term and long term impacts that the drought have on the species that dwell on it for survival. In California, efforts to conserve the drought refuge there, include reserving water when possible. Water conservation is done in order to migrating bird populations (National Wildlife Refuge; March, 1, 2016). The National wildlife refuge also takes part in mowing, disking, spraying and controlled burns. These measures are taken in an effort to stop non-native vegetation from growing; this type of vegetation typically out grows the native when in drought. Thus, allowing for native vegetation to survive during drought, leading to the dependent species to forage on the available vegetation. The clean water act was passed in order to protect the American waters from pollution. Although the act does not protect all waters, it protects many bodies of water. When drought refuges are polluted, they become an even greater danger for the dwelling species. The clean water act is just one step in cleaning waters, and saving drought refuges "(The Clean Water Rule; National Wildlife Organization)."

Continuous threats to the drought refuge conservation include; sedimentation, waterhole pumping, and the lack of the structure of the water, it is not near any other bodies of water. These of course, lead to situations where there is an extreme decrease in water availability. As water availability decreases, it increases the chances for dependent species to die out.

&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Groundwater [[aquifers]] support drought refuges for water-dependent ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt;[[Pollution]] and over-extraction of [[groundwater]] are both problematic because it lowers its ability to support groundwater-supplied drought refuges.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Over-extraction lowers the [[water table]] and degrades water-dependent [[ecosystems]].&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Over-extraction often occurs in areas with surface [[water scarcity]] and frequent drought; where groundwater refuges and refugia are most important.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Man-made disturbances can mimic the effects of drought, like water withdrawal, and dams.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; Man-made channel modifications threaten the [[hyporheic zone]] as a refuge.

&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Groundwater [[Salinity|salinization]] compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance,  along with [[irrigation]], causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses [[species]] not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing [[photosynthesis]]. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts.

&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; There needs to be an increased focus on conservation efforts.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Knowledge of refuge functions is critical for understanding their role in conservation of [[biodiversity]], especially climatically sensitive species.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Especially in regions where climate change is increasing the frequency and duration of dry periods.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; To best conserve species facing extreme weather events, it is necessary to identify conditions ‘pushing’ species, and, more importantly, to identify the refuge sites to which individuals move.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennially flowing streams and perennial pools may be crucially important for sustaining biodiversity within a mosaic of stream habitats with drier flow regimes.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt; The primary emphasis of drought refuge protection should be on protecting perennial surface waters and range edges within that landscape.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Conservation approaches for river systems will need to focus on identifying and conserving refuges together with maintaining refuge connectivity, reducing the impacts of other disturbances on these systems, and sustaining predictable seasonal flow patterns.

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Releases from hydroelectricity reservoirs could be used to lower river water temperatures or replenish reaches of formerly perennial flow, thereby creating refuges for river biota.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; Also, focusing on maintaining groundwater quality is more beneficial than focusing on surface water resources.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Re-vegetation can reduce water [[pollution]] in ground and surface water, benefitting biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Robson5" /&gt; There is increasing evidence that habitats created by humans, such as canals, ditches, and farm ponds can support freshwater biodiversity and, therefore, have potential to provide refuges.&lt;ref name="Parkos2a" /&gt; They can prevent larger organisms, like fish, from becoming stranded as water levels decrease.&lt;ref name="Robson5" /&gt; While the preservation of refuges is crucial to provide recolonization sources, it is not sufficient if colonists cannot get from the refuge to habitat patches suitable for colonization.

Conversely, where management of pest species is necessary, controlling them in their drought refuges during droughts may be more cost-effective than broad-scale control at other times.  One example of this is controlling [[rabbit]]s in [[arid]] and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid regions]] of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berman, D. |year=2008 |title=Control of rabbits in arid Australia: destroying the drought refuge. |journal=In: Proceedings of the 14th Australasian Vertebrate Pest Conference, 10–13 June 2008, Canberra |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://era.deedi.qld.gov.au/1405/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarajevo Summer Law School''' is a project organized by the [[European Law Students' Association]] (ELSA) in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

[http://www.summerschoolsineurope.eu/course/4423/media-law-and-role-of-media-in-armed-conflicts]
ELSA summer law schools are organized like seven-day international schools on certain topics in science domains, guided by ideas which are helpful to youth in their academic, but in business upgrade too.

== Idea of project ==

Idea about the project of Sarajevo Summer Law School comes from Darko Dizdarević who was Vice President S&amp;C of ELSA B&amp;H at the moment of its foundation in 2013. The purpose is to expand the knowledge in the area of law through lectures of recognized experts and to gather students from different countries in Europe to exchange their opinions and to create effective network.

== Founders ==

Beside Darko, other founders of Sarajevo Summer Law School are: Nihad Odobašić, Mirza Hebib, Harun Išerić, Amina Mašović, Enida Šačirović, Ana-Maria Paponja, Nasir Muftić, Ajdina Batalović, Emina Agić, Muhamed Tulić.

[http://www.summerschoolsineurope.eu/course/4423/media-law-and-role-of-media-in-armed-conflicts]
Main ideas which characterize this project are knowledge expansion of students about certain law theme which is a base of entire project, education and progressional upgrade of students who participate in project, linking, at the same time, students from all over Europe because of networking as the main goal. ELSA summer law schools are held in summer, and gather approximately 40-50 participants. Inspired by this, ELSA B&amp;H decided to start this unique project, with aim to give unique opportunity to law students from B&amp;H and the other starters across Europe who are going to participate in this project, then to increase academic standard in B&amp;H which did not include an opportunity of additional education on this way, and to improve reputation, structure and organization of ELSA B&amp;H.

== First Sarajevo Summer Law School ==

In 2014, ELSA Bosnia and Herzegovina organized the first Summer Law School on the topic ''Media Law and International Standards on Information Access''. This school was the first law school of this type organized by students in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The idea for this project was created as a result of the need of a detailed and clear proposal solutions of unarranged domain access to information and abuse of media rights to the detriment of conscientious citizens.The school attracted around 40 students from 15 different countries, who had lectures for seven days (7–14 August) at the School of Economics and Business in Sarajevo. Recognized lecturers and experts such as: MSc Dunja Mijatović (The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media), MSc Amer Džihana (Internews BiH), MSc Kristina Ćendić (Internews BiH), Helena Mandić (Communications Regulatory Agency B&amp;H), DSc Marco Bellezza (Associate at Portolano Cavallo Studio Legale), DSc Oreste Pollicino (Bocconi University) and Anja Gengo (University of Sarajevo) attended.

The announcement of the first Sarajevo Summer Law School and promotion of signing a memorandum of cooperation with institutions and non-governmental
organizations were reported by many media in B&amp;H of which is important to mention the state television ˝TV Sarajevo˝ and ˝Hayat TV˝ with contributions in television shows about school, radio station ˝Antena Sarajevo˝ with contribution in a radio show and ˝Dnevni Avaz˝ as a written media. During the lasting of the seven-day school, the following media were reporting : ˝Antena Sarajevo˝, ˝RSG Radio˝, ˝Klix.ba˝, ˝Fena TV˝, ˝TV Sarajevo˝, ˝Ekskluziva.ba˝, and many web portals of student organizations and civil society organizations. Official websites of all the project partners have set
promotional information about the successful realization of the school.

== Second Sarajevo Summer Law School ==

After success of the first school, ELSA Bosnia and Herzegovina organized second Summer Law School in July 2015 on the topic " [http://sarajevosls.ba/?p=205 Media Law and Role of Media in Armed Conflicts "]. The focus remains on the field of Media Law, since this domain was highlighted as a focus programme of the ELSA International.

In existence and development of free democratic society media has an important role. Its original role as a mere transmitter of information in modern society is outdated. The formation of public opinion is considerably dependent on both the monitoring of information and its presentation in public. Growing power of media is evident and it reveals series of sensitive questions about legislation, such as freedom of expression, the right to information, the right to privacy, the right to honor and reputation, intellectual property rights, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Topic|url = http://sarajevosls.ba/?page_id=79|website = Sarajevo Summer Law School|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US|last = elsasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media law as a contemporary branch of law consolidates a large number of areas of law with radio and television, printed media, Internet and on-line services, various forms of entertainment, advertisements and marketing, as the subject to regulation. The interest of authority in this branch of law is significant since the trust and support of public are based on transparency and openness of decision-making process, which is provided by media. The topic of media law is very important and sensitive topic which is one of the reasons of it being selected as the topic of second Sarajevo Summer Law School. The biggest advantage of virtual communication is reflected in the two-way interactive communication, thus enabling denial of incorrect information. Another inevitable media is social media, a product of [[web 2.0]] , which accomplishes a complete democratization of data and information publishing. Nowadays, through social media people have the opportunity to globally affect messages, publish their attitudes, opinions and ideas. Information provided by these sites have had a significant role in the activism in recent years. The best example for that is [[Arab Spring]] in which these social media were used as the key tool for mobilization, training, forming the opinion and affecting the change. Despite the censorship of media and the fact that the national television was not reporting anything about what was happening, amateur footage of the first riots in Tunisia got on the Internet. Thereby, the whole world was informed about the course of these events, and citizens realized they can turn the power to their advantage. People of the Arab world understood that they are not alone, that there are others going through the same suffering and brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Topic|url = http://sarajevosls.ba/?page_id=79|website = Sarajevo Summer Law School|access-date = 2016-01-31|language = en-US|last = elsasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 45 participants not only from Europe, second Sarajevo Summer Law School has grown in one of the most recognized schools in ELSA network, since our law school is one of the 36 law schools under ELSA organisation. The School was honored with presence of highly experts in this field: DSc Vladimir Bratić (Hollins University, USA), MSc Stana Tadić (Humanitarian Law Centre Belgrade), Nedžad Smailagić (Poitiers University, France), MSc Amer Džihana (Internews BiH), MSc Kristina Ćendić (Internews BiH), Nihad Kreševljaković (Sarajevo War Theatre) and Asja Rokša – Zubčević (Communications Regulatory Agency BiH).

Also, the appearance, structure and organization of ELSA B&amp;H are improved through this project, and there is expressed desire and need for the establishment of the Institute of Media Law and the study of Media Law in the frame of the regular curriculum at the Law Faculty in Sarajevo, and to the general public we enabled information about the protection of the rights of the injured through the media, which is extremely necessary for creating a democratic state.

== Third Sarajevo Summer Law School ==

After very successful second Sarajevo Summer Law School, in the summer of 2016. tradition is continued and the third Sarajevo Summer Law School is going to be organized. This year's summer school topic will be completely different from the topics discussed from previous two years.  
This year’s theme is "''Freedom of Religion in Europe''". Freedom of religion is considered by many people and nations to be a fundamental human right. In a country with a state religion, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11628">'''Environmental full-cost accounting''' ('''EFCA''') is a &lt;!--conventional--&gt; method of [[cost accounting]] that traces [[direct costs]] and allocates [[indirect costs]]&lt;ref&gt; Schaltegger, S. &amp; Burritt, R. (2000), ''Contemporary Environmental Accounting: Issues, Concepts and Practice'', Sheffield: Greenleaf Publishing, p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt; by collecting and presenting information about the possible environmental, social and economical [[Cost-benefit analysis|costs and benefits]] or advantages{{spaced ndash}}in short, about the "[[triple bottom line]]"{{spaced ndash}}for each proposed alternative. It is also known as '''true-cost accounting''' ('''TCA'''), but, as definitions for "true" and "full" are inherently subjective, experts consider both terms problematical.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;See [[Green economics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since costs and advantages are usually considered in terms of [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[economic]] and [[social]] impacts, full or true cost efforts are collectively called the "triple bottom line".  A large number of standards now exist in this area including [[Ecological Footprint]], [[eco-label]]s, and the [[United Nations]] [[ICLEI|International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives]] approach to triple bottom line using the ecoBudget metric.  The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has several accredited standards useful in FCA or TCA including for [[greenhouse gas]]es, the [[ISO 26000]] series for [[corporate social responsibility]] coming in 2010, and the [[ISO 19011]] standard for [[audit]]s including all these.

Because of this evolution of terminology in the [[public sector]] use especially, the term full-cost accounting is now more commonly used in [[management accounting]], e.g. infrastructure management and finance.  Use of the terms FCA or TCA usually indicate relatively conservative extensions of current management practices, and incremental improvements to [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] to deal with waste output or resource input.

These have the advantage of avoiding the more contentious questions of social cost.

== Concepts ==
Full-cost accounting embodies several key concepts that distinguish it from standard [[accounting]] techniques. The following list highlights the basic tenets of FCA.

Accounting for:
# [[Cost]]s rather than outlays (see explanation below);
# Hidden costs and externalities;
# Overhead and indirect costs;
# Past and future outlays;
# Costs according to lifecycle of the product.

===1. Costs rather than outlays===
Expenditure of cash to acquire or use a resource. A cost is the cash value of the resource as it is used. For example, an outlay is made when a vehicle is purchased, but the cost of the vehicle is incurred over its active life (e.g., 10 years). The cost of the vehicle must be allocated over a period of time because every year of its use contributes to the [[depreciation]] of the vehicle's value.

===2. Hidden costs===
The value of goods and services is reflected as a cost even if no cash outlay is involved. One community might receive a grant from a state, for example, to purchase equipment. This equipment has value, even though the community did not pay for it in cash. The equipment, therefore, should be valued in an FCA analysis.

Government subsidies in the [[energy production|energy]] and [[food production]] industries keep true costs low through artificially cheap product [[pricing]]. This [[price manipulation]] encourages unsustainable practices and further hides negative externalities endemic to [[fossil fuel]] production and modern [[mechanized agriculture]].

===3. Overhead and indirect costs===
FCA accounts for all overhead and indirect costs, including those that are shared with other public agencies. Overhead and indirect costs might include [[legal service]]s, administrative support, [[data processing]], [[Electronic billing|billing]], and purchasing. Environmental costs as indirect costs include the full range of costs throughout the life-cycle of a product ([[Life cycle assessment]]), some of which even do not show up in the firm's bottom line. &lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Burritt, R. (2000): Contemporary Environmental Accounting. Issues, Concepts and Practice. Sheffield: Greenleaf Publ., p.112&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains fixed overhead, fixed administration expense etc.

===4. Past and future outlays===
Past and future cash outlays often do not appear on annual budgets under cash accounting systems. Past (or upfront) costs are initial investments necessary to implement services such as the acquisition of vehicles, equipment, or facilities. Future (or back-end) outlays are costs incurred to complete  operations such as facility closure and postclosure care, equipment retirement, and post-employment health and retirement benefits.

== Examples ==

===Waste management===
For example, the State of Florida uses the term full-cost accounting for its solid waste management. In this instance, FCA is a systematic approach for identifying, summing, and reporting the actual costs of [[solid waste management]]. It takes into account past and future outlays, overhead (oversight and support services) costs, and operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dep.state.fl.us/waste/categories/fca/default.htm Solid Waste Full Cost Accounting], ''www.dep.state.fl.us'', Department of Environmental Protection, Florida, Accessed 24.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/fullcost/index.htm Full Cost Accounting on Municipal Solid Waste Management at US-EPA], ''www.epa.gov'', US Environmental Protection Agency, Accessed 24.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated solid waste management systems consist of a variety of [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) activities and paths. Activities are the building blocks of the system, which may include [[waste collection]], operation of [[transfer station (waste management)|transfer station]]s, transport to [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|waste management facilities]], waste processing and disposal, and sale of byproducts. Paths are the directions that MSW follows in the course of integrated solid waste management (i.e., the point of generation through processing and ultimate disposition) and include [[recycling]], [[composting]], [[waste-to-energy]], and [[landfill]] disposal. The cost of some activities is shared between paths. Understanding the costs of MSW activities is often necessary for compiling the costs of the entire solid waste system, and helps municipalities evaluate whether to provide a service itself or contract out for it. However, in considering changes that affect how much MSW ends up being recycled, composted, converted to energy, or landfilled, the analyst should focus the costs of the different paths. Understanding the full costs of each MSW path is an essential first step in discussing whether to shift the flows of MSW one way another.

====Benefits====
; Identify the costs of MSW management : When municipalities handle MSW services through general [[tax fund]]s, the costs of MSW management can get lost among other expenditures. With FCA, managers can have more control over MSW costs because they know what the costs are.

; See through the peaks and valleys in MSW cash expenditures : Using techniques such as depreciation and [[amortization]], FCA produces a more accurate picture of the costs of MSW programs, without the distortions that can result from focusing solely on a given year's cash expenditures.

; Explain MSW costs to citizens more clearly : FCA helps you collect and compile the information needed to explain to citizens what solid waste management actually costs. Although some people might think that solid waste management is free (because they are not billed specifically for MSW services), others might overestimate its cost. FCA can result in "bottom line" numbers that speak directly to residents. In addition, public officials can use FCA results to respond to specific public concerns.

; Adopt a business-like approach to MSW management : By focusing attention on costs, FCA fosters a more businesslike approach to MSW management. Consumers of goods and services increasingly expect value, which means an appropriate balance between quality and cost of service. FCA can help identify opportunities for streamlining services, eliminating inefficiencies, and facilitating [[cost-saving]] efforts through informed planning and decision-making.

; Develop a stronger position in negotiating with vendors : When considering privatization of MSW services, solid waste managers can use FCA to learn what it costs (or would cost) to do the work. As a result, FCA better positions public agencies for negotiations and decision-making. FCA also can help communities with publicly run operations determine whether their costs are competitive with the private sector.

; Evaluate the appropriate mix of MSW services : FCA gives managers the ability to evaluate the cost of each element of their solid waste system, such as recycling, composting, waste-to-energy, and landfilling. FCA can help managers avoid common mistakes in thinking about solid waste management, notably the error of treating avoided costs as revenues.

; Fine-tune MSW programs : As more communities use FCA and report the results, managers might be able to "benchmark" their operations to similar communities or norms. This comparison can suggest options for "re-engineering" current operations. Furthermore, when cities, counties, and towns know what it costs to manage MSW independently, they can better identify any savings that might come from working together.

== Motives for adoption ==

Various motives for adoption of FCA/TCA have been identified.  The most significant of which tend to involve anticipating market or regulatory problems associated with ignoring the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole process or event accounted for.  ''In [[green economics]], this is the major concern and basis for critiques of such measures as [[GDP]].''  The [[public sector]] has tended to move more towards longer term measures to avoid accusations of political favoritism towards specific solutions that seem to make financial or economic sense in the short term, but not longer term.

Corporate decision makers sometimes call on FCA/TCA measures to decide whether to initiate [[Product recall|recalls]], practice voluntary [[product stewardship]] (a form of recall at the end of a product's useful life).  This can be motivated as a [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] against future liabilities arising from those who are negatively affected by the waste a product becomes.  Advanced theories of FCA, such as [[Natural Step]], focus firmly on these.  According to [[Ray Anderson (entrepreneur)|Ray Anderson]], who instituted a form of FCA/TCA at Interface Carpet, used it to rule out decisions that increase [[Ecological Footprint]] and focus the company more clearly on a sustainable marketing strategy.

The [[urban ecology]] and [[industrial ecology]] approaches inherently advocate FCA&amp;nbsp;— treating the [[built environment]] as a sort of ecosystem to minimize its own wastes.

==Background==
In the mid 19th century Britain faced reduced timber supplies from the Indian sub-continent&lt;ref name="oost" /&gt; (then [[British India]]) and had turned, under guidance from [[Hugh Cleghorn (forester)|Cleghorn]] towards increased professionalism in forestry at home, and in India. In the late 19th century with Scotland, now established as the British centre for forestry &lt;ref name="oost" /&gt; and successful forestry education in established in [[Dehradun]] this fair was held. Countries and colonies were being invited to produce papers and exhibit products for judgment by British and Indian officials.&lt;ref name="nature2"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v30/n771/abs/030337a0.html|title=The Forestry Exhibition |accessdate=10 March 2012 | volume=30|doi=10.1038/030337a0|journal=Nature|pages=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants (in addition to the [[British India|India]] and hosts [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]) included [[Cape Colony]], [[India]]&lt;ref name="princebook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Prince, Princess and People. An account of the social progress and development of our own times, as illustrated by the life and work of their royal highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales 1863-1889|author=Henry C Burdett|page= 301}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Poland. [[Chile]] was invited but did not attend due to "an unforeseen accident".&lt;ref name="nature1" /&gt;

Plants exhibited included [[Buxus sempervirens|boxwood]] and variants, and the southern African white pear,  ''[[Apodytes dimidiata]]'' (which was mislabelled as ''Pterocelastrus rostratus''&lt;ref name="easyerror"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantab/apodytesdim.htm|title=Apodytes dimidiata|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Visitors==
The, then, [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] visited on 22 &lt;ref name=edinhist /&gt; or 2&lt;ref name="princebook"/&gt; August where they inspected exhibits from colonies and dependencies noting fine wood from [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]].

[[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|R.A.Cross]], [[Secretary of State for India]] presented wood from [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]]&lt;ref name="maceUoE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.general-council.ed.ac.uk/system/files/GC%20Mace.pdf|title=THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH MACE|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the exhibition.

==Legacy==
The wood presented by R.A.Cross ([[#Visitors|above]]) passed to the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, [[University of Edinburgh]], and then to the university's general council who used it to make their [[Ceremonial mace|ceremonial mace's]] shaft.&lt;ref name="maceUoE" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7482">In [[evolutionary biology]], people often speak of the '''four Fs''' which are said to be the four basic and most primal drives ([[motivation]]s or [[instincts]]) that [[animal]]s (including humans) are [[evolutionarily]] [[adapted]] to have, follow, and achieve:&lt;!-- for a citation that animals have these four drives see those that describe or use the term "four drives" or its four terms --&gt; [[fight-or-flight response|''fighting'', ''fleeing'']], [[eating|''feeding'']] and [[reproduction|fornicating]].

Conventionally, the four Fs were described as adaptations which helped the organism to find food, avoid danger, defend its territory, et cetera. However, in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] argued that adaptive traits do not evolve to benefit individual organisms, but to benefit the passing on of genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/619142755|title=The evolution of culture|last=Linquist|first=Stefan Paul|date=|publisher=Ashgate|others=|year=2010|isbn=0754627616|location=Farnham|pages=|oclc=619142755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Four Fs and vertebrates ==
In the case of [[vertebrate]]s, this list corresponds to the motivational behaviours that drive the activity in the [[hypothalamus]]. The hypothalamus responds to these motivations by regulating activity in the [[endocrine system]] to [[releasing hormone|release hormone]]s to alter the [[ethology|behaviour]] of the animal.&lt;ref name="Lambert11"&gt;{{cite article|last=Lambert|first=Kelly|title=A Tale of Two Rodents|journal=Scientific American Mind|year=2011|volume=22|pages=36&amp;ndash;43|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind0911-36|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamericanmind/journal/v22/n4/full/scientificamericanmind0911-36.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hormones include [[epinephrine]] (adrenalin) to increase blood flow and heart rate for a sufficient fight-or-flight response,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/769803483|title=Marks' basic medical biochemistry : a clinical approach|last=Lieberman|first=Michael|date=2013|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|others=Marks, Allan D., Peet, Alisa.|year=|isbn=9781608315727|edition=4th|location=Philadelphia|pages=|oclc=769803483}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ghrelin]], which is commonly described as “the hunger hormone”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sakata|first=Ichiro|last2=Sakai|first2=Takafumi|date=2010|title=Ghrelin cells in the gastrointestinal tract|journal=International Journal of Peptides|volume=2010|doi=10.1155/2010/945056|issn=1687-9775|pmc=2925405|pmid=20798855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other animals ==
Species from other phyla than vertebrates, such as [[arthropod]]s and [[sponge]]s, do not possess a hypothalamus. Hormones that influence the behaviour of [[insect]]s are excreted by [[Neurosecretory Cell|neurosecretory cells (NCS)]] in the [[Insect physiology#Endocrine system|corpora cardiaca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0065280608601320|title=Hormonal Mechanisms Underlying Insect Behaviour|last=Truman|first=James W.|last2=Riddiford|first2=Lynn M.|pages=297–352|doi=10.1016/s0065-2806(08)60132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponges, despite not having a neurosystem, do show signs of behaviour in response to external stimuli, but not much is known about neuro-sensory mechanisms in sponges and whether they possess all four of these drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Renard|first=Emmanuelle|last2=Vacelet|first2=Jean|last3=Gazave|first3=Eve|last4=Lapébie|first4=Pascal|last5=Borchiellini|first5=Carole|last6=Ereskovsky|first6=Alexander V.|date=2009-09-01|title=Origin of the neuro-sensory system: new and expected insights from sponges|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-4877.2009.00167.x/abstract|journal=Integrative Zoology|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=294–308|doi=10.1111/j.1749-4877.2009.00167.x|issn=1749-4877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related experiments ==
In order to explore the influences of the hypothalamus as a drive on the four Fs, researchers lesioned the lateral areas of the hypothalamus of rats. This resulted in a reduction in the interest of eating (''feeding''). If these animals were not fed or cared for they starved to death, even when enough food was present around them. The influence of the hypothalamus is also clear when researchers overstimulated the hypothalamus. When the lateral areas of the hypothalamus were treated with [[Electrical brain stimulation|electrical brain stimulation (EBS)]], the animals would start eating uncontrollably, which resulted in gaining excess weight rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/776541087|title=Psychology: themes and variations|last=Weiten|first=Wayne|date=2012|publisher=Cengage/Wadsworth|year=|isbn=9781111354749|edition=9th|location=Belmont, Calif.|pages=|oclc=776541087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830351091|title=Fundamental neuroscience|last=Squire|first=Larry R.|date=|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|others=|year=2013|isbn=9780123858719|edition=4th|location=Amsterdam|pages=|oclc=830351091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keesey|first=R.

The hypothalamus consists of clusters of highly similarly functioning nerve cells. These nerve cells operate so intimately that signals may get misinterpret.

'''''Galeas per montes''''' is the name by which an enterprise of [[military engineering]] made between December 1438 and April 1439 by the [[Republic of Venice]] and consisting of the transport of ships, [[Galley]] and [[frigate (ship)|frigates]] from [[Adriatic Sea]] to [[Lake Garda]], climbing the river [[Adige]] to [[Rovereto]] and transporting ships by land to [[Nago–Torbole|Torbole]], on the northern shores of the lake. A journey of about 20&amp;nbsp;km through the mountains and the [[Lago di Loppio|Loppio Lake]], now almost disappeared following the construction of the [[Galleria Adige-Garda]], which emptied the lake above.

== Context==
The [[Republic of Venice]] was at the time a power in the Mediterranean and in the fifteenth century began a phase of expansion into the Veneto and Lombardy mainland through military conquests (eg. Padua) or spontaneous "dedication" as [[Vicenza]].  [[Brescia]], to escape the [[Duchy of Milan]], became loyal to Republic of Venice on November 20, 1426 &lt;ref&gt;Alemano Barchi, "Annotazioni alla Cronologia Bresciana civile" 1832 - "... For the noble pacts that the Brescia dedication, she preserved his Senate with the name of the General Council until 1797 ...".

In the 1438, the [[Duchy of Milan|Duke of Milan]] [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], went to war against [[the Republic of Venice]] and with a series of lucky shots took control of Lombard lands up to the southern shores of [[lake of Garda]].  [[Brescia]] was under siege by "captain of fortune" [[Niccolò Piccinino]], in the pay of the [[Duchy of Milan|Duke of Milan]], but resisted, calling on the [[Venetian Senate]] for assistance.

The [[Niccolò Piccinino|Piccinino]] captain took control of the entire southern sector of the lake so the Venetian warlord [[Gattamelata]] ([[Erasmo da Narni]]) could only access from the north of [[lake of Garda]] that is from [[Nago-Torbole|Torbole]] or from Riva, now [[Riva del Garda]].  The milanese army was also barricaded in the castles of [[Peschiera del Garda]] and [[Desenzano del Garda|Desenzano]], making a head-on collision too expensive.  The [[Republic of Venice|Serenessima]] then decided to prepare a military plan that would allow its troops to surprise the Visconti army by moving north of the lake.

On 1 December 1438, after a very long session, the [[Minor Council|Minor Consiglio]] approved the proposal formulated by Blasio de Arboribus, at the service of the Serenissima, and by a Greek sailor, Nicolò Sorbolo.

==Project and realization ==
The two planned to drag along the [[Adige|Adige valley]] a fleet of ships, to take them dry before [[Rovereto]] and then drag them on wooden rollers along the route of [[Lago di Loppio|Loppio valley]] to then drop them in [[Lake Garda]] near [[Nago-Torbole|Torbole]]. From there, the Venetian fleet would have attacked by surprise the Milanese, anchored to [[Desenzano del Garda|Desenzano]], cutting the road to the Visconti militia of presidio a [[Peschiera del Garda]] and forcing the block in order to have successively free for [[Brescia]] and then also for [[Milan]].

== Realization ==

The fleet, consisting of 25 large boats, 2 [[Galley]] and 6 [[Frigate (ship)|frigates]] (or 6 galleys and 2 frigates according to other sources), sailed in January 1439 from [[Venice]] entering the mouths of the Adige near [[Sottomarina]] di [[Chioggia]], went up the river passing through [[Legnago]] and [[Verona]]. There, being the Adige in lean, they had to apply to the boats a sort of "floating" of wood to reduce the draft and continue through the sluiced of Ceraino up to over Lavini di Marco near [[Lagarina Valley]] south of [[Rovereto]], and to [[Mori (Italy)|Mori]].
Hundreds of workers were hired: diggers and carpenters who created a new road made of wooden planks, leveling the ground and removing from the track plants, boulders and even two houses.
In the town of Mori, just south of Rovereto, the fleet was rolled up and loaded onto new invented machines. Then, with the help of 2000 oxen commandeered in the vicinity and hundreds of sailors and rowers of ships with local men, the boats were rolled on rollers over the wooden planks road passing through the villages of Mori, and the [[Lago di Loppio|Lake of Loppio]], which allowed to put the boats in water for 2&amp;nbsp;km. Then the fleet was pulled again and dragged along the steep slope to the Pass of San Giovanni. During the steep descent from the Pass towards [[Nago-Torbole|Nago]] the ships were held with large ropes secured to winches and slid slowly towards the shore of the lake, to [[Nago-Torbole|Torbole]].  The writer of the time that the weight of the ships was such that several old olive trees, which had been set the winches, were literally torn from the ground and that, to stop the descent, resorted to the advent of waiting for the strong wind that blowing from the south in the afternoon and explaining the sails to lighten the weight of the ships.
The complex operation, which lasted three months, cost to the [[Republic of Venice]] the fabulous figure of 15,000 [[Ducats]], but it was one of the most important military engineering works ever built as such, it became famous throughout Europe.

== Consequences ==

The transport of the fleet, however, was not able to remain hidden to the Milanese and so the surprise factor on which Piero Zen, captain of the Venetian fleet, was lost.
The clash occurred near[[Desenzano del Garda|Desenzano]] and the victory was of the Milanese, who were stronger in number and who captured part of the fleet. Only two Venetian galleys were able to repair in the port of [[Nago-Torbole#Torbole|Torbole]].
[[Brescia]] was not freed from the siege, but thanks to the naval control of the northern part of [[Lake Garda]], the Venetians managed to bring aid and food, allowing the city to resist another year's siege.

During the year 1439 was set up in Torbole a second and more powerful Venetian fleet with the material transported from Venice through the already tested route Adige-Loppio-Torbole. In the clash of April 1440 the new fleet, commanded by Stefano Contarini clashed with the Milanese off the [[Ponale]] and this time won the battle, acquiring complete control of the lake.

In the ceiling of the [[Great Council of Venice|Maggior Consiglio]] room in [[Doge's Palace|Palazzo Ducale]] of Venice a painting by [[Tintoretto]] represents the very hard battle with the Milanese.

== Notes ==
&lt;references /&gt;
Citation: ''”&lt;small&gt;Unica viache ancor rimanesse ad approvvigionare Brescia era quella del lago di Garda, poiché essendo la costa orientale di esso formata dal Veronese, imbarcati colà i viveri, facilmente si potevano condurre a Brescia, e se il Piccinino fosse accorso a vietarlo avrebbe facilmente lasciata libera o poco munita la strada da Brescia a Verona. Ma nel lago non avevano i Veneziani alcun naviglio, mentre il nemico teneva un'armetta a Peschiera, e altri posti fortificati all'intorno.''&lt;br /&gt;
''In tanta difficoltà la Repubblica aveva accolto fino dal dicembre 1438 il temerario progetto di un Blasio de Arboribus (o Nicolò Carcavilla o Caravilla) e Nicolò Sorbolo di far passare pei monti una flottiglia dall'Adige nel lago. Componevasi di venticinque barche e sei galere, le quali dalla foce dell' Adige furono fatte salire fino quasi a Roveredo, ma di là erano ancora da dodici a quindici miglia per giungere a Torbole per terreno erto ed alpestre. In mezzo a quei monti e alle falde della catena del monte Baldo trovasi il lago di s. Andrea, nel quale appunto volevasi far entrare la flottiglia.''&lt;br /&gt;
''A quest'uopo furono radunati fino a duemila buoi, abbisognandone ben cento venti paia per ogni galera; gran numero di guastatori, operai, ingegneri sgombravano i borri, costruivano ponti, spianavano la strada, e così, dopo indicibili sforzi e fatiche, poté giungere l'armetta nel lago di s. Andrea. Restava a superare il monte Baldo, e l'umana industria e il ferreo volere anco a questo pervennero e con istrano spettacolo i navigli trovaronsi alfine sulla vetta del monte.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Di colà bisognava gettarli nel lago, operazione non meno difficile pei pericoli della discesa; in quel ripido pendìo legavansi le barche agli alberi e ai macigni, col mezzo di argani allentavansi a poco a poco le funi, e i navigli si calavano da quegli orridi precipizii. Così dopo quindici giorni di viaggio per terra, l'armetta giunse senz'alcun sinistro a Torbole, donde fu lanciata in acqua e munita.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Fu impresa maravigliosa che costò alla Repubblica ben quindici mila ducati, ma sciaguratamente presso che inutile per lo scopo di vettovagliare Brescia, poiché accorso il Piccinino col. suo navilio, poco sollievo poterono avere i Bresciani e il comandante veneziano Pietro Zeno dovette ritirarsi a Torbole e mettersi in salvo dietro a forte steccato.”''&lt;/small&gt; &lt;BR&gt;

The '''Global Implementation Plan to End Violence Against Women and Girls''' was a recommendation from the multi-agency [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on the prevention of violence against women and girls]]. The meeting was convened as part of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|United Nations Commission on the Status of Women's]] multi-year programme of work for 2010-2014.

The "Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls" formed a priority theme for its [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women#Session reports|fifty-seventh session in 2013 (CSW57).]]
{{TOClimit}}

==Background==
The [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] took place in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] 17 - 20 September 2012 and was organised by the [[United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] ([[UN Women]]), in collaboration with the following organisations:
*[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP);
*[[United Nations Development Programme]] ([[UNDP]]);
*[[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA);
*[[United Nations Children’s Fund]] ([[UNICEF]]) and;
*[[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/en/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM announced, [[UN Women]]'s website.]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report that the meeting produced reflected the shared discussion and analysis of the major issues, gaps and challenges identified at the [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] and presented key findings and recommendations. It was intended to build on the individual papers on specific issues provided by experts prior to the meeting, and the background paper prepared by the rapporteur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls.] Background papers. Retrieved 8 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It provided inputs for the reports of the Secretary-General to the CSW and was widely disseminated in preparation to the fifty-seventh session of CSW.

[[EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#A_global_implementation_plan_to_end_violence_against_women_and_girls|Recommendations 106 - 109]] of the [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] calls for a global plan to be launched by 2015, to end violence against women and girls organised along these lines:-

'''Recommendation 109'''&lt;br /&gt;''The Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls, endorsed and supported by Member States at its launch, would aim to:''
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Intensify and scale-up global awareness of violence against women and girls as a global emergency.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Combine the best thinking on how to proceed with concrete pledges for action.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Mobilise international, regional and national action by governments, multilaterals, the private sector and civil society.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Build the foundation for an evidence and practice-informed global prevention strategy.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Increase resources available to end violence against women and girls.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

'''Recommendation 111'''&lt;br /&gt;''Development of the plan would require, among other things:''
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Identification of a small set of key policy, legal and programme-delivery targets (institutions) at the national level towards which global violence prevention efforts can be directed.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Detailed review of existing action plans, indicators, recommendations, platforms for action, policy agendas, and recommendations outlined by the Security Council, UN Treaty bodies, the special rapporteurs, and various UN agencies, with a view to closing implementation gaps and building the next stage.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Creation of a cohesive global community of key stakeholders.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Designation of strong coordinating mechanisms.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Development of an accountability framework with indicators to measure State responsiveness to the policy, legal and programme-delivery goals identified and an independent monitoring mechanism.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==United Nations Commission on the Status of Women - fifty-seventh session==
The [[United_Nations_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women#Session_reports|fifty-seventh session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] took place at the UN building, New York between 4 and 15 March 2013. The agreed conclusions from the session agreed the following four actions:
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening implementation of legal and policy frameworks and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addressing structural and underlying causes and risk factors so as to prevent violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening multisectorial services, programmes and responses to violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the evidence-base.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw57/CSW57_agreed_conclusions_advance_unedited_version_18_March_2013.pdf Unedited draft.] Retrieved 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0252-0117}} [https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2013/27 Final draft, pp. 1-17.] Retrieved 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

[[UN Women|UN Women's]] Executive Director [[Michelle Bachelet]] urged speedy implementation of the Agreed Conclusions saying, "The best way to honour the commitments made by Member States at the Commission is to work for implementation and accountability."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/2013/03/un-women-urges-implementation-of-historic-global-agreement-to-end-violence-against-women-and-girls/ Press release from UN Women, "UN Women urges implementation of historic global agreement to end violence against women and girls", 20 March 2013.

A '''guitar technician''' (or 'guitar tech') is a member of a music ensemble's [[road crew]] who maintains and sets up the musical equipment for one or more [[guitarist]]s. Depending on the type and size of band, the guitar tech may be responsible for stringing, tuning, and adjusting [[electric guitar]]s and [[acoustic guitar]]s, and maintaining and setting up [[guitar amplifier]]s and other related electronic equipment such as [[effect pedal]]s.

Once the guitar equipment has been set up onstage, the guitar tech does a soundcheck to ensure that the equipment is working well. If there are any problems, the guitar tech replaces or repairs the faulty components or equipment. Since guitar techs need to soundcheck the instruments and amplifiers, they must have basic guitar-playing skills, a musical "ear" for tuning, and a familiarity with the way guitars, amplifiers, and effect pedals are supposed to sound in the style of music of their band.  

Guitar techs learn their craft either "on the job", by working in a range of music, sound engineering, and instrument repair jobs; by completing a guitar repair program at a college or [[lutherie]] school; or from a combination of these two routes. The salaries and conditions of work for guitar techs vary widely, depending on whether a guitar tech is working for a minor or regional touring bar band or a major international touring act.

==Duties==
===Setting up and soundchecking===

The duties of a guitar technician depend on the type of band they are working for, and on a range of other factors such as the size and nature of the stage show and the length of the show. Guitar technicians who work for an acoustic band, such as a folk group or [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] ensemble may be responsible for setting up and stringing, and tuning a range of stringed, fretted instruments including acoustic guitars, [[dobro]]s, and mandolins. A guitar tech for a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, on the other hand, may focus mainly on electric guitars, guitar amplifiers, and effects pedals. A guitar tech may change the sequence of effects pedals or alter the settings on effects pedals during the show, to assist the guitarist in creating different tone colours or sounds. For example, a guitarist may ask the guitar tech to connect a [[chorus effect]] and [[reverb]] before a [[guitar solo]]. In an [[indie rock]] band, a guitar technician would likely configure the equipment to evoke through [[Musical tone|tone]] a modern yet historically evocative sound. In an acid rock band, a guitar tech might have to manipulate the controls on a [[ring modulator]] or a rotating [[Leslie speaker]] cabinet to create unusual sounds while the guitarist is performing.

Once the guitars have been tuned with an [[electronic tuner]] and strummed to ensure that they are in tune, the guitar tech usually sets up the different guitars on guitar racks, ensures that the leather or nylon straps are properly connected, and that the patch cords are plugged in properly. During the show, the guitar tech hands instruments to the guitarist or guitarists according to the types of guitar that are required in the songs that they are playing. For example, a hard rock guitarist may use a "flying-V" guitar for a fast song, and then switch to an acoustic 12-string guitar for a soft ballad. The guitar tech retunes all of the instruments before they are used, because even if an instrument was perfectly in tune during the soundcheck, the heat from stage lights and the humidity from the stage conditions may render the instrument slightly out of tune. 

After each guitar is used, the guitar tech cleans the strings with a cloth and replaces the instrument on a rack. During the show, the tech stands ready to replace any guitars in case a string breaks or if there is an equipment malfunction. The guitar tech may hand fresh towels to the guitarist so that the guitarist can remove sweat from the hands and ensure that the guitarist has ready access to bottles of cool water or other wet [[beer|beverages]]&lt;!--Technically, this could be called an easter egg...but it is on the grey zone, because Beer is a beverage...also, it is fun...who said we can't have a little bit o' fun!  --&gt;. If a guitar technician is working for a guitarist who uses [[plectrum|pick]]s, the guitar tech may lay out a variety of picks on a guitar amplifier or tape the picks to the mic stands with double-sided tape, so that they are within easy reach. At the end of the show, the guitar tech disconnects all of the patch cords, cleans the instruments and puts them back into their cases.

===Maintenance and repair===
The guitar tech also might perform any of a variety of maintenance tasks, such as checking that the string height of the guitars is set properly, modifying ("dressing") the height and arc of the frets, adjusting [[Intonation (music)|the intonation of the instruments]], checking that tubes (valves) on [[tube amplifier]]s are working properly, and that cables are in good condition and free from crackles and hum caused by nicks and abrasions in the shielding or cable insulation. Techs also check the batteries on "outboard" devices — effects boxes, tuners, and pre-amps — and wireless transmitters, and change them as necessary. Depending on the size of a band's road crew, the guitar tech may either do this maintenance him- or herself, or, in a large touring act, delegate tasks to more-junior personnel.

The guitar tech does a basic soundcheck with the different guitars, amplifiers, and effects, to ensure that the equipment is functioning properly and that all of the connections between the equipment (which are made with [[patch cord]]s) are plugged in correctly. This may be as simple as plugging an electric guitar into an amplifier or plugging an acoustic guitar into a [[DI box]] and preamp/equalizer. On the other hand, a tech may have to set up ten or more electric guitars, a variety of amplifiers, and connect them to an intricate sequence of effects pedals.  

When all of the instruments and equipment are set up and [[soundcheck]]ed, if there are problems — crackles, hum, no signal from the guitar, no sound from an amplifier — the tech may have responsibility for [[troubleshooting]] to determine the cause or causes. Common problems include damaged patch cords, [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]] in connection between instruments and amplifiers, weak batteries in effects boxes or on-board preamps, bad vacuum tubes in tube amplifiers or overdrive effects, broken electrical connectors or solder joints, speaker voice coils damaged from the previous concert, or equipment damaged during transport. Tuning problems may come from old or dirty strings, damaged or worn machine heads or frets, or mis-adjusted bridges.

A guitar tech is often a "jack of all trades," expected to make simple repairs: resolder a loose wiring connection inside a guitar, replace an amplifier tube, swap out a damaged speaker for a new one, reglue a loose part on an acoustic guitar, or adjust a [[truss rod]]. In cases where there is either not enough time to make the repair, or if the equipment is damaged beyond repair, the guitar tech is may be responsible for finding a replacement instrument or part, either by purchasing or renting it from a local music store or by borrowing it from another band. While another member of the road crew may be dispatched to pick up an item, the tech usually writes down which models or brands are acceptable replacements.

On rare occasions, guitar technicians may be asked to fill in for the guitarist they are teching for.

==Conditions of work==
The conditions of work for guitar techs vary widely. Some guitar techs for small touring acts may set up guitars for all of the stringed-instrument performers—rhythm guitar, lead guitar, bass, and so on; they may even take on a large variety of tasks beyond guitar tech work, such as helping to set up sound equipment or soundcheck the microphones. On the other hand, guitar techs for major touring bands may be part of a large road crew team that includes amplifier technicians, guitar technicians for each guitarist (rhythm guitarist and lead guitarist), and a variety of people who set up the stage equipment. In a major touring band, a guitar tech's duties might be more narrowly circumscribed. They might only have to set up the guitars for a single performer, and there might be other staff who set up and maintain the amplifiers, effects, and guitar stands, and electronics technicians who solder and repair connections and wiring.

The salary, benefits, and accommodations of guitar techs vary widely. The first jobs that a guitar tech does may be on a volunteer basis in a garage band or amateur group, to gain experience, or alternatively the guitar tech might work in return for a small cash payment that is more of a symbolic [[honorarium]] than a real salary. In regional-level bar bands or minor touring acts, the guitar techs may be paid on a contractual basis during the weeks or months that the group is on tour, and there may not be health or dental benefits. A guitar tech working for this type of band must find other work to fill in months when the band is not on tour. On the other hand, a major touring act may hire a guitar technician as a permanent employee and provide them with a range of benefits. 

Accommodations depend on conditions set out in the contract, and the level and status of the group. A guitar tech traveling with a regional-level band may stay in inexpensive motels and receive a modest per diem for restaurant meals. A guitar tech traveling with a major touring band, however, may stay at the same first-class hotels as the star performers and eat catered buffet or restaurant meals. Some bands with substantial road crews may have their own catering crew. Guitar techs for the most famous international guitarists such as [[Jimmy Page]] or [[Tony Iommi]] can become minor celebrities within the guitar fan community because of their proximity to famous musicians and insider knowledge of how a certain guitarist's unique tone is created.

==Training and career path==
Guitar technicians must have a broad knowledge of the musical equipment used in the types of bands they work with. At a minimum, this must consist of familiarity with setting up and tuning guitars and making simple adjustments and repairs. As well, guitar techs are often expected to set up, repair, and adjust electronic effects, tuners, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, and pedalboards. To do these tasks, guitar techs must know about a range of audio engineering and electronics concepts—such as [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], signal phase (for speakers and microphone wiring), and input voltage for pre-amps and effects. To do simple repairs on electronic gear, a guitar tech may have to know how to use a soldering iron and a [[multitester]], and how to do basic electronics troubleshooting.

As well, since guitar techs need to soundcheck the instruments and amplifiers, they must have a knowledge of the way guitars and amplifiers are supposed to sound in the style of music of the band. This means that the guitar tech must have an ear for music, and for musical tones and sounds. A guitar tech for a heavy metal band must be able to tell whether distortion from a heavily over-driven tube amp is desirable tube clipping or distortion from a blown speaker or damaged power amp. The distinctions a guitar tech must make can be subtle. For example, a guitar tech replacing a blown tube with a new one may have to ensure that the tube amplifier still has the same "color" or "warmth" when chords are played through it.

To check guitar tuning, a guitar tech must be able to play major, minor, and other chords in a variety of keys. Even if the guitar has been tuned with an electronic tuner, the tuning still must be checked by ear, because the [[Equal temperament|equal tempered tuning]] of a guitar can involve compromise. Guitar tuning can be affected by fret placement and wear, the angle of bridge angle, string age, and other factors. Thus, even if an electronic tuner indicates that a guitar is 100% "in tune," it may still need minor adjustments which are made by ear. 

The training of guitar technicians varies widely. Some guitar technicians have studied music, guitar repair, amplifier maintenance, or electronics repair in college or university. On the other hand, some techs learned these skills informally on the job, or by working their way up through the ranks in a range of musical jobs, from a [[roadie]] and [[sound engineer]] to a [[sideman]] in a bar band. Guitar techs trained on the job may learn their skills by playing in amateur or semi-professional bands as a guitarist or bassist, working for music stores as a guitar repairperson, for clubs or bars as a sound engineer, or by maintaining equipment for [[PA system]] rental companies.  

A typical career path for becoming a guitar technician via on the job training is to begin by volunteering in a bar band and then working for low wages in a regional touring act or a minor touring act. As they gain experience and add skills, they may seek out better-paying jobs with higher-status touring bands. Once a guitar technician has joined the road crew of a major touring act, they may seek out promotions within this organization, to jobs with greater responsibilities and higher pay. For example, a guitar tech who works as an assistant technician could try to get promoted to a guitar technician for the lead guitarist. A guitar tech who completes a guitar repair program at a college or [[lutherie]] school may be able to enter midway up the guitar tech career ladder.

In the early part of a guitar tech's career, there might be a great deal of mobility between different types of bands and technician roles. While working for minor or regional acts, a guitar tech may be able to work for a country rock bar band and then immediately switch to being the bass tech for a hard rock [[tribute band]], because the tasks are fairly uniform. Career mobility of guitar technicians tends to become more constrained, though, when guitar techs begin to get jobs with high-status professional touring acts from specific genres. When a regional bar band looks for a guitar tech for a summer nightclub tour, there may many guitar techs who could meet the skill requirements. However, if an internationally-known 1960s-style acid rock touring act with a celebrity lead guitarist goes on a major tour, there may be only a handful of guitar techs who have the unique combination of skills for this position.&lt;ref&gt;(E.g., professional lutherie training on how to repair vintage 1960s-era guitars and effects, familiarity with repairing and maintaining 1960s-era rotating Leslie speaker cabinets—and
familiarity with what is, for many, a more obscure music genre).
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bass guitar technician==
[[Bass guitar]] technicians (or "bass techs") perform the same functions for a bass guitar player. The bass guitar is a variety of electric guitar pitched below a regular electric guitar, typically by one octave. Many basic elements of the two types of instruments are similar enough—magnetic pickups routed to an electronic amplifier—that a guitar technician is usually able to work as a bass guitar technician if they become familiar with the unique aspects of the electric bass. The electric bass differs from the electric guitar in several respects. To become a bass tech, a person must learn how to set up the string action (height) and adjust the height of the pickups so that the bassist is able to create the tones associated with different bass styles. Depending on the band, these styles might include such as [[slap and pop]], [[tapping]], or [[upright bass]]-style playing with the thumb. 

As with guitar techs, a bass tech also sets up the amplification equipment and effects pedals. Due to the lower pitch of the bass guitar, this instrument is amplified with specialized [[bass instrument amplifier]]s. While bass guitarists do not usually use as many effects pedals as most guitarists (e.g., reverb, chorus, flanger, etc.), most professional bassists may use a few "sound conditioner" effects such as a [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]], [[limiter]], or [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]]. Some bassists also use octave pedals to generate extremely low pitches or bass overdrive pedals that produce a fuzzy, distorted sound. Although these effects function in the same way as regular electric guitar effects, a bass tech must be familiar with the settings and the resulting sounds and tones that are most often used by bass guitarists. A guitar tech who is in the first stages of learning to become a bass tech may know how to set up the bass effects from a technical point of view, but it may take a little longer for them to learn which compressor settings, for example, are associated with different funk or metal styles.

In some country, [[rockabilly]], or jazz bands, the bass tech might also be responsible for setting up, tuning, and maintaining an [[upright bass]] or [[electric upright bass]]. In some folk or acoustic bands, the bass technician may also be responsible for maintaining an [[acoustic bass guitar]], which is a larger, bass version of a standard [[acoustic guitar]]. More rarely, some bass techs might have to set up a [[bass synth]] (e.g., as used by the bassists in some alternative bands) or bass [[pedal keyboard]] such as a [[Moog Taurus]] pedal, as used by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] or [[Led Zeppelin]]. Both upright basses and acoustic bass guitars usually use piezoelectric pickups rather than magnetic pickups, and in some cases, the instruments may use condenser mics to pick up the higher range sounds. To amplify instruments with piezo transducers and condenser mics, specialized impedance-matching preamplifiers are often required. Also, since both piezoelectric transducers and microphones are more prone to unwanted feedback than magnetic pickups, the bass tech may have to set up a [[notch filter]] with a [[parametric equalizer]] to reduce the frequency that is feeding back.

'''Hans Thomas Hakl''' (born February 27 1947 in [[Graz]], [[Austria]]) is an Austrian [[publisher]], [[essayist]] and [[translator]]. He has also used the signatures '''H. T. Hakl''', '''H.T.H.''', or the [[pseudonym]] '''H. T. Hansen'''.

==Biography==
[[Doctor of law]] ([[Graz University]], 1970), he has founded an international trading company named HHS Handels AG (HHS Trading Company), based first in [[Zürich]] and then in [[Schwerzenbach]], which had 14 daughter companies in 13 different countries, dealing in particular with the [[Far East]], as well as the publishing house Ansata-Verlag,  specialised in studies on [[esotericism]], based first in [[Schwarzenburg]] and then in [[Interlaken]] ([[Switzerland]]). In 1996, he created the esoteric [[academic journal]] ''Gnostika'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aagw-gnostika.de/gnostika/ ''Gnostika''].&lt;/ref&gt; of which he remains co-editor to this date. 
Concurrently with his publishing activities, he has contributed material on matters related to esotericism to several international dictionaries and journals, such as ''Politica Hermetica'', where he regularly publishes book reviews. He has published a book on the « [[Eranos]] » series of colloquia initiated by [[Carl Gustav Jung]] and attended by names such as [[Mircea Eliade]] and several specialists of esoteric and religious studies. The English translation by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] of his book ''[[Nazism and occultism|Unknown Sources: National Socialism and the Occult]]'' was published in 2000. 
He is the author of German translations of the works of [[Julius Evola]], of whom he is an internationally recognized specialist. 
Hakl is the founder of the ''Octagon'' library, one of the most important private European [[libraries]] specialised in the [[history of religion]] and esotericism&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [https://www.hthakl-octagon.com Kurzinformation on Hans Thomas Hakl]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Audiovisual.jpg|thumb|Hi-fi speakers are a key component of quality audio reproduction.]]

'''High fidelity''' (often shortened to '''hi-fi''' or '''hifi''') is a term used by listeners, [[audiophile]]s and [[home audio]] enthusiasts to refer to high-quality [[sound reproduction|reproduction of sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hartley |first1=H. A. |title=Audio Design Handbook |url=http://www.tech-systems-labs.com/books/hartley.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-08-08 |year=1958 |publisher=Gernsback Library |location=New York, New York |id=[[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card No. 57-9007 |page=200 |chapter=High fidelity |quote=I invented the phrase 'high fidelity' in 1927 to denote a type of sound reproduction that might be taken rather seriously by a music lover. In those days the average radio or phonograph equipment sounded pretty horrible but, as I was really interested in music, it occurred to me that something might be done about it. |ref=Hartley}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the lower quality sound produced by inexpensive audio equipment, or the inferior quality of sound reproduction that can be heard in recordings made until the late 1940s.

Ideally, high-fidelity equipment has inaudible [[noise]] and [[distortion]], and a flat (neutral, uncolored) [[frequency response]] within the [[human hearing range]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hi-fiworld.co.uk/amplifiers/75-amp-tests/147-frequency-response.html|title=Frequency response|website=www.hi-fiworld.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Bell Laboratories]] began experimenting with a range of recording techniques in the early 1930s.  Performances by [[Leopold Stokowski]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in [[Philadelphia]] and the Bell labs in New Jersey.  Some [[multitrack recording]]s were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by [[MGM]] (as early as 1937) and [[Twentieth Century Fox|20th Century-Fox Film Corporation]] (as early as 1941).  [[RCA Victor]] began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, [[Avery Fisher]], an amateur [[violin]]ist, began experimenting with audio design and [[acoustics]]. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra—that would achieve high fidelity to the original sound.  After [[World War II]], [[Harry F. Olson]] conducted an experiment whereby test subjects listened to a live orchestra through a hidden variable acoustic filter. The results proved that listeners preferred high fidelity reproduction, once the noise and distortion introduced by early sound equipment was removed.

Beginning in 1948, several innovations created the conditions that made for major improvements of home-audio quality possible:

* [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording]], based on technology taken from Germany after WWII, helped musical artists such as [[Bing Crosby]] make and distribute recordings with better fidelity.
* The advent of the 33⅓ rpm [[Long Play]] (LP) microgroove [[vinyl record]], with lower surface noise and quantitatively specified [[RIAA equalization|equalization curves]] as well as noise-reduction and dynamic range systems. [[Classical music]] fans, who were [[opinion leadership|opinion leaders]] in the audio market, quickly adopted LPs because, unlike with older records, most classical works would fit on a single LP.
* [[FM radio]], with wider audio bandwidth and less susceptibility to signal interference and fading than [[AM radio]].
* Better [[electronic amplifier|amplifier]] designs, with more attention to frequency response and much higher power output capability, reproducing audio without perceptible [[distortion]].&lt;ref name="Lander"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/3/2006_3_13.shtml David Lander] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223172555/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/3/2006_3_13.shtml |date=2007-02-23 }} "The Buyable Past: Classic Hi-Fi Components," ''American Heritage'', June/July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* New [[loudspeaker]] designs, including acoustic suspension, developed by [[Edgar Villchur]] and [[Henry Kloss]] improved bass frequency response.

In the 1950s, audio manufacturers employed the phrase ''high fidelity'' as a marketing term to describe records and equipment intended to provide faithful sound reproduction. While some consumers simply interpreted ''high fidelity'' as fancy and expensive equipment, many found the difference in quality between "hi-fi" and the then standard AM radios and 78 rpm records readily apparent and bought 33⅓ LPs such as [[RCA]]'s New Orthophonics and London's ffrr (Full Frequency Range Recording, a UK [[Decca Records|Decca]] system); and high-fidelity phonographs. Audiophiles paid attention to technical characteristics and bought individual components, such as separate turntables, radio tuners, [[preamplifier]]s, [[power amplifier]]s and loudspeakers. Some enthusiasts even assembled their own loudspeaker systems. In the 1950s, ''hi-fi'' became a generic term for home sound equipment, to some extent displacing ''phonograph'' and ''record player''.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the development of the [[Western Electric|Westrex]] single-groove [[stereophonic]] record cutterhead led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance ''stereo'' displaced ''hi-fi''. Records were now played on ''a stereo''. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of ''high fidelity'' continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the "Golden Age of Hi-Fi", when [[vacuum tube]] equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered endearing by modern audiophiles, and just before [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] ([[transistor]]ized) equipment was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.

A popular type of system for reproducing music beginning in the 1970s was the integrated [[music centre]]—which combined a phonograph turntable, AM-FM radio tuner, tape player, preamplifier, and power amplifier in one package, often sold with its own separate, detachable or integrated speakers. These systems advertised their simplicity. The consumer did not have to select and assemble individual components, or be familiar with impedance and power ratings. Purists generally avoid referring to these systems as high fidelity, though some are capable of very good quality sound reproduction. Audiophiles in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to buy each component separately. That way, they could choose models of each component with the specifications that they desired. In the 1980s, a number of audiophile magazines became available, offering reviews of components and articles on how to choose and test speakers, amplifiers and other components.

== Listening tests ==
Listening tests are used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile magazines and [[audio engineering]] researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done in such a way that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgment. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use [[Blind experiment|blind tests]], in which the researchers can see the components being tested, but the listeners undergoing the experiments can't. In a [[double-blind experiment]], neither the listeners nor the researchers know who belongs to the [[control group]] and the [[experimental group]], or which type of audio component is being used for which listening sample. Only after all the data has been recorded (and in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which components or recordings were preferred by the listeners. A commonly used variant of this test is the [[ABX test]]. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample ''A'', the reference, and sample ''B'', an alternative), and one unknown sample ''X,'' for three samples total. ''X'' is randomly selected from ''A'' and ''B'', and the subject identifies ''X'' as being either ''A'' or ''B''. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is [[Transparency (data compression)|transparent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spanos, Aris|year=1999|title= Probability Theory and Statistical Inference |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page=699 |isbn= 0-521-42408-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is ''not'' transparent.

Scientific double-blind tests are sometimes used as part of attempts to ascertain whether certain audio components (such as expensive, exotic cables) have any subjectively perceivable effect on sound quality. Data gleaned from these double-blind tests is not accepted by some "audiophile" magazines such as ''[[Stereophile]]'' and ''[[The Absolute Sound]]'' in their evaluations of audio equipment. [[John Atkinson (music editor)|John Atkinson]], current editor of ''Stereophile'', stated (in a 2005 July editorial named ''Blind Tests &amp; Bus Stops'') that he once purchased a solid-state amplifier, the Quad 405, in 1978 after seeing the results from blind tests, but came to realize months later that "the magic was gone" until he replaced it with a tube amp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/705awsi |date=2005-07-17 |author=John Atkinson |title=Blind Tests &amp; Bus Stops}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Harley of ''The Absolute Sound'' wrote, in a 2008 editorial (on Issue 183), that: "...blind listening tests fundamentally distort the listening process and are worthless in determining the audibility of a certain phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avguide.com/forums/blind-listening-tests-are-flawed-editorial?page=2 |author=Robert Harley |title=Blind Listening Tests are Flawed: An Editorial |publisher=The Absolute Sound |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930084747/http://www.avguide.com/forums/blind-listening-tests-are-flawed-editorial?page=2 |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doug Schneider, editor of the online Soundstage network, refuted this position with two editorials in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodsound.com/editorial/200905.htm |author=Doug Schneider |title=The Misinformed Misleading the Uninformed – A Bit About Blind Listening Tests |publisher=GoodSound! |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodsound.com/editorial/200906.htm |author=Doug Schneider |title=A Bit More About Blind Listening Tests (6/2009) |publisher=GoodSound! |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He stated: "Blind tests are at the core of the decades' worth of research into loudspeaker design done at Canada's National Research Council (NRC). The NRC researchers knew that for their result to be credible within the scientific community and to have the most meaningful results, they had to eliminate bias, and blind testing was the only way to do so." Many Canadian companies such as Axiom, Energy, Mirage, Paradigm, PSB and Revel use blind testing extensively in designing their loudspeakers. Audio professional Dr. Sean Olive of Harman International shares this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Sean Olive |url=http://seanolive.blogspot.com/2009/04/dishonesty-of-sighted-audio-product.html |title=The Dishonesty of Sighted Listening Tests |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Semblance of realism ==
[[Stereophonic]] sound provided a partial solution to the problem of creating the [[auditory illusion|illusion]] of live orchestral performers by creating a phantom middle channel when the listener sits exactly in the middle of the two front loudspeakers. When the listener moves slightly to the side, however, this phantom channel disappears or is greatly reduced. An attempt to provide for the reproduction of the reverberation was tried in the 1970s through [[quadraphonic sound]] but, again, the technology at that time was insufficient for the task. Consumers did not want to pay the additional costs and space required for the marginal improvements in realism. With the rise in popularity of [[home cinema|home theater]], however, multi-channel playback systems became affordable, and many consumers were willing to tolerate the six to eight channels required in a home theater. The advances made in [[digital signal processor|signal processors]] to synthesize an approximation of a good concert hall can now provide a somewhat more realistic illusion of listening in a concert hall.

In addition to spatial realism, the playback of music must be subjectively free from noise, such as hiss or hum, to achieve realism. The [[compact disc]] (CD) provides about 90 [[decibel]]s of [[dynamic range]],&lt;ref name="Fries2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Audio Essentials |last=Fries |first=Bruce |author2=Marty Fries |year=2005 |publisher=O'Reilly Media |isbn=0-596-00856-2 |pages=144–147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0vsd5z2Rg4C&amp;pg=PA147 |quote=Digital audio at 16-bit resolution has a theoretical dynamic range of 96 dB, but the actual dynamic range is usually lower because of overhead from filters that are built into most audio systems." ... "Audio CDs achieve about a 90-dB signal-to-noise ratio." "Most adults can't hear frequencies higher than 15&amp;nbsp;kHz, so the 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate of CD audio is more than adequate to reproduce the highest frequencies most people can hear.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which exceeds the 80&amp;nbsp;dB dynamic range of music as normally perceived in a concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Recording Engineering |last=Eargle |first=John |authorlink=John M. Eargle |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-28470-2 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00m1SlorUcIC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Audio equipment must be able to reproduce frequencies high enough and low enough to be realistic. The human hearing range, for healthy young persons, is 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D'Ambrose|first=Chris|year=2003|title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|work=The Physics Factbook|accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most adults can't hear higher than 15&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Fries2005"/&gt; CDs are capable of reproducing frequencies as low as 0&amp;nbsp;Hz and as high as 22.05&amp;nbsp;kHz, making them adequate for reproducing the frequency range that most humans can hear.&lt;ref name="Fries2005"/&gt; The equipment must also provide no noticeable distortion of the [[signal (information theory)|signal]] or emphasis or de-emphasis of any frequency in this frequency range.

== Modularity {{anchor|integrated|mini|lifestyle|midi}}==
[[File:HK AVR 245.jpg|thumb|Modular components made by [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] and [[Harman Kardon]]]]
''Integrated'', ''mini'', or ''lifestyle'' systems (also known by the older terms ''[[music centre]]'' or ''midi system''&lt;ref name='argos_midi' /&gt;&lt;ref name='matsui_midi_47' /&gt;) contain one or more sources such as a [[Compact Disc player|CD player]], a [[tuner (radio)|tuner]], or a [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] deck together with a [[preamplifier]] and a [[power amplifier]] in one box. Although some [[High-end audio|high-end]] manufacturers do produce integrated systems, such products are generally disparaged by [[audiophile]]s, who prefer to build a system from ''separates'' (or ''components''), often with each item from a different manufacturer specialising in a particular component. This provides the most flexibility for piece-by-piece upgrades and repairs.

For slightly less flexibility in [[upgrade]]s, a [[preamplifier]] and a power [[amplifier]] in one box is called an ''[[integrated amplifier]]''; with a tuner, it is a ''[[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]''. A monophonic power amplifier, which is called a ''[[Amplifier|monoblock]]'', is often used for powering a [[subwoofer]]. Other modules in the system may include components like [[magnetic cartridge|cartridges]], [[tonearm]]s, hi-fi [[phonograph|turntable]]s, [[Digital Media Player]]s, [[digital audio player]]s, [[DVD]] players that play a wide variety of discs including [[CD]]s, [[CD recorder]]s, [[MiniDisc]] recorders, hi-fi [[videocassette recorder]]s (VCRs) and [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] [[tape recorder]]s. Signal modification equipment can include [[Equalization (audio)|equalizers]] and [[signal processor]]s.

This modularity allows the enthusiast to spend as little or as much as they want on a component that suits their specific needs. In a system built from separates, sometimes a failure on one component still allows partial use of the rest of the system. A repair of an integrated system, though, means complete lack of use of the system. Another advantage of modularity is the ability to spend money on only a few core components at first and then later add additional components to the system. Some of the disadvantages of this approach are increased cost, complexity, and space required for the components.

== Modern equipment ==
In the 2000s, modern hi-fi equipment can include signal sources such as [[digital audio tape]] (DAT), [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) or [[HD Radio]] tuners. Some modern hi-fi equipment can be digitally connected using [[fibre optic]] [[TOSLINK]] cables, [[USB|universal serial bus]] (USB) ports (including one to play digital audio files), or [[Wi-Fi]] support. Another modern component is the ''music server'' consisting of one or more [[computer]] [[hard disk|hard drives]] that hold music in the form of [[computer file]]s. When the music is stored in an [[audio file format]] that is [[lossless]] such as [[FLAC]], [[Monkey's Audio]] or [[WMA Lossless]], the computer playback of recorded audio can serve as an audiophile-quality source for a hi-fi system.

The '''National Science Center Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology (KIPT)''' ({{lang-uk|Національний науковий центр «Харківський фізико-технічний інститут»}}, formerly Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology) is the oldest and largest [[physical science]] research centre in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kipt.kharkov.ua/en/bhr.html|title=History {{!}} ННЦ ХФТИ|website=www.kipt.kharkov.ua|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is known as a [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] as it consists of several institutes that are part of the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology science complex.

==History==
[[File:ХФТИ.jpg|thumb|Group photo of the KIPT physicists in 1934]]
[[File:NSC KIPT 03.jpg|thumb|Commemoritve plaque about the nuclear fission conducted in 1932]]
The institute was founded on 30 October 1928 by the Government of Soviet Ukraine&lt;ref name=vokrugsveta&gt;Taravarov, Ya. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20171230193505/http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/telegraph/theory/816/ Landau in a field of negative values (Ландау в области отрицательных значений)]''. Vokrug Sveta. 15 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; on an initiative of [[Abram Ioffe]] on the northern outskirts of [[Kharkiv]] (in khutir [[Piatykhatky, Kharkiv Oblast|Piatykhatky]]) as the '''Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology''' for the purpose of research on [[nuclear physics]] and [[condensed matter physics]]. Note that Kharkiv at that time was the capital of [[Soviet Ukraine]]. An opening of the institute precisely in [[Kharkiv]] had an ideological implication: At height of being defeated by the [[Russian Red Army]], the "samostiynyky"{{efn|a ridiculed name for Ukrainians in Russia}} of various modifications who laid at the basis of Ukrainian [[national consciousness]] their culture of the past, the [[Soviet Ukraine]] has implemented new culture based on advanced achievements of the human intellect and modern technologies rather than on [[sharovary]] (Ukrainian traditional dress), [[Ukrainian folk music|folk songs]], and [[oseledets]] (Ukrainian Cossack hairstyle).&lt;ref name=vokrugsveta/&gt;

From the moment of its creation, the institute was run by the [[People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry]].&lt;ref name=vokrugsveta/&gt;

On 10 October 1932 the first experiments in [[nuclear fission]] in the [[Soviet Union]] were conducted here. The Soviet nuclear physicists [[Anton Valter]], [[Georgiy Latyshev]], [[Cyril Sinelnikov]], and [[Aleksandr Leipunskii]] used a [[lithium]] atom nucleus. Later the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology was able to obtain [[liquid hydrogen]] and helium. They also constructed a [[radar]] station, and the institute became a pioneer of the Soviet high [[vacuum engineering]] which was developed into an industrial [[vacuum metallurgy]].

During the Stalin epoch, this was where the [[UPTI Affair]] occurred in 1938: three leading physicists of the Kharkiv Institute ([[Lev Landau]], [[Yuri Rumer]] and Moisey Korets) were arrested by the Soviet secret police.

The Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology was the "Laboratory no. 1" for nuclear physics, and was responsible for the first development of a nuclear bomb in the former USSR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1953">{{for|an error in logical reasoning|logical fallacy}}
In [[computer programming]], a '''logic error'''  is a [[Software bug|bug]] in a program that causes it to operate incorrectly, but not to terminate abnormally (or [[crash (computing)|crash]]). A logic error produces unintended or undesired output or other behaviour, although it may not immediately be recognized as such.

Logic errors occur in both [[Compiler|compiled]] and [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] languages. Unlike a program with a [[syntax error]], a program with a logic error is a valid program in the language, though it does not behave as intended. Often the only clue to the existence of logic errors is the production of wrong solutions, though [[Static program analysis|static analysis]] may sometimes spot them.

==Debugging logic errors==

One of the ways to find this type of error is to output the program's [[Variable (programming)|variables]] to a file or on the screen in order to determine the error's location in code. Although this will not work in all cases, for example when calling the wrong [[subroutine]], it is the easiest way to find the problem if the program uses the incorrect results of a bad [[Algorithm|mathematical calculation]].

==Examples==

This example function in [[C (programming language)|C]] to calculate the [[Arithmetic mean|average]] of two numbers contains a logic error. It is missing parentheses in the calculation, so it compiles and runs but does not give the expected answer due to [[Operator precedence in C|operator precedence]] (division is evaluated before addition).
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
float average(float a, float b)
{
    return a + b / 2;     /* should be (a + b) / 2 */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

With further research, large-scale chemical processing in a refinery-style environment could help process millions of gallons of "pig biocrude" per day.

According to the tests conducted by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] pig manure biocrude produced by current technology contains 15% water, [[sulfur]] and char waste containing heavy metals, which should be removed to improve the quality of oil.&lt;ref name=india&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8143">'''Open Platform Communications''' ('''OPC''') is a series of [[standardization|standards]] and specifications for industrial [[telecommunication]]. An [[industrial automation]] industry task force developed the original standard in 1996 under the name '''OLE for Process Control''' ([[Object Linking and Embedding]] for [[process control]]). OPC specifies the communication of [[real-time computing|real-time]] plant data between control devices from different manufacturers.

After the initial release in 1996, the [[OPC Foundation]] was created to maintain the standard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://opcfoundation.org/about/what-is-opc/ What is OPC?] [http://www.opcfoundation.org/ opcfoundation.org]&lt;/ref&gt; As OPC has been adopted beyond the field of process control, the [[OPC Foundation]] changed the name to Open Platform Communications in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/about/what-is-opc/&lt;/ref&gt; The change in name reflects the applications of OPC technology for applications in [[building automation]], [[discrete manufacturing]], process control and many others. OPC has also grown beyond its original OLE ([[Object Linking and Embedding]]) implementation to include other data transportation technologies including [[Microsoft Corporation|Microsoft]]'s [[.NET Framework]], [[XML]], and even the OPC Foundation's binary-encoded TCP format.

==Origin and uses== &lt;!-- or something to say we are not in the Introduction any more --&gt;
The '''OPC Specification''' was based on the [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]], [[Component object model|COM]], and [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] technologies developed by [[Microsoft Corporation|Microsoft]] for the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system family. The specification defined a standard set of [[Object (computer science)|object]]s, [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] and [[Method (computer science)|methods]] for use in process control and manufacturing automation applications to facilitate [[interoperability]]. The most common OPC specification is [[OPC Data Access]], which is used to read and write real-time data. When vendors refer to '''OPC''' generically, they typically mean [[OPC Data Access]] (OPC DA). OPC DA itself has gone through three major revisions since its inception. Versions are backwards compatible, in that a version 3 OPC Server can still be accessed by a version 1 OPC Client, since the specifications add functionality, but still require the older version to be implemented as well. However, a Client could be written that does not support the older functions since everything can be done using the newer ones, so a DA-3-compatible Client will not necessarily work with a DA 1.0 Server.

In addition OPC DA specification, the OPC Foundation also maintains the [[OPC Historical Data Access]] (HDA) specification. In contrast to the real time data that is accessible with OPC DA, OPC HDA allows access and retrieval of archived data.

The OPC Alarms and Events specification is also maintained by the OPC Foundation, and defines the exchange of alarm and event type message information, as well as variable states and state management.&lt;ref&gt;[https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-classic/alarms-and-events/ OPC A&amp;E specification]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
OPC was designed to provide a common bridge for Windows-based software applications and process control hardware. Standards define consistent methods of accessing field data from plant floor devices. This method remains the same regardless of the type and source of data. An OPC Server for one hardware device provides the same methods for an OPC Client to access its data as any and every other OPC Server for that same and any other hardware device. The aim was to reduce the amount of duplicated effort required from hardware manufacturers and their software partners, and from the [[SCADA]] (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) and other [[Human-Machine Interface|HMI]] (Human-Machine Interface) producers in order to interface the two. Once a hardware manufacturer had developed their OPC Server for the new hardware device their work was done to allow any 'top end' to access their device, and once the [[SCADA]] producer had developed their OPC Client their work was done to allow access to any hardware, existing or yet to be created, with an OPC compliant server.

OPC servers provide a method for many different software packages (so long as it is an OPC Client) to access data from a process control device, such as a [[programmable logic controller|PLC]] or [[distributed control system|DCS]]. Traditionally, any time a package needed access to data from a device, a custom interface, or driver, had to be written. The purpose of OPC is to define a common interface that is written once and then reused by any business, [[SCADA]], [[Human-Machine Interface|HMI]], or custom software packages.

There is nothing in the OPC specifications to restrict the server to providing access to a process control device. OPC Servers can be written for anything from getting the internal temperature of a microprocessor to the current temperature in Monument Valley.

Once an OPC Server is written for a particular device, it can be reused by any application that is able to act as an OPC client. OPC servers use Microsoft’s OLE technology (also known as the Component Object Model, or COM) to communicate with clients. COM technology permits a standard for real-time information exchange between software applications and process hardware to be defined.

It is important to note that some OPC specifications are published, others are available only to members of the OPC Foundation. So whilst no company "owns" OPC and anyone can develop an OPC server, whether or not they are a member of the [[OPC Foundation]], non-members will not necessarily be using the latest specifications. Anyone can integrate OPC products, and there is no pre-requisite for the system integrator to belong to any organization. It is therefore up to each company that requires OPC products to ensure that their products are certified and that their system integrators have the necessary training.

==Future==
{{Main|OPC Unified Architecture}}
The [[OPC Unified Architecture]] (UA) has been specified and is being tested and implemented through its Early Adopters program. It can be implemented with [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Microsoft .NET]], or [[C (programming language)|C]], eliminating the need to use a [[Microsoft Windows|Microsoft-Windows]]-based platform of earlier OPC versions. UA combines the functionality of the existing OPC interfaces with new technologies such as [[XML]] and [[Web Services]] to deliver higher level [[Manufacturing execution system|MES]] and [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] support.

On September 16, 2010, The OPC Foundation and the [[MTConnect]] Institute announced a cooperation to ensure interoperability and consistency between the two standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opcfoundation.org/Default.aspx/02_news/02_news_display.asp?id=845&amp;MID=News|title=OPC Foundation and MTConnect Institute Announce a Memorandum of Understanding|author=|date=2010-10-21|work=|publisher=OPC Foundation|accessdate=2010-10-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616214614/http://www.opcfoundation.org/Default.aspx/02_news/02_news_display.asp?id=845&amp;MID=News|archivedate=2011-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pocket park''' (also known as a '''parkette''', '''mini-park''', '''vest-pocket park''' or '''vesty park''') is a small [[park]] accessible to the general public. Pocket parks are frequently created on a single vacant [[Lot (real estate)|building lot]] or on small, irregular pieces of land. They also may be created as a component of the [[Form-based code#Public Space Standards|public space requirement]] of large building projects.

Pocket parks can be urban, suburban or rural, and can be on public or private land. Although they are too small for physical activities, pocket parks provide greenery, a place to sit outdoors, and sometimes a children's [[playground]]. They may be created around a monument, historic marker or art project.

In highly urbanized areas, particularly [[downtown]]s where land is very expensive, pocket parks are the only option for creating new public spaces without large-scale redevelopment. In inner-city areas, pocket parks are often part of [[urban regeneration]] plans and provide areas where [[wildlife]] such as birds can establish a foothold. Unlike larger parks, pocket parks are sometimes designed to be fenced and locked when not in use.

Small parks can increase the value of nearby homes.  One study conducted in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], found that "attractively maintained small and medium parks have a positive influence on neighboring property values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Benefits of Trails|url=http://www.americantrails.org/resources/economics/Economic-Benefits-Trails-Open-Space-Walkable-Community.html|publisher=American Trails|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Balfour street pocket park.JPG|thumb|Balfour Street pocket park, [[Sydney]]]]
Pocket parks, such as the [[Balfour Street Park]], can be created from small unused areas of public land.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Balfour Street Pocket Park|url = http://architectureau.com/articles/balfour-street-pocket-park/|accessdate = 2015-08-10|last = MacGowen|first = Tempe|website = ArchitectureAu|date = 1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Santiago, Chile, the first pocket park (''plaza de bolsillo'') was created beside of Palacio [[Palacio La Moneda|La Moneda]] at Morandé Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plataformaurbana.cl/archive/2016/01/14/morande-83-la-primera-plaza-de-bolsillo-de-santiago/|title=Morandé 83, la primera "Plaza de Bolsillo" de Santiago|website=Plataforma Urbana|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an initiative of Architecture Departament of the Ministry of Public Infrastructure and Regional Government of Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elmostrador.cl/cultura/2016/04/07/la-plaza-de-bolsillo-morande-83-un-oasis-en-la-selva-de-cemento-un-punto-de-fuga/|title=La Plaza de Bolsillo Morandé 83, un oasis en la selva de cemento, un punto de fuga|last=Mostrador|first=El|website=El Mostrador|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico City]], there is a city program to create up to 150 pocket parks of 400m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or less on vacant lots or even on land that had been part of a large intersection, such as [[Jardín Edith Sánchez Ramírez]] and the [[Condesa pocket park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seduvi.df.gob.mx/portal/index.php/parques-publicos-de-bolsillo "Parques Públicos de Bolsillo", Secretariat of Urban Development and Housing, Mexican Federal District, accessed 2014-10-07]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In England, a 1984 project to involve the local community in the creation and running of small, local parks has fostered several pocket parks in [[Northamptonshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/Opening%20Green%20Doors_tcm6-9082.pdf Pocket Park project Page 6&amp;7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Leisure/pocket-parks/Pages/default.aspx Northamptonshire's Pocket Park Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205101339/http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Leisure/pocket-parks/Pages/default.aspx |date=2012-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later developed by the [[Countryside Commission]] into the [[Millennium Green]] and [[Doorstep Green]] projects.

===United States===
In [[Columbus, Ohio]], [[Polaris Founder's Park]] was opened in 2011 and holds a 35-foot [[kinetic art|wind sculpture]].

In [[Los Angeles]], where there are restrictions on how close registered sex offenders can live to parks, local officials planned three pocket parks to drive "undesirables" from a given area.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/28/local/la-me-parks-sex-offenders-20130301 | title=L.A. sees parks as a weapon against sex offenders | date=February 28, 2013 | agency=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=July 8, 2014 | author=Jennings, Angel | location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political Economy''' in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Most anthropologists moved away from modes of production analysis typical of structural Marxism, and focused instead on the complex historical relations of class, culture and hegemony in regions undergoing complex colonial and capitalist transitions in the emerging world system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political Economy was introduced in American anthropology primarily through the support of [[Julian Steward]], a student of [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Kroeber]]. Steward’s research interests centered on “subsistence” — the dynamic interaction of man, environment, technology, social structure, and the organization of work. This emphasis on subsistence and production - as opposed to exchange - is what distinguishes the Political Economy approach. Steward's most theoretically productive years were from 1946-1953, while teaching at [[Columbia University]].  At this time, Columbia saw an influx of [[World War II]] [[veteran]]s who were attending school thanks to the [[GI Bill]]. Steward quickly developed a coterie of students who would go on to develop Political Economy as a distinct approach in anthropology, including [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Eleanor Leacock]], [[Roy Rappaport]], [[Stanley Diamond]], Robert Manners, [[Morton Fried]], [[Robert F. Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert F. Murphy]], and influenced other scholars such as [[Elman Service]], [[Marvin Harris]] and June Nash. Many of these students participated in the Puerto Rico Project, a large-scale group research study that focused on modernization in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Anthropologies and Histories: essays in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutcgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=146–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlins' work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt;

More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

===Cultural materialism===
{{main|Cultural materialism (anthropology)}}
Cultural materialism is a research orientation introduced by [[Marvin Harris]] in 1968 (''The Rise of Anthropological Theory''),&lt;ref name=Harris2001a&gt;{{citation |date=2001a |origyear=1968 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=0-7591-0132-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUUYN3X18dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rise+Anthropological+Theory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KySLTMqBFI2IvgOjtY0Y&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a theoretical paradigm and research strategy.

Harris' approach was influenced by but distinct from Marx. Harris' method was to demonstrate how particular cultural practices (like the Hindu prohibition on harming cattle) served a materialistic function (such as preserving an essential source of fertilizer from being consumed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars &amp; witches; the riddles of culture|year=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic behavior has a cultural side which indicates that the works of anthropologists is relevant to economics. The Motivation behind cultural materialism is mainly to show that cultures adapt to the environment they're produced in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Materialism and Institutional Economics|last=Jackson|first=William|publisher=Review of Social Economy|year=1996|isbn=|location=University of York|pages=225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural Marxism===
{{main|Structural Marxism}}
Structural Marxism was an approach to [[Marxist philosophy]] based on [[structuralism]], primarily associated with the work of the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] and his students. It was influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s, and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and anthropologists outside France during the 1970s. French structuralist Marxism melded Marxist political economy with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Levi-Strauss]]'s [[Structuralism|structural]] methodology, eliminating the human subject, dialectical reason and history in the process. Structural Marxists introduced two major concepts, mode of production and social formation, that allowed for a more prolonged and uneven transition to capitalism than either dependency or World systems theory allowed for.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt; A [[mode of production]] consisting of producers, non-producers and [[means of production]], combined in a variety of ways, formed the deep structure of a "social formation." A social formation combined (or "articulated") several modes of production, only one of which was dominant or determinant. Primary anthropological theorists of this school included [[Maurice Godelier]], [[Claude Meillassoux]], Emmanuel Terray and Pierre-Philippe Rey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Chris Hann]]|first=[[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]]|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=73–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural Marxism arose in opposition to the [[Marxist humanism|humanistic Marxism]] that dominated many western universities during the 1970s. In contrast to Humanistic Marxism, Althusser stressed that Marxism was a [[science]] that examined objective structures.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). Lenin and Philosophy. In ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays''. NY: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural materialism===
Critical influences on Structural Marxism, primarily from the British Marxist historical tradition, included [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[Raymond Williams]]. They criticized the functionalist emphasis in Structural Marxism, that neglected individuals in favour of the structural elements of their model. The British school was more interested in class, culture and politics, and placed human subjects at the centre of analysis. Where mode of production analysis was abstract, they focused on people. Where world-systems theory had little to say about the local, the Cultural Materialists began and ended there. Others connected with this school of thought concentrated on issues such as ethnic formation, labor migration, remittances, household formation, food production and the processes of colonialism.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 172"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=172|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The anthropology of pre-capitalist societies ==
[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumbnail|Dobe !Kung men lighting a fire.]]
{{main|Original affluent society}}
As anthropologists embraced "mode of production" analysis in the 1950s, they struggled to adapt its evolutionary model to the groups that they had traditionally worked with. While Marxist analysis was developed to account for capitalist society and its class dynamics, it had little to say about "pre-capitalist" societies, other than to define them by what they were not.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 172"/&gt; One of the first attempts to theorize [[Hunter-gatherer]] society was [[Marshall Sahlins]] ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972) which overturned nineteenth century ideas that characterized life in such societies as "nasty, brutish and short". Sahlins demonstrated that actual existing hunter-gatherers lived in "the original affluent society"; their needs were met with relatively little work leaving them with far more leisure time than western industrial societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chris Hann|first=Keith Hart|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard B. Lee|Richard B. Lee's]] work amongst the [[ǃKung people|Dobe !Kung]] of Botswana provided a detailed case study of the argument, even in one of the most hostile desert environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Richard B.|title=The Dobe Ju/'hoansi 3rd edition|year=2002|publisher=Wadsworth Thomson|location=Belmont CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part of Sahlins' book applies Chayanov's theories to develop a theory of a "Domestic mode of production." Given the argument of the "original affluent society" that many of these societies had abundant resources, Sahlins argued that the limit on production was the amount of labour available. Young families with many dependent children had to work harder, whereas older families with mature children and many workers worked much less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Durrenberger|first=Paul|title=A Shower of Rain: Marshall Sahlins's Stone Age Economics Twenty-five years later|journal=Culture &amp; Agriculture|year=1998|volume=20|issue=2/3|pages=103–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final sections developed a theory of reciprocity discussed above.

An alternate model of the Domestic Mode of Production was developed by Eric Wolf, who rejected the evolutionary implications of Sahlins' model and argued that this mode of production should be viewed as the product of developing colonial trade relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several collections addressing the question of mode of production analysis in classless societies came out in this period, including "''The Anthropology of Pre-Capitalist Societies''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joel Kahn|first=Joseph Llobera|title=The Anthropology of Pre-capitalist Societies|year=1981|publisher=Macmillan|location=Basingstoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "''Marxist Analysis and Social Anthropology''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurice Bloch ed.|title=Marxist analysis and Social Anthropology|year=1975|publisher=Tavistock|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the state==
{{main|State formation}}
Political economists such as [[Morton Fried]], [[Elman Service]], and [[Eleanor Leacock]] took a Marxist approach and sought to understand the origins and development of inequality in human society. Marx and Engels had drawn on the ethnographic work of [[Lewis H. Morgan]], and these authors now extended that tradition. In particular, they were interested in the evolution of social systems over time.

==Colonialism and imperialism==
[[File:Rhodes and Africa from Cairo to Cape Town.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cecil Rhodes, driving force of British imperialism in Africa]]

===Articulated modes of production===
The articulation of modes of production within a single formation was meant to account for the influence of colonialism on lineage modes of production, primarily in the African context. According to Hann and Hart, the short lived success of the theory was that

&lt;blockquote&gt;it produced a version of structural-functionalism at once sufficiently different from the original to persuade English-speakers that they were learning Marxism and similar enough to allow them to retain their customary way of thinking, which had been temporarily discredited by its role in the administration of empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chris Hann|first=Keith Hart|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===World-systems theory and dependency theory===
{{main|World-systems theory|Dependency theory}}
Dependency Theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to [[modernization theory]]. It argues that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[World-system]]" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency Theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=166|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immanuel Wallerstein's "world-systems theory" was the version of Dependency Theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency Theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency Theory.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"/&gt;

Both versions of Dependency Theory were critiqued throughout the 1970s for the static historical accounts they provided. Their influence was slowly replaced by more dynamic and historically sensitive versions, such as Eric Wolf's "Europe and the People Without History."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=167|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Wolf and ''Europe and the people without history''===
{{main|Europe and the people without history}}
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumbnail|left|16th-century Portuguese (blue) and Spanish (white) trade routes]]
"Europe and the people without history" is history written on a global scale, tracing the connections between communities, regions, peoples and nations that are usually treated as discrete subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins in 1400 with a description of the trade routes a world traveller might have encountered, the people and societies they connected, and the civilizational processes trying to incorporate them. From this, Wolf traces the emergence of Europe as a global power, and the reorganization of particular world regions for the production of goods now meant for global consumption. Wolf differs from World Systems theory in that he sees the growth of Europe until the late eighteenth century operating in a tributary framework, and not capitalism. He examines the way that colonial state structures were created to protect tributary populations involved in the silver, fur and slave trades.  Whole new "tribes" were created as they were incorporated into circuits of mercantile accumulation. The final section of the book deals with the transformation in these global networks as a result of the growth of capitalism with the industrial revolution. Factory production of textiles in England, for example transformed cotton production in the American South and Egypt, and eliminated textile production in India. All these transformations are connected in a single structural change. Each of the world's regions are examined in terms of the goods they produced in the global division of labour, as well as the mobilization and migration of whole populations (such as African slaves) to produce these goods. Wolf uses [[labor market segmentation]] to provide a historical account of the creation of ethnic segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=127–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where World Systems theory had little to say about the periphery, Wolf's emphasis is on the people "without history" (i.e. not given a voice in western histories) and on how they were active participants in the creation of new cultural and social forms emerging in the context of commercial empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Maritime Fur Trade-WorldContext.png|thumbnail|Maritime Fur Trade, 1790-1840.]]
Wolf distinguishes between three modes of production: capitalist, kin-ordered, and tributary. Wolf does not view them as an evolutionary sequence. He begins with capitalism because he argues our understanding of kin-ordered and tributary modes is coloured by our understanding of capitalism. He argues they are not evolutionary precursors of capitalism, but the product of the encounter between the West and the Rest. In the tributary mode, direct producers possess their own means of production, but their surplus production is taken from them through extra economic means. This appropriation is usually by some form of strong or weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the kin-ordered mode of production, social labour is mobilized through kin relations (such as lineages), although his description makes its exact relations with tributary and capitalist modes unclear. The kin mode was further theorized by French structuralist Marxists in terms of 'articulated modes of production.' The kin-ordered mode is distinct again from Sahlins' formulation of the domestic mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unfree labour and slavery==
Liberal and neo-liberal market-based societies are predicated upon the concept of "free labour" - workers enter a labour market freely, and enter into contractual relations with employers voluntarily. "Unfree labour" - otherwise known as bond labour, debt bondage, debt peonage, and slavery, are thought to be archaic forms that will be eliminated with capitalist development. Anthropologists working in a wide variety of current situations have documented that the incidence of bonded labour is much greater than capitalist ideology would lead us to expect.&lt;ref name="Brass 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brass|first=Tom|title=Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labour: Case Studies and Debates|year=1999|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=349–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Brass argues that unfree labour is not an archaic holdover in today's world, but an active process of deproletarianization of agricultural workers to provide rural agrarian capitalists with cheaper labour. In the constant drive to cheapen the cost of agricultural labour, debt bondage is used to tie workers to specific employers, lower their wages, and extract further unpaid labour from them. He illustrates this process at work in Peru and India.&lt;ref name="Brass 1999"/&gt;

An early study of debt bondage was [[Ann Laura Stoler]]'s ''Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979'' (1985). Stoler examined the tobacco plantations of the Deli Maatschappij, one of the most profitable Dutch colonial corporations of the 19th century. The Deli company imported large numbers of Chinese indentured labourers to [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], where they were treated not as employees, but as contractors. As contractors they had to buy all their supplies at inflated prices from the company, take all the risks of cultivation and processing, and finally sell their tobacco to the company at prices it set. They were kept in perpetual debt, unable to change employers, in working conditions that resulted in extraordinarily high death rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoler|first=Ann|title=Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Breman extended this analysis of the "Coolie regulation" (which allowed for indentured labour) to the Dutch mining industry in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breman|first=Jan|title=Taming the Coolie Beast : Plantation Society and the Colonial Order in Southeast Asia|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery is but one form of unfree (or bound) labour. Structural Marxists sought to theorize it as a mode of production. Claude Meillassoux has refined this approach in his study of pre-colonial African slavery. He analyzed the military and aristocratic systems that organized the capture of slaves and situated it within the politics of the merchants who organized the trade in slaves. His work focuses on the forces at play within a kinship organized polity that define slaves culturally as "anti-kin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meillassoux|first=Claude|title=The Anthropology of Slavery: The Womb of Iron and Gold|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peasant studies and agrarian change==

==="Differentiation of the Peasantry": Lenin vs Chayanov===
{{main|Alexander Chayanov}}

===Simple commodity production and the peasantry===
{{main|Simple commodity production}}
Simple commodity production (also known as "petty commodity production") is a term coined by [[Frederick Engels]] to describe productive activities under the conditions of what Marx had called the "simple exchange" of [[commodities]], where independent producers such as peasants trade their own products. The use of the word "simple" does not refer to the nature of the producers or of their production, but to the relatively simple and straightforward exchange processes involved. Simple commodity production is compatible with many ''different'' relations of production, ranging from [[self-employment]] where the producer owns his means of production, and family labour, to forms of [[slavery]], [[peonage]], [[indentured labour]], and [[serfdom]].

===Capitalist transitions and agrarian change===
{{main|Anthropology of development}}
Michael Taussig, for example, examined the reactions of peasant farmers in Columbia as they struggled to understand how money could make interest. Taussig highlights that we have [[Commodity fetishism|fetishized]] money. We view money as an active agent, capable of doing things, of growth. In viewing money as an active agent, we obscure the social relationships that actually give money its power. The Columbian peasants, seeking to explain how money could bear interest, turned to folk beliefs like the "baptism of money" to explain how money could grow. Dishonest individuals would have money baptized, which would then become an active agent; whenever used to buy goods, it would escape the till and return to its owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taussig|first=Michael|title=The Genesis of Capitalism Amongst a South American Peasantry: Devil's Labor and the Baptism of Money|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=1977|volume=19|issue=2|pages=130–155|doi=10.1017/S0010417500008586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peasant wars of the twentieth century===
Written in 1969 by [[Eric Wolf]], ''Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century'', is a comparative view of the [[peasant]] [[revolution]]s of [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Algeria]], and [[Cuba]].

===The moral economy of the peasant===
The concept of a [[moral economy]] was first elaborated by English historian [[E.P. Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was developed further in anthropological studies of other peasant economies. Thompson wrote of the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to “set the price” of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional “fair price” was more important to the community than a “free” market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. The notion of a non-capitalist cultural mentalité using the market for its own ends has been linked by others (with Thompson's approval) to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cambodiaricefarming1.jpg|thumbnail|Cambodian rice farming]]
The concept was widely popularized in anthropology through the book, "The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia" by [[James C. Scott]] (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James C.|title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|year=1976|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins with a telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live so close to the subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a "safety first" principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as "traditionalist" when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides "subsistence insurance" for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes. Although fieldwork has not supported many of Scott's conclusions, the book encouraged a generation of researchers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1138">'''Pycniospores''' are a type of [[spore]] in [[fungi]]. They are produced in special cup-like structures called pycnia or pynidia.  Almost all fungi [[Asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]] with the production of spores.  Spores may be colorless, green, yellow, orange, red, brown or black.

==Other types of spore==

;Sporangiospores
Sporangiospores (spore:spore, angion:sac) are spores formed inside the [[sporangium]] which is a spore sac. 

;Conidia
Conidia (singular: [[conidium]]) are spores produced at the tip of special branches called conidiophores.

;Oidia
Oidia (singular: [[oidium (spore)|oidium]]).  In several fungi, the [[hyphae]] is often divided into a large number of short pieces by transverse walls.  Each piece is able to germinate into a new body.  These pieces are called oidia (small [[Egg (biology)|egg]]).

;Chlamydospores
[[Chlamydospore]]s (chlymus: mantle) are produced like oidia but differ from oidia in being thick walled.  They are either terminal or intercalary.

The term refers to regions where [[river]]s [[debouch]] into [[estuary|estuaries]] and coastal [[shelf sea]]s where the currents patterns are governed by density differences between salt [[sea water]] and fresh river water. In other words, a ROFI is the region between the shelf sea regime and the estuary where the local input of freshwater buoyancy from the coastal source is comparable with, or exceeds, the seasonal input of buoyancy as heat which occurs all over the shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1= J.H.|last2= |first2= |year= 1997|title= Physical processes in the ROFI regime|journal= Journal of Marine Systems|volume= |issue= 12|pages= 3–15|url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans usually use the term river plume where Europeans use ROFI.

'''Scientific literature''' comprises scholarly [[publication]]s that report original [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] and [[theoretical]] work in the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, and within an academic field, often abbreviated as '''the literature'''.  [[Academic publishing]] is the process of contributing the results of one's [[research]] into the literature, which often requires a peer-review process. Original [[scientific research]] published for the first time in [[scientific journal]]s is called the [[primary literature]]. Patents and [[technical report]]s, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software), can also be considered primary literature. [[Secondary source]]s include review articles (which summarize the findings of published studies to highlight advances and new lines of research) and [[book]]s (for large projects or broad arguments, including compilations of articles). [[Tertiary source]]s might include [[encyclopedia]]s and similar works intended for broad public consumption.

== Types of scientific publications ==

Scientific literature can include the following kinds of publications:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Öchsner|first=Andreas|title=Types of Scientific Publications|date=2013|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_3|work=Introduction to Scientific Publishing|pages=9–21|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_3|isbn=9783642386459|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* scientific articles published in [[Scientific journal|scientific journals]]
* [[Patent|patents]] specialized for science and technology (for example, [[Biological patent|biological patents]] and [[Chemical patent|chemical patents]])
* [[Book|books]] wholly written by one or a small number of co-[[Author|authors]]
* [[Edited volume|edited volumes]], where each [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] is the responsibility of a different author or set of authors, while the [[Editing|editor]] is responsible for determining the scope of the project, keeping the work on schedule, and ensuring consistency of style and content
* presentations at [[Academic conference|academic conferences]], especially those organized by [[Learned society|learned societies]]
* [[government]] reports such as a [[forensic investigation]] conducted by a government agency such as the [[NTSB]]
* scientific publications on the [[World Wide Web]]
* books, [[Technical report|technical reports]], [[Pamphlet|pamphlets]], and [[Working paper|working papers]] issued by individual researchers or research organizations on their own initiative; these are sometimes organised into a series
* [[blogs]] and science forums

Literature may also be published in areas considered to be "[[Grey literature|grey]]", as they are published outside of traditional channels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This material is traditionally not indexed by major databases and can include manuals, theses and dissertations, or newsletters and bulletins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The significance of different types of the scientific publications can vary between disciplines and change over time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to James G. Speight and Russell Foote, peer-reviewed journals are the most prominent and prestigious form of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ORgP4AwPtQC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;dq=peer-reviewed+journal+articles+remain+the+predominant+publication+type,+and+have+the+highest+prestige.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ssTqWvQvWE&amp;sig=nLzMKCNc2qRGt3auPXHrH7TXh54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSwLGLpqLeAhXEzlMKHc9xDUcQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=peer-reviewed%20journal%20articles%20remain%20the%20predominant%20publication%20type,%20and%20have%20the%20highest%20prestige.&amp;f=false|title=Ethics in Science and Engineering|last=Speight|first=James G.|last2=Foote|first2=Russell|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781118104842|location=|pages=241|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally books published by university presses are usually considered more prestigious than those published by commercial presses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The status of working papers and [[conference proceeding]]s depends on the discipline; they are typically more important in the [[applied sciences]]. The value of publication as a [[preprint]] or scientific report on the web has in the past been low, but in some subjects, such as [[mathematics]] or [[high energy physics]], it is now an accepted alternative.{{citationneeded|date=October 2018}}

=== Scientific papers and articles ===
There are ten different types of scientific papers. Eight of these carry specific objectives, while the other two can vary depending on the style and the intended goal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peh|first=Wilfred|date=2008|title=Basic structure and types of scientific papers|url=|journal=Effective Medical Writing|volume=|pages=|via=Singapore Medical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papers that carry specific objectives are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

* '''The original article''' provides new information from original research usually supported by statistics.
* '''case reports''' are unique events that researchers look at to gain information on what they are researching.
* '''technical notes''' this is a description of a technique or piece of equipment that has been modified from an existing one to be new and more effective.
* '''[[pictorial essay]]''' are a series of images high in quality that's goal is to teach what the pictures are of.
* '''[[Review article|review]]''' is a detailed analysis of recent developments on a topic.
* '''commentary''' is a short summery of an author's personal experience.
* '''[[Editorial|editorials]]''' are short reviews or critiques of original articles.
* '''letters to the editor''', these are comments directed to the editor of an article to ask questions and provide constructive criticism.

These two have varying types of scientific classifications and can range from historical articles to speeches:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''other.''' Other types of papers not listed under non scientific material or any of the 8 above types of scientific publications are put into this category and vary depending on the objective and style of the article.
* '''nonscientific material.''' This type of material comes from the result of an article being published. it does not advance an article scientifically but instead contributes to its reputation as a scientific article.

==Scientific article==

===Preparation===
The actual day-to-day records of scientific information are kept in research notebooks or logbooks. These are usually kept indefinitely as the basic evidence of the work, and are often kept in duplicate, signed, notarized, and archived. The purpose is to preserve the evidence for scientific priority, and in particular for priority for obtaining patents. They have also been used in scientific disputes.  Since the availability of computers, the notebooks in some data-intensive fields have been kept as database records, and appropriate software is commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

The work on a project is typically published as one or more technical reports, or articles. In some fields both are used, with preliminary reports, working papers, or [[preprint]]s followed by a formal article. Articles are usually prepared at the end of a project, or at the end of components of a particularly large one. In preparing such an article vigorous rules for [[scientific writing]] have to be followed.

===Language===
{{see also|Impact factor|Copy editing}} 

Often, career advancement depends upon publishing in high-impact journals, which, especially in hard and applied sciences, are usually published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | title=MEDLINE Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | location=Washington DC | accessdate=October 15, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016122141/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | archivedate=October 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, scientists with poor English writing skills are at a disadvantage when trying to publish in these journals, regardless of the quality of the scientific study itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pan, Z|title=Crossing the language limitations|journal=PLOS Medicine |volume=3|pages=E410|year=2006|pmid=17002510|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030410|last2=Gao|first2=J|issue=9|pmc=1576334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many{{which|date=August 2018}} international universities require publication in these high-impact journals by both their students and faculty. One way that some international authors are beginning to overcome this problem is by contracting with freelance medical copy editors who are native speakers of English and specialize in ESL (English as a second language) editing to polish their manuscripts' English to a level that high-impact journals will accept.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Structure and style===
{{main|IMRAD}}
A scientific article has a standardized structure, which varies only slightly in different subjects. Although the IMRAD structure emphasizes the organization of content and in scientific journal articles, each section (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) has unique conventions for scientific writing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/Scientific-And-Medical-Communication-A-Guide-For-Effective-Practice/Mogull/p/book/9781138842557|title=Scientific And Medical Communication: A Guide For Effective Practice|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138842557|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, it is not the format that is important, but what lies behind it--the content. However, several key formatting requirements need to be met:

#The title attracts readers' attention and informs them about the contents of the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langdon-Neuner|first=Elise|title=Titles in medical articles: What do we know about them?|journal=The Write Stuff|year=2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=158–160|url=http://www.emwa.org/members/indevelopment/neuner.pd|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Titles are distinguished into three main types: declarative titles (state the main conclusion), descriptive titles (describe a paper's content), and interrogative titles (challenge readers with a question that is answered in the text).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasilev|first=Martin|title=How to write a good title for journal articles|url=http://jeps.efpsa.org/blog/2012/09/01/how-to-write-a-good-title-for-journal-articles/|work=JEPS Bulletin|publisher=European Federation of Psychology Students’ Associations|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journals indicate, in their instructions to authors, the type (and length) of permitted titles.
#The names and affiliations of all authors are given. In the wake of some [[scientific misconduct]] cases, publishers often require that all co-authors know and agree on the content of the article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientific fraud#Responsibility of authors and of coauthors]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#An [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] summarizes the work (in a single paragraph or in several short paragraphs) and is intended to represent the article in bibliographic databases and to furnish [[subject metadata]] for indexing services.
# The context of previous scientific investigations should be presented, by citation relevant documents in the existing literature, usually in a section called an "Introduction".
# Empirical techniques, laid out in a section usually called "Materials and Methods", should be described in such a way that a subsequent scientist, with appropriate knowledge of and experience in the relevant field, should be able to repeat the observations and know whether he or she has obtained the same result. This naturally varies between subjects, and does not apply to mathematics and related subjects.
#Similarly, the results of the investigation, in a section usually called "Results", data should be presented in tabular or graphic form ([[image]], [[chart]], [[schematic]], [[diagram]] or [[drawing]]). These display elements should be accompanied by a caption and discussed in the text of the article.
# Interpretation of the meaning of the results is usually addressed in a "Discussion" or "Conclusions" section. The conclusions drawn should be based on the new empirical results while taking established knowledge into consideration, in such a way that any reader with knowledge of the field can follow the argument and confirm that the conclusions are sound.  That is, acceptance of the conclusions must not depend on personal [[appeal to authority|authority]], [[rhetoric|rhetorical skill]], or [[faith]].
# Finally, a "References" or "Literature Cited" section lists the sources cited by the authors.

== Peer review ==
{{main|Scholarly peer review}}
Though peer review and the learned journal format are not themselves an essential part of scientific literature, they are both convenient ways of ensuring that the above fundamental criteria are met. They are essentially a means of [[quality control]], a term which also encompasses other means towards the same goal.

The "quality" being referred to here is the scientific one, which consists of transparency and repeatability of the research for independent verification, the validity of the conclusions and interpretations drawn from the reported data, overall importance for advance within a given field of knowledge, novelty, and in certain fields applicability as well. The lack of peer review is what makes most [[technical report]]s and World Wide Web publications unacceptable as contributions to the literature. The relatively weak peer review often applied to books and chapters in edited books means that their status is also second-tier, unless an author's personal standing is so high that prior achievement and a continued stake in one's reputation within the scientific community signals a clear expectation of quality.

The emergence of institutional digital repositories where scholars can post their work as it is submitted to a print-based journal has taken formal peer review into a state of flux. Though publicizing a preprint online does not prevent it from being peer reviewed, it does allow an unreviewed copy to be widely circulated. On the positive side this change has led to faster dissemination of novel work within the scientific community; on the negative it has made it more difficult to discern a valid scientific contribution from the unmeritorious.

Increasing reliance on [[Indexing and abstracting service|abstracting service]]s, especially on those available electronically, means that the effective criterion for whether a publication format forms part of the established, trusted literature is whether it is covered by these services; in particular, by the specialised service for the discipline concerned such as [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], and by the major interdisciplinary services such as those marketed by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]].

==Ethics==
The transfer of [[copyright]] from author to publisher, used by some journals, can be controversial because many authors want to propagate their ideas more widely and re-use their material elsewhere without the need for permission. Usually an author or authors circumvent that problem by rewriting an article and using other pictures. Some publishers may also want publicity for their journal so will approve [[facsimile]] [[reproduction]] unconditionally; other publishers are more resistant. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In terms of research publications, a number of key issues include and are not restricted to:&lt;ref name="Chanson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson]] |title=Digital Publishing, Ethics and Hydraulic Engineering: The Elusive or "Boring" Bore?  |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159099 |publisher=In: Stefano Pagliara 2nd International Junior Researcher and Engineer Workshop on Hydraulic Structures (IJREW'08), Pisa, Italy, Keynote, pp. 3-13, 30 July-1 August 2008 |year=2008 |isbn=978-88-8492-568-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Honesty. Honesty and integrity is a duty of each author and person, expert-reviewer and member of journal editorial boards.
* Review process. The peer-review process contributes to the quality control and it is an essential step to ascertain the standing and originality of the research.&lt;ref name="Chanson2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Hubert Chanson]] |title=Research Quality, Publications and Impact in Civil Engineering into the 21st Century.

**Redundant Publications. Publications that contain copyrighted and new unpublished material. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benos|first=Dale J.|last2=Fabres|first2=Jorge|last3=Farmer|first3=John|last4=Gutierrez|first4=Jessica P.|last5=Hennessy|first5=Kristin|last6=Kosek|first6=David|last7=Lee|first7=Joo Hyoung|last8=Olteanu|first8=Dragos|last9=Russell|first9=Tara|date=2005-2006|title=Ethics and scientific publication|url=https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00056.2004|journal=Advances in Physiology Education|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=59–74|doi=10.1152/advan.00056.2004|issn=1043-4046|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Data Fabrications. Is the process of purposefully changing data to make the information more in the favor of the author.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Ethical standards. Recent journal editorials presented some experience of unscrupulous activities.&lt;ref name="Mavinic2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Mavinic |title=The "Art" of Plagiarism |journal=Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering|volume=33|issue=3|pages=iii–vi |year=2006 |isbn= |doi=10.1139/l06-901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIAA2007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Publication Ethical Standards: Guidelines and Procedures |journal=AIAA Journal |volume=45 |issue=8 |page= 1794 |doi=10.2514/1.32639 |year=2007  |bibcode=2007AIAAJ..45.1794. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Human Welfare Concerns. The guidelines for human experimentation started during WWII with the Nuremberg Code. It has evolved into three main principles from The Belmont Report. The subject must be able to make their own choices to protect themselves, benefits must outweigh the risks, and subjects must be evaluated for their selection and benefits must go to all of society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
**Animal Welfare Concerns. Is the ethical care of animals in scientific experiments. The APS has set strict guidelines and regulations to stop animals from being unnecessarily harmed in experiments. These are being updated regularly by the APS and is a federal law in the United States enforced by DHHS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Authorship. Who may claim a right to authorship?&lt;ref name="Chanson2008" /&gt; In which order should the authors be listed?
**Conflicts of Interests. This is referring to the biased assumption due to private interest. It can be done knowingly or not. This is unethical because it makes data inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
**Authors Disputes. The authorship of an article is simply the author of the article. The ethical issue with this is when there are two people that believe to be the author, but there is only one true author. There are guidelines to help pick which get authorship of the writing. The one that does not get authorship is put in the acknowledgments. The guidelines come from NIH and The Council of Science Editors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Scientific writing#History}}

The first recorded editorial pre-publication peer-review occurred in 1665 by the founding editor of ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', [[Henry Oldenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (2006) p. 220-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/263105/1/399we23.htm|title=The Origin of the Scientific Journal and the Process of Peer Review|last=Select Committee on Science and Technology|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical and scientific books were a specialty of [[David Van Nostrand]], and his [[David Van Nostrand#Engineering magazine|Engineering Magazine]] re-published contemporary scientific articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18105">[[File:SimpleSortingNetwork2.svg|thumb|250px|A simple sorting network consisting of four wires and five connectors]]

In [[computer science]], '''comparator networks''' are abstract devices built up of a fixed number of "wires", carrying values, and comparator modules that connect pairs of wires, swapping the values on the wires if they are not in a desired order. Such networks are typically designed to perform [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] on fixed numbers of values, in which case they are called '''sorting networks'''.

Sorting networks differ from general [[comparison sort]]s in that they are not capable of handling arbitrarily large inputs, and in that their sequence of comparisons is set in advance, regardless of the outcome of previous comparisons. This independence of comparison sequences is useful for parallel execution and for implementation in [[computer hardware|hardware]]. Despite the simplicity of sorting nets, their theory is surprisingly deep and complex. Sorting networks were first studied circa 1954 by Armstrong, Nelson and O'Connor,&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt; who subsequently patented the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=3029413 |title=Sorting system with {{mvar|n}}-line sorting switch |pubdate=10 April 1962 |fdate= 21 February 1957 |inventor1-first=Daniel G. |inventor1-last=O'Connor |inventor2-first=Raymond J. |inventor2-last=Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorting networks can be implemented either in [[computer hardware|hardware]] or in [[software]]. [[Donald Knuth]] describes how the comparators for binary integers can be implemented as simple, three-state electronic devices.&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt; [[Ken Batcher|Batcher]], in 1968, suggested using them to construct [[switch|switching networks]] for computer hardware, replacing both [[Bus (computing)|buses]] and the faster, but more expensive, [[crossbar switch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=K. E. |last=Batcher |url=http://www.cs.kent.edu/~batcher/sort.ps |title=Sorting networks and their applications |conference=Proc. AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference |pages=307–314 |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2000s, sorting nets (especially [[bitonic sorter|bitonic mergesort]]) are used by the [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]] community for constructing sorting algorithms to run on [[graphics processing unit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2008.917757| title = GPU Computing| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE| volume = 96| issue = 5| pages = 879–899| year = 2008| last1 = Owens | first1 = J.

==Introduction==
[[File:Sorting-network-comparator-demonstration.svg|thumb|150px|Demonstration of a comparator in a sorting network.]]
A sorting network consists of two types of items: comparators and wires. The wires are thought of as running from left to right, carrying values (one per wire) that traverse the network all at the same time. Each comparator connects two wires. When a pair of values, traveling through a pair of wires, encounter a comparator, the comparator swaps the values [[if and only if]] the top wire's value is greater than the bottom wire's value.

In a formula, if the top wire carries {{mvar|x}} and the bottom wire carries {{mvar|y}}, then after hitting a comparator the wires carry &lt;math&gt;x' = \min(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y' = \max(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, so the pair of values is sorted.&lt;ref name="clrs"&gt;{{Introduction to Algorithms|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|635}} A network of wires and comparators that will correctly sort all possible inputs into ascending order is called a sorting network.

The full operation of a simple sorting network is shown below. It is easy to see why this sorting network will correctly sort the inputs; note that the first four comparators will "sink" the largest value to the bottom and "float" the smallest value to the top. The final comparator simply sorts out the middle two wires.

[[File:SimpleSortingNetworkFullOperation.svg|650px]]

===Depth and efficiency===
The efficiency of a sorting network can be measured by its total size, meaning the number of comparators in the network, or by its ''depth'', defined (informally) as the largest number of comparators that any input value can encounter on its way through the network. Noting that sorting networks can perform certain comparisons [[Parallel computing|in parallel]] (represented in the graphical notation by comparators that lie on the same vertical line), and assuming all comparisons to take unit time, it can be seen that the depth of the network is equal to the number of time steps required to execute it.&lt;ref name="clrs"/&gt;{{rp|636–637}}

=== Insertion and Bubble networks ===
We can easily construct a network of any size recursively using the principles of insertion and selection. Assuming we have a sorting network of size ''n'', we can construct a network of size {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} by "inserting" an additional number into the already sorted subnet (using the principle behind [[insertion sort]]). We can also accomplish the same thing by first "selecting" the lowest value from the inputs and then sort the remaining values recursively (using the principle behind [[bubble sort]]).
{|
|style="vertical-align: top;"| [[File:Recursive-bubble-sorting-network.svg|200px|thumb|A sorting network constructed recursively that first sinks the largest value to the bottom and then sorts the remaining wires. Based on [[bubble sort]]]]
|style="vertical-align: top;"| [[File:Recursive-insertion-sorting-network.svg|200px|thumb|A sorting network constructed recursively that first sorts the first n wires, and then inserts the remaining value. Based on [[insertion sort]]]]
|}

The structure of these two sorting networks are very similar. A construction of the two different variants, which collapses together comparators that can be performed simultaneously shows that, in fact, they are identical.&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt; 
{|
|style="vertical-align: top;"| [[File:Six-wire-bubble-sorting-network.svg|200px|thumb|Bubble sorting network]]
|style="vertical-align: top;"| [[File:Six-wire-insertion-sorting-network.svg|200px|thumb|Insertion sorting network]]
|style="vertical-align: top;"| [[File:Six-wire-pyramid-sorting-network.svg|200px|thumb|When allowing for parallel comparators, bubble sort and insertion sort are identical]]
|}

The insertion network (or equivalently, bubble network) has a depth of {{math|2''n'' - 3}}.&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt; This is better than the {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} time needed by [[Random-access machine|random-access machines]], but it turns out that there are much more efficient sorting networks with a depth of just {{math|''O''(log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'')}}, as described [[#Constructing sorting networks|below]].

===Zero-one principle===

While it is easy to prove the validity of some sorting networks (like the insertion/bubble sorter), it is not always so easy. There are {{math|''n''!}} permutations of numbers in an {{mvar|n}}-wire network, and to test all of them would take a significant amount of time, especially when {{mvar|n}} is large.  The number of test cases can be reduced significantly, to {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, using the so-called zero-one principle.  While still exponential, this is smaller than {{math|''n''!}} for all {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}}, and the difference grows rapidly with increasing {{mvar|n}}.

The zero-one principle states that, if a sorting network can correctly sort all {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} sequences of zeros and ones, then it is also valid for arbitrary ordered inputs. This not only drastically cuts down on the number of tests needed to ascertain the validity of a network, it is of great use in creating many constructions of sorting networks as well.

The principle can be proven by first observing the following fact about comparators: when a [[monotonic function|monotonically increasing]] function {{mvar|f}} is applied to the inputs, i.e., {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are replaced by {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and {{math|''f''(''y'')}}, then the comparator produces {{math|min(''f''(''x''), ''f''(''y'')) {{=}} ''f''(min(''x'', ''y''))}} and {{math|max(''f''(''x''), ''f''(''y'')) {{=}} ''f''(max(''x'', ''y''))}}. By [[Mathematical induction|induction]] on the depth of the network, this result can be extended to a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] stating that if the network transforms the sequence {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} into {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, it will transform {{math|''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} into {{math|''f''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''f''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. The proof now proceeds [[proof by contradiction|by contradiction]]: suppose that some input {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} contains two items {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and the network incorrectly swaps these in the output. Then it will also incorrectly sort {{math|''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for the function

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \begin{cases}
        1\ &amp;\mbox{if } x &gt; a_i \\
        0\ &amp;\mbox{otherwise.}
       \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

This function is monotonic, so we have the zero-one principle as the [[Contraposition|contrapositive]].&lt;ref name="clrs"/&gt;{{rp|640–641}}

==Constructing sorting networks==
Various algorithms exist to construct simple, yet efficient sorting networks of depth {{math|''O''(log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'')}} (hence size {{math|''O''(''n'' log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'')}}) such as [[Batcher odd–even mergesort]], [[bitonic sort]], [[Shell sort]], and the [[Pairwise sorting network]]. These networks are often used in practice. It is also possible, in theory, to construct networks of logarithmic depth for arbitrary size, using a construction called the ''AKS network'', after its discoverers [[Miklós Ajtai|Ajtai]], [[János Komlós (mathematician)|Komlós]], and [[Endre Szemerédi|Szemerédi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | doi = 10.1145/800061.808726| title = An {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} sorting network| work = Proceedings of the fifteenth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing | conference = [[Symposium on Theory of Computing|STOC]] '83| pages = 1–9| year = 1983| last1 = Ajtai | first1 = M. |author-link1 = Miklós Ajtai| last2 = Komlós | first2 = J. |author-link2 = János Komlós (mathematician)| last3 = Szemerédi | first3 = E. |author-link3 = Endre Szemerédi| isbn = 0-89791-099-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While an important theoretical discovery, the AKS network has little or no practical application because of the linear constant hidden by the [[Big-O notation]], which is in the "many, many thousands".&lt;ref name="clrs"/&gt;{{rp|653}} These are partly due to a construction of an [[expander graph]]. A simplified version of the AKS network was described by [[Michael S. Paterson|Paterson]], who notes that "the constants obtained for the depth bound still prevent the construction being of practical value".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01840378| title = Improved sorting networks with {{math|''O''(log ''N'')}} depth| journal = Algorithmica| volume = 5| pages = 75–92| year = 1990| last1 = Paterson | first1 = M. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another construction of sorting networks of size {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} was discovered by [[Michael T. Goodrich|Goodrich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodrich|first1=Michael|authorlink1=Michael T. Goodrich|arxiv=1403.2777|title=Zig-zag Sort: A Simple Deterministic Data-Oblivious Sorting Algorithm Running in O(n log n) Time|date=March 2014|doi=10.1145/2591796.2591830|journal=Proceedings of the 46th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing - STOC '14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While their size has a much smaller constant factor than that of AKS networks, their depth is {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}}, which makes them inefficient for parallel implementation.

===Optimal sorting networks===
For small, fixed numbers of inputs {{mvar|n}}, ''optimal'' sorting networks can be constructed, with either minimal depth (for maximally parallel execution) or minimal size (number of comparators). These networks can be used to increase the performance of larger sorting networks resulting from the [[divide and conquer algorithm|recursive]] constructions of, e.g., Batcher, by halting the recursion early and inserting optimal nets as base cases.&lt;ref name="parberry91"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ian |last=Parberry |title=A Computer Assisted Optimal Depth Lower Bound for Nine-Input Sorting Networks |journal=Mathematical Systems Theory |volume=24 |pages=101–116 |year=1991 |url=http://larc.unt.edu/ian/pubs/9-input.pdf |doi=10.1007/bf02090393}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table summarizes the known optimality results:

The first sixteen depth-optimal networks are listed in Knuth's ''[[The Art of Computer Programming|Art of Computer Programming]]'',&lt;ref name="knuth"&gt;{{cite book |first=D. E. |last=Knuth |authorlink=Donald Knuth |title=[[The Art of Computer Programming]], Volume 3: Sorting and Searching |edition=Second |publisher=Addison–Wesley |year=1997 |isbn=0-201-89685-0 |pages=219–247}} Section 5.3.4: Networks for Sorting.&lt;/ref&gt; and have been since the 1973 edition; however, while the optimality of the first eight was established by [[Robert Floyd|Floyd]] and Knuth in the 1960s, this property wasn't proven for the final six until 2014&lt;ref name="bundala_zavodny"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-04921-2_19| title = Optimal Sorting Networks| journal = Language and Automata Theory and Applications| volume = 8370| pages = 236–247| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 2014| last1 = Bundala | first1 = D. | last2 = Závodný | first2 = J. | isbn = 978-3-319-04920-5| arxiv = 1310.6271}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the cases nine and ten having been decided in 1991&lt;ref name="parberry91"/&gt;).

For one to ten inputs, minimal (i.e. size-optimal) sorting networks are known, and for higher values, lower bounds on their sizes {{math|''S''(''n'')}} can be derived inductively using a lemma due to Van Voorhis: {{math|''S''(''n'' + 1) ≥ ''S''(''n'') + ⌈log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')⌉}}. All ten optimal networks have been known since 1969, with the first eight again being known as optimal since the work of Floyd and Knuth, but optimality of the cases {{math|''n'' {{=}} 9}} and {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10}} took until 2014 to be resolved.&lt;ref name="codish"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Codish |first1=Michael |last2=Cruz-Filipe |first2=Luís |last3=Frank |first3=Michael |last4= Schneider-Kamp |first4=Peter |title=Twenty-Five Comparators is Optimal when Sorting Nine Inputs (and Twenty-Nine for Ten) |conference=Proc. Int'l Conf. Tools with AI (ICTAI) |arxiv=1405.5754 |year=2014 |pages=186–193|bibcode=2014arXiv1405.5754C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some work in designing optimal sorting network has been done using [[genetic algorithm]]s: D. Knuth mentions that depth-optimal sorting networks for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 9}} and {{math|''n'' {{=}} 11}} were found by Loren Schwiebert using this method in 2001.&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt;

===Complexity of testing sorting networks===

It is unlikely that significant further improvements can be made for testing general sorting networks, unless [[P vs NP|P=NP]], because the problem of testing whether a candidate network is a sorting network is known to be [[co-NP]]-complete.&lt;ref name=parberry&gt;{{cite conference |last=Parberry|first=Ian|title=On the Computational Complexity of Optimal Sorting Network Verification|journal=Proc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7472">'''Spatial [[epidemiology]]''' is a [[Discipline (academia)|subfield]] of [[health geography]] focused on the study of the [[Space|spatial]] distribution of health outcomes.

Specifically, spatial epidemiology is concerned with the description and examination of disease and its geographic variations. This is done in consideration of “demographic, environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, genetic, and infections risk factors."&lt;ref name=pmid15198920&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=Paul |last2=Wartenberg |first2=Daniel |title=Spatial epidemiology: current approaches and future challenges |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=112 |issue=9 |pages=998–1006 |year=2004 |pmid=15198920 |pmc=1247193 |jstor=3838101 |doi=10.1289/ehp.6735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of studies==
;Disease Mapping:
* Disease maps are visual representations of intricate geographic data that provide a quick overview of said information. Mainly used for explanatory purposes, disease maps can be presented to survey high-risk areas and to help policy and resource allocation in said areas.

;Geographic correlation studies
* Geographic correlation studies attempt to study the geographical factors and their effects on geographically differentiated health outcomes. Measured on an ecologic scale, these factors include environmental variables (quality of surrounding space), socioeconomic and demographic statistics (income and race), or even lifestyle choices (nutrition or diet) of the population groups under study. This approach has the convenience of being able to employ already available data from various surveying sources.

;Clustering, disease clusters, and surveillance.
* Disease clusters, or spatial groupings of proximity and characteristically related epidemics. While the term itself is relatively poorly defined, it generally “implies an excess of cases above some background rate bounded in time and space.”&lt;ref name=pmid15198920/&gt; Although clustering is not the most precise method for spatial analysis, it can and has proved useful for health-related surveillance and monitoring.

Because the statistical models used to draw up such research are complex, the data analysis and the interpretation of results should be carried out by qualified statisticians. Sometimes, the proliferation of errors in disease mapping has led to inefficient decision-making, implementation of inappropriate health policies and negative impact on the advancement of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ocaña-Riola R |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |year=2010 |pmid=20503184 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
;Data availability and quality
* Since spatial epidemiology is almost entirely based on the analysis of data and its various visual representations, data collection methods must be routine, accurate, and publicly available. With the advent of specialized and accurate health equipment and global information networks, these methods can be relatively and easily improved. Compiling and standardizing data can also be done efficiently and usefully given the right tools and processes.

;Data protection and confidentiality
* In our current time, legislation in the United States regarding individual human rights are gaining increasing support, especially in regards to the confidentiality of personal health data and consent over its use in medical investigations. Safe and secure data is a crucial aspect of successful epidemiologic research.

;Exposure assessment and mapping
* Typically always seen as an analytical weakness, the quality of exposure data, or reported accuracy of the spatial reach of epidemics, is especially important in spatial epidemiology. With the more mainstream use of geographic information systems, the capabilities of spatial interpolation and mapping have been tremendously improved, yet these still greatly depend on the precision and legitimacy of the source data commissioned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2324">The '''[[Stockholm Environment Institute]] (SEI)''' is an international research organization focusing on the issue of sustainable development. SEI has its headquarters in Stockholm with a network structure of permanent and associated staff worldwide and with centres the US, York (UK), Oxford (UK), Tallinn (Estonia), and Bangkok (Thailand).

SEI's US center is a research affiliate of Tufts University in Massachusetts and also has offices in Davis, California, and Seattle, Washington. It conducts a diverse programme focusing on the social, technological and institutional requirements for a transition to sustainability.  Its funders include the United Nations, the World Bank, and numerous foundations and national governments such as the United States, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.

In addition to providing policy-relevant analyses, the Center works to build capacity in developing countries for integrated sustainability planning through training and collaboration on projects.  Its decision support tools are widely used: [[LEAP:Long range Energy Alternatives Planning System|LEAP]] for energy planning and climate change mitigation, [[Weap|WEAP]] for water resources planning and PoleStar for evaulating sustainable development strategies.

Its activities are organized into three programs:

* The Climate and Energy Program conducts energy system analyses, examines environmental consequences of energy use such as global warming, and develops policies for a transition to efficient and renewable energy technology.
* The Water Resources Program brings an integrated perspective to freshwater assessment, one that seeks sustainable water solutions by balancing the needs for basic water services, development and the environment.
* The Sustainable Development Studies Program takes a holistic perspective in assessing sustainability at global, regional, and national levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11053">'''Superdiversity''', or '''super-diversity''', is a [[social science]] term and concept often said to have been coined by sociologist Steven Vertovec in a 2007 article in ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'',&lt;ref name=Vertovec&gt;{{cite journal|first=Steven|last=Vertovec|title=Super-diversity and its implications|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=30|issue=6|pages=1024-1054|year=2007|doi=10.1080/01419870701599465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/socio-cultural-diversity/research-focus/ |title=Research focus|publisher=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity|date= |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which he first used in a [[BBC]] article in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4266102.stm |title=Opinion: Super-diversity revealed |publisher=BBC News |date= 20 September 2005 |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and usage==
The term superdiversity is used to refer to some current levels of population diversity that are significantly higher than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/superdiversity-institute/about/about-superdiversity.aspx |title=About superdiversity|publisher=University of Birmingham |date= |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertovec argues superdiversity in Britain "is distinguished by a dynamic interplay of variables among an increased number of new, small and scattered, multiple-origin, transnationally connected, socio-economically differentiated and legally stratified immigrants who have arrived over the last decade".&lt;ref name=Vertovec/&gt; It denotes increased diversity not only between immigrant and ethnic minority groups, but also within them. It has also been called the "diversification of diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recognise superdiversity in S'pore to overcome stereotyping|url=http://www.todayonline.com/daily-focus/education/recognise-superdiversity-spore-overcome-stereotyping|work=Today|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertovec gives the example of [[Somalis in the United Kingdom]], arguing that the Somali community includes British citizens, [[refugees]] and [[asylum seeker]]s, people granted [[exceptional leave to remain]], undocumented migrants, and [[secondary migrants]] from other European states.&lt;ref name=Vertovec/&gt; Parveen Akhtar, a sociologist at the [[University of Bradford]], argues that the UK is no longer characterized by diversity but by superdiversity: "Post-1945 you had large waves of immigration from fewer places in the world, largely from the former colonies. Now, since the 1980s, you’ve got smaller waves of immigration from a wider range of places".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How will 'super diversity' affect the future of British politics|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/08/immigration-britains-changing-identity|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Nasar Meer, "Super-diversity has emerged both as a description of empirical phenomena (the proliferation of diversities) and as a normative claim that increased pluralism (both associated with migration as well as wider changes in our understanding of identity categories) requires social scientists and policy makers to develop approaches to register this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key Concepts in Race and Ethnicity|first=Nasar|last=Meer|year=2014|location=London|publisher=Sage|isbn=9780857028686|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fran Meissner and Steven Vertovec, writing in 2015, the concept of superdiversity has been the subject of "considerable attention" since Vertovec introduced it in 2005. They note that Vertovec's 2007 article in ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' is the most [[Citation|cited]] article in the history of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparing super-diversity|first1=Fran|last1=Meissner|first2=Steven|last2=Vertovec|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=38|issue=4|pages=541–555|year=2015|doi=10.1080/01419870.2015.980295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has started to influence the fields of [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mutsaers|first1=Paul|last2=Swanenberg|first2=Jos|title=Super-diversity at the margins? Youth language in North Brabant, The Netherlands|journal=Sociolinguistic Studies|year=2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=65–89|doi=10.1558/sols.v6i1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some authors are critical of the concept of superdiversity. Sinfree B. Makoni argues that the concept "contains a powerful sense of social romanticism, creating an illusion of equality in a highly asymmetrical world, particularly in contexts characterized by a search for homogenization...I find it disconcerting, to say the least, to have an open celebration of diversity in societies marked by violent xenophobia, such as South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Critique of Language, Languaging and Supervernacular|first=Sinfree B.|last=Makoni|journal=Muitas Vozes|volume=1|issue=2|pages=189-199|year=2012|doi=10.5212/MuitasVozes.v.1i2.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ana Deumert argues:  “The use of ‘superdiverse’ as a descriptive adjective, is a theoretical cul-de-sac, because the complexities brought about by diversity in the social world ultimately defy numerical measurement” &lt;ref&gt; Deumert, A. (2014) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/22116958/4/supp/C Digital superdiversity: A commentary. Discourse, Context, and Media,4-5, 116-120].&lt;/ref&gt;
The claims of increased migrations and diversity have been challenged by Czajka and de Haas (2014). They observe that while globally the number of migrants has increased so has the world population so the ''proportion'' of  migrants has actually decreased . In the Americas migration has increased but diversity hasn't. The fact that migrations have centered on a “shrinking pool of prime destination countries”  (many of them small countries in Western Europe) led them to conclude that “the idea that immigration has become more diverse may partly reveal a Eurocentric worldview”&lt;ref&gt;Czajka, M. &amp; de Haas (2014) [http://iussp.org/sites/default/files/event_call_for_papers/The%20Globalization%20of%20Migration_extended%20abstract.pdf The globalization of migration: Has the world become more migratory]? International Migration Review, 48, 2, 283-323.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aneta Pavlenko argues that superdiversity is an exercise in academic branding  which  fails as an academic term:&lt;ref&gt;Pavlenko, A (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292157452_Superdiversity_and_why_it_isn't_Reflections_on_terminological_innovations_and_academic_branding Superdiversity and why it isn't: Reflections on terminological innovations and academic branding] &lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=The uptake of the slippery slogan is not surprising. The aesthetic appeal of truthiness and the illusion of novelty, contemporaneity and relevance undoubtedly explain some of the attraction yet we cannot ignore the fact that the advent of superdiversity provided scholars of multilingualism with a new means to move up the academic ladder, distinguish their publications, and fund their work.}}

==Researchers and research institutes==
Key researchers working on superdiversity include Vertovec, [[Jan Blommaert]] and Jenny Phillimore. The University of Birmingham established the Institute for Research into Superdiversity in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elkes |first=Neil |url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/local-news/superdiversity-represents-real-opportunity-birmingham-4311557 |title=Superdiversity represents real opportunity for Birmingham |work=Birmingham Post |date=14 June 2013|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity]] in [[Göttingen]] is also an important centre for superdiversity research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://interlandaston.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/exploring-superdiversity-at-the-max-planck-institute/ |title=Exploring Superdiversity at the Max Planck Institute|website=Interland at Aston University|publisher=Aston University|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's "Superdiversity Stocktake: Impact on Business, Government and on New Zealand" was launched in November 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/73871314/New-Zealand-needs-to-adapt-to-diversity|title=New Zealand needs to adapt to diversity|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=10 November 2015|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsored by banks, companies, the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]], and the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]]. A study on "Implications of Superdiversity for NZ’s Electoral Laws and Democracy" was also launched. Both projects were carried out by the Superdiversity Centre for Law, Policy and Business, which describes itself as "a multidisciplinary centre specialising in analysing the law, policy and business implications of New Zealand’s superdiversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdiversity Stocktake to launch|url=http://www.immigration.govt.nz/employers/retain/settlementactionz/sept2015/superdiversitystocktake.htm|publisher=Immigration New Zealand|accessdate=2 November 2015|date=1 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202070431/http://www.immigration.govt.nz/employers/retain/settlementactionz/sept2015/superdiversitystocktake.htm|archivedate=2 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdiversity Centre for Law, Policy and Business|url=http://www.chenpalmer.com/superdiversity/|publisher=Chen Palmer|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its patron is Sir [[Anand Satyanand]] and its chair is [[Mai Chen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Personnel|url=http://www.chenpalmer.com/superdiversity/key-personnel/|publisher=Chen Palmer|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Systems theory in political science''' is a highly abstract, partly holistic view of [[politics]], influenced by [[cybernetics]]. The adaptation of [[system theory]] to [[political science]] was first conceived by [[David Easton]] in 1953.

==Overview==
In simple terms, Easton's [[behavioral]] approach to politics, proposed that a political system could be seen as a delimited (i.e. all political systems have precise boundaries) and fluid (changing) system of steps in decision making. Greatly simplifying his model:&lt;ref&gt;Easton, David. (1965). ''A Systems Analysis of Political Life''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
Influence of computers on the discipline of political science and the political system work within an environment.
The environment generates different demands from different section of society such as reservation system in the matter of a certain group,demand for better transportation etc.
* Step 1. changes in the social or physical environment surrounding a political system produce "demands" and "supports" for action or the status quo directed as "inputs" towards the political system, through political behavior.
* Step 2, these demands and supporting groups stimulate competition in a political system, leading to decisions or "outputs" directed at some aspect of the surrounding social or physical environment.
* Step 3, after a decision or output is made (e.g., a specific policy), it interacts with its environment, and if it produces change in the environment, there are "outcomes."
* Step 4, when a new policy interacts with its environment, outcomes may generate new demands or supports and groups in support or against the policy ("feedback") or a new policy on some related matter.
* Step 5, feedback, leads back to Step 1, forming a never-ending cycle.

If the system functions as described, then we have a "stable political system". If the system breaks down, then we have a "dysfunctional political system".

===Political analysis===
Easton aspired to make politics a science, that is, working with highly abstract models that described the regularities of patterns and processes in political life in general. In his view, the highest level of abstraction could make scientific generalizations about politics possible. In sum, politics should be seen as a whole, not as a collection of different problems to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, David. (1953). ''The Political System: An Inquiry into the State of Political Science''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

His main model was driven by an organic view of politics, as if it were a living object. His theory is a statement of what makes political systems adapt and survive. He describes politics in a constant flux, thereby rejecting the idea of "equilibrium", so prevalent in some other political theories (see [[Institutionalism in political parties|institutionalism]]). Moreover, he rejects the idea that politics could be examined by looking at different levels of analysis. His abstractions could account for any group and demand at any given time. That is, interest group theory and elite theory can be subsumed in political systems analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, David. (1965). ''A Framework for Political Analysis''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
His theory was and is highly influential in the [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist tradition]] in political science. (see [[Harold Lasswell]] and [[Robert Dahl]])

'''''The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music''''' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik}}) is an 1872 work of [[dramatic theory]] by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. It was reissued in 1886 as ''The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus}}). The later edition contained a prefatory essay, "[[s:An Attempt at Self-Criticism|An Attempt at Self-Criticism]]", wherein Nietzsche commented on this earliest book.

== The Book ==

Nietzsche found in [[Theater of ancient Greece|classical Athenian]] [[tragedy]] an art form that transcended the [[pessimism]] and [[nihilism]] of a fundamentally meaningless world. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering and affirming it, passionately and joyously affirmed the meaning of their own existence. They knew themselves to be infinitely more than petty individuals, finding self-affirmation not in another life, not in a world to come, but in the terror and ecstasy alike celebrated in the performance of tragedies.

Originally educated as a [[philology|philologist]], Nietzsche discusses the history of the tragic form and introduces an intellectual [[dichotomy]] between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysian and the Apollonian]] (very loosely: reality as disordered and undifferentiated by forms versus reality as ordered and differentiated by forms). Nietzsche claims life always involves a struggle between these two elements, each battling for control over the existence of humanity. In Nietzsche's words, "Wherever the Dionysian prevailed, the Apollonian was checked and destroyed.... wherever the first Dionysian onslaught was successfully withstood, the authority and majesty of the Delphic god [[Apollo]] exhibited itself as more rigid and menacing than ever." Yet neither side ever prevails due to each containing the other in an eternal, natural check or balance.

Nietzsche argues that the tragedy of Ancient Greece was the highest form of art due to its mixture of both Apollonian and Dionysian elements into one seamless whole, allowing the spectator to experience the full spectrum of the [[human condition]]. The Dionysian element was to be found in the music of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]], while the Apollonian element was found in the dialogue which gave a concrete symbolism that balanced the Dionysian revelry. Basically, the Apollonian spirit was able to give form to the abstract Dionysian.

Before the tragedy, there was an era of static, idealized plastic art in the form of sculpture that represented the Apollonian view of the world. The Dionysian element was to be found in the wild revelry of festivals and drunkenness, but, most importantly, in music. The combination of these elements in one art form gave birth to tragedy. He theorizes that the chorus was originally always [[satyr]]s, goat-men. (This is speculative, although the word “tragedy” τραγωδία is contracted from trag(o)-aoidiā = "goat song" from ''tragos'' = "goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing".) Thus, he argues, “the illusion of culture was wiped away by the primordial image of man” for the audience; they participated with and as the chorus empathetically, “so that they imagined themselves as restored natural geniuses, as satyrs.” But in this state, they have an Apollonian dream vision of themselves, of the energy they're embodying. It's a vision of the god, of Dionysus, who appears before the chorus on the stage. And the actors and the plot are the development of that dream vision, the essence of which is the ecstatic dismembering of the god and of the [[Bacchante]]s' rituals, of the inseparable ecstasy and suffering of human existence.

After the time of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]], there was an age where tragedy died.  Nietzsche ties this to the influence of writers like [[Euripides]] and the coming of rationality, represented by [[Socrates]].  Euripides reduced the use of the chorus and was more naturalistic in his representation of human drama, making it more reflective of the realities of daily life. Socrates emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of myth and suffering to human knowledge. For Nietzsche, these two intellectuals helped drain the ability of the individual to participate in forms of art, because they saw things too soberly and rationally. The ''[[participation mystique]]'' aspect of art and myth was lost, and along with it, much of man's ability to live creatively in [[optimistic]] harmony with the sufferings of life. Nietzsche concludes that it may be possible to reattain the balance of Dionysian and Apollonian in modern art through the operas of [[Richard Wagner]], in a ''rebirth'' of tragedy.

In contrast to the typical [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view of ancient Greek culture as noble, simple, elegant and grandiose, Nietzsche believed the Greeks were grappling with pessimism. The universe in which we live is the product of great interacting forces; but we neither observe nor know these as such. What we put together as our conceptions of the world, Nietzsche thought, never actually addresses the underlying realities. It is human destiny to be controlled by the darkest universal realities and, at the same time, to live life in a human-dreamt world of illusions.

The issue, then, or so Nietzsche thought, is how to experience and understand the Dionysian side of life without destroying the obvious values of the Apollonian side. It is not healthy for an individual, or for a whole society, to become entirely absorbed in the rule of one or the other. The soundest (healthiest) foothold is in both. Nietzsche's theory of Athenian tragic drama suggests exactly how, before Euripides and Socrates, the Dionysian and Apollonian elements of life were artistically woven together. The Greek spectator became healthy through direct experience of the Dionysian within the protective spirit-of-tragedy on the Apollonian stage.

==History==
In January and February 1870, Nietzsche delivered two lectures about ancient Greek drama. After receiving copies of the lectures, his friends Richard and [[Cosima Wagner]] suggested that he write a book about the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1871, he submitted a manuscript to publisher [[Wilhelm Engelmann]]. When Englemann was unresponsive, Nietzsche asked for the return of the manuscript in June. He had a portion of the book [[Vanity press|privately printed]] under the title ''Socrates and Greek Tragedy'' ({{lang-de|Sokrates und griechische Tragödie}}) and sent to friends. Richard Wagner received the first copy on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1871, Nietzsche submitted a revised manuscript to E. W. Fritzsch, who had published works by Wagner. Fritzsch accepted the book in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was completed at the end of December, and the book, now titled ''The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik}}), reached bookstores on 2 January 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition was printed by Fritzsch in 1874, but due to the publisher's financial problems, it was not bound until 1875 and had little circulation. In 1878, the remaining copies and publication rights for the first two editions were acquired by Nietzsche's new publisher, Ernst Schmeitzner.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1886, Nietzsche had fallen out with Schmeitzner, and Fritzsch had recovered from his financial difficulties. Fritzsch published a new edition in October 1886, retitled ''The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus}}), with an added prefatory essay by Nietzsche called "An Attempt at Self-Criticism", commenting on the earlier editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
''The Birth of Tragedy'' is a young man's work, and shows the influence of many of the philosophers Nietzsche had been studying. His interest in classical Greece as in some respects a rational society can be attributed in some measure to the influence of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], although Nietzsche departed from Winckelmann in many ways.  In addition, Nietzsche uses the term "naïve" in exactly the sense used by [[Friedrich Schiller]]. Of great importance are the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], especially ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''. The Apollonian experience bears great similarity to the experience of the world as "representation" in Schopenhauer's sense, and the experience of the Dionysian bears similarities to the identification with the world as "will." Nietzsche opposed Schopenhauer's Buddhistic negation of the will. He argued that life is worth living despite the enormous amount of cruelty and suffering that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

One year before the publication of ‘’The Birth of Tragedy’’, Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljp2NPK0qPAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=nietzsche+%2B+%22what+we+here+have+asserted%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vxdZT8bsHc6I0QGJt_DRDw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Music and Words]. In it he asserted the Schopenhauerian judgment that  music is a primary expression of the essence of everything.  Secondarily derivative are lyrical poetry and drama, which represent mere phenomenal appearances of objects. In this way, tragedy is born from music.

== Reception ==
''The Birth of Tragedy'' was angrily criticized by many respected professional scholars of Greek literature. Particularly vehement was philologist [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], who denounced Nietzsche's work as slipshod and misleading. Prompted by Nietzsche, [[Erwin Rohde]]—a friend who had written a favorable review that sparked the first derogatory debate over the book—responded by exposing Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's inaccurate citations of Nietzsche's work. [[Richard Wagner]] also issued a response to Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's critique, but his action only served to characterize Nietzsche as the composer's lackey.

In his denunciation of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Wilamowitz says:

:Herr N. ... is also a professor of classical philology; he treats a series of very important questions of Greek literary history. ... This is what I want to illuminate, and it is easy to prove that here also imaginary genius and impudence in the presentation of his claims stands in direct relation to his ignorance and lack of love of the truth. ... His solution is to belittle the historical-critical method, to scold any aesthetic insight which deviates from his own, and to ascribe a "complete misunderstanding of the study of antiquity" to the age in which philology in Germany, especially through the work of [[Gottfried Hermann]] and [[Karl Lachmann]], was raised to an unprecedented height.

In suggesting the Greeks might have had problems, Nietzsche was departing from the scholarly traditions of his age, which viewed the Greeks as a happy, perhaps even naive, and simple people. The work is a web of professional [[philology]], philosophical insight, and admiration of musical art. As a work in philology, it was almost immediately rejected, virtually destroying Nietzsche's academic aspirations. The music theme was so closely associated with Richard Wagner that it became an embarrassment to Nietzsche once he himself had achieved some distance and independence from Wagner. It stands, then, as Nietzsche's first complete, published philosophical work, one in which a battery of questions are asked, sketchily identified, and questionably answered.

Marianne Cowan, in her introduction to Nietzsche's ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', describes the situation in these words:
:''The Birth of Tragedy'' presented a view of the Greeks so alien to the spirit of the time and to the ideals of its scholarship that it blighted Nietzsche's entire academic career.  It provoked pamphlets and counter-pamphlets attacking him on the grounds of common sense, scholarship and sanity. For a time, Nietzsche, then a professor of classical philology at the [[University of Basel]], had no students in his field.  His lectures were sabotaged by German philosophy professors who advised their students not to show up for Nietzsche's courses.

By 1886, Nietzsche himself had reservations about the work, and he published a preface in the 1886 edition where he re-evaluated some of his main concerns and ideas in the text. In this post-script, Nietzsche referred to ''The Birth of Tragedy'' as "an impossible book... badly written, ponderous, embarrassing, image-mad and image-confused, sentimental, saccharine to the point of effeminacy, uneven in tempo, [and] without the will to logical cleanliness."&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he defended the "arrogant and rhapsodic book" for inspiring "fellow-rhapsodizers" and for luring them on to "new secret paths and dancing places."

In 1888, in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', Nietzsche was back on the attack. He defends ''The Birth of Tragedy'' by stating: "...It is indifferent toward politics,—'un-German,' to use the language of the present time—it smells offensively Hegelian, and the cadaverous perfume of Schopenhauer sticks only to a few formulas. An 'idea'—the antithesis of the Dionysian and the Apollinian—translated into the metaphysical; history itself as the development of this 'idea'; in tragedy this antithesis is sublimated into a unity; under this perspective things that had never before faced each other are suddenly juxtaposed, used to illuminate each other, and comprehended... Opera, for example, and the revolution.— The two decisive innovations of the book are, first, its understanding of the Dionysian phenomenon among the Greeks: for the first time, a psychological analysis of this phenomenon is offered, and it is considered as one root of the whole of Greek art. The other is the understanding of Socratism: Socrates is recognized for the first time as an instrument of Greek disintegration, as a typical décadent. 'Rationality' against instinct. 'Rationality' at any price as a dangerous force that undermines life!— Profound, hostile silence about Christianity throughout the book. That is neither Apollinian nor Dionysian; it negates all aesthetic values—the only values that the 'Birth of Tragedy' recognizes: it is nihilistic in the most profound sense, while in the Dionysian symbol the ultimate limit of affirmation is attained. There is one allusion [The Birth of Tragedy, 24] to Christian priests as a 'vicious kind of dwarfs' who are 'subterranean' ..."

In the title of his novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'', [[Thomas Mann]] alludes to a passage from ''The Birth of Tragedy'', and the influence of Nietzsche's work can be seen in the novel's character Mynheer Peepercorn, who embodies the "Dionysian principle."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''The Birth of Tragedy'' (Trans. Douglas Smith), Oxford University Press, 2008: pp. xxxii, 28, 109, 140. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of a critical study of Nietzsche's "atheist humanism", the influential Catholic theologian [[Henri de Lubac]] considered it "a work of genius", and dedicated several pages of his study to explicate the relationship between Nietzsche's early thought and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;De Lubac, Henri, ''The Drama of Atheist Humanism'', Ignatius Press (San Francisco), 2008: pp. 74, 82. For De Lubac's full discussion of this early work of Nietzsche, see ''id''., pp. 73–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia''''' is a 1974 [[utopian]] [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], set in the same [[fictional universe]] as that of ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (the [[Hainish Cycle]]). The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1974,&lt;ref name="WWE-1974"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a nomination for the [[John W. Campbell]] Memorial Award in 1975.&lt;ref name="WWE-1975"/&gt; It achieved a degree of literary recognition unusual for science fiction works due to its exploration of many themes, including anarchism and revolutionary societies, capitalism and individualism and collectivism.

It features the development of the mathematical theory underlying the fictional [[ansible]], an instantaneous communications device that plays a critical role in Le Guin's Hainish Cycle. The invention of the ansible places the novel first in the [[Hainish Cycle#Novels|internal chronology of the Hainish Cycle]], although it was the fifth Hainish novel published.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Word for World is Forest]]'', the newly created ansible is brought to Athshe, a planet being settled by [[Earth]]-[[humans]]. In other tales in the Hainish Cycle, the ansible already exists. The word "ansible" was coined in ''[[Rocannon's World]]'' (first in order of publication but third in internal chronology), where it is central to the plot.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In her new introduction to the [[Library of America]] reprint in 2017, the author wrote:
{{bquote|''The Dispossessed'' started as a very bad short story, which I didn’t try to finish but couldn’t quite let go. There was a book in it, and I knew it, but the book had to wait for me to learn what I was writing about and how to write about it. I needed to understand my own passionate opposition to the war that we were, endlessly it seemed, waging in Vietnam, and endlessly protesting at home. If I had known then that my country would continue making aggressive wars for the rest of my life, I might have had less energy for protesting that one. But, knowing only that [[Down by the Riverside|I didn’t want to study war no more]], I studied peace. I started by reading a whole mess of utopias and learning something about pacifism and [[Gandhi]] and [[nonviolent resistance]]. This led me to the nonviolent anarchist writers such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Paul Goodman]]. With them I felt a great, immediate affinity. They made sense to me in the way [[Lao Tzu]] did. They enabled me to think about war, peace, politics, how we govern one another and ourselves, the value of failure, and the strength of what is weak.

So, when I realised that nobody had yet written an anarchist utopia, I finally began to see what my book might be. And I found that its principal character, whom I’d first glimpsed in the original misbegotten story, was alive and well—my guide to Anarres. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.tor.com/2017/08/30/introduction-from-ursula-k-le-guin-the-hainish-novels-stories-volume-one/ “Introduction” from Ursula K. Le Guin: The Hainish Novels &amp; Stories, Volume One], retrieved 9/8/2017 &lt;/ref&gt;}}

Le Guin's parents, academic anthropologists [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Alfred]] and [[Theodora Kroeber]], were friends with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]; Le Guin stated that Oppenheimer was the model for Shevek, the book's protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spivack|first=Charlotte|title=Ursula K. Le Guin|year=1984|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=0805773932}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

==Setting==

''The Dispossessed'' is set on [[Anarres]] and [[Urras (fictional planet)|Urras]], the twin inhabited worlds of [[Tau Ceti in fiction|Tau Ceti]]. Urras is divided into several [[State (polity)|states]] and dominated by its two largest, the rivals A-Io and Thu. The former has a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy and [[patriarchy|patriarchal system]], and the latter is an authoritarian system that claims to rule in the name of the [[proletariat]]. A-Io has oppositional [[left-wing]] parties, one of which is closely linked to the rival society Thu.

The other world, Anarres, represents a third ideological structure: [[anarcho-syndicalism]]. Its society has weakened influence due to their ancestors' self-imposed exile from Urras. Some citizens of A-Io contact the Anarresti protagonist Shevek, chiding him for betraying his beliefs by working at the university and accepting the government's hospitality.

A revolution sparks in the major, yet undeveloped third area of Benbili. A-Io invades the Thu-supported revolutionary area, generating a [[proxy war]]. Although there are a wide variety of political parties in A-Io, there are none on Anarres.

== Plot summary ==
The chapters alternate between the two planets and in time. The even-numbered chapters, which are set on Anarres, take place first chronologically and are followed by  the odd-numbered chapters, which take place on Urras. The only exceptions occur in the first and last chapters, which take place in both worlds.

In order to forestall an [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] rebellion, the major Urrasti states gave the revolutionaries (inspired by a visionary named Odo) the right to live on Anarres, along with a guarantee of non-interference, approximately two hundred years before the events of ''The Dispossessed''. (The story is told in Le Guin's "[[The Day Before the Revolution]]".)  Before this, Anarres had had no permanent settlements, apart from some mining facilities.

The economic and political situation of Anarres and its relation to Urras is ambiguous. The people of Anarres consider themselves as being free and independent, having broken off from the political and social influence of the old world. However, the powers of Urras consider Anarres as being essentially their mining colony, as the annual consignment of Anarres' [[precious metals]] and their distribution to major powers on Urras is a major economic event of the old world.

===Anarres (chapters 1,2,4,6,8,10,12,13)===
Chapter One begins in the middle of the story. The protagonist Shevek is a physicist attempting to develop a General Temporal Theory. The physics of the book describes time as having a much deeper, more complex structure than we understand it. It incorporates not only mathematics and physics, but also philosophy and ethics. Shevek finds his work blocked by a jealous superior, as his theories conflict with the prevailing political philosophy and are thus distrusted by the society. His work is further disrupted by his obligation to perform manual labor during a drought in this anarchist society; in order to ensure survival in a harsh environment, the people of Anarres must put the needs of  society ahead of their own personal desires, so Shevek performs hard agricultural labor in a dusty desert instead of working on his research. He arranges to go to Urras to finish and publish his theory.

===Urras (chapters 1,3,5,7,9,11,13)===
Arriving on Urras, Shevek is feted. Shevek soon finds himself disgusted with the social, sexual and political conventions of the hierarchical capitalist society of Urras. He joins in a labor protest that is violently suppressed, but he escapes to safety. Finally, he is sponsored by ambassadors of Terra who provide him safe passage back to Anarres.

==Themes==

=== Symbolism ===
The ambiguity of Anarres' economic and political situation in relation to Urras is symbolically manifested in the low wall surrounding Anarres' single spaceport. This wall is the only place on the [[anarchist]] planet where "No Trespassing!" signs may be seen, and it is where the book begins and ends. The people of Anarres believe that the wall divides a free world from the corrupting influence of an oppressor's ships. On the other hand, the wall could be a prison wall keeping the rest of the planet imprisoned and cut off. Shevek's life attempts to answer this question.

In addition to Shevek's journey to answer questions about his society's true level of freedom, the meaning of his theories themselves weave their way into the plot; they not only describe abstract physical concepts, but they also reflect ups and downs of the characters' lives, and the transformation of the Anarresti society. An oft-quoted saying in the book is "true journey is return."&lt;ref&gt;Said by Shevek near the end of Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of Shevek's theories—which deal with the nature of time and simultaneity—have been subject to interpretation. For example, there have been interpretations that the non-linear nature of the novel is a reproduction of Shevek's theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rigsby, Ellen M. (2005), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anarchism and capitalism ===
Le Guin's foreword to the novel notes that her anarchism is closely akin to that of [[Peter Kropotkin]], whose ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|Mutual Aid]]'' closely assessed the influence of the natural world on competition and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin]], ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|Mutual Aid]]'' (1902).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many conflicts occur between the freedom of anarchism and the constraints imposed by authority and society, both on Anarres and Urras. These constraints are both physical and social. Physically, Odo was imprisoned in the Fort for nine years. Socially speaking, 'time after time the question of who is being locked out or in, which side of the wall one is on, is the focus of the narrative.' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/7/barbour7art.htm|title=Wholeness and Balance|last=Barbour|first=Douglas|publisher=Science Fiction Studies (1975)|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Tunik emphasises that ''the wall'' is the dominant metaphor for these social constraints. Shevek hits ‘the wall of charm, courtesy, indifference.” He later notes that he let a “wall be built around him” that kept him from seeing the poor people on Urras. He had been co-opted, with walls of smiles of the rich, and he didn’t know how to break them down. Shevek at one point speculates that the people on Urras are not truly free, precisely because they have so many walls built between people and are so possessive. He says, “You are all in jail. Each alone, solitary, with a heap of what he owns. You live in prison, die in prison. It is all I can see in your eyes – the wall, the wall!” ‘ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7017991/The_New_Utopian_Politics_of_Ursula_K._Le_Guins_The_Dispossessed|title=The Need for Walls: Privacy, Community, and Freedom in The Dispossessed|last=Tunik|first=Mark|publisher=Lexington Books (2005)|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not just the state of mind of those inside the prisons that concerns Shevek, he also notes the effect on those outside the walls. Steve Grossi says, ‘by building a physical wall to keep the bad in, we construct a mental wall keeping ourselves, our thoughts, and our empathy out, to the collective detriment of all." Shevek himself later says, “those who build walls are their own prisoners.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevegrossi.com/on/the-dispossessed|title=The Dispossessed|last=Grossi|first=Steve|publisher=Steve Grossi (2013)|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Guin makes this explicit in chapter two, when the schoolchildren construct their own prison and detain one of their own inside. The deleterious effect on the children outside parallels the effect on the guards in the [[Stanford Prison Experiment]] of 1971 (three years before ''The Dispossessed'' was published).&lt;ref name="paul_brians2"&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/dispossessed.html "Study Guide for Ursula LeGuin: '''The Dispossessed''' (1974)" - Paul Brians] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107225601/http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/dispossessed.html |date=2005-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doukhobor666.wordpress.com/2015/12/20/the-dispossessed/|title=The Dispossessed|publisher=Samizdat (2015)|accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language spoken on Anarres also reflects anarchism. [[Pravic]] is a [[constructed language]] in the tradition of [[Esperanto]]. Pravic reflects many aspects of the philosophical foundations of utopian anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, Davis and Peter G. Stillman. ''The New Utopian Politics of Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed'', Lexington Books (2005). Pp. 287-298.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the use of the [[possessive case]] is strongly discouraged, a feature that also is reflected by the novel's title.&lt;ref&gt;Conley, Tim and Stephen Cain. ''Encyclopedia of Fictional and Fantastic Languages''. Greenwood Press, Westport (2006). Pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Children are trained to speak only about matters that interest others; anything else is "egoizing" (pp.&amp;nbsp;28–31). There is no property ownership of any kind. Shevek's daughter, upon meeting him for the first time, tells him, "You can share the handkerchief I use"&lt;ref name="Dispossessed2"&gt;Ursula K. Le Guin, ''The Dispossessed'', p.69.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than "You may borrow my handkerchief", thus conveying the idea that the handkerchief is not owned by the girl, but is merely used by her.&lt;ref name="Burton-19852"&gt;Burton (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Utopianism ===
The work is sometimes said to represent one of the few modern revivals of the [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian genre]].&lt;ref name="Davis-20052"&gt;Davis and Stillman (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; When first published, the book included the tagline: "The magnificent epic of an ambiguous utopia!" which was shortened by fans to "An ambiguous utopia" and adopted as a subtitle in certain editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.gizmodo.com/5607981/ursula-le-guins-the-dispossessed-when-you-want-to-like-a-book-but-dont Book review discussing meanings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20719930?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Penn State University Press listing]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many characteristics of a utopian novel found in this book. For example, Shevek is an outsider when he arrives on Urras, which capitalizes on the utopian and scientific fiction theme of the "estrangement-setting".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/7/bierman7art.htm|title=Judah Bierman- Ambiguity in Utopia: The Dispossessed|website=www.depauw.edu|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Guin's utopianism, however, differs from the traditional "anarchist commune." Whereas most utopian novels attempt to convey a society that is absolutely good, this world differs as it is portrayed only as "ambiguously good."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Feminism ===
There is some disagreement as to whether ''The Dispossessed'' should be considered a [[Feminism|feminist]] utopia or a [[feminist science fiction]] novel. According to Mary Morrison of the State University of New York at Buffalo, the anarchist themes in this book help to promote feminist themes as well. Other critics, such as William Marcellino of SUNY Buffalo and Sarah Lefanu, writer of "Popular Writing and Feminist Intervention in Science Fiction," argue that there are distinct anti-feminist undertones throughout the novel.

Morrison argues that Le Guin's portrayed ideals of [[Taoism]], the celebration of labor and the body, and desire or sexual freedom in an anarchist society contribute greatly to the book's feminist message. Taoism, which rejects dualisms and divisions in favor of a [[Yin and Yang]] balance, brings attention to the balance between not only the two planets, but between the male and female inhabitants. The celebration of labor on Anarres stems from a celebration of a mother's labor, focusing on creating life rather than on building objects. The sexual freedom on Anarres also contributes to the book's feminist message.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Mary I. Anarcho-Feminism and Permanent Revolution in Ursula K. Le Guin's ‘‘The Dispossessed’’, State University of New York at Buffalo, Ann Arbor, 2011, ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/878894517&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some critics believe that Le Guin's feminist themes are either weak or not present. Some believe that the Taoist interdependence between the genders actually weakens Le Guin's feminist message. Marcellino believes that the anarchist themes in the novel take precedence and dwarf any feminist themes.&lt;ref&gt;Marcellino, William. "Shadows to Walk: Ursula Le Guin's Transgressions in Utopia." The Journal of American Culture, vol. 32, no. 3, 2009, pp. 203-213, Music Periodicals Database; Performing Arts Periodicals Database, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/200658410&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Lefanu adds that there is a difference between the feminist messages that the book explicitly presents and the anti-feminist undertones. For example, the book says that women created the society on Anarres. However, female characters seem secondary to the male protagonist, who seems to be a traditional male hero; this subversion weakens any feminist message that Le Guin was trying to convey.&lt;ref&gt;Lefanu, Sarah. "Popular Writing and Feminist Intervention in Science Fiction." Gender, Genre and Narrative Pleasure. Ed. Derek Longhurst. Vol. 9. New York: Routledge, 2012. 177-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
It has been suggested that Le Guin's title is a reference to [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoyevsky's]] novel about anarchists, ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]'' ({{lang-ru|Бесы}}, ''Bésy''), one popular English-language translation of which is titled ''The Possessed''.&lt;ref name="paul_brians2"/&gt; Much of the philosophical underpinnings and ecological concepts came from [[Murray Bookchin]]'s ''[[Post-Scarcity Anarchism]]'' (1971), according to a letter Le Guin sent to Bookchin.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Biehl, Bookchin biographer; letter in UKL archive&lt;/ref&gt; Anarres citizens are ''dispossessed'' not just by political choice, but by the very lack of actual resources to possess. Here, again, Le Guin draws a contrast with the natural wealth of Urras, and the competitive behaviors this fosters.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed time ==
In the last chapter of ''The Dispossessed'', we learn that the Hainish people arrived at Tau Ceti 60 years previously, which is more than 150 years after the secession of the Odonians from Urras and their exodus to Anarres. [[Terra (Hainish cycle)|Terrans]] are also there, and the novel occurs some time in the future, according to an elaborate chronology worked out by science fiction author [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] in 1975: "the baseline date of AD 2300 for The Dispossessed is taken from the description of Earth in that book (§11) as having passed through an ecological and social collapse with a population peak of 9 billion to a low-population but highly centralized recovery economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Ian |last= Watson | title= Le Guin's ''Lathe of Heaven'' and the Role of Dick: The False Reality as Mediator| publisher= Science Fiction Studies # 5 = Volume 2, Part 1 | date=March 1975 | accessdate=2017-02-26 |url= http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/5/watson5art.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, Watson assigns a date of  AD 4870 to [[The Left Hand of Darkness]]; both dates are problematic — as Watson says himself, they are contradicted by "Genly Ai's statement that Terrans 'were ignorant until about three thousand years ago of the uses of zero' ".

==Reception==
The novel received generally positive reviews. [[Baird Searles]] characterized the novel as an "extraordinary work", saying Le Guin had "created a working society in exquisite detail" and "a fully realized hypothetical culture [as well as] living breathing characters who are inevitable products of that culture".&lt;ref&gt;"The Dispossessed: Visit from A Small Planet", ''[[Village Voice]]'', November 21, 1974, pp.56, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Jonas, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that "Le Guin's book, written in her solid, no-nonsense prose, is so persuasive that it ought to put a stop to the writing of prescriptive Utopias for at least 10 years".&lt;ref&gt;"Of Things to Come", ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', October 26, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Sturgeon]] praised ''The Dispossessed'' as "a beautifully written, beautifully composed book", saying "it performs one of [science fiction's] prime functions, which is to create another kind of social system to see how it would work. Or if it would work."&lt;ref&gt;

"Galaxy Bookshelf", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', June 1974, pp.97-98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lester del Rey]], however, gave the novel a mixed review, citing the quality of Le Guin's writing but claiming that the ending "slips badly", a ''[[deus ex machina]]'' that "destroy[s] much of the strength of the novel".&lt;ref&gt;"Reading Room", [[If (magazine)|''If'']], August 1974, pp.144-45&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29714">This is a timeline of the [[feminist art movement]] in [[New Zealand]] (or Aotearoa/New Zealand as it is often known in inclusive circles). It lists important figures, collectives, publications, exhibitions and moments that have contributed to discussion and development of the movement. For the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]] population, the emergence of the [[feminist art movement]] broadly coincided with the emergence of [[Māori Renaissance]].

==1970s==

'''1972'''

The feminist publication [[Broadsheet (magazine)|''Broadsheet'']] is co-founded by Anne Else and [[Sandra Coney]] in [[Auckland]]. It is New Zealand's first feminist magazine, and provides regular arts coverage. It ceases publication in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Else|first1=Anne|title=Gender inequalities - Areas of discrimination|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/28622/broadsheet|website=Te Ara - The Online Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1974'''

Feminist poet [[Heather McPherson]] starts The Women Artists Group in Christchurch and begins working towards establishing the women's art journal ''Spiral,'' and the Spiral Collective.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/spiral-collectives/in-the-beginning-there-was-heather-d2ebbf4dd63c|title=In the beginning there was Heather.|last=Evans|first=Marian|date=31 May 2016|website=Spiral Collective|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1975'''

The [[Robert McDougall Art Gallery]] in Christchurch (now the [[Christchurch Art Gallery]]) organises ''Women's Art: An Exhibition of Six Women Artists'' to mark International Women's Year. The exhibition is curated by artist [[Allie Eagle]], then Exhibitions Officer at the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Art: An Exhibition of Six Women Artists|date=1975|publisher=Robert McDougall Art Gallery|location=Christchurch|url=http://christchurchartgallery.org.nz/media/uploads/2010_08/WomansArt1975.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works from photographer [[Fiona Clark (photographer)|Fiona Clark]]'s series 'Dance Party', taken at a gay lib dance party at Auckland University in 1974, are withdrawn from the touring photography exhibition ''[[The Active Eye]]'' after accusations of indecency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Peter|title=Incandescent Moment: Fiona Clark's Go Girl|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 2003|issue=106|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issue106/Clark.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national art magazine ''Art New Zealand'' dedicates its Autumn issue to female artists and the women's art movement. Art historian [[Cheryll Sotheran]] writes an overview of the current state and reception of women's art in New Zealand, noting  that 'most critics in New Zealand avoid or condemn exhibitions of women's art which use gender difference as a political weapon. The women whose art receives favourable reviews (or in many cases any reviews at all) are those whose work fits the modernist mould, are not feminists, are asexual and apolitical.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sotheran|first1=Cheryll|title=Replacing Women in Art History|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues21to30/replacing.htm|website=Art New Zealand|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=Autumn 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uppsala Conflict Data Program Office at Uppsala University, Sweden..JPG|thumb|The UCDP is located at [[Uppsala University|Uppsala University's]] Department of Peace and Conflict Research (at left) in Gamla Torget.]]
The '''Uppsala Conflict Data Program''' ('''UCDP''') is a data collection project on organized [[violence]] housed at [[Uppsala University]] in [[Sweden]] that has been collecting information on [[armed conflict]] since 1946&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt; and making it publicly available through its annual report, ''States in Armed Conflict.'' Beginning in Since 2004, the constantly-updated UCDP is also publicly available.&lt;ref name="pcr" /&gt; The UCDP collects both [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative data]] on organized violence (e.g., fatality statistics, [[Georeferencing|georeferenced]] event data, and armed actor and conflict descriptions) that is used by [[social science]] researchers, [[journalist]]s, and [[Politician|policymakers]].

==Background==
The UCDP began recording information on ongoing violent conflicts in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="pcr"&gt;{{cite web |author=Erik Melander |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/program_overview/ |title=UCDP Program Overview |accessdate=January 22, 2017 |publisher=[[Department of Peace and Conflict Research]], [[University of Upsala]] |date=nd |location=[[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206111450/http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/program_overview/ |archive-date=February 6, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became clear that more systematic and global data on armed conflicts was necessary for conducting research in the expanding academic discipline of [[peace and conflict studies]].

Initially, the program collected data only on so-called "armed conflicts", defined as fighting exceeding 25 battle-related deaths between two actors of which at least one was a [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/definition_of_armed_conflict/#i |title=UCDP definition of armed conflict |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162625/http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/definition_of_armed_conflict#i |archive-date=2013-07-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, the data gathering grew, and the program also began collecting data on "non-state conflicts" (where neither party was a state) and "one-sided violence" (where an organized group attacked unarmed [[civilian]]s).

The UCDP's data is published annually in such publications as the ''[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|SIPRI Yearbook]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2012 |title=and the |publisher=Sipri.org |date=2012-06-04 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]''. The UCDP also makes its data publicly available through its website and previously in its publication, ''States in Armed Conflict''.

==Organization==
The UCDP is located at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research of Uppsala University in Sweden. The program is led by Associate Professor Kristine Eck, and employs approximately 10-15 research assistants and researchers. A number of scholars and Ph.D. candidates are also attached to the program and tasked with carrying out research for the collection of conflict data. In addition to collecting data, the program disseminates knowledge on trends and dynamics of armed conflict to the public via lectures at academic and government forums.

===Cooperation===
The UCDP works closely with both the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] (PRIO) and the [[Human Security Report Project]], based within the School for International Studies at [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The UCDP collaborates with PRIO to create its datasets and provides the Human Security Research Project with data for its annual publication, the ''[[Human Security Report 2005|Human Security Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/2012/overview.aspx |title=Overview - Human Security Report 2012 |publisher=Hsrgroup.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCDP's data is published annually in collaboration with the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) and appears in the ''SIPRI Yearbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2012 |title=SIPRI Yearbook 2012 — www.sipri.org |publisher=Sipri.org |date=2012-06-04 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Hundreds of scholars have used the UCDP's data for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/publications/Publications_using_UCDP_data/ |title=Publications using UCDP data - Uppsala universitet |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617161647/http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/publications/Publications_using_UCDP_data |archive-date=2013-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCDP couples data collection with research on conflict resolution and the dynamics of conflicts.&lt;ref name="pcr" /&gt; Much of the research done by UCDP staff is published in the UCDP's ''States in Armed Conflict'' annual report, the annual ''SIPRI Yearbook'', and the ''Journal of Peace Research''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/publications/ |title=Publications - Uppsala universitet |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Database==

The Armed Conflict Dataset is a joint project between the UCDP and PRIO that records armed conflicts from 1946–2016 that result in a minimum of 25 battle-related deaths and in which at least one actor is the government of a state. Data is collected by keying specific search words in the [[Factiva|Factiva Database]], an online resource containing over 10,000 different newspapers, newswires, and other sources, as well as published books, case studies, and journals (''[[Africa Research Bulletin]]'', ''[[Africa Confidential]]'', [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] publications). The dataset is updated annually, with Version 17.1-2017 being the most recent.

Every armed conflict is classified as a dyad in the dataset and assigned an ID number. A dyad consists of two conflicting primary parties. Dyads can last multiple years and are coded for intensity level ("minor" for those with less than 1,000 deaths; "major" for those with more than 1,000 deaths), region ([[Americas]], [[Asia]], [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]]), incompatibility (government, territory, government and territory), and type (extrasystemic, interstate, internal, internationalized internal). The start date, end date, year, and location of conflict are also provided as well as the precision of the start and end date.

===Publications===
UCDP data has been published in the ''SIPRI Yearbook'' since 1988. Since 1993, a list of all armed conflicts also appears in the ''Journal of Peace Research''. Data on non-state conflicts appears in the ''Human Security Report'' from 2004. The UCDP has also releases (annually) its own report, ''States in Armed Conflict''. UCDP data is also frequently used by journalists, government agencies, and other organizations to produce overviews of peace and conflict in the world. One prominent index that uses UCDP data is the [[Global Peace Index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofhumanity.org/gpi/home.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704165325/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/gpi/home.php |date=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset==
A battle-related death is one that is caused by combat between conflicting parties over a contested incompatibility. These deaths can be caused by traditional battlefield fighting, [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla activities]], [[urban warfare]], and any kind of [[bombardment]] of military units, cities, and villages. Guerrilla activities include [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run attacks]] and [[ambush]]es, and examples of urban warfare include [[bomb]]s, [[explosion]]s, and [[assassination]]s. Targets of attacks are generally military, state institutions, and state representatives. However, civilians are [[collateral damage]], and both military and [[Civilian casualties|civilian deaths]] are accounted for in the dataset.

UCDP has three ways of estimating battle-related deaths: best estimate, low estimate, and high estimate. The best estimate is the aggregate of the most reliable numbers for all battle-related incidents during a year. The low estimate is the aggregate of low estimates for all battle-related incidents during a year, and the high estimate is the aggregate of high estimates for all battle-related incidents during a year. These estimates are found in both conflict-year based datasets and dyad-year based datasets. The averages of deaths in the most recent of each kind of dataset are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Conflict-year dataset || bdBest || bdLow || bdHigh
|-
| Average || 918 || 868 || 1,287
|-
| Dyad-year dataset || bdBest || bdLow || bdHigh
|-
| Average || 705 || 666 || 979
|}

UCDP gathers and updates data on a yearly basis. They have datasets available from 1989 to 2016. Every event lists the date of the event, reporting source, primary source, actors involved, place of event, what happened, and the estimates of fatalities. The staff reads all the reports, and the information is entered manually. Furthermore, the aggregate results are compared to figures in official documents, special reports, and news media.

UCDP uses both printed and electronic public sources for gathering information. The main source is the Factiva Database that is composed of over 10,000 newspapers, newswires, and other sources from around the globe. UCDP uses at least one major newswire ([[Reuters]], [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]], [[EFE]]) and [[BBC Monitoring]]. Additional sources include news agencies, newly published books, case studies, journals like ''Africa Research Bulletin'', research reports, documents of international and multinational organizations, publications by NGOs such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], and documents of fighting parties. Sources are judged according to the context in which they are published, and reports are traced back to the primary source to establish reliability.

==UCDP's definitions of organized violence==
The program divides armed conflict into three categories: "state-based conflict", "non-state conflict", and "one-sided violence".

'''State-based conflict''' refers to what most people intuitively perceive as "war"; fighting either between two states, or between a state and a rebel group that challenges it. The UCDP defines an armed state-based conflict as: "An armed conflict is a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#i |title=UCDP definition of armed conflict |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program's definition differs somewhat from other data collection programs, such as the [[Correlates of War]] Project, which only counts conflicts where at least 1,000 deaths have been recorded during one calendar year. In UCDP, data such an armed conflict is labelled as having the intensity level of "war", whilst armed conflicts that reap between 25 and 999 battle-related deaths are seen as having the intensity of a "minor" armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#i |title=Definition of intensity levels |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-state conflicts''' are those conflicts in which none of the warring parties is a state. Examples of non-state conflicts include the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict (2006–07)|Fatah–Hamas conflict of 2006 and 2007]], [[Ethnic conflict|inter-ethnic group conflicts]] such as the [[Lou Nuer]]–[[Murle people|Murle]] conflict of 2009–2012, and inter-[[Drug cartel|cartel]] violence in the [[Mexican Drug War]].

'''One-sided violence''' is defined as: "The use of armed force by the government of a state or by a formally organized group against civilians which results in at least 25 deaths in a year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#o |title=UCDP definition of one-sided violence |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include actions by the governments of [[Sudan]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Syria]] against civilians, as well as actions of non-state organizations such as [[Los Zetas]], Al-Qaeda, and the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] against civilians.

* Note: Fatality figures may be substantially lower than other stated estimates as UCDP data does not include fatalities from disease and/or war-time epidemics, or combine casualty figures between different types of armed conflicts. Additionally the figures in the tables represent the UCDP's "best estimate" figures and not its "high estimate" figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/search.php#__utma=1.2093341673.1361462813.1361717506.1362395396.7&amp;__utmb=1.4.10.1362395396&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1362395396.7.4.utmcsr=ucdp.uu.se%7cutmccn=(referral)%7cutmcmd=referral%7cutmcct=/gpdatabase/search.php&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=175407906 |title=Database - Uppsala Conflict Data Program |publisher=UCDP |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Edward S. Herman|Edward Herman]], Professor Emeritus of Finance at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], and his colleague David Peterson, who together co-authored ''The Politics of Genocide'', have accused the UCDP of using "politicized [...] methodologies" in an effort to "minimize U.S.- and Western-led warmaking and killing." Exemplifying these assertions, they compare the classification{{by whom|date=July 2013}} of US involvement in [[Guatemala]] and the perception of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward S Herman and David Peterson

'''''What Should Legal Analysis Become?''''' is a book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. First published in 1996, the book germinated from lectures Unger gave at Yale Law School, Columbia Law School, and the London School of Economics. In the book, Unger argues that in order to transform society to be more radically democratic, it is necessary to penetrate the specialized professions so that we can talk about, and imagine, institutions effectively. Unger focuses on the legal profession in this book, setting forth a vision of law as "institutional imagination." He presents a program for changing the nature of the legal profession so that less power is vested in legal professionals and institutions, and legal analysis is reoriented to be more egalitarian and advance more effectively the democratic project.

==Reception==

[[Jeremy Waldron]], reviewing ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?'' in the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, "Dirty Little Secret" (review of ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?''), 98 Columbia Law Review 510 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; praised the book as an "eminently readable" text encompassing many of the same themes that Unger explored in his three-volume ''Politics: A Work in Constructive Social Theory''. Waldron notes that Unger's argument in the book has a negative and a positive side. Waldron finds the negative side of Unger's argument—in which Unger attacks contemporary American legal analysis as "incapable of contributing to serious social reform" (as Waldron summarizes the argument)—"exciting," and states that Unger's negative argument "goes right to the heart of the difficulties about political agency that disfigure modern legal scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 517&lt;/ref&gt; Waldron finds the positive side of Unger's argument "somewhat less convincing." The positive argument, which contains Unger's exploration of the alternative futures of democracy, Waldron dismisses as "broad-brush sketching of some rather familiar social-democratic ideals .... [that] might have been produced by any intelligent person on the left."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 512-513&lt;/ref&gt; Waldron sums up his assessment by stating that "so far as the positive suggestions are concerned, one is left frustrated by this book. The negative account of mainstream legal analysis is provocative, and the critique of its orientation to the courts is important and timely."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 528&lt;/ref&gt;

Robin Bradley Kar contends that Unger's constructive program in ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?'' is inconsistent with his negative criticisms of contemporary American legal interpretation. In his review of the book in the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Legal Analysis and the Perversions of Theory (review of ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?''), 106 Yale Law Journal 2685 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Kar argued that Unger's criticism of contemporary legal analysis rests on the idea that we should not rest our interpretations of law upon general "policies of collective welfare and principles of moral and political right,"&lt;ref&gt;Kar 2686&lt;/ref&gt; because such reliance works to suppress important parts of the democratic compromises that help advance radical democratic aims. But, Kar points out, Unger's constructive, positive program rests on "similarly general conceptions of democracy and human nature."&lt;ref&gt;Kar 2690&lt;/ref&gt; Kar concludes that "Unger's entire work thus provides us with a useful moral about the dangers inherent in interpreting the law through the lens of theory."&lt;ref&gt;Kar 2686&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorne Sossin, reviewing the book in the ''University of Toronto Law Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;"The Politics of Imagination" (review of ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?'') 47 University of Toronto Law Journal 523 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; praised ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?'' as a "provocative and enlightening" account of "the myths and contradictions upon which our political and legal institutions rest," one that may "facilitate transforming those institutions into more emancipatory forms."&lt;ref&gt;Sossin 523-524&lt;/ref&gt; Sossin notes that Unger would add "prophecy" and "vision" to the pursuits of critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Sossin 524&lt;/ref&gt; Sossin concludes that "''What Should Legal Analysis Become?'' is in many ways an illustration of Unger practicing what he preaches—reinventing and recombining ideas and elements of his previous thought into a reinvigorated critique. His analysis never fails to engage, though ... it does leave important questions unanswered."&lt;ref&gt;Sossin 534&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14436">The '''worm-like chain''' ('''WLC''') model in [[polymer physics]] is used to describe the behavior of [[polymers]] that are semi-flexible: fairly stiff with successive segments pointing in roughly the same direction, and with [[persistence length]] within a few orders of magnitude of the polymer length. The WLC model is the continuous version of the [[Otto Kratky|Kratky]]-[[Günther Porod|Porod]] model.

== Model elements ==
[[File:Worm-like Chain.png|thumb|An illustration of the WLC model, with position and unit tangent vectors as shown.|250x250px]] The WLC model envisions a continuously flexible [[isotropic]] rod.&lt;ref name=Doi&gt;{{cite book | author=Doi and Edwards | title=The Theory of Polymer Dynamics | year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubinstein&gt;{{cite book | author=Rubinstein and Colby | title=Polymer Physics | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;{{cite book | author=Kirby, B.J. | title=Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics: Transport in Microfluidic Devices | url=http://www.kirbyresearch.com/textbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the [[Ideal chain|freely-jointed chain]] model, which is only flexible between discrete freely hinged segments. The model is particularly suited for describing stiffer polymers, with successive segments displaying a sort of cooperativity: nearby segments are roughly aligned. At room temperature, the polymer adopts a smoothly curved conformation; at &lt;math&gt;T = 0&lt;/math&gt; K, the polymer adopts a rigid rod conformation.&lt;ref name=Doi/&gt;

For a polymer of maximum length &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;, parametrize the path of the polymer as &lt;math&gt;s \in(0,L_0)&lt;/math&gt;. Allow &lt;math&gt;\hat t(s)&lt;/math&gt; to be the unit tangent vector to the chain at point &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\vec r(s)&lt;/math&gt; to be the position vector along the chain, as shown to the right. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat t(s) \equiv \frac {\partial \vec r(s) }{\partial s}&lt;/math&gt; and the end-to-end distance &lt;math&gt;\vec R = \int_{0}^{L_0}\hat t(s) ds&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;ref name=Doi/&gt;

The energy associated with the bending of the polymer can be written as:

&lt;math&gt; E = \frac {1}{2}k_B T \int_{0}^{L_0} P \cdot \left (\frac {\partial^2 \vec r(s) }{\partial s^2}\right )^{2} ds&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the polymer's characteristic [[persistence length]], &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute temperature. At finite temperatures, the end-to end distance of the polymer will be significantly shorter than the maximum length &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is caused by thermal fluctuations, which result in a coiled, random configuration of the undisturbed polymer.

The polymer's orientation [[correlation function]] can then be solved for, and it follows an [[exponential decay]] with decay constant 1/P:&lt;ref name="Doi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\langle\hat t(s) \cdot \hat t(0)\rangle=\langle \cos \; \theta (s)\rangle = e^{-s/P}\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Crossover from flexible to stiff behavior in the worm-like chain polymer model.svg|thumb|300x300px|Mean squared end-to-end distance as a function of persistence length.]]

A useful value is the mean square end-to-end distance of the polymer:&lt;ref name="Doi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\langle R^{2} \rangle  = \langle \vec R \cdot \vec R \rangle
  = \left\langle \int_{0}^{L_0} \hat t(s) ds \cdot \int_{0}^{L_0} \hat t(s') ds' \right\rangle = \int_{0}^{L_0} ds \int_{0}^{L_0} \langle \hat t(s) \cdot \hat t(s') \rangle ds'= \int_{0}^{L_0} ds \int_{0}^{L_0} e^{-\left | s - s' \right | / P} ds' 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\langle R^{2} \rangle  
= 2 PL_0 \left [ 1 - \frac {P}{L_0} \left ( 1 - e^{-L_0/P} \right ) \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the limit of &lt;math&gt;L_0 \gg P&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\langle R^{2} \rangle = 2PL_0&lt;/math&gt;. This can be used to show that a [[Kuhn length|Kuhn segment]] is equal to twice the [[persistence length]] of a worm-like chain. In the limit of &lt;math&gt;L_0 \ll P&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\langle R^{2} \rangle = L_0^2&lt;/math&gt;, and the polymer displays rigid rod behavior.&lt;ref name="Rubinstein" /&gt; The figure to the right shows the crossover from flexible to stiff behavior as the [[persistence length]] increases.

== Stretching worm-like chain polymers ==
Upon stretching, the accessible spectrum of thermal fluctuations reduces, which causes an entropic force acting against the external elongation.
This entropic force can be estimated from considering the total energy of the polymer:

&lt;math&gt; H = H_{\rm elastic} + H_{\rm external}= \frac {1}{2}k_B T \int_{0}^{L_0} P \cdot \left (\frac {\partial^2 \vec r(s) }{\partial s^2}\right )^{2} ds - xF&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, the [[contour length]] is represented by &lt;math&gt;L_0&lt;/math&gt;, the [[persistence length]] by &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, the extension is represented by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and external force is represented by &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.  
    	 
Laboratory tools such as [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) and [[optical tweezers]] have been used to characterize the force-dependent stretching behavior of biological polymers. An interpolation formula that approximates the force-extension behavior with about 15% relative error is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marko|first1=J.F.|last2=Siggia|first2=E.D.|title=Statistical mechanics of supercoiled DNA|journal=Phys. Rev. E|date=1995|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.52.2912|bibcode=1995PhRvE..52.2912M}}&lt;/ref&gt;	 
	 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \frac {1}{4} \left ( 1 - \frac {x} {L_0} \right )^{-2} - \frac {1}{4} + \frac {x}{L_0}&lt;/math&gt;
 	

A more accurate approximation for the force-extension behavior with about 1% relative error is:&lt;ref name=Petrosyan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrosyan|first=R.|title=Improved approximations for some polymer extension models|journal=Rehol Acta|year=2016|doi = 10.1007/s00397-016-0977-9|arxiv=1606.02519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \frac {1}{4} \left ( 1 - \frac {x} {L_0} \right )^{-2} - \frac {1}{4} + \frac {x}{L_0}-0.8 \left (\frac {x} {L_0} \right )^{2.15}&lt;/math&gt;
:

A corresponding approximation for the extension-force behavior, also with about 1% relative error, was reported:&lt;ref name=Petrosyan/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {x} {L_0} = \frac {4}{3} -  \frac {4} {3\sqrt{\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} + 1}} -\frac {10e^{\sqrt[4]{900\frac {k_{B}T} {FP}}}} {\sqrt{\frac {FP} {k_{B}T}} \left(e^{\sqrt[4]{900\frac {k_{B}T} {FP}}}-1 \right)^{2} } + \frac {\left (\frac {FP} {k_{B}T}\right)^{1.62}} {3.55+3.8\left ( \frac {FP} {k_{B}T}\right)^{2.2}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Extensible worm-like chain model ==

The elastic response from extension cannot be neglected: polymers elongate due to external forces. This enthalpic compliance is accounted for the material parameter &lt;math&gt;K_0&lt;/math&gt;, and the system yields the following Hamiltonian for significantly extended polymers:

&lt;math&gt; H = H_{\rm elastic}+H_{\rm enthalpic}+H_{\rm external} = \frac {1}{2}k_B T \int_{0}^{L_0} P \cdot \left (\frac {\partial \vec r(s) }{\partial s}\right )^{2} ds  +  \frac {1}{2}\frac {K_0}{L_0} x^{2}  -  xF &lt;/math&gt;,

This expression contains both the entropic term, which describes changes in the polymer conformation, and the enthalpic term, which describes the stretching of the polymer due to the external force. 
Several approximations for the force-extension behavior have been put forward, depending on the applied external force. These approximations are made for stretching DNA in physiological conditions (near neutral pH, ionic strength approximately 100 mM, room temperature), with stretch modulus around 1000&amp;nbsp;pN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Michelle D.|author2=Hong Yin|author3=Robert Landick|author4=Jeff Gelles|author5=Steven M.

For the low-force regime (F &lt; about 10&amp;nbsp;pN), the following interpolation formula was derived:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marko|first=J.F.|author2=Eric D. Siggia |title=Stretching DNA|journal=Macromolecules|year=1995|volume=28|pages=8759–8770|bibcode = 1995MaMol..28.8759M |doi = 10.1021/ma00130a008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \frac {1}{4} \left ( 1 - \frac {x} {L_0} + \frac {F}{K_0} \right )^{-2} - \frac {1}{4} + \frac {x}{L_0} - \frac {F}{K_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

For the higher-force regime, where the polymer is significantly extended, the following approximation is valid:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odijk|first=Theo|title=Stiff Chains and Filaments under Tension|journal=Macromolecules|year=1995|volume=28|pages=7016–7018|bibcode = 1995MaMol..28.7016O |doi = 10.1021/ma00124a044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = L_0 \left ( 1 - \frac {1} {2} \left ( \frac {k_{B}T}{FP} \right )^{1/2} + \frac {F}{K_0}\right ) &lt;/math&gt;.

More accurate interpolation formulas for the force-extension and extension-force behaviors are:&lt;ref name=Petrosyan/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} = \frac {1}{4} \left ( 1 - \frac {x} {L_0}+ \frac {F}{K_0} \right )^{-2} - \frac {1}{4} + \frac {x}{L_0} - \frac {F}{K_0}-0.8 \left (\frac {x} {L_0}- \frac {F}{K_0} \right )^{2.15}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {x} {L_0} = \frac {4}{3} -  \frac {4} {3\sqrt{\frac {FP} {k_{B}T} + 1}} -\frac {10e^{\sqrt[4]{900\frac {k_{B}T} {FP}}}} {\sqrt{\frac {FP} {k_{B}T}} \left(e^{\sqrt[4]{900\frac {k_{B}T} {FP}}}-1 \right)^{2} } + \frac {\left (\frac {FP} {k_{B}T}\right)^{1.62}} {3.55+3.8\left ( \frac {FP} {k_{B}T}\right)^{2.2}} + \frac {F}{K_0}&lt;/math&gt;
