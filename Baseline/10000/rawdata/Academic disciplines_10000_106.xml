[[Image:Wiki-sixtynine.png|thumb|A man and a woman performing mutual [[oral sex]] in the 69 position.]]
'''Sixty-nine''' or '''69''', also known by its [[French language|French]] name '''soixante-neuf''' (69),&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite web |title=Soixante-neuf definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/soixante-neuf |website=www.collinsdictionary.com |publisher=[[Collins English Dictionary]] |accessdate=8 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of [[sex position]]s in which two people align themselves so that each person's mouth is near the other's genitals, each simultaneously performing [[oral sex]] on the other.&lt;ref name="little"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rojiere|first=Jean|title=The Little Book of Sex|publisher=Ulysses Press|year=2001|isbn=1-56975-305-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julie Coleman, "Love, sex, and marriage: a historical thesaurus", Rodopi, 1999, {{ISBN|90-420-0433-9}}, p.214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aggrawal&gt;{{cite book |last=Aggrawal |first=Anil|authorlink=Anil Aggrawal|title=[[Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices]] |year=2009 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |isbn=1-4200-4308-0|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants are thus mutually inverted like the numerals 6 and 9 in the [[69 (number)|number 69]], hence the name.&lt;ref name=aggrawal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;René James Hérail, Edwin A.

==Method==
Variations of the 69 positions include mutual [[Anal–oral sex|anilingus]] or "double rimming", and [[fingering (sexual act)|digital penetration]] of either partner's [[anus]] or [[vagina]].

In these positions, the partners are said to experience [[sexual stimulation]] simultaneously, but this can also distract those who try to focus solely on pleasuring themselves. The position can also be awkward for partners who are not similar in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
Mutual simultaneous oragenitalism is usually referred to in English under the euphemistic French numerical form, “''soixante-neuf''{{r|collins}}.” The ancient Chinese [[Yin and Yang]] (female &amp; male) symbol is identical. ... The term “''soixante-neuf''” has not been traced any earlier than the ''Whore’s Catechism''s published in the 1790s in France, usually attributed to the early leader of the French Revolution, Mlle. [[Théroigne de Méricourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

"The earliest unequivocal representation of the sixty-nine appears to be that on an oil-lamp preserved in the [[Munich]] Museum ([[Deutsches Museum]]), and first reproduced in Dr. Gaston Vorberg’s … portfolio, ''Die Erotik der Antiken in Kleinkunst und Keramik'' (Munich, 1921) plate 58, showing the woman lying on top of the man. Dr. Vorberg gives this … to be of the period of the Roman Caesars … . However, another oil-lamp of the same kind, showing the sixty-nine almost identically … is more recently reproduced as a full-color plate, in Prof. [[Jean Marcadé]]’s ''Eros Kalos'' (English-language edition, [[Geneva]] : Nagel, 1965), facing page 58, in … lamps preserved in the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum|Heracleion Museum]] in [[Greece]]."&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

"A [[Hindu]] temple-sculpture from the sacred caverns of the island of [[Elephanta Island|Elephanta]], near [[Mumbai]] in [[India]], showing this position with the man actually standing, and holding the woman hanging down in this from his shoulders, was … brought to England in the late eighteenth century … . … this sculptured fragment … is both discussed and illustrated in [[Richard Payne Knight]]’s ''A Discourse on the Worship of [[Priapus]]'', privately issued for the [[Dilettanti Society]] of London in 1786 … . The illustration in question is a detail engraving given in Payne Knight’s plate XI; and the full form of this sculptured group is … given as plate XXIV."&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' mentions this sex position, albeit by a different name: "When a man and woman lie down in an inverted order, i.e. with the head of the one towards the feet of the other and carry on [mouth] congress, it is called the 'congress of a crow'."&lt;ref&gt;

'''Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research''' (AMD), with headquarters at [[Hyderabad, Telangana|Hyderabad]] and seven regional centrers, is the oldest unit of the [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)]] (DAE), [[Government of India]]. The principal mandate of the organisation is to carry out geological exploration and discover mineral deposits required for [[nuclear power]] programme of [[India]].

==History==

AMD started functioning from [[New Delhi]] on 10 August 1948 as ‘Rare Minerals Survey Unit'. Renamed first as ‘Raw Materials Division’ and then as ‘Atomic Minerals Division’ in 1958, it was shifted to Hyderabad in 1974. On 29 July 1998 it underwent the latest name change as 'Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research' to assert its status as a premier geological exploration and research organisation. Professor [[Darashaw Nosherwan Wadia|D.N. Wadia]], FRS, a doyen among Indian geologists guided the organisation from its inception to 1970 as Geological Adviser to [[Government of India]].

==Work spectrum==
 The prime mandate of Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research is to identify and evaluate uranium resources required for the successful implementation of Atomic Energy programme of the country.
AMD over the past five decades has been instrumental in locating [[Uranium]] resources in Singhbhum Shear Zone, Jharkhand; KPM (Domiasiat), Wahkut, Wahkyn, [[Meghalaya]]; Lambapur - Chitrial, Peddagattu, [[Telangana]]; Tummalapalle, [[Andhra Pradesh]]; Gogi, [[Karnataka]] and Rohil, [[Rajasthan]]. AMD also has established vast resources of thorium in the coastal tracts of [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Orissa, India|Odisha]]. AMD has also extented its contribution towards recovery of Rare Metals and Rare Earths elements.

==Organisation==

Apart from the headquarters, centralised laboratories and specialised groups at Hyderabad,  AMD has seven regional centres at [[New Delhi]], [[Jaipur]], [[Shillong]], [[Jamshedpur]], [[Nagpur]], [[Bangalore]] and Hyderabad. Two sectional offices are located at [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and [[Vishakhapatnam]] for beach sand and offshore investigations. AMD commenced its operations with a nucleus of 17 geoscientists which has grown to 2777 personnel today.

The '''Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri''' or simply the '''Chester Beatty Papyri''' are a group of early [[papyrus]] [[Biblical manuscript|manuscripts of biblical texts]]. The manuscripts are in Greek and are of Christian origin. There are eleven manuscripts in the group, seven consisting of portions of Old Testament books, three consisting of portions of the New Testament (Gregory-Aland no. [[Papyrus 45|P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Papyrus 46|P&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;]], and [[Papyrus 47|P&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;]]), and one consisting of portions of the [[Book of Enoch]] and an unidentified Christian homily. Most are dated to the 3rd century. They are housed in part at the [[Chester Beatty Library]] in Dublin, Ireland, and in part at the [[University of Michigan]], among a few other locations.

The papyri were most likely first obtained by dealers in [[illegal antiquities]]. Because of this, the exact circumstances of the find are not clear. One account is that the manuscripts were in jars in a Coptic graveyard near the ruins of the ancient city of [[Atfih|Aphroditopolis]]. Other theories have proposed that the collection was found near [[Al Fayyum|the Fayum]] instead of Aphroditopolis, or that the location was a Christian church or monastery instead of a graveyard. Most of the papyri were bought from a dealer by [[Alfred Chester Beatty]], after whom the manuscripts are named, although some leaves and fragments were acquired by the [[University of Michigan]] and a few other collectors and institutions.

The papyri were first announced on November 19, 1931, although more leaves were acquired over the next decade. [[Frederic G. Kenyon]] published the manuscripts in ''The Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri: Descriptions and Texts of Twelve Manuscripts on Papyrus of the Greek Bible'', in an 8-volume work that spanned 1933-58. The papyri are usually cataloged as ''P. Chester Beatty'' followed by a corresponding Roman numeral between I-XII, one for each manuscript.

The term '''"Chester Beatty Papyri"''' can also generally refer to the collection of manuscripts that Alfred Chester Beatty acquired over his lifetime, which include non-Biblical papyri such as the [[Chester Beatty Medical Papyrus]].

== Character of the collection ==

All of the manuscripts are [[codex|codices]], which was surprising to the first scholars who examined the texts because it was believed that the papyrus codex was not extensively used by Christians until the 4th century. Most of the manuscripts dated to the 3rd century, with some as early as the 2nd. The manuscripts also helped scholars understand the construction of papyrus codices. There is significant variation between the construction of each manuscript. Page size ranges from about 14 by 24.2&amp;nbsp;cm (P. III) to 18 by 33&amp;nbsp;cm (P. VI). Some of the manuscripts were constructed of a single gathering (quire) of papyrus sheets (Pap. II, VII, IX + X), while in others the gathering varies from a single sheet (I) to five (V) or seven (VII). The largest codex (P. IX/X) is believed to have contained roughly 236 pages.

The manuscripts employ ''[[nomina sacra]]''. One notable example is in P. VI which contains portions of the Old Testament. The name Joshua which relates linguistically to Jesus was considered a sacred name and abbreviated as such.

Since all but two (P. XI, XII) of the eleven manuscripts are dated before the 4th century, they present significant [[textual criticism|textual]] evidence for the Greek Bible as it existed in Egypt prior to the Diocletianic persecutions where Christian books are said to have been destroyed and a century or more earlier than the [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Although some of the scholars who first studied the collection considered some of the New Testament manuscripts, especially ''P. Chester Beatty'' I (P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;) to be of the [[Caesarean text-type]], this has little support today. The textual character is generally described as being eclectic, mixed, or unaligned. The manuscripts provided many new textual variations, especially because the Old Testament manuscripts predated the revision activity of [[Lucian]] and [[Origen]] and others, and the New Testament manuscripts are some of the earliest yet quite extensive examples of the corresponding books.

== Old Testament manuscripts ==

Originally, there were believed to be eight manuscripts in the Chester Beatty collection that contained portions of the Old Testament. However, what was believed to be two different manuscripts actually belonged to the same codex, resulting in a total of seven Old Testament manuscripts in the collection, all following the text of the [[Septuagint]].

* P. IV and V – Two manuscripts that contain portions of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], one dated to the late 3rd century, and one the early 4th century. These manuscripts are significant because the next oldest Greek Old Testament texts of Vaticanus and Sinaiticus have extensive [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in Genesis.
* P. VI – A manuscript of the [[Book of Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]], consisting of around 50 partial leaves out of 108 and many very small fragments, dated to the first half of the 2nd century. It is the earliest manuscript in the collection, but is predated by two other less extensive Greek papyri manuscripts of these books, [[Papyrus Fouad 266|''P. Fouad'' 266]] and ''[[Papyrus Rylands 458|P. Rylands 458]]''.
* P. VII – A manuscript of the [[Book of Isaiah]], heavily deteriorated, with Coptic (Old Fayumic) marginal notes, dated to the 3rd century. 
* P. VIII – Two fragmentary leaves from the [[Book of Jeremiah]], ''c.'' 200
* P. IX/X – A manuscript of the Books of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], and [[Book of Esther|Esther]], dated to the 3rd century. What remains is 50 out of an original 118 leaves, 29 of which are in the Chester Beatty Library (8 of Ezekiel, 8 of Esther, and 13 of Daniel), and another 21 (of Ezekiel) are in the [[Harvey S. Firestone Memorial Library|Princeton University Library]]. The bottom portions of the leaves are missing. Nonetheless, all parts of the manuscript are the most substantial, early examples of the corresponding books of the Bible. Ezekiel is written in a different handwriting than the other two books. Daniel was originally counted as P. X, because it was mistakenly thought to be a separate manuscript. It was later decided that all three books belong to a single codex. Daniel contains some significant variations regarding the order and omission of certain parts of the text (chapters 7-8 come before 5-6, and parts of chapters 4 and 5 are missing). 
* P. XI – Two fragmentary leaves from [[Ecclesiastes]], dated to the 4th century.

== New Testament manuscripts ==
{{main|Papyrus 45|Papyrus 46}}
[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|A folio from P46 containing 2 Corinthians 11:33-12:9]]

There are three New Testament manuscripts that are part of the Chester Beatty Papyri. The first, P. I, is labeled under the Gregory-Aland numbering system as [[Papyrus 45|P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;]] and was originally a codex of 110 leaves that contained the four canonical gospels and Acts. 30 fragmentary leaves remain, consisting of two small leaves of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] chapters 20/21 and 25/26, portions of the [[Gospel of Mark]] chapters 4-9, 11-12, portions of the [[Gospel of Luke]] 6-7, 9-14, portions of the [[Gospel of John]] 4-5, 10-11, and portion of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 4-17. The ordering of the gospels follows the Western tradition, Matthew, John, Luke, Mark, Acts. These fragments are [[Palaeography|palaeographically]] dated to the first half of the 3rd century.

[[Papyrus 46|P&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;]] is the second New Testament manuscript in the Chester Beatty collection (P. II), and was a codex that contained the [[Pauline Epistles]] dating ''c.'' 200.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} What remains today of the manuscript is roughly 85 out of 104 leaves consisting of Romans chapters 5-6, 8-15, all of Hebrews, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, virtually all of 1–2 Corinthians and 1 Thessalonians 1-2, 5. The leaves have partially deteriorated, resulting in the loss of some lines at the bottom of each folio. The manuscript split up between the [[Chester Beatty Library]] and the [[University of Michigan]]. Scholars do not believe the [[Pastoral epistles]] were included originally in the codex, based on the amount of space required in the missing leaves; they conclude 2 Thessalonians would have occupied the final portion of the codex. The inclusion of Hebrews, a book that was questioned canonically and not considered [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|authored by Paul]], is notable. The placement of it following Romans is unique against most other witnesses, as is the ordering of Galatians following Ephesians.

P. III is the last New Testament manuscript, P&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;, and contains 10 leaves from the [[Book of Revelation]], chapters 9-17. This manuscript also dates to the 3rd century, and Kenyon describes the handwriting as being rough.

== Apocrypha manuscript ==

The last manuscript in the Chester Beatty Papyri, XII, contains chapters 97-107 of the [[Book of Enoch]] and portions of an unknown Christian homily attributed to [[Melito of Sardis]]. The manuscript is placed in the 4th century. The Book of Enoch is listed as "The Epistle of Enoch" in the manuscript. Chapters 105 and 108 are not included, and scholars believe they were later additions. XII is the only Greek witness to certain parts of Enoch. As for the homily, XII was the only known copy of the text at the time of its discovery. Two manuscripts which contain the text, ''[[Bodmer Papyri|P. Bodmer]]'' XIII and ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|P. Oxy.]]'' 1600, have since been found. The manuscript also contains the only manuscript witness to the [[Apocryphon of Ezekiel]], although it is cited by [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Paedagogus'' I. ix. 84.2–4). Overall, the handwriting is rough and most likely from a scribe who did not know Greek well. Campbell Bonner of the University of Michigan published this manuscript in his 1937 ''The Last Chapters of Enoch in Greek'' and 1940 ''The Homily on the Passion by Melito Bishop of Sardis''. {{clear}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1366">The '''Committee on the Public Understanding of Science''' or '''Copus''' was founded in 1985 by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] (BAAS), the [[Royal Institution]] and the [[Royal Society]]. Its aim was to interpret scientific advances and make them more accessible to non-scientists.

It played a part in developing the [[Public awareness of science|public understanding of science]] it establishing standards for communicating science and technology

The Copus Grant Schemes was set up in 1987 and the last round of grants was for 2003/4. The scheme was funded by the [[Office of Science and Technology]] and the [[Royal Society]]. 25 grants worth a total of over £750,000 were awarded in 2003/2004.

In 2000 The new Copus Council was formed to be a more inclusive partnership for science communication in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 following a report commissioned by the [[Office of Science and Technology]] the Copus Council was discontinued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8981">The '''conservation and restoration of outdoor murals''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[mural]]s, and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

== History ==

[[Mural]]s are most commonly defined as wall paintings, works of art integrated into a specific architectural space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''mural'' is derived from the Latin word ''murus'', meaning wall. Walls have long provided a direct support for aesthetic, political, and social ideas expressed with paint. Cave paintings could be considered the earliest murals, followed over time by wall paintings in tombs, temples, churches, civic buildings, and a variety of outdoor spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern murals grow out of this long tradition. From the beginning of the 20th century, murals have had a significant presence in the architecture of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years murals have changed just as everyday life has changed. Murals were painted on church walls and carved into stone or wood on the outside, to educate those who cannot read.  The tradition has carried on to today’s churches. Visual images and language are one of the most powerful forms of communication, both then and more so now.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perspective Realia - History of Murals|url = http://www.art.utah.edu/murals/What_We_Do/History_of_Murals.html|website = www.art.utah.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals today share much of the history from past murals, though today’s murals can depict anything. The major job of murals today is to band communities together. In an age where everything is materialistic, and most of us don’t know our neighbors let alone anyone else in our community, finding a way to bring people together can be difficult. Murals have a very positive effect on communities, bring people together and bring pride to the community, and that pride tends to stay and spread to other parts of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perspective Realia - History of Murals|url = http://www.art.utah.edu/murals/What_We_Do/History_of_Murals.html|website = www.art.utah.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterioration  ==

Outdoor contemporary murals are generally seen as temporary installation, varying from 10 to 20 years due to weathering and vandalism. Outdoor murals are susceptible to, depending on their physical location, extreme weather conditions. A few of the biggest problems facing murals are graffiti, physical destruction, and desaturation as the paint layers weather and are exposed to UV. UV radiation causes cracking, color change and fading. Oxidation chain reactions are the culprit on a chemical level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.conservators-converse.org/2012/05/40th-annual-meeting-architecture-session-may-10-preservation-of-outdoor-public-murals-research-and-public-outreach-by-amanda-norbutus/|title = AIC's Annual Meeting » AIC’s 40th Annual Meeting – Architecture Session, May 10, "Preservation of Outdoor Public Murals: Research and Public Outreach" by Amanda Norbutus|date = May 21, 2012|accessdate = November 25, 2015|website = The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|publisher = |last = Norbutus|first = Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental conditions are a major factor in mural deterioration. Freeze-thaw cycles and capillary rise affect the architectural support of the mural and lead to salt efflorescence, cracking, and lifting of the paint layers if incompatible paints or coatings are used and the mural extends to ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals that face South in direct UV rays are susceptible to fade and also binder deterioration.

== Conservation ==
Murals are traditionally commissioned on private buildings and structures, leaving ownership of the mural in the hands of the owner of the building. Gaining permission to conduct conservation is a key first step in the process. Annual inspections of mural will contribute to it lifetime. Inspections are encouraged to take place during the spring season. This will allow for any damage done during the winter months to not be overseen, and will also allow for conservation to being and take place during the summer.

=== Preventive conservation ===
Preventive conservation can take place before a mural begins. Such as preparing the wall properly and using high-quality, lightfast, and compatible materials—is fundamental. Other preventive actions (e.g., regular maintenance, graffiti removal, and community awareness) can help preserve murals. Much of the damage seen on murals is due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance. Sadly, regular maintenance is not always a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building maintenance is also important to the life of the mural. Communities are aware of well-respected buildings, community engagement is important to continue to spread the word about preserving the sight of the mural. Continue to maintain the grounds that the building reside on. A well maintained building will deter vandalism and also [[litter]]ing around the property. These are all preventive steps that can me undertaken by the community at large, contributing to the murals dialog of bringing a community together.

=== Graffiti ===
[[Graffiti]] plagues the presence of many murals, especially those found within city limits. Graffiti is often seen as a form of territory, and once it premiers on a location it invites others to participate in the act of vandalism. Involving the youth of the community with mural project directly is seen as a way to prevent future graffiti, giving them a profound connection and education with and about the project.

If graffiti is present on a mural, it must be removed in a safe and effective manner that does not directly harm the image beneath it. For this reason, removal should be undertaken by a conservator or an artist/technician familiar with the piece after consultation with or under the supervision of a conservator. Removal without adequate testing, or by an individual without adequate experience or supervision, can irreparably harm the mural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Caring for an Existing Mural|url = https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/art/murals-murales/caring-eng.aspx|website = www.cci-icc.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-12-11|last = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===
As murals deteriorate, owners and agencies have several treatment options. They may ask the artist to repaint or restore the work, or they may call a conservator who could either treat the mural according to strict conservation guidelines or work with the artist to conserve and possibly restore the work. With contemporary murals, there are many instances of restoration or even re-creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this takes place it is advised to look back for an existing plan set out before the mural project began planning the steps of its conservation, if and when needed. This document should articulate who will be the lead of the project; conservator, artist, committee etc. and will also state who will approve the conservation work need to be performed. 

A conservator should ideally perform the analysis of the state of the mural and outline procedures and materials need to be performed. This should all then be taken into consideration with the expectations of the community and also the owner of the mural (owner of the building).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9634">'''Cultural history''' combines the approaches of [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to look at [[popular culture|popular cultural]] traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and [[narrative]] descriptions of past matter, encompassing the continuum of events (occurring in succession and leading from the past to the present and even into the future) pertaining to a [[culture]].

Cultural history records and interprets past events involving human beings through the [[social]], [[cultural]], and [[political]] [[Social environment|milieu]] of or relating to [[the arts]] and manners that a group favors. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) helped found cultural history as a discipline. Cultural history studies and interprets the record of [[human societies]] by denoting the various distinctive ways of living built up by a group of people under consideration. Cultural history involves the aggregate of past cultural activity, such as [[ceremony]], class in practices, and the interaction with locales.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Description==
Cultural history overlaps in its approaches with the French movements of ''[[histoire des mentalités]]'' (Philippe Poirrier, 2004) and the so-called new history, and in the U.S. it is closely associated with the field of [[American studies]]. As originally conceived and practiced by 19th Century Swiss historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] with regard to the [[Italian Renaissance]], cultural history was oriented to the study of a particular historical period in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the economic basis underpinning society, and the social institutions of its daily life as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (6th ed.), p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Echoes of Burkhardt's approach in the 20th century can be seen in [[Johan Huizinga]]'s ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Sean Farrell |last=Moran |title=Johan Huizinga, ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'', and the Writing of History |journal=Michigan Academician |volume=42 |year=2016 |pages=410–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most often the focus is on phenomena shared by non-elite groups in a society, such as: [[carnival]], [[festival]], and public [[ritual]]s; [[performance]] traditions of [[Narrative|tale]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and other verbal forms; cultural evolutions in human relations (ideas, sciences, arts, techniques); and cultural expressions of social movements such as [[nationalism]]. Also examines main historical concepts as [[power (sociology)|power]], [[ideology]], [[Social class|class]], [[culture]], [[cultural identity]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[perception]] and new historical methods as narration of body. Many studies consider adaptations of traditional culture to [[mass media]] (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, etc.), from [[Printing|print]] to [[film]] and, now, to the [[Internet]] (culture of [[capitalism]]). Its modern approaches come from [[art history]], [[Annales School|Annales]], [[Marxist]] school, [[microhistory]] and new cultural history.

Common theoretical [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]]s for recent cultural history have included: [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s formulation of the [[public sphere]] in ''The Structural Transformation of the Bourgeois Public Sphere''; [[Clifford Geertz]]'s notion of '[[thick description]]' (expounded in, for example, ''The Interpretation of Cultures''); and the idea of [[memory]] as a cultural-historical category, as discussed in [[Paul Connerton]]'s ''How Societies Remember''.

===Historiography and the French Revolution===
The area where new-style cultural history is often pointed to as being almost a [[paradigm]] is the '[[Historical revisionism|revisionist]]' history of the [[French Revolution]], dated somewhere since [[François Furet]]'s massively influential 1978 essay ''Interpreting the French Revolution''. The 'revisionist interpretation' is often characterised as replacing the allegedly dominant, allegedly [[Marxist]], 'social interpretation' which locate the causes of the Revolution in class dynamics. The revisionist approach has tended to put more emphasis on '[[political culture]]'. Reading ideas of political culture through Habermas' conception of the public sphere, historians of the Revolution in the past few decades have looked at the role and position of cultural themes such as [[gender]], [[ritual]], and [[ideology]] in the context of pre-revolutionary French political culture.

Historians who might be grouped under this umbrella are [[Roger Chartier]], [[Robert Darnton]], [[Patrice Higonnet]], [[Lynn Hunt]], Keith Baker, Joan Landes, Mona Ozouf and [[Sarah Maza]]. Of course, these scholars all pursue fairly diverse interests, and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the paradigmatic nature of the new history of the French Revolution. Colin Jones, for example, is no stranger to cultural history, [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], or Marxism, and has persistently argued that the Marxist interpretation is not dead, but can be revivified; after all, Habermas' logic was heavily indebted to a Marxist understanding. Meanwhile, Rebecca Spang has also recently argued that for all its emphasis on difference and newness, the 'revisionist' approach retains the idea of the French Revolution as a watershed in the history of (so-called) [[modernity]], and that the problematic notion of 'modernity' has itself attracted scant attention.

==Cultural studies==
''[[Cultural studies]]'' is an academic discipline popular among a diverse group of scholars.  It combines [[political economy]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[art history]]/[[art criticism|criticism]] to study [[culture|cultural]] phenomena in various societies.  Cultural studies researchers often concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].  The term was coined by [[Richard Hoggart]] in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]]. It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who succeeded Hoggart as Director.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7695">'''Cyanide fishing''' is a method of collecting live fish mainly for use in [[aquarium]]s, which involves spraying a [[sodium cyanide]] mixture into the desired fish's habitat in order to stun the fish. The practice hurts not only the target population, but also many other marine organisms, including [[coral]] and [[coral reef]]s.

==History and geography==
Cyanide fishing is practiced mainly in [[seawater|saltwater]] fishing regions of Southeast Asia. Since the practice was never widely publicized or officially approved, its origins are uncertain, but it is believed to have originated in the 1950s in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;Dzombak, David A; Ghosh, Rajat S; Wong-Chong, George M. ''Cyanide in Water and Soil''. [[CRC Press]], 2006, Chapter 11.2: "Use of Cyanide for Capturing Live Reef Fish".&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the twentieth century the practice was adopted by some fishing outfits in Indonesia, Thailand, Maldives, and Taiwan, among others.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; Cyanide fishing was initially developed to stun and capture fish for [[aquarium]]s and collectors, but it was soon used for catching food fish as well. It is [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|illegal]] in many of the countries in which it is practiced, although these laws are often minimally enforced.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; [[Grouper]], [[wrasse]], and [[coral trout]] are among the more popular species of fish captured through cyanide fishing.

The [[World Resources Institute]] determined that approximately 20% of the live fish traded on the Philippine market in 1996 were caught using cyanide; assuming this is reflective of southeast Asian practice as a whole, environmental engineer David Dzombak estimates that 12,000 to 14,000 tons of live food fish are caught each year using this method.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt;

Colourful, particularly eccentric, and therefore rare [[coral fish]] are packed into plastic bags; up to two thirds of these fish die during transport. Estimates suggest 70 to 90% of [[aquarium fish]] exported from the Philippines are caught with cyanide.&lt;ref name="Wabritz"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wabritz, C. |author2=Taylor, M. |author3=Green, E. |author4=Razak, T. | year=2003| title=From Ocean to Aquarium| journal=Unep-Wcmc| pages=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barber, C.V. |author2=Pratt, R.V. |year=1998| title=Poison and profits: cyanide fishing in the Indo-Pacific|journal=Environment| volume=40| pages=5–34| doi=10.1080/00139159809604600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McManus"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McManus, J. W. |author2=Reyes, R.B. |author3= Nanola, C.L. |last-author-amp=yes |year=1997| title=Effects of some destructive fishing practices on coral cover and potential rates of recovery|journal=Environmental Management| volume=21|issue=1|pages=69–78| doi=10.1007/s002679900006|pmid=8939786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the post-capture handling stress and the effects of the cyanide, fish are bound to have a shorter life span than usual in aquariums. According to an interview with experienced aquarium owners, they were willing to pay more for net-caught fish because of the higher survival rate.&lt;ref name="Tsang"&gt;{{cite web | title=A glance at the marine aquarium fish trade in Hong Kong. | work=Tsang, A. | url=http://www.hku.hk/ecology/porcupine/por24/24-vert-fish.htm | accessdate=May 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also said they would not trust an [[ecolabel]]ling system, which can be misleading.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The basis for this [[illegal fishing]] method is, among others, the rising demand for [[live fish trade|live fish]] in the higher-class restaurants of the big cities, particularly in rich, nearby countries, which pay increasingly high prices. The extremely low wages of the fishermen in remote, underdeveloped areas, where there are no alternative sources of income, drive them to endure the health risks and possible prosecution.

==Method==
The fishermen dive into the sea usually without artificial breathing aids, although some use a highly dangerous apparatus (commonly garden hose surface-fed from the type of [[air compressor]] commonly used to power [[jackhammer]]s). When they reach the [[coral reef]]s, they spray the poison between the individual layers, after which the yield is collected. Edible fish, of which a number are sold for general consumption, are first placed for ten to fourteen days in fresh water for "rinsing". Recent studies have shown that the combination of cyanide use and stress of post capture handling results in [[Fish mortality|mortality]] of up to 75% of the organisms within less than 48 hours of capture. With such high mortality numbers, a greater number of fish must be caught in order to supplement post-catch death.

Cases have been reported of fishermen dumping drums of concentrated cyanide in places where fishing is difficult or economic times are hard.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; Such high concentrations normally kill most of the haul, but in these cases the objective is no longer to catch live fish, but to catch the largest amount possible.

==Mechanism==
In seawater sodium cyanide breaks down into sodium and cyanide [[ion]]s. In humans, cyanides block the oxygen-transporting protein [[haemoglobin]]; the haemoglobin in fish is closely related to that of humans, and can combine with oxygen even faster{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. Through the irreversible combining of cyanide ions onto the active [[structural domain]], oxygen is prevented from reaching the cells, and an effect similar to [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning results. [[Coral polyp]]s, young fish and [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] are most vulnerable; adult fish can take somewhat higher doses. The use of cyanide is known to cause mortality on laboratory [[coral]]s in measured doses, however these data are very difficult to quantify in regard to wild populations.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, R.J.|year=1997|title=Zooxanthellae loss as a [[bioassay]] for assessing stress in corals| journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=149|pages=163–171|doi=10.3354/meps149163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans ingestion or breathing in of cyanide leads to unconsciousness within a minute; asphyxiation follows. Lower doses lead to temporary or permanent disability and/or sensory failure. This is a constant danger for the fishermen; there are many local accounts of such "occupational accidents", but such incidents are not recorded in official statistics or statements{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

==Habitat destruction==
Many fishing and diving areas across the whole of South East Asia, already severely damaged from the impact of [[dynamite fishing]], have been ruined or totally lost through cyanide fishing. Cyanide concentration slows [[photosynthesis]] in [[zooxanthellae]], which results in [[Coral bleaching|coral reefs losing color]]; it also eliminates one of their major food sources.&lt;ref name=crc/&gt; Even at very low doses, cyanide results in higher mortality levels among corals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">'''Democratic rationalization''' is term used by [[Andrew Feenberg]] in his article "Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with technology."  Feenberg argues against the idea of ''[[technological determinism]]'' citing flaws in its two fundamental theses.

The first is the ''thesis of unilinear progress''.  This is the belief that technological progress follows a direct and predictable path from lower to higher levels of complexity and that each stage along this path is necessary for progress to occur ([[Feenberg]] 211).

The second is the ''thesis of determination by the base''.  This is the concept that  in a society where a technology had been introduced, that society must organize itself or adapt to the technology ([[Feenberg]] 211).

In his argument against the former thesis [[Feenberg]] says that [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] studies of technology will lead us to realize that there is not a set path by which development of technologies occur but rather an emerging of similar technologies at the same time leading to a multiplicity of choices.  These choices are made based upon certain social factors and upon examining them we will see that they are not deterministic in nature ([[Feenberg]] 212).

Arguing against the latter thesis, [[Feenberg]] calls to our attention social reforms that have been mandated by governments mainly in regards to the protection of its citizens and laborers.  Most of the time these mandates are widely accepted after being passed through the governing body. At which point technology and industry will reform and re-evolve to meet the new standards in a way that has greater efficiency than it did so previously ([[Feenberg]] 214)

Buckminster|date=|website=Buckminster Fuller Institute|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded on this concept in his ''World Design Science Decade'' proposal to the International Union of Architects in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bfi.org/design-science/primer/world-design-science-decade|title=World Design Science Decade documents|last=Fuller|first=R. Buckminster|last2=McHale|first2=John|date=1964|website=Buckminster Fuller Institute|publisher=Southern Illinois University|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later used by S. A. Gregory in the 1965 'The Design Method' Conference &lt;ref name="gregory1966" /&gt; where he drew the distinction between [[scientific method]] and design method. Gregory was clear in his view that design was not a science and that design science referred to the scientific study of design. [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] in his 1968 [[Karl Taylor Compton]] lectures &lt;ref name="simon1996" /&gt; used and popularized these terms in his argument for the scientific study of the artificial (as opposed to the natural). Over the intervening period the two uses of the term (systematic designing and study of designing) have co-mingled to the point where design science may have both meanings.

==Science of design==

The first edition of Simon's ''The Sciences of the Artificial'',&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Herbert A. ''The Sciences of the Artificial'', MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1969, built on previous developments and motivated the development of systematic and formalized [[Design methods|design methodologies]] relevant to many design disciplines, for example architecture, engineering, urban planning, medicine, computer science, and management studies.&lt;ref name="baldwin2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="banathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="long1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="romme2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vanaken2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="warfield1990" /&gt; Simon's ideas about the science of design also motivated the development of [[Design|design research]] and the scientific study of designing.&lt;ref name="cross2007" /&gt; In his book Simon also used the idea of a theory of design alluding to design science as a science of design. For example, the [[Axiomatic design|axiomatic theory of design]] described in Suh&lt;ref name="suh1990" /&gt; presents a domain independent theory that can explain or prescribe the design process. The [[Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology|Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) ontology]], described in Gero&lt;ref name="gero1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gerokanneng2004" /&gt; presenting a domain independent ontology of design and designing, is another example. Early efforts that use mathematics to formalize the design process include Braha’s Formal Theory of Design (FDT), which is a domain independent mathematical and computational theory of the design process.&lt;ref name=”FDT”&gt;Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1998). A Mathematical Theory of Design: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing from the idea of a 'design science' there has been recurrent concern to differentiate design from science.&lt;ref name="gregory1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crossnw1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="willem1990" /&gt; [[Nigel Cross]] differentiated between scientific design, design science and a science of design.&lt;ref name="cross2001" /&gt; The scientific study of design does not require or assume that the acts of designing are themselves scientific and an increasing number of research programs take this view.&lt;ref name="gero2004" /&gt; Cross uses the term 'designerly' to distinguish designing from other kinds of human activity.&lt;ref name="cross2006" /&gt;

==Design as science==

Braha and Maimon argue that there is direct similarity between design and the scientific process.&lt;ref&gt; Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1997). [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/IEEE_TSMC_Design_Process.pdf The design process: properties, paradigms, and structure]. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, 27(2), 146-166. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=”FDT”/&gt; There is growing pressure on architects, engineers, lawyers, managers and other design-oriented professionals to act and decide on the basis of a systematic body of evidence.&lt;ref name="vanaken2009" /&gt; Hevner and Chatterjee provide a reference on Design Science Research (DSR) in Information Systems,&lt;ref name="hevner2010" /&gt; including a selection of papers from the [http://desrist.org/ DESRIST conferences], a look at key principles of DSR, and the integration of action research with design research. In 2010, 122 professors promoted design science in information system research by signing a [http://memo.iwi.unisg.ch/en/ memorandum].

==Design as science in information systems==

Hevner et al. provide a set of seven guidelines which help information systems researchers conduct, evaluate and present design-science research.&lt;ref name="hevner2004" /&gt;  The seven guidelines address design as an artifact, problem relevance, design evaluation, research contributions, research rigor, design as a search process,  and research communication.

Later extensions of the Design Science framework detail how design and research problems can be rationally decomposed by means of nested problem solving.&lt;ref name="wieringa2009" /&gt; It is also explained how the regulative cycle (problem investigation, solution design, design validation, solution implementation, and implementation evaluation) fits in the framework. Peffers et al.&lt;ref name="peffers" /&gt; developed a model for producing and presenting information systems research, the Design Science Research Process. The Peffers et al. model has been used extensively and Adams provides an example of the process model being applied to create a digital forensic process model.&lt;ref name="adams" /&gt;

'''Economic geography''' is the study of the [[location]], distribution and spatial organization of economic activities across the world. It represents a traditional subfield of the discipline of [[geography]]. However, many economists have also approached the field in ways more typical of the discipline of [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Gordon L. Clark |editor2=Maryann P. Feldman |editor3=Meric S. Gertler |title=The Oxford Handbook of Economic Geography|isbn=978-0-19-823410-4|publisher=Oxford University Press}} Scroll to chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=TzZ_oByXYhkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Economic+geography%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x1w8qTXGfi&amp;sig=DTOZmshfo7muaRIt3ifaAT8Fj5E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MEWeS9f5JYP68Aa5g4S7Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false links.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic geography has taken a variety of approaches to many different subject matters, including the location of industries, [[economies of agglomeration]] (also known as "linkages"), [[Transportation geography|transportation]], [[international trade]], development, [[real estate]], [[gentrification]], ethnic economies, gendered economies, [[core-periphery]] theory, the [[urban economics|economics of urban form]], the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and [[globalization]].

== Theoretical background and influences ==
The subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher's methodological approach.  Neoclassical [[location theory|location theorists]], following in the tradition of [[Alfred Weber]], tend to focus on industrial location and use quantitative methods.  Since the 1970s, two broad reactions against neoclassical approaches have significantly changed the discipline: Marxist political economy, growing out of the work of [[David Harvey (social theorist and geographer)|David Harvey]]; and the new economic geography which takes into account social, cultural, and institutional factors in the spatial economy.

Economists such as [[Paul Krugman]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]] have also analyzed many traits related to economic geography. Krugman called his application of spatial thinking to [[international trade theory]] the "new economic geography", which directly competes with an approach within the discipline of geography that is also called "new economic geography".&lt;ref&gt;From S.N.

==History==
[[File:ElSalvadorfairtradecoffee.jpg|thumb|right|The [[economics of coffee|coffee trade]] is a worldwide industry]]

Some of the first traces of the study of spatial aspects of economic activities can be found in [[History of Cartography#China|seven Chinese maps]] of the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] dating to the 4th century BC. Ancient writings can be attributed to the Greek geographer [[Strabo]]'s ''Geographika'' compiled almost 2000 years ago.  As the science of [[cartography]] developed, geographers illuminated many aspects used today in the field; maps created by different European powers described the resources likely to be found in American, African, and Asian territories.  The earliest travel journals included descriptions of the native peoples, the climate, the landscape, and the productivity of various locations.  These early accounts encouraged the development of transcontinental trade patterns and ushered in the era of [[mercantilism]].

World War II contributed to the popularization of geographical knowledge generally, and post-war economic recovery and development contributed to the growth of economic geography as a discipline. During [[environmental determinism]]'s time of popularity, [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and his theory of [[climatic determinism]], while later greatly criticized, notably influenced the field. Valuable contributions also came from location theorists such as [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]] or [[Alfred Weber]]. Other influential theories include [[Walter Christaller]]'s [[Central place theory]], the theory of core and periphery. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Fred K. Schaefer]]'s article "Exceptionalism in geography: A Methodological Examination", published in the American journal ''Annals of the [[Association of American Geographers]]'', and his critique of regionalism, made a large impact on the field: the article became a rallying point for the younger generation of economic geographers who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science, and quantitative methods began to prevail in research. Well-known economic geographers of this period include [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Brian Berry]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[Peter Haggett]] and [[William Bunge]].

Contemporary economic geographers tend to specialize in areas such as [[location theory]] and [[spatial analysis]] (with the help of [[geographic information systems]]), market research, geography of transportation, real estate price evaluation, regional and global development, planning, [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]], innovation, [[social networks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braha | first1 = Dan | last2 = Stacey | first2 = Blake | last3 = Bar-Yam | first3 = Yaneer | year = 2011 | title = Corporate competition: A self-organized network | url = http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/Journal_Version_SON_Braha.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Social Networks | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 219–230 | doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2011.05.004| arxiv = 1107.0539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to study==
As economic geography is a very broad discipline, with economic geographers using many different methodologies in the study of economic phenomena in the world some distinct approaches to study have evolved over time:
*''[[Theoretical economic geography]]'' focuses on building theories about spatial arrangement and distribution of economic activities.
*''[[Regional geography|Regional]] economic geography'' examines the economic conditions of particular regions or countries of the world. It deals with economic [[regionalization]] as well as local [[Economic growth|economic development]].
*''[[Historical economic geography|Historical]] economic geography'' examines the history and development of spatial economic structure. Using historical data, it examines how centers of population and economic activity shift, what patterns of regional specialization and localization evolve over time and what factors explain these changes.
*''[[Evolutionary]] economic geography'' adopts an [[evolutionary]] approach to economic geography. More specifically, Evolutionary Economic Geography uses concepts and ideas from [[evolutionary economics]] to understand the evolution of cities, regions, and other economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boschma | first1 = Ron | last2 = Frenken | first2 = Koen |year = 2006 | title = Why is economic geography not an evolutionary science? Towards an evolutionary economic geography | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbi022 | journal = Journal of Economic Geography | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–302 | doi=10.1093/jeg/lbi022}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''[[Critical geography|Critical]] economic geography'' is an approach taken from the point of view of contemporary [[critical geography]] and its philosophy.
*''[[Behavioral geography|Behavioral]] economic geography'' examines the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, locational decision making, and behavior of firms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoenberger | first1 = E | year = 2001 | title = Corporate autobiographies: the narrative strategies of corporate strategists | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Geography | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 277–98 | doi=10.1093/jeg/1.3.277}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals.

Economic geography is sometimes approached as a branch of [[Human geography|anthropogeography]] that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity. An alternative description of different approaches to the study of human economic activity can be organized around spatiotemporal analysis, analysis of production/consumption of economic items, and analysis of economic flow. Spatiotemporal systems of analysis include economic activities of region, mixed social spaces, and development.

Alternatively, analysis may focus on production, exchange, distribution, and consumption of items of economic activity. Allowing parameters of space-time and item to vary, a geographer may also examine material flow, commodity flow, population flow and information flow from different parts of the economic activity system. Through analysis of flow and production, industrial areas, rural and urban residential areas, transportation site, commercial service facilities and finance and other economic centers are linked together in an economic activity system.

===Branches===
Thematically, economic geography can be divided into these subdisciplines:
* [[Agricultural geography|Geography of agriculture]]
It is traditionally considered the branch of economic geography that investigates those parts of the Earth's surface that are transformed by humans through primary sector activities. It thus focuses on structures of agricultural landscapes and asks for the processes that lead to these spatial patterns. While most research in this area concentrates rather on production than on consumption,[1] a distinction can be made between nomothetic (e.g. distribution of spatial agricultural patterns and processes) and idiographic research (e.g. human-environment interaction and the shaping of agricultural landscapes). The latter approach of agricultural geography is often applied within regional geography.
* Geography of industry
* Geography of international trade
* Geography of resources
* [[Transportation geography|Geography of transport]] and communication
* [[Geography of finance]]

These areas of study may overlap with other [[geography|geographical sciences]].

===Economists and economic geographers===
Generally, spatially interested economists study the effects of space ''on the economy''. Geographers, on the other hand, are interested in the economic processes' impact ''on spatial structures''.

Moreover, economists and economic geographers differ in their methods in approaching spatial-economic problems in several ways. An economic geographer will often take a more holistic approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, which is to conceptualize a problem in terms of space, place, and scale as well as the overt economic problem that is being examined. The economist approach, according to some economic geographers, has the main drawback of homogenizing the economic world in ways economic geographers try to avoid.&lt;ref name="Coe"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yeung |first1=Henry W. C. |last2=Kelly |first2=Phillip |year=2007 |title=Economic Geography: A Contemporary Introduction |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New economic geography==
With the rise of the [[New Economy]], economic inequalities are increasing spatially. The New Economy, generally characterized by globalization, increasing use of information and communications technology, the growth of knowledge goods, and feminization, has enabled economic geographers to study social and spatial divisions caused by the rising New Economy, including the emerging [[digital divide]].

The new economic geographies consist of primarily service-based sectors of the economy that use innovative technology, such as industries where people rely on computers and the internet. Within these is a switch from manufacturing-based economies to the digital economy. In these sectors, competition makes technological changes robust. These high technology sectors rely heavily on interpersonal relationships and trust, as developing things like software is very different from other kinds of industrial manufacturing—it requires intense levels of cooperation between many different people, as well as the use of [[tacit knowledge]]. As a result of cooperation becoming a necessity, there is a clustering in the high-tech new economy of many firms.

=== Social and spatial divisions ===
As characterized through the work of Diane Perrons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perrons|first=Diane|title=Understanding Social and Spatial Divisions in the New Economy: New Media Clusters and the Digital Divide|journal=Economic Geography|year=2004|volume=80|issue=1|pages=45–61|doi=10.1111/j.1944-8287.2004.tb00228.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Anglo-American literature, the New Economy consists of two distinct types. New Economic Geography 1 (NEG1) is characterized by sophisticated spatial modelling. It seeks to explain uneven development and the emergence of [[Business cluster|industrial clusters]]. It does so through the exploration of linkages between centripetal and centrifugal forces, especially those of economies of scale.

New Economic Geography 2 (NEG2) also seeks to explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of industrial clusters in a contemporary context, however, it emphasizes relational, social, and contextual aspects of economic behaviour, particularly the importance of tacit knowledge. The main difference between these two types is NEG2's emphasis on aspects of economic behaviour that NEG1 considers intangible.

Both New Economic Geographies acknowledge transport costs, the importance of knowledge in a new economy, possible effects of externalities, and endogenous processes that generate increases in productivity. The two also share a focus on the firm as the most important unit and on growth rather than development of regions. As a result, the actual impact of clusters on a region is given far less attention, relative to the focus on clustering of related activities in a region.

However, the focus on the firm as the main entity of significance hinders the discussion of New Economic Geography. It limits the discussion in a national and global context and confines it to a smaller scale context. It also places limits on the nature of activities carried out in the firm and their position within the global value chain. Further work done by Bjorn Asheim (2001) and Gernot Grabher (2002) challenges the idea of the firm through action-research approaches and mapping organizational forms and their linkages. In short, the focus on the firm in new economic geographies is undertheorized in NEG1 and undercontextualized in NEG2, which limits the discussion of its impact on spatial economic development.

Spatial divisions within these arising New Economic geographies are apparent in the form of the [[digital divide]], as a result of regions attracting talented workers instead of developing skills at a local level (see [[Creative Class]] for further reading). Despite increasing inter-connectivity through developing information communication technologies, the contemporary world is still defined through its widening social and spatial divisions, most of which are increasingly gendered. [[Danny Quah]] explains these spatial divisions through the characteristics of knowledge goods in the New Economy: goods defined by their infinite expansibility, weightlessness, and [[Nonrival good|nonrivalry]]. Social divisions are expressed through new spatial segregation that illustrates spatial sorting by income, ethnicity, abilities, needs, and lifestyle preferences. Employment segregation can be seen through the overrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in lower-paid service sector jobs. These divisions in the new economy are much more difficult to overcome as a result of few clear pathways of progression to higher-skilled work.

'''Economic statistics''' is a topic in [[applied statistics]] that concerns the [[data collection|collection]], processing, compilation, dissemination, and [[data analysis|analysis]] of [[economic data]]. It is also common to call the data themselves 'economic statistics', but for this usage see [[economic data]]. The data of concern to economic  statistics may include those of an [[economy]] of region, country, or  group of countries. Economic statistics may also refer to a subtopic of [[official statistics]] for data produced by official organizations (e.g. [[List of national and international statistical services|national statistical services]], intergovernmental organizations such as [[United Nations]], [[European Union]] or [[OECD]], [[central bank]]s, ministries, etc.).  Analyses within economic statistics both make use of and provide the empirical data needed in economic research, whether descriptive or [[econometric]]. They are a key input for decision making as to [[economic policy]].
The subject includes statistical analysis of topics and problems in [[microeconomics]], [[macroeconomics]], [[business]], [[finance]],&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Business and Economic Statistics'', [http://pubs.amstat.org/page/jbes/aims-and-scope Aims and Scope.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[economic forecasting|forecasting]], [[data quality]], and [[Policy analysis|policy]] evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/publications/jbes.cfm "Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics, American Statistical Association."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;• Charles J.

'''Environmental soil science''' is the study of the interaction of humans with the [[pedosphere]] as well as critical aspects of the [[biosphere]], the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Environmental [[soil science]] addresses both the fundamental and applied aspects of the field including: buffers and surface water quality, [[vadose zone]] functions, [[septic drain field]] site assessment and function, land treatment of [[wastewater]], [[stormwater]], [[erosion]] control, [[soil contamination]] with metals and pesticides, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated soils, restoration of [[wetlands]], [[soil degradation]], [[nutrient management]], movement of viruses and bacteria in soils and waters, [[bioremediation]], application of [[molecular biology]] and [[genetic engineering]] to development of soil microbes that can degrade hazardous pollutants, [[land use]], [[global warming]], [[acid rain]], and the study of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] soils, such as [[terra preta]]. Much of the research done in environmental soil science is produced through the use of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Hongwei|last2=An|first2=Jing|last3=Wei|first3=Shuhe|last4=Gu|first4=Jian|last5=Liang|first5=Wenju|title=Spatial Patterns and Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Soils in a Resource-Exhausted City, Northeast China|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|date=2015|volume=10|issue=9|page=e0137694|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0137694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziadat|first1=Feras Mousa|last2=Yeganantham|first2=Dhanesh|last3=Shoemate|first3=David|last4=Srinivasan|first4=Raghavan|last5=Narasimhan|first5=Balaji|last6=Tech|first6=Jaclyn|title=Soil-Landscape Estimation and Evaluation Program (SLEEP) to predict spatial distribution of soil attributes for environmental modeling|journal=International Journal of Architectural and Biological Engineering|date=2015|volume=8|issue=3|pages=158–172|doi=10.3965/j.ijabe.20150803.1270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green criminology''' is a branch of [[criminology]] that involves the study of harms and [[crimes against the environment]] broadly conceived, including the study of environmental law and policy, the study of [[corporate crimes]] against the environment, and environmental justice from a criminological perspective.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Origins ==

The term "green criminology" was introduced by Michael J. Lynch in 1990, and expanded upon in Nancy Frank and Michael J. Lynch’s 1992 book, ''Corporate Crime, Corporate Violence'',&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Nancy and Michael J. Lynch  1992  Corporate Crime, Corporate Violence. Albany, NY:  Harrow and Heston.&lt;/ref&gt; which examined the political economic origins of green crime and injustice, and the scope of environmental law. The term became more widely used following publication of a special issue on green criminology in the journal ''Theoretical Criminology'' edited by Piers Beirne and Nigel South (1998, volume 2, number 2). Green criminology has recently started to feature in university-level curriculum and textbooks in criminology and other disciplinary fields.&lt;ref&gt;White, R., &amp; Heckenberg, D. (2014) 'Green Criminology: An Introduction to the Study of Environmental Harm' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of green criminology has expanded significantly over time, and is supported by groups such as the ''International Green Criminology Working Group'' [http://greencriminology.org/ See http://greencriminology.org/].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} There are increasing interfaces and hybrid empirical and theoretical influences between the study of green criminology, which focuses on environmental harms and crimes, and mainstream criminology and criminal justice, with criminologists studying the 'greening' of criminal justice institutions and practices in efforts to become more environmentally sustainable and the involvement of people in prison or on probation in ecological justice initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 4 'Greening Justice' of Graham, H., &amp; White, R. (2015) 'Innovative Justice' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, R., &amp; Graham, H. (2015) 'Greening Justice: Examining the Interfaces of Criminal, Social and Ecological Justice' British Journal of Criminology [Advance Online Access]: 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moran, D., &amp; Jewkes, Y. (2014) ''Green' Prisons: Rethinking the ‘Sustainability’ of the Carceral Estate' Geographica Helvetica, vol 69: 345-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

Though green criminology was originally proposed as a political economic approach for the study of environmental harm, crime, law and justice, there are now several varieties of green criminology as noted below.&lt;ref&gt;For a general guide to green criminology, its definition, and varieties see, South, Nigel, Avi Brisman, and Piers Beirne. (2013). A guide to a green criminology. Pp. 27-42 in  N. South and A. Brisman (eds), The Routledge international handbook of green criminology. UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political economy, environmental justice, and the treadmill of production approach ===

The initial grounding of green criminology was in political economic theory and analysis. In his original 1990 article,&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Michael J. 1990. The Greening of Criminology: A Perspective for the 1990s. The Critical Criminologist 2,3:3-4,11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch proposed green criminology as an extension of [[radical criminology]] and its focus on political economic theory and analysis. In that view, it was essential to examine the political economic dimensions of green crime and justice in order to understand the major environmental issues of our times and how they connect with the political economy of capitalism. The political economic approach was expanded upon by Lynch and Paul B. Stretesky in two additional articles in the Critical Criminologist.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Michael J. and Paul B. Stretesky. 1999. Clarifying the Analysis of Environmental Justice: Further Thoughts on the Critical Analysis of Environmental Justice Issues. The Critical Criminologist. 9,3: 5-8;   Lynch, Michael J. and Paul B. Stretesky. 1998. Uniting Class and Race with Criticism Through the Study of Environmental Justice. The Critical Criminologist. Fall: 1, 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  In those articles, Lynch and Stretesky extended the scope of green criminology to apply to the study of environmental justice, and followed that work with a series of studies addressing environmental justice concerns,&lt;ref&gt;Stretesky, Paul B., and Michael J. Lynch. 2002. Environmental Hazards and School Segregation in Hillsborough, 1987-1999. The Sociological Quarterly. 43,4: 553-573; Stretesky, Paul B., and Michael J . Lynch. 1999.

Lynch. 1998. Corporate Environmental Violence and Racism. Crime, Law and Social Change  30, 2: 163-184;  Lynch, Michael J., Paul B. Stretesky and Ronald G. Burns. (2004). Determinants of Environmental Law Violation Fines Against Oil Refineries:  Race, Ethnicity, Income and Aggregation Effects. Society and Natural Resources. 17, 4:333-347; Lynch, Michael J., Paul B. Stretesky, and Ronald G. Burns. 2004. Slippery Business: Race, Class and Legal Determinants of Penalties Against Petroleum Refineries. Journal of Black Studies. 34,3: 421-440.&lt;/ref&gt; the distribution of environmental crimes and hazards,&lt;ref&gt;Stretesky, Paul B., and Michael J. Lynch. 2011. Coal Strip Mining, Mountain Top Removal and the Distribution of Environmental Violations Across the United States, 2002-2008. Landscape Research  36,2: 209-230; Stretesky, Paul B., and Michael J.

Lynch. 2012. “Density Dependence and Specialized Environmental Justice Organizations, 1970-2008.”  The Social Science Journal  49,3: 343-51; Stretesky, Paul B., Shelia Huss, Michael J.

Organization and Environment, 23 (4): 398–416.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, working with Michael A. Long and then Kimberly L. Barrett, the political economic explanation and empirical studies of green crimes were adapted to include a perspective on the structural influence of the [[environmental sociology|treadmill of production]] on the creation of green crimes &lt;ref&gt;Long, Michael A., Paul B. Stretesky, Michael J. Lynch and Emily Fenwick. 2012. Crime in the Coal Industry: Implications for Green Criminology and Treadmill of Production Theory. Organization &amp; Environment  25,3:  299-316;  Lynch, Michael J., Michael A. Long, Kimberly L. Barrett and Paul B. Stretesky. (2013). Is it a Crime to Produce Ecological Disorganization? Why Green Criminology and Political Economy Matter in the Analysis of Global Ecological Harms. British Journal of Criminology  55, 3; 997-1016; Stretesky, Paul B., Michael A. Long and Michael J. Lynch. (2013a). The Treadmill of Crime: Political Economy and Green Criminology. UK:  Routledge; Stretesky, Paul B., Michael A. Long and Michael J. Lynch. (2013b) Does environmental enforcement slow the treadmill of production? The relationship between large monetary penalties, ecological disorganization and toxic releases within offending corporations. Journal of Crime and Justice  36, 2: 235-249.&lt;/ref&gt; drawn from the work of [[Allan Schnaiberg]], [[environmental sociology]], [[eco-socialism]] and [[ecological Marxism]].  Throughout the development of the political economic approach to green criminology, scholars have made significant use of scientific and ecological literatures, as well as empirical analysis, which have become characteristics of this approach and distinguish it from other varieties of green criminology.

=== Nonspeciesist and nonhuman animal studies ===

The second major variation of green criminology is the nonspeciesist argument proposed by Piers Beirne.&lt;ref&gt;Beirne, Piers. 1999. For a nonspeciesist criminology: Animal abuse as an object of study. Criminology 37, 1: 117-148.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Beirne’s view, the study of harms against nonhuman animals is an important criminological topic which requires attention and at the same time illustrates the limits of current criminological theorizing about, crime/harm, law and justice with its focus almost exclusively on humans.&lt;ref&gt;Beirne, Piers. 2009. Confronting animal abuse: Law, criminology, and human-animal relationships. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach also includes discussions of [[animal rights]]. Beirne’s approach to green criminology has been extremely influential, and there are now a significant number of studies within the green criminological literature focusing on nonhuman animal crimes and animal abuse.&lt;ref&gt;For examples see the special issue of Crime, Law and Social Change Beirne has edited (volume 55, number 5); Cazaux, Geertrui. 1999. Beauty and the beast: Animal abuse from a non-speciesist criminological perspective. Crime, Law and Social Change 31, 2 : 105-125.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to studies of animal abuse, included within the scope of [[nonhuman animal]] studies are those focused on illegal [[wildlife trade]], [[poaching]], [[wildlife smuggling]], animal trafficking and the [[CITES|international trade in endangered species.]]&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, Tanya. Green criminology &amp; wildlife trafficking: The illegal fur and falcon trades in Russia Far East. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, 2012; Wyatt, Tanya. 2009. Exploring the organization of Russia Far East's illegal wildlife trade: two case studies of the illegal fur and illegal falcon trades. Global Crime 10, 1-2: 144-154.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the studies green criminologists undertake in this area of research are theoretical or qualitative. Ron Clarke and several colleagues, however, have explored empirical examinations of illegal animal trade and trafficking,&lt;ref&gt;Lemieux, Andrew M., and Ronald V. Clarke. 2009. The international ban on ivory sales and its effects on elephant poaching in Africa. British Journal of Criminology 49, 4: 451-471;   Clarke, Ronald V., and A. Rolf. 2013. Poaching, habitat loss and the decline of neotropical parrots: a comparative spatial analysis. Journal of Experimental Criminology 9, 3: 333-353; Pires, Stephen, and Ronald V. Clarke. 2012. Are parrots CRAVED? An analysis of parrot poaching in Mexico. Journal of research in crime and delinquency 49, 1: 122-146; Pires, Stephen F., and Ronald V. Clarke. 2011. Sequential foraging, itinerant fences and parrot poaching in Bolivia. British Journal of Criminology 51, 2: 314-335.&lt;/ref&gt; and this has become a useful approach for examining green crimes. Clarke’s approach draws on more traditional criminological theory such as [[rational choice theory]] and [[crime opportunity theory]], and hence is not within the mainstream of green criminological approaches. Nevertheless, Clarke’s approach has drawn attention to important empirical explanations of green crimes.

=== Bio-piracy and eco-crimes ===

Similar to the political economic approach but without grounding in political economic theory, some green criminologists have explored the issue of green crime by examining how corporate behavior impacts green crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, Vincenzo, and Nigel South. 2013. Green criminology and crimes of the economy: theory, research and praxis. Critical Criminology 21, 3: 359-373.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other issues, this approach has included discussions of eco-crimes and activities such as [[bio-piracy]] as discussed by Nigel South.&lt;ref&gt;South, Nigel. 2007. The ‘corporate colonisation of nature’: Bio-prospecting, bio-piracy and the development of green criminology. Pp. 230-247 in P. Beirne and N. South’s (ed), Issues in green criminology. Devon, UK: Willan.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bio-piracy is largely an effort by corporations to commodify native knowledge and to turn native knowledge and practices into for-profit products while depriving native peoples of their rights to that knowledge and those products, and in most cases, avoiding payments to natives for their knowledge or products. Bio-piracy includes issues of [[social and economic justice]] for native peoples. These kinds of crimes fall into the category of eco-crimes, a term associated with the work of Reece Walters.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Reece. 2006. Crime, bio-agriculture and the exploitation of hunger. British Journal of Criminology 46, 1: 26-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also included within the examination of eco-crimes is the analysis of other ecologically harmful corporate behaviors such as the production of [[genetically modified foods]] &lt;ref&gt;Walters, Reece. 2007. Food crime, regulation and the biotech harvest. European Journal of Criminology 4, 2: 217-235.&lt;/ref&gt; and various forms of toxic pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Reece. 2010. Toxic atmospheres air pollution, trade and the politics of regulation. Critical Criminology 18, 4: 307-323.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eco-global criminology ===

Some of those who study environmental crime and justice prefer the use of Rob White’s term, eco-global criminology.&lt;ref&gt;White, Rob. 2011. Transnational environmental crime: Toward an eco-global criminology. UK: Routledge; Ellefsen, Rune, Guri Larsen, and Ragnhild Sollund (eds). 2012. Eco-global Crimes: Contemporary Problems and Future Challenges. UK: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;  In proposing this term, White suggested that it is necessary to employ a critical analysis of environmental crime as it occurs in its global context and connections.&lt;ref&gt;White, Rob. 2009. Researching Transnational Environmental Harm: Toward an Eco‐Global Criminology. International journal of comparative and applied criminal justice 33, 2: 229-248.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Lynch’s political economic approach to green criminology, White has also noted that it is desirable to refer to the political economy of environmental crime, and to social and [[environmental justice]] issues.

=== Green-cultural criminology ===

As proposed by Avi Brisman and Nigel South &lt;ref&gt;Brisman, Avi, and Nigel South. 2013. A green-cultural criminology: An exploratory outline. Crime, Media, Culture 9, 2: 115-135.&lt;/ref&gt; green-cultural criminology attempts to integrate green and [[cultural criminology]] to explore the cultural meaning and significance of terms such as “environment” and “environmental crime.”

=== Conservation criminology ===

Conservation criminology is compliment to green criminology. Originally proposed by an interdisciplinary group of scholars from the Department of Fisheries &amp; Wildlife, School of Criminal Justice, and Environmental Science &amp; Policy Program at Michigan State University, conservation criminology seeks to overcome limitations inherent to single-discipline science and provide practical guidance about on-the-ground reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/1/124.short Gibbs, Carole, Meredith L. Gore, Edmund F. McGarrell, and Louie Rivers. 2010. Introducing conservation criminology towards interdisciplinary scholarship on environmental crimes and risks. British Journal of Criminology 50, 1: 124-144.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Meredith L.|date=2011-08-01|title=The Science of Conservation Crime|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01701.x/abstract|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=659–661|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01701.x|issn=1523-1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.conservationcriminology.com/ Conservation criminology] is an interdisciplinary and applied paradigm for understanding programs and policies associated with global conservation risks. By integrating natural resources management, risk and decision science, and criminology, conservation criminology-based approaches ideally result in improved environmental resilience, biodiversity conservation, and secure human livelihoods. As an interdisciplinary science, conservation criminology requires the constant and creative combination of theories, methods, and techniques from diverse disciplines throughout the entire processes of research, practice, education, and policy. Thinking about the interdisciplinary nature of conservation criminology can be quite exciting but does require patience and understanding of the different languages, epistemologies and ontologies of the core disciplines. Conservation criminology has been extensively applied to extralegal exploitation of natural resources such as wildlife poaching in Namibia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Meredith L|last2=Ratsimbazafy|first2=Jonah|last3=Rajaonson|first3=Andry|last4=Lewis|first4=Amanda|last5=Kahler|first5=Jessica S|date=2016-07-12|title=Public perceptions of poaching risks in a biodiversity hotspot: Implications for wildlife trafficking interventions|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305224010_Public_perceptions_of_poaching_risks_in_a_biodiversity_hotspot_Implications_for_wildlife_trafficking_interventions|journal=ResearchGate|volume=2016|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Madagascar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Meredith L.|last2=Lute|first2=Michelle L.|last3=Ratsimbazafy|first3=Jonah H.|last4=Rajaonson|first4=Andry|date=2016-04-15|title=Local Perspectives on Environmental Insecurity and Its Influence on Illegal Biodiversity Exploitation|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150337|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0150337|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0150337|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4833313|pmid=27082106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  corruption in conservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Meredith L.|last2=Ratsimbazafy|first2=Jonah|last3=Lute|first3=Michelle L.|date=2013-11-01|title=Rethinking Corruption in Conservation Crime: Insights from Madagascar|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12032/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|volume=6|issue=6|pages=430–438|doi=10.1111/conl.12032|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt; e-waste,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibbs|first=Carole|last2=McGarrell|first2=Edmund F.|last3=Axelrod|first3=Mark|date=2010-08-01|title=Transnational white-collar crime and risk|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9133.2010.00649.x/abstract|journal=Criminology &amp; Public Policy|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=543–560|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9133.2010.00649.x|issn=1745-9133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and general noncompliance with conservation rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solomon|first=Jennifer N.|last2=Gavin|first2=Michael C.|last3=Gore|first3=Meredith L.|date=2015-09-01|title=Detecting and understanding non-compliance with conservation rules|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715001822|journal=Biological Conservation|series=Detecting and Understanding Non-compliance with Conservation Rules|volume=189|pages=1–4|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2015.04.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By relying on multiple disciplines, conservation criminology leapfrogs this ideal; it promotes thinking about second- and third-order consequences of risks, not just isolated trends.

== Green criminological theory ==

It is often noted that green criminology is interdisciplinary and as a result, lacks its own unique theory or any preferred theoretical approach. Moreover, significant portions of the green criminological literature are qualitative and descriptive, and those studies have generally not proposed a unique or unifying theory. Despite this general lack of a singular theory, some of the approaches noted above indicate certain theoretical preferences. For example, as noted, the political economic approach to green criminology develops explanations of green crime, victimization and environmental justice consistent with several existing strains of political economic analysis. Beirne’s approach takes an interdisciplinary view of theory with respect to various animal rights models and arguments. Clarke’s rational choice models of animal poaching and trafficking build on the rational choice tradition found within the criminological literature. To date, these different theoretical approaches have not been examined as competing explanations for green crime and justice, a situation that is found with respect to orthodox or traditional criminological theories of street crime.

'''Henry''' '''(Jindřich, Heinrich) Kulka'''&lt;ref&gt;Like Adolf Loos Henry Kulka was an Anglophile and adopted the preferred name of Henry Kulka since before his emigration to New Zealand. Kulka was a native Czech speaker. German was his second language.&lt;/ref&gt; (29 March 1900 – 9 May 1971) was a Moravian (Czechoslovak) modern architect who was a key figure in the development of ‘Raumplan’ architecture in central Europe between 1919 and 1938. Kulka brought this approach to spatial planning and the Loosian traditions of natural material craftsmanship to modern building in New Zealand (1940–1971) where he was a pioneer of modern architecture.

== Life ==
Henry Kulka was born on 29 March 1900 into a Jewish family in the town of [[Litovel]] near [[Olomouc]] in the Czech Republic (then [[Austria-Hungary]]). His father Moritz owned and ran the village drapery shop. He was the youngest of three children, having two older sisters. Young Henry was sent to Vienna to complete his secondary education after which he studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna. As he found his studies uninspiring he did not complete his degree but preferred to continue his architectural development as a pupil of the pioneer modern architect and ideologue Adolf Loos. He became Loos’s assistant in 1919 and by the end of 1927 ran a joint architectural practice with Loos as full collaborating partner. In 1927 he married Hilda Beran and they had two children, Richard and Elizabeth (Maru). The young couple was active in the rich intellectual life of Vienna of that time.  After Loos died Kulka continued his work in Vienna.  When the Nazis occupied Austria in 1938 Kulka and his family fled to Czechoslovakia where his wife’s family lived. When the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia he managed to travel to England, being forced to leave his family behind. Thanks to warm letters of recommendation from [[Jan Masaryk]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Karin Michaëlis|Karen Michaelis]] he obtained visas for his family and himself to emigrate to New Zealand. After travelling by separate routes he was united with his family in New Zealand. He settled in Auckland where he found employment with the Fletcher Construction Company. He was chief architect at Fletcher’s, designing numerous commercial buildings as well as private residences, until his retirement in 1960. From 1960 to his death in 1971 he designed and realised private houses prolifically. He died in Auckland in 1971 aged 71.

== Career ==

=== Early work ===
In 1919 after a brief period at the Technical University in Vienna, Henry Kulka began his studies at the Building School of the pioneer modern architect Adolf Loos.

Loos emphasized that all architecture should be related to human activity and evolve from it: form follows function. Loos was opposed to unnecessary ornamentation in architecture. He advocated the use of natural unadulterated materials and a respect for skilled craftsmanship. His designs included specifications of internal lining of quality materials such as stone marble and wood. The unique feature of Loos’s design was three dimensional planning later named Raumplan by Kulka and described in Kulka’s words;  “The rooms of his houses are situated on various levels, inter-related in harmonious proportions, space flowing into space, but forming a compact unit. The levels are not bound to a special floor (ground floor, first floor, etc.) and are not the result simply dividing a high room into mezzanine parts. The floors are inter-related rooms with open vistas, the levels connected by steps”&lt;ref&gt;Kulka, Henry ‘Adolf Loos: 1870-1933’, in Architects’ year book 9, ed. by Trevor Dannatt (London: Elek, 1957), pp. 7-29 (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Kulka had an affinity for Loos’s thinking and had an aptitude to three dimensional planning, he became Loos’s assistant and later became his partner, further developing the Raumplan concept.

In 1922 Kulka assisted Loos on the realisation of the first cubic Raumplan house, the [[Rufer House|Villa Rufer]] in Hietzing Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Weissenbacher, Gerhard, ''In Hietzing gebaut'' vol. II (Vienna: Verlag Holzhausen, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1922 and 1923 Kulka designed, autonomously, a cubic Raumplan in smaller cubic dimensions than the Villa Rufer. Kulka's autonomously designed prototype became subsequently known as the Cubic, Dice or Würfelhaus, and was realised in Vienna by Kulka a decade later at 55 Künniglbergasse.&lt;ref&gt;Risselada, Max, ed., ''Raumplan versus Plan Libre'', 2nd English edn. (New York: Rizzoli,1988, repr. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period 1923–1927 Kulka worked between Stuttgart, Vienna and Paris. Loos was based in Paris during this period. Kulka collaborated with Ernst Otto Oswald on the winning entry of the competition to design the Stuttgart Tagblatt Tower, which was built in 1927. In 1927 Kulka spent the year heading Loos’s office in Paris, leading the design of the Villa Moller Raumplan (after Loos and Kulka's colleague Zlatko Neuman had returned to Zagreb), the Paris Knize fashion botique and other unrealised projects such as the famous Raumplan Villa for [[Josephine Baker]]. 
In 1928 Kulka and Loos returned to Vienna and ran an atelier as full collaborating partners. Henry Kulka's wife, Hilda Kulka née Beran, was their practice manager during this period. In the last years of his life Loos was less active due to the deterioration of his health.

During those years the works often attributed to Loos such as the Khuner house of 1929 in Semmering, Austria were principally designed by Kulka. During that period Kulka was also involved in planning [[Villa Müller]] in Prague, and the Wien Werkbund Houses.

In 1930 Kulka authored the seminal monograph on Loos’s work; 'Adolf Loos: The work of the Architect' published by Anton Schroll Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Kulka, Adolf Loos: Das Werk des Architekten, (Vienna: Anton Schroll Verlag, 1931)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late work in Europe ===
After Loos's death in 1933, Kulka continued and expanded their former architectural practice, maintaining their Vienna office and opening a second satellite office in Hradec Králové in Czechoslovakia to service commissions across Bohemia and Moravia.



Between 1932-1939 Kulka evolved new cubic Raumplan Villa and Apartment typologies. In addition to functionality, Kulka's approach was humanistic. He considered the feelings of  people inhabiting the space of his buildings, striving to give them a sense of harmony and well being.  Among these works are the 1932 Weissmann House in Hietzing Vienna, the 1933 Oskar Semler Raumplan Apartment in Pilsen, the 1934 Kantor Cubic Raumplan Villa in Jablonec, the 1934 small mountain Raumplan for Dr. Samuel Teichner in Spicak in Zelezna Ruda and the Villa Holzner Raumplan in Hronov, near Nachod. A fine example of Kulka’s Raumplan work at this time is the Villa Kantor, 1934. This cubic Raumplan was tailored to the requirements of a medical doctor who needed a functional consulting room nestled within the corpus of a comfortable family home. The exterior envelope of the building is cubic and rendered in fine stucco punctured by symmetrical fenestration in the front façade and a functional asymmetrical positioning of fenestration at the sides of the house. The symmetry of the façade is maintained through the use of a classical wall projection which accommodates internal circulation. The  interior of the Raumplan villa is clad with light colored woods and marble. The house has larger windows than Kulka’s villas with Loos. Kulka lets in more light and incorporates a lighter chromatic selection of cladding materials. It is in the more relaxed and subtle management of spatial transition that the Villa Kantor evolves raumplanning, and points toward changes Kulka would bring to his later work in New Zealand.

=== Work in New Zealand ===
Kulka understood that he could not transplant his European mode of operation to New Zealand.  He adapted remarkably well to the very different conditions of building, which included climate, construction methods, materials and availability of space. The compact style of building which characterized his more vertically oriented European work became less necessary. He retained many elements which characterized his European houses such as built in seating surrounding a fire place, built in furniture in the periphery of rooms, raised dining areas opening on living space and flat roofs. He had an extraordinary sense of quality and recognized the beauty of New Zealand wood, lining his houses with fine wooden paneling.Kulka said that he "wanted the interiors of his houses to look like the inside of a violin." At first his style was considered to be eccentric and provocative by the public but in later years it became emulated by young modern architects.



From 1940 until 1960 Kulka was the chief architect of the Fletcher Construction Company for whom he designed a large number of commercial and public buildings as well as private houses. His designs were diverse: family homes, bungalows, beach houses, bush batches, galleried houses, apartments, libraries, churches and monuments. These were largely realized in New Zealand, although he did build a limited amount of structures through Fletcher Building in Samoa, Tonga and Fiji.  Kulka followed changes to building technology closely and employed these new techniques in his commercial designs. Kulka is estimated to have designed and realized over 100 commercial structures throughout the period of New Zealand's post war industrialization. Characteristic  features of Kulka’s commercial structures include simple, solid facades and the avoidance of structural or decorative exhibitionism. His simple exterior envelopes accorded with a post war mood, which favoured civic modesty and utility. The reception and board rooms of these commercial structures were lined with indigenous wood and stone. Kulka introduced many innovations into his industrial designs including natural lighting and the introduction to New Zealand of the saw tooth factory ceiling. In the E. A Robinson building (1959) Kulka designed a double fenestration system so that offices within the deeper sections of that structure could benefit from internal glass facades which enabled natural light to permeate into these working spaces. In the entrance to Fletcher Building (1941-1942) Kulka designed a dramatic curved staircase lined with light marble and amber native wood.

Privately, Kulka realized over 40 fine wooden houses throughout New Zealand. His wooden houses were innovative in their spatial and material resolution. The Halberstam House in Wellington (1945) is an excellent example of Kulka’s ability to design compact minimal dwellings. The single level bungalow sits on top of a small hill in Wellington. It had a  very modest construction budget and post war building restrictions were imposed on the commissioners. Notwithstanding these constraints, Kulka built a striking cubic bungalow clad with dark stained weather boards on the exterior with the uplifting surprise of a luminous and calming interior consisting of fine honey coloured native wood panels and clean fibrous plaster. In this modest sized family home a small piano nobile is built subtly into the lounge. This niche is separated from the main body of the lounge by the minimal gesture of a bookcase which projects a little into the lounge. A small lowered ceiling above the nobile adds to the sense of separateness, snugness of this sub space.  Built in seating on either side of a fireplace are positioned toward the view of northerly hills, and the light. Cosiness, economy and functionality are brought together to achieve a sense of gentle refinement. Notwithstanding the Halberstam villa’s more modest scale compared to other Kulka Houses in New Zealand, it remains exemplary of the spirit of his work spatially and materially.

Kulka's prolific building throughout New Zealand continues to influence Modern Architecture in New Zealand.

The term '''high-performance fuzzy computing''' ('''HPFC''') refers to
those technologies able to exploit [[supercomputers]] and [[computer clusters]]
to perform high performance [[fuzzy logic]] computations.
Thus HPFC is just a special case of the much more general [[high-performance computing]].
In the specific case of fuzzy logic, however, there exist more traditional ways to achieve high performance, that could be considered HPFC but in a broader sense, like the
hardware implementations on [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] or [[FPGA]].
More recently, another alternative has emerged: fuzzy computing on [[GPU]].

''What is female desire?'' by Daniel Bergner, p. 26.]&lt;/ref&gt;   IASR is unique among sexology organizations in that individuals must be elected to membership, which requires demonstration of substantial contribution to sexology, including the authorship of 10 or more professional publications.  Notable members have included Drs. [[Ray Blanchard]], [[Milton Diamond]], [[Kurt Freund]], [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]], [[Leonore Tiefer]], Judith Becker, and [[Ken Zucker]]. The official journal of IASR is the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]''.

==History==
IASR was founded on 1 August 1973. The 53 founding charter members were nominated by the board of the journal ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'', which became the official publication of the IASR. The founding editor of ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' was Richard Green.&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. (1985). The International Academy of Sex Research: In the beginning. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 14,'' 293-302.&lt;/ref&gt; The current editor is [[Kenneth Zucker]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.springer.com/public+health/journal/10508?detailsPage=editorialBoard&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual IASR meeting was held at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] in September 1975. It was hosted by IASR founding president, [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. (2001). A 30 years' thank you. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 30,'' 633-637.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Institute for Species Exploration''' (IISE) is a [[research institute]] located in [[Syracuse, New York]].  Its mission is to improve [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] exploration and the cataloging of new species of flora and fauna.  Since 2008, IISE has published a yearly "Top 10" of the most unusual or unique biota newly identified in the previous year, with the aim of drawing attention to the work done in taxonomy across the world over the previous year.

In 2011, the institute contributed towards the estimate that [[Earth]] was home to approximately 8.7 million species.

==Overview==
The International Institute for Species Exploration (IISE) is a research facility dedicated to cataloging the Earth's species across all [[kingdom (biology)|biological kingdom]]s.&lt;ref name=mission /&gt; IISE cites three reasons why an improved taxonomic understanding of life is important: without knowing what exists today, humans will be unable to tell when species go extinct; the diversity of life driven by billions of years of natural selection means nature likely holds the answers to many human problems; and to better appreciate our place in the world.&lt;ref name=redOrbit2014 /&gt;

IISE is hosted by the [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry]] and located in [[Syracuse, New York]], United States. It was founded in 2007.&lt;ref name=mission&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.edu/species/mission.htm|title=About us|publisher=International Institute for Species Exploration|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IISE was previously associated with [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref name=report2011 /&gt; The institute's executive director is [[Quentin D. Wheeler]], an [[entomologist]].&lt;ref name=VOA2014 /&gt;

In 2011, the Institute contributed to a widely publicized estimate that Earth is home to approximately 8.7 million species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/23/species-earth-estimate-scientists|last=[[The Guardian]]|title=Planet Earth is home to 8.7 million species, scientists estimate|accessdate=August 24, 2011|location=London|date=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Top 10 New Species list ==
Starting in 2008, the IISE has published an annual list of the "Top 10 New Species" in an effort to increase public awareness of the diversity of life on Earth.&lt;ref name=VOA2014&gt;{{cite news|title=New Species Identified in 2014|work=[[Voice of America]]|author=Rosanne Skirble|date=May 22, 2014|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/new-species-identified-in-2014/1920625.html|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The list is credited with bringing attention to the abundance of new discovers, just as the world's species are declining.  Additionally, Wheeler said he hopes it spurs a sense of urgency to catalog Earth's creatures.&lt;ref name=redOrbit2014 /&gt;

Each year an international panel picks the list from the 17,000–18,000 species described during the previous calendar year, emphasizing diversity with their picks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top ten new species of 2014 - from tree-dwelling carnivores to translucent shrimp|author=James Vincent|date=May 22, 2014|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/top-ten-new-species-of-2014--from-treedwelling-carnivores-to-translucent-shrimp-9417980.html|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be eligible for inclusion, the species must have been formally described in an accredited scientific journal and named within the previous calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10 New Species Announced By Scientists|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112855560/top-10-new-species-announced-052313/|date=May 22, 2014|work = Red Orbit|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The list is published on or just before May 23, the birthday of [[Carl Linnaeus]], the "father" of [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].  The list is unordered.&lt;ref name=redOrbit2014&gt;{{cite news|title=Rich Biodiversity Of Species Makes Annual Top Ten List Of Discoveries|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1113152735/top-ten-species-2014-compiled-discoveries-052214/|date=May 22, 2014|author=Lawrence LeBlond|work=Red Orbit|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to selection committee chair Antonio Valdecasas, it is very difficult to select the list due to the large number of species discovered each year.  He added that "always surprised" by the diverse discoveries each year and that we are "very far" from a complete description of life on Earth.&lt;ref name=redOrbit2014 /&gt;

The list regularly draws considerable press attention.  The ''[[Dehli Daily News]]'' said the list "highlights the most amazing species found last year", while the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' called the creatures it features "bizarre discoveries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10 New Species 2014 listed|date=May 22, 2014|work=Dehli Daily News|url=http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/Top-10-newly-discovered-species-of-2014-1400782564/|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[TIME]]'' magazine called the list the "best of the best when it comes to new life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10 New Species for 2014|work=TIME|author=Bryan Walsh|date=May 22, 2014|url=http://time.com/107563/top-10-new-species-2014/|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State of observed species report==
The IISE also releases an annual report that inventories the complete list of species cataloged two years prior and discusses the state of new species discovery.  The 2011 report, for example, found that 19,232 species were named in 2009, a 5.6% increase over the prior year.  The report takes about two years to compile due to the lack of standardized registration for new species, and issue which IISE has campaigned for.  It routinely finds that insects make up roughly half of all new species discovered, followed by [[vascular plants]] and [[arachnid]]s.&lt;ref name=report2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Insects Top Newly Discovered Species List|date=January 28, 2012|work=Huffington Post|author=Remy Melina|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/28/insects-top-newly-discove_n_1237689.html|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7854">A '''[[biobank]]''' is a physical place which stores [[biobank specimens]].  In some cases, participant data is also collected and stored. Access policies details may vary across biobanks but generally involve obtaining [[ethics]] approval from [[institutional review board]]s and scientific review or [[peer review]] approval from the institutions under which the biobanks operate as well as Ethics approval from the institutions where the research projects will be undertaken.  The samples and data are safeguarded so that researchers can use them in experiments deemed adequate.  This page contains a list of biobanks.

==Classification==
Biobanks can be classified in several ways.  Some examples of how they can be classified is by their controlling entity (government, commercial enterprise, or private research institution), by their geographical location, or by what sorts of samples they collect.

Biobanks may be classified by purpose or design. Disease-oriented biobanks usually have a hospital affiliation through which they collect samples representing a variety of diseases, perhaps to look for biomarkers affiliated with disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bevilacqua | first1 = G. | last2 = Bosman | first2 = F. | last3 = Dassesse | first3 = T. | last4 = Höfler | first4 = H. | last5 = Janin | first5 = A. | last6 = Langer | first6 = R. | last7 = Larsimont | first7 = D. | last8 = Morente | first8 = M.

An '''MD–MS program''' is a [[dual degree]] [[graduate school]] program awarding both a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) and a [[Master of Science]] (MS) degree. Post-graduate diploma holders and [[Diplomate of National Board]] (India) candidates can upgrade to an MD-MS degree through opportunities such as post-graduate–up-gradation programs.

== Description ==
An MD-MS Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tauedu.org/masters-in-medicine.html |title=M.D./M.S. Programs - Education - Texila American University |publisher=Tauedu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[tutor]]-based program in which students are trained by research professionals on modern innovations in the healthcare industry. The MD-MS degree is designed for people who intend to pursue clinical practice and want to develop their research skills in a related area of engineering. It is well suited for students who desire a better understanding of the types of technology they may employ as practicing physicians. The MD-MS degree program provides a funded research experience in engineering that is expected to lead to research publishing. The program also provides practice in engineering design and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/academics/graduate/mdms/ |title=M.D./M.S. Program &amp;#124; Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth |publisher=Engineering.dartmouth.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire course is developed to be mentor-based, enabling the students to be coached by experts attached to a recommended medical center.

The dual degree program can usually be completed within five to six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medschool.umaryland.edu/osr/student_md_masters.asp |title=Combined MD/Master's Programs: Office of Student Research: University of Maryland School of Medicine |publisher=Medschool.umaryland.edu |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluation ===
Evaluation of the course is assessed by the guide and university through [[thesis]]/[[dissertation]] submitted by the student based on their research project done.

==Examples ==
Biomedical Informatics (BMI) applies statistical techniques and technologies to the medical and health sciences.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008&gt;{{cite web |title=MS Programs - Education - Stanford University School of Medicine |url=http://med.stanford.edu/ms/ |publisher=Med.stanford.edu |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2014-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503050513/http://med.stanford.edu/ms/ |archivedate=2014-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiology involves the study of disease — and the predisposing conditions for disease — among human populations in all parts of the world, with an emphasis on approaches to improving levels of health. The MS Program in Epidemiology is presented by the Department of Health Research and Policy (HRP) at the School of Medicine.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Health Services Research (HSR) is concerned with the analysis of health policy in the public and private sectors. The MS Program in HSR is part of the Department of Health Research and Policy (HRP) at the School of Medicine.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Masters of Medicine (MOM) includes experience in clinical medicine with a view to foster translational research. Students who pursue the MS in Medicine while engaged in their doctoral programs will be highly knowledgeable about human biology and disease, and thus more able to translate scientific discoveries into useful medical advances.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

Masters of Human Genetics and Genetic Counseling is a program that trains students to understand the molecular, clinical and psychological implications of differences in the human genome, and to translate these intricacies to health care professionals, laboratory researchers and patients/families. Graduates of this program will be eligible for board certification by the American Board of Genetic Counselling.&lt;ref name=Stanford2008/&gt;

'''Manchester Digital Music Archive (MDMarchive)''' is an online community archive founded in 2003 by Matthew Norman, Alison Surtees, [https://about.me/abigail_ward Abigail Ward], [[CP Lee]] and Dave Rofe. It was created as a way of celebrating and raising awareness of Greater Manchester's musical heritage and protecting collections of material held by individuals and institutions relating to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/about_us.php|title=Manchester District Music Archive: Mission Statement|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of 2015 it became a registered charity.

== Beginnings ==
The archive, originally named Manchester District Music Archive, came about in 2003 after Surtees and Norman had the idea of making a documentary about the Greater Manchester music scene, loosely based on [[CP Lee]]’s book ‘Shake, Rattle and Rain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Unconvention: Alison Surtees | url= http://unconventionhub.org/alison-surtees | accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realising the subject was too vast to be contained within a documentary, Surtees and Norman, alongside Dave Rofe and CP Lee, decided to launch a campaign to create a Greater Manchester music museum. Abigail Ward joined the team shortly afterwards and began to develop an online presence for the project. Lee's book covered the history of Manchester music from 1955 - 1995 and contained an extensive band list at the end of the book, which was used a starting point when populating the band list on the Manchester Digital Music Archive website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CerysmaticFactory: Shake Rattle and Rain: Popular Music Making in Manchester 1955 - 1995 by CP Lee | url=http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/shake_rattle_and_rain.php | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminar was held at [[Urbis]] in 2004 to officially launch the newly constituted organisation with a panel featuring [[Jon Savage]], [[CP Lee]], [[Guy Garvey]], [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] and Jan Hargreaves. Hundreds attended the event and it was announced that the intention was to set up a museum where people could donate items of music ephemera to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=21 September 2004 | title=CerysmaticFactory: Manchester District Music Archive Seminar | url= http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/mdma_seminar_210904.php | accessdate= 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-founders then spent a number of years trying to create a physical space for the archive but after years of struggling to find something suitable, a website was set up in 2006, which allowed users to upload images of their own personal artefacts, along with associated memories, relating to Greater Manchester music, musicians, DJs and venues. This online archive was developed by Abigail Ward with web designer Ashley Kennerley (Go Bang! Design).

In 2007 and 2014, Manchester Digital Music Archive won the Big Chip best not-for-profit project award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MDMA {{!}} The Big Chip Awards|url = http://bigchipawards.com/MDMA2007|website = bigchipawards.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Best Not for Profit Project {{!}} The Big Chip Awards|url = http://bigchipawards.com/BNFPP2014|website = bigchipawards.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015 the site has in excess of 3000 members who have uploaded material relating to more than 3350 bands, 600 DJs and 1000 venues. Users are encouraged to provide memories and anecdotes along with their artefacts and the only stipulation is that items need to be linked to acts or venues from Greater Manchester. All genres of music are covered and as well as an extensive collection of pop memorabilia, the archive includes material relating to the history of the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and the [[The Hallé|Halle Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manchester District Music Archive Homepage | url= http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/ | accessdate= 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can comment on and discuss items uploaded by others or curate online themed exhibitions using material from the site. The site has a number of these exhibitions on various subjects including [[Moss Side]] and [[Hulme]] club culture, [[City Fun]] fanzine, Manchester's [[LGBT]] music and club culture and [[Royal Northern College of Music]] students who served in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Manchester District Music Archive: Exhibitions | url=http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/exhibitions.php | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charitable status ==
In November 2015, the organisation became a registered charity and in June 2017 changed its name to Manchester Digital Music Archive. The board of trustees are Dave Carter, CP Lee, Cathy Brooks, Aidan O'Rourke and Sarah Feinstein.

== Physical Presence ==
The archive exists online but has held numerous events and exhibitions at venues around Greater Manchester. In 2008 it held an event at [[Islington Mill]] which explored the city’s 1980s electro-funk scene, curated by DJ [[Greg Wilson (DJ)|Greg Wilson]]. The event included music and discussion and also showed the premiere of the Tim Forde documentary 'Birth of The British B-Boy', which tells the story of breakdancing in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Electrofunkroots: Electrospective Press Release | url= http://www.electrofunkroots.co.uk/electrospective-event-press-release | accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, following investment from [[Heritage Lottery Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/|title=Heritage Lottery Fund|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDMarchive held an exhibition, ''Defining Me: Musical Adventures in Manchester'' ,at The Lowry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Lowry: What’s On – Defining Me: Musical Adventures In Manchester | url= http://www.thelowry.com/event/defining-me-musical-adventures-in-manchester | accessdate = 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 5-month show co-curated by members of MDMarchive's online community. The exhibition attracted a 32,000 visitors. There were a number of spin-off events featuring Greater Manchester music luminaries in conversation, including [[Barry Adamson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barry Adamson  - onstage interview &amp; audience Q&amp;A|url = http://www.manchesterhistoriesfestival.org.uk/whatson/barryadamson|website = Manchester Histories|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Cummins (photographer)|Kevin Cummins]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seven of Kraak Gallery’s best events|url = http://www.timeout.com/manchester/blog/seven-of-kraak-gallerys-best-events-081715|website = Time Out Manchester|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Boon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ever fallen in love with Richard Boon?|url = http://www.northernsoul.me.uk/ever-fallen-in-love-with-richard-boon/|website = Northern Soul|access-date = 2016-01-12|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the project ended with a community concert at [[Band on the Wall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Musical Adventures in Manchester'- featuring The Prospectors with Graham Massey &lt; Events {{!}} Band on the Wall|url = http://bandonthewall.org/events/4292/|website = bandonthewall.org|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring British rave pioneer [[Graham Massey]] in collaboration with The Prospectors, a collective of disabled musicians from [[Stockport]].

The archive also has a regular presence in the ''Louder Than Words'' festival - an annual event focused on literature within the music industry. In 2014 MDMarchive hosted a panel discussion which saw Elbow's Guy Garvey, Jaheda Choudhury-Potter of Ajah UK and [[Everything Everything]]'s Jon Higgs talk about Greater Manchester lyricism in music .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EnglandEvents.co.uk: Manchester: Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly | url=http://englandevents.co.uk/manchester-hear-my-voice-in-your-head-and-think-of-me-kindly/35912 | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year it hosted another session, this time focusing on the work of virtual archives and included panellists from MDMarchive as well as writer [[Anita Sethi]] and Jez Collins from the Birmingham Music Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Louder Than Words: Festival Programme 2015 | url=http://louderthanwordsfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Louder-Than-Words-Events1.pdf | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Manchester Digital Music Archive won further investment from Heritage Lottery Fund for ''Rebel Music: The Sound of Politics and Protest in Manchester''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hlf.org.uk/our-projects/rebel-music-sound-politics-and-protest-manchester|title=Rebel Music: The Sound of Politics and Protest in Manchester {{!}} Heritage Lottery Fund|website=www.hlf.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/news.php?id=209|title=MDMarchive wins Heritage Lottery support for Rebel Music project : MANCHESTER DIGITAL MUSIC ARCHIVE|website=MANCHESTER DIGITAL MUSIC ARCHIVE|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' a project exploring the intertwined histories of music and political activism across the ten boroughs of the Greater Manchester. The project will focus in particular on the musical achievements of women and the LGBT+ community.

Throughout the project, MDMarchive will be working with teams of volunteers from the two chosen communities (women and LGBT+ people) to co-produce a programme of events, two physical pop-up exhibitions, a series of digital exhibitions, six short films and three guided heritage walks. The volunteers will also access training on how to preserve and share their own musical heritage.

The first physical exhibition, ''Queer Noise: The History of LGBT+ Music &amp; Club Culture in Manchester'', will be held at the [[People's History Museum|People’s History Museum]] from July–September 2017 as part of ''Never Going Underground 2017'', a major exhibition marking 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality. The second exhibition, ''Woman: Breaking The Rules'' is slated for February 2018 and will coincide with 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16679">'''Mental health literacy''' has been defined as "knowledge and beliefs about [[mental disorders]] which aid their recognition, management or prevention. Mental health literacy includes the ability to recognize specific disorders; knowing how to seek mental health information; knowledge of risk factors and causes, of self-treatments, and of professional help available; and attitudes that promote recognition and appropriate help-seeking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jorm | first1 = A.F. | last2 = Korten | first2 = A.E. | last3 = Jacomb | first3 = P.A. | last4 = Christensen | first4 = H. | last5 = Rodgers | first5 = B. | last6 = Pollitt | first6 = P. | year = 1997 | title = "Mental health literacy": a survey of the public's ability to recognise mental disorders and their beliefs about the effectiveness of treatment | url = | journal = Medical Journal of Australia | volume = 166 | issue = | pages = 182–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of mental health literacy was derived from [[health literacy]], which aims to increase patient knowledge about physical health, illnesses, and treatments.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jorm|first=Anthony F.|last2=Korten|first2=Ailsa E.|last3=Jacomb|first3=Patricia A.|last4=Christensen|first4=Helen|last5=Rodgers|first5=Bryan|last6=Pollitt|first6=Penelope|date=1997-01-01|title=Mental health literacy: a survey of the public's ability to recognise mental disorders and their beliefs about the effectiveness of treatment|url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/1997/166/4/mental-health-literacy-survey-publics-ability-recognise-mental-disorders-and|journal=Medical Journal of Australia|volume=166|issue=4|issn=0025-729X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework ==
Mental health literacy has three major components: recognition, knowledge, and attitudes. A conceptual framework of mental health literacy illustrates the connections between components, and each is conceptualized as an area to target for measurement or intervention.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jorm|first=Anthony F.|year=2000|title=Mental health literacy: Public knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders|url=https://msrc.fsu.edu/system/files/Mental%20health%20literacy%20Public%20knowledge%20and%20beliefs%20about%20mental%20disorders.pdf|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=177|pages=396–401|via=|doi=10.1192/bjp.177.5.396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Matt|last2=Casey|first2=Leanne|last3=Clough|first3=Bonnie|date=2014-08-01|title=Measuring mental health literacy – a review of scale-based measures|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09638237.2014.910646|journal=Journal of Mental Health|volume=23|issue=4|pages=197–204|doi=10.3109/09638237.2014.910646|issn=0963-8237}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some researchers have focused on a single component, others have focused on multiple and/or the connection between components. For example, a researcher may focus solely on improving recognition of disorders through an education program, whereas another researcher may focus on integrating all three components into one program.

=== Recognition ===
Recognition can be broken down into symptom or illness recognition. Symptom recognition is the ability to detect beliefs, behaviors, and other physical manifestations of mental illness, without knowing explicitly which disorder they link to. Specific illness recognition is the ability to identify the presentation of a disorder, such as [[major depressive disorder]].

The recognition of difference between knowledge and attitudes is a crucial part of the mental health literacy framework. While some efforts have focused on promoting knowledge, other researchers have argued that changing attitudes by reducing stigma is a more prolific way of creating meaningful change in mental healthcare utilization. Overall, both approaches have benefits for improving outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrigan|first=Patrick W.|last2=Morris|first2=Scott B.|last3=Michaels|first3=Patrick J.|last4=Rafacz|first4=Jennifer D.|last5=Rüsch|first5=Nicolas|title=Challenging the Public Stigma of Mental Illness: A Meta-Analysis of Outcome Studies|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ps.201100529|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=63|issue=10|pages=963–973|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.201100529|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knowledge ===
Knowledge is the largest component of mental health literacy, and is divided into four sub-components:
* Where/how to get information: the networks and systems individuals use to get information about mental disorders. This may include friends, family, educators, or broader sources, such as entertainment or social media.
* Risk factors: what factors put individuals at greatest risk for specific mental health disorders. Risk factors can be biological, environmental,
* [[Causes of mental disorders]]
* Self-treatment or [[self-help]]: what individuals can do to help themselves recover without consulting with professionals, including the use of self-help books and media. Although many self- treatments are quite ineffective and even harmful due to lack of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guy|first=Sarah|last2=Sterling|first2=Bobbie Sue|last3=Walker|first3=Lorraine O.|last4=Harrison|first4=Tracie C.|title=Mental Health Literacy and Postpartum Depression: A Qualitative Description of Views of Lower Income Women|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2014.04.001|journal=Archives of Psychiatric Nursing|volume=28|issue=4|pages=256–262|doi=10.1016/j.apnu.2014.04.001|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Professional help: where to get professional help and/or what professional help is available.

=== Attitudes ===
Attitudes are studied in two sub-components: attitudes about mental disorders, or persons with mental disorders, and attitudes about seeking professional help or treatment. Attitudes can vary greatly by individual, and can often be difficult to measure or target with intervention. Nonetheless, a large body of research literature exists on both sub-components, though not always explicitly tied to the mental health literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2014.04.001|title=Mental Health Literacy and Postpartum Depression: A Qualitative Description of Views of Lower Income Women|first1=Sarah|last1=Guy|first2=Bobbie Sue|last2=Sterling|first3=Lorraine O.|last3=Walker|first4=Tracie C.|last4=Harrison|publisher=|journal=Archives of Psychiatric Nursing|volume=28|issue=4|pages=256–262|doi=10.1016/j.apnu.2014.04.001|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public attitude ==

Surveys of the public have been carried out in a number of countries to investigate mental health literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Angermeyer | first1 = M.C. | last2 = Matschinger | first2 = H. | year = 2005 | title = Have there been any changes in the public's attitudes towards psychiatric treatment?

Ethnicity and Health, 9(3), 225-252.&lt;/ref&gt; These surveys show that recognition of mental disorders is lacking and reveal negative beliefs about some standard psychiatric treatments, particularly medications.  On the other hand, psychological, complementary and self-help methods are viewed much more positively. Negative attitudes towards people with mental disorders have been found, such as viewing them as having a weak character. These beliefs and attitudes are potential barriers to seeking optimal professional help and being supportive of others.

== Measures ==
Researchers have measured aspects of mental health literacy in several ways.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wei|first=Yifeng|last2=McGrath|first2=Patrick J.|last3=Hayden|first3=Jill|last4=Kutcher|first4=Stan|date=2015-01-01|title=Mental health literacy measures evaluating knowledge, attitudes and help-seeking: a scoping review|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-015-0681-9|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=15|pages=291|doi=10.1186/s12888-015-0681-9|issn=1471-244X|pmc=4650294|pmid=26576680}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popular methodologies include vignette studies and achievement tests. Vignette studies measure mental health literacy by providing a brief, detailed story of an individual (or individuals) with a mental health problem, and asks participants questions to identify what problem the individual is experiencing, and at times, additional questions about how the individual can help themselves.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

Achievement tests measure mental health literacy on a continuum, such that higher scores on a test indicate greater overall knowledge or understanding of a concept. Achievement tests can be formatted using multiple-choice, true/false, or other quantitative scales.

Various scales have been created to measure the various components of mental health literacy, though not all are validated.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mental health literacy has been measured across several populations, varying in age range, culture, and profession. Most studies have focused on adult and young adult populations, though improving literacy in children has been a focus of prevention efforts.

== Improvement approaches ==
A number of approaches have been tried to improve mental health literacy, many of which have evidence of effectiveness. These include:
# '''Whole of community campaigns'''.

{{Monarchism |expanded=concepts}}
A '''monarch''' is a [[potentate|sovereign]] [[head of state]] in a [[monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=monarch | website=Oxford Dictionaries | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/monarch?q=monarch | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;Webster's II New College Dictionary. [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/monarch?q=monarch Monarch]. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 2001. p. 707. {{ISBN|0-395-96214-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the [[Sovereign state|state]], or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally [[inheritance|inherits]] the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as ''the throne'' or ''[[the Crown|the crown]]'') or is [[elective monarchy|selected]] by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, [[acclamation]] or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns [[Life tenure|for life]] or until [[abdication]].

If a young child is crowned the monarch, a [[regent]] is often appointed to govern until the monarch reaches the requisite adult age to rule. Monarchs' actual powers vary from one monarchy to another and in different eras; on one extreme, they may be [[autocracy|autocrats]] ([[absolute monarchy]]) wielding genuine sovereignty; on the other they may be [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] [[head of state|heads of state]] who exercise little or no direct power or only [[reserve power]]s, with actual [[authority]] vested in a [[parliament]] or other body ([[constitutional monarchy]]).

A monarch can reign in multiple monarchies simultaneously. For example, the [[monarchy of Canada]] and the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]] are separate states, but they share the same monarch through [[personal union]].

==Characteristics==
Monarchs, as such, bear a variety of titles – [[king]] or [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[prince]] or [[princess]] (e.g., [[Sovereign Prince of Monaco]]), [[emperor]] or [[Emperor|empress]] (e.g., [[Emperor of China]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Emperor of India]]), [[archduke]], [[duke]] or [[grand duke]] (e.g., [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]), [[emir]] (e.g., [[Emir of Qatar]]) or [[sultan]] (e.g., [[Sultan of Oman]]). ''Prince'' is sometimes used as a generic term to refer to any monarch regardless of title, especially in older texts.&lt;ref name="pine"&gt;{{cite book | title=Titles: How the King became His Majesty | publisher=Barnes  &amp; Noble | author=[[L.G. Pine|Pine, L.G.]] | year=1992 | location=New York | page=86 | isbn=978-1-56619-085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A king can also be a queen's husband and a queen can be a king's wife. If both of the couple reign, neither person is generally considered to be a consort. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Monarchy]] is political or sociocultural in nature, and is generally (but not always) associated with [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary rule]]. Most monarchs, both historically and in the present day, have been born and brought up within a [[royal family]] (whose rule over a period of time is referred to as a [[dynasty]]) and trained for future duties. Different systems of [[Order of succession|succession]] have been used, such as [[proximity of blood]] (male preference or absolute), [[primogeniture]], [[agnatic seniority]], [[Salic law]], etc. While traditionally most monarchs have been male, female monarchs have also ruled, and the term [[queen regnant]] refers to a ruling monarch, as distinct from a [[queen consort]], the wife of a reigning king.

Some monarchies are non-hereditary. In an [[elective monarchy]], the monarch is [[election|elected]] but otherwise serves as any other monarch. Historical examples of elective monarchy include the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (chosen by [[prince-elector]]s, but often coming from the same dynasty) and the [[royal elections in Poland|free election]] of kings of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Modern examples include the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]], who is appointed by the [[Conference of Rulers]] every five years or after the king's death, and the [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who serves as sovereign of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] and is elected to a life term by the [[College of Cardinals]].

In recent centuries, many states have abolished the monarchy and become [[republic]]s (however see, e.g., [[United Arab Emirates#Government and politics|United Arab Emirates]]). Advocacy of government by a republic is called [[republicanism]], while advocacy of monarchy is called [[monarchism]]. A principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of national leadership, as illustrated in the classic phrase "[[:The King is dead. Long live the King.|The [old] King is dead. Long live the [new] King!]]". In cases where the monarch serves mostly as a ceremonial figure (e.g. most modern constitutional monarchies) real leadership does not depend on the monarch.

A form of government may in fact be hereditary without being considered monarchy, such as a [[family dictatorship]].

==Classification==
Monarchies take a wide variety of forms, such as the two [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes of Andorra]], positions held simultaneously by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Urgel (Spain) and the elected [[President of France]] (although strictly Andorra is a [[diarchy]]). Similarly, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] is considered a monarch despite only holding the position for five years at a time.

Hereditary succession within one [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] family has been most common (although, see the [[Rain Queen]]), with preference for children over siblings, sons over daughters. In Europe, some peoples practiced equal division of land and regalian rights among sons or brothers, as in the Germanic states of the Holy Roman Empire, until after the [[medieval era]] and sometimes (e.g., [[Ernestine duchies]]) into the 19th century. Other European realms practice one form or another of [[primogeniture]], whereunder a [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son or, if he had none, by his brother, his daughters or sons of daughters.

The system of [[tanistry]] was semi-elective and gave weight also to ability and merit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The [[Salic law]], practiced in France and in the Italian territories of the [[House of Savoy]], stipulated that only men could inherit the crown. In most [[fief]]s, in the event of the demise of all legitimate male members of the [[patrilineality|patrilineage]], a female of the family could succeed (semi-Salic law). In most realms, daughters and sisters were eligible to succeed a ruling kinsman before more distant male relatives (male-preference primogeniture), but sometimes the husband of the heiress became the ruler, and most often also received the title, ''[[jure uxoris]]''. Spain today continues this model of succession law, in the form of [[cognatic primogeniture]]. In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood|proximity]] and [[primogeniture]] battled, and outcomes were often idiosyncratic.

As the average life span increased, an eldest son was more likely to reach majority age before the death of his father, and primogeniture became increasingly favoured over proximity, tanistry, seniority and election.

In 1980, [[Sweden]] became the first monarchy to declare ''equal primogeniture'', ''absolute primogeniture'' or ''full cognatic primogeniture'', meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations have since adopted this practice: [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, and [[Luxembourg]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15489544&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/new-ducal-succession-rights-for-grand-duchy-4f60cf15e4b047833b93fca0&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] adopted absolute (equal) primogeniture on April 25, 2013, following [[Perth Agreement|agreement by the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth Realms]] at the 22nd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

In some monarchies, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother and so on through his other brothers, and only after them to the monarch's children (''agnatic seniority''). In some other monarchies (e.g. [[Jordan]]), the monarch chooses who will be his successor within the royal family, who need not necessarily be his eldest son.

Whatever the rules of succession, there have been many cases of a monarch being overthrown and replaced by a usurper who would often install his own family on the throne.

===Monarchs in Africa===
{{Further|Monarchies in Africa}}
[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ramesses II]], the third [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]]]
A series of [[Pharaoh]]s ruled [[Ancient Egypt]] over the course of three millennia (circa 3150 BC to 31 BC), until it was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. In the same time period several kingdoms flourished in the nearby [[Nubia]] region, with at least one of them, that of the so-called [[A-Group]] culture, apparently influencing the customs of Egypt itself. From the 6th to 19th centuries, Egypt was variously part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Islamic Empire, [[Mamluk]] Sultanate, [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[British Empire]] with a distant monarch. The [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was a short lived protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1914 until 1922, when it became the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] changed his title to King. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] the monarchy was dissolved and Egypt became a republic.

[[West Africa]] hosted the [[Kanem Empire]] (700–1376) and its successor, the [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] principality which survives to the present day as one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of [[Nigeria]].
[[File:Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shire 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohamoud Ali Shire]], the 26th Sultan of the [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali]] [[Warsangali Sultanate]]]]
In the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and later the [[Zagwe Dynasty]], [[Ethiopian Empire]] (1270–1974), and [[Aussa Sultanate]] were ruled by a series of monarchs. [[Haile Selassie]], the last Emperor of Ethiopia, was deposed in a [[communist]] [[coup]]. Various [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali Sultanates]] also existed, including the [[Adal Sultanate]] (led by the [[Walashma dynasty]] of the [[Ifat Sultanate]]), [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], [[Ajuran Sultanate]], [[Warsangali Sultanate]], [[Geledi Sultanate]], [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] and [[Sultanate of Hobyo]].

[[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]] were largely isolated from other regions until the modern era, but they did later feature kingdoms like the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] (1400–1914).

The [[Zulu people]] formed a powerful [[Zulu Kingdom]] in 1816, one that was subsequently absorbed into the [[Colony of Natal]] in 1897. The [[List of Zulu kings|Zulu king]] continues to hold a hereditary title and an influential cultural position in contemporary South Africa, although he has no direct political power. Other tribes in the country, such as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and the [[Tswana people|Tswana]], have also had and continue to have a series of kings and chiefs whose local precedence is recognised, but who exercise no legal authority.

As part of the [[Scramble for Africa]], Europeans conquered, bought, or established African kingdoms and styled themselves as monarchs due to them.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Currently the African nations of [[Morocco]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]] are sovereign monarchies under dynasties that are native to the continent. Places like [[St. Helena]], [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are ruled by the [[Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] or the [[King of Spain]]. So-called "sub-national monarchies" of varying sizes can be found all over the rest of the continent, e.g. the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city-state of [[Akure Kingdom|Akure]] in south-western [[Nigeria]] is something of an elective monarchy: its reigning [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] having to be chosen by an electoral college of nobles, from amongst a finite collection of royal princes of the realm.

[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Elizabeth II]] has been monarch of independent countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and the Americas.]]

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] different titles were used by nobles exercising various degrees of sovereignty within their borders (see below). Such titles were granted or recognised by the Emperor or Pope. Adoption of a new title to indicate sovereign or semi-sovereign status was not always recognized by other governments or nations, sometimes causing [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] problems.

During the nineteenth century many small monarchies in Europe merged with other territories to form larger entities, and following [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], many [[Monarchy abolishment|monarchies were abolished]], but of those remaining all except Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Vatican City and Monaco were headed by a king or queen.

{{As of|2015}} in Europe there are twelve monarchies: seven [[monarchy|kingdom]]s ([[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]), one [[grand duchy]] ([[Luxembourg]]), one [[papacy]] ([[Vatican City]]), and two [[principalities]] ([[Liechtenstein]] and [[Monaco]]), as well as one [[diarchy]] principality ([[Andorra]]).

In China, before the abolition of the monarchy in 1912, the [[Emperor of China]] was traditionally regarded as the ruler of "[[Tianxia|All under heaven]]". "King" is the usual translation for the term ''wang'' 王, the sovereign before the [[Qin dynasty]] and during the [[Ten Kingdoms]] period. During the early [[Han dynasty]], China had a number of kingdoms, each about the size of a [[province]] and subordinate to the Emperor.
In Korea, ''Daewang'' (great king), or ''Wang'' (king), was a Chinese royal style used in many states rising from the dissolution of [[Gojoseon]], [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], [[Silla]] and [[Balhae]], [[Goryeo]], [[Joseon]]. The legendary [[Dangun]] Wanggeom founded the first kingdom, Gojoseon. Some scholars maintain that the term ''Dangun'' also refers to a title used by all rulers of Gojoseon, and that ''Wanggeom'' is the proper name of the founder. ''Gyuwon Sahwa'' (1675) describes The Annals of the Danguns as a collection of nationalistic legends. The monarchs of Goguryeo and some monarchs of Silla used the title "[[Taewang]]", meaning the "Great king". The early monarchs of Silla have used the title of "Geoseogan", "Chachaung", "Isageum", and finally "Maripgan" until 503. The title "Gun" (prince) can refer to the dethroned rulers of Joseon dynasty as well. Under the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910), the rulers of Korea were given the title of "Hwangje", meaning the "Emperor". Today, Members of the Korean Imperial Family continue to participate in numerous traditional ceremonies, and groups exist to preserve Korea's lmperial heritage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The [[Imperial House of Japan|Japanese monarchy]] is now the only monarchy to still use the title of [[Emperor]].

In modern history, between 1925 and 1979, Iran was ruled by two Emperors from the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] that used the title of "Shahanshah" (or "King of Kings"). The last Iranian Shahanshah was King [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], who was forced to abdicate the throne as a result of a revolution in Iran. In fact Persian (Iranian) kingdom goes back to about 2,700 BC (see [[Kings of iran#Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC)|List of Kings of Persia]]), but reached its ultimate height and glory when King [[Cyrus the Great]] (Known as "The Great Kourosh" in Iran) started the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid dynasty]], and under his rule, the [[empire]] embraced all the previous civilized states of [[Ancient Near East|the ancient Near East]], expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of [[Southwest Asia]] and much of [[Central Asia]] and the Caucasus. From the [[Mediterranean sea]] and [[Hellespont]] in the west to the [[Indus River]] in the east, Cyrus the Great created the largest empire the world had yet seen.

[[Thailand]] and Bhutan are like the United Kingdom in that they are constitutional monarchies ruled by a King. [[Jordan]] and many other Middle Eastern monarchies are ruled by a [[Malik]] and parts of the [[United Arab Emirates]], such as [[Dubai]], are still ruled by monarchs.

[[Saudi Arabia]] is the largest Arab state in Western Asia by land area and the second-largest in the Arab world (after Algeria). It was founded by [[Ibn Saud|Abdul-Aziz bin Saud]] in 1932, although the conquests which eventually led to the creation of the Kingdom began in 1902 when he captured [[Riyadh]], the ancestral home of his family, the [[House of Saud]]; succession to the throne was limited to sons of Ibn Saud until 2015, when [[Muhammad bin Nayef|a grandson]] was elevated to Crown Prince. The Saudi Arabian government has been an absolute monarchy since its inception, and designates itself as [[Islamic]]. The King bears the title "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques" in reference to the two holiest places in Islam: [[Masjid al-Haram]] in [[Mecca]], and [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] in [[Medina]].

[[Oman]] is led by Monarch Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said Al Said]]. The [[Kingdom of Jordan]] is one of the [[Middle East]]'s more modern monarchies is also ruled by a [[Malik]]. In Arab and arabized countries, [[Malik]] (absolute King) is absolute word to render a monarch and is superior to all other titles. [[Nepal]] abolished their monarchy in 2008. [[Sri Lanka]] had a complex system of monarchies from 543BC to 1815. Between 47BC-42BC Anula of Sri Lanka became the country's first female head of state as well as Asia's first head of state.{{dubious|date=September 2010}}

In [[Malaysia]]'s constitutional monarchy, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (The Supreme Lord of the Federation) is ''de facto'' rotated every five years among the nine Rulers of the Malay states of Malaysia (those nine of the thirteen states of Malaysia that have hereditary royal rulers), elected by ''Majlis Raja-Raja'' ([[Conference of Rulers]]).

Under [[Brunei]]'s 1959 constitution, the [[Sultan of Brunei]] is the head of state with full executive authority, including emergency powers, since 1962. The Prime Minister of Brunei is a title held by the Sultan. As the prime minister, the Sultan presides over the cabinet.

[[Cambodia]] has been a kingdom since the 1st century. The power of the absolute monarchy was reduced when it became the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia]] from 1863 to 1953. It returned to an absolute monarchy from 1953 until the establishment of a republic following the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]]. The monarchy was restored as a constitutional monarchy in 1993 with the king as a largely symbolic figurehead.

In the [[Philippines]], the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|pre-Colonial]] [[Filipino people|Filipino]] nobility, variously titled the ''harì'' (today meaning "king"), ''[[Lakan]]'', ''[[Raja]]'' and ''[[Datu]]'' belonged to the caste called ''Uring [[Maharlika]]'' (Noble Class). When the islands [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|were annexed]] to the [[Spanish Empire]] in the late 16th century, the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarch]] became the sovereign while local rulers often retained their prestige as part of the [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianised]] nobility called the ''[[Principalía]]''. After the [[Spanish–American War]], the country was ceded to the United States of America and made into a territory and eventually a [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]], thus ending monarchism. While the Philippines is currently a republic, the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]] and [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Sultan of Maguindanao]] retain their titles only for ceremonial purposes, but are considered ordinary citizens by the [[1987 Constitution]]. [[Bhutan]] has been an independent kingdom since 1907. The first [[Druk Gyalpo]] (''Dragon King'') was elected and thereafter became a hereditary absolute monarchy. It became a constitutional monarchy in 2008.

[[Tibet]] was a monarchy since the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the 6th century. It was ruled by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] following the Mongol invasion in the 13th century and became an effective [[diarchy]] with the [[Dalai Lama]] as co-ruler. It came under the rule of the Chinese [[Qing Dynasty]] from 1724 until 1912 when it gained de facto independence. The [[Dalai Lama]] became absolute temporal monarch until [[incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China]] in 1951.

[[Nepal]] was a monarchy for most of its history until becoming a federal republic in 2008.

The concept of monarchy existed in the Americas long before the arrival of European colonialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html Canada: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219053336/http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html |date=2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/switchboard/article.jsp?content=20031027_68038_68038 Ferguson, Will; ''The Lost Kingdom''; ''Macleans'', October 27, 2003] {{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Europeans arrived they referred to these tracts of land within territories of different aboriginal groups to be kingdoms, and the leaders of these groups were often referred to by the Europeans as Kings, particularly hereditary leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/4Chiefs.html The Four Indian Kings]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-colonial titles that were used included:
* [[Cacique]] – Aboriginal [[Hispaniola]] and [[Borinquen]]
* [[Tlatoani]] – [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]s
* [[Ajaw]] – [[Maya civilization|Maya]]
* [[Qhapaq Inka]] – [[Inca Empire|Tawuantin Suyu]] (Inca Empire)
* Morubixaba – [[Tupi people|Tupi]] tribes
* Sha-quan – King of the world used in some Native American tribes

The first local monarch to emerge in North America after colonization was [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who declared himself [[First Haitian Empire|Emperor of Haiti]] on September 22, 1804. Haiti again had an emperor, [[Faustin I of Haiti| Faustin I]] from 1849 to 1859. In South America, Brazil&lt;ref&gt;L Gomes. 1889: como um imperador cansado, um marechal vaidoso e um professor injustiçado contribuíram para a o fim da monarquia e programação da republica no Brasil. Globo Livros. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; had a royal house ruling as emperor between 1822 and 1889, under Emperors [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]].

Between 1931 and 1983 nine other previous British colonies attained independence as kingdoms. All, including Canada, are in a [[personal union]] relationship under a shared monarch. Therefore, though today there are legally ten American monarchs, one person occupies each distinct position.

In addition to these sovereign states, there are also a number of sub-national ones. In [[Bolivia]], for example, the [[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|Afro-Bolivian king]] claims descent from an African dynasty that was taken from its homeland and sold into slavery. Though largely a ceremonial title today, the position of ''king of the Afro-Bolivians'' is officially recognized by the government of Bolivia.

[[Polynesia]]n societies were ruled by an ''[[ariki]]'' from ancient times. The title is variously translated as "supreme chief", "paramount chief" or "king".

The [[Kingdom of Tahiti]] was founded in 1788. Sovereignty was ceded to [[France]] in 1880 although descendants of the [[Pōmare Dynasty]] claim the title of King of Tahiti.

The [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was established in 1795 and overthrown in 1893.

An independent [[Kingdom of Rarotonga]] was established in 1858. It became a protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] at its own request in 1893.

[[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] ruled the short lived [[Kingdom of Fiji]], a constitutional monarchy, from 1871 to 1874 when he voluntarily ceded sovereignty of the islands to the [[United Kingdom]]. After independence in 1970, the [[Dominion of Fiji]] retained the British monarch as head of state until it became a republic following a [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|military coup in 1987]].

[[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] (including the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]), [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Tuvalu]] are sovereign states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that currently have [[Elizabeth II]] as their reigning constitutional monarch.

The [[Pitcairn Islands]] are part of the [[British Overseas Territories]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as the reigning constitutional monarch.

[[Tonga]] is the only remaining sovereign kingdom in Oceania. It has had a monarch since the 10th century and became a constitutional monarchy in 1875. In 2008, King [[George Tupou V]] relinquished most of the powers of the monarchy and the position is now largely ceremonial.

In [[New Zealand]] the position of [[Māori King Movement|Māori King]] was established in 1858. The role is largely cultural and ceremonial, and has no legal power.

[[Wallis Island|Uvea]], [[Alo (Wallis and Futuna)|Alo]] and [[Sigave]] in the [[France|French]] territory of [[Wallis and Futuna]] have non-sovereign elective monarchs.

==Titles and precedence in Europe==
{{For|commonly used names for specific monarchs|List of monarchs by nickname}}

The usage and meaning of a monarch's specific title has historically been defined by tradition, law and diplomatic considerations.

Note that some titles borne by monarchs have several meanings and may not exclusively designate a monarch. A [[Prince]] may be a [[prince du sang|person of royal blood]] (some languages uphold this distinction, see [[Fürst]]). A [[Duke]] may belong to a [[peerage]] and hold a dukedom (title) but no duchy (territory). In [[Imperial Russia]], a [[Grand Duke]] was a son or patrilineal grandson of the [[Tsar]] or [[Tsarina]]. Holders of titles in these alternative meanings did not enjoy the same status as monarchs of the same title.

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], there were numerous titles used by noblemen whose authority within their territory sometimes approached [[sovereignty]], even though they acknowledged the Holy Roman Emperor as [[suzerain]]; [[Prince-elector|Elector]], [[Grand Duke]], [[Margrave]], [[Landgrave]] and [[Count Palatine]], as well as secular princes like kings, dukes, princes and "princely counts" (''Gefürstete Grafen''), and ecclesiastical princes like Prince-Archbishops, [[Prince-bishop|Prince-Bishops]] and Prince-Abbots. A ruler with a title below emperor or king might still be regarded as a monarch, outranking a nobleman of the same ostensible title (e.g., [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]], a reigning sovereign, and his younger brother, [[Claude, Duke of Guise]], a nobleman in the [[peerage of France]]).

The table below lists titles in approximate [[order of precedence]]. According to [[protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] any holder of a title indicating sovereignty took precedence over any non-sovereign titleholder.

|[[Papacy]]
|Successor of St. Peter, Bishop of Rome, Head of the Roman Catholic Church, Monarch of the [[Papal States]] and later Sovereign of the State of [[Vatican City]]. As senior ruler in Medieval Christendom, the Pope held precedence over all other titles and offices. The Papacy is a celibate office always forbidden to women; in English however, reports of female popes such as ([[Pope Joan]]) refer to them as ''pope'' and ''[[Popess]]''; the term is used, among other things, for the second trump in the [[Tarot]] deck''; some European languages also have a feminine form of the word pope, such as the Italian ''papessa'', the French ''papesse'', the Portuguese ''papisa'' and the German ''Päpstin''.

==Use of titles by non-sovereigns==
It is not uncommon that people who are not generally seen as monarchs nevertheless use monarchical titles. There are at least five cases of this:
* Claiming an existing title, challenging the current holder. This has been very common historically. For centuries, the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] used, among his other titles, the title [[King of France]], despite the fact that he had had no authority over mainland French territory since the sixteenth century. Other cases include the numerous [[antipope]]s who have claimed the [[Holy See]].
* Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy. This can be coupled with a claim that the monarchy was in fact never, or should never have been, extinct. An example of the first case is the [[Seborga|Prince of Seborga]]. Examples of the second case are several [[List of monarchs who lost their thrones or abdicated in the 20th century|deposed monarchs]] or otherwise [[pretender|pretenders to thrones of abolished monarchies]], e.g., [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1982)|Leka, Crown Prince of Albania]] who is styled by some as the "King of The Albanians". Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy can, however, be totally free of claims of sovereignty, for example it was customary in numerous European monarchies to include "King of Jerusalem" in their full titles. When it comes to deposed monarchs, it is customary to continue the usage of their monarchical title (e.g., [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II, King of the Hellenes]]) as a [[courtesy title]], not a constitutional position, for the duration of their lifetime. However the title then dies with them and is not used by subsequent heirs or claimants unless the crown is restored constitutionally. Monarchs who have ''freely'' [[abdicate]]d are sometimes addressed by a lesser style (although, see [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] and [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. However, where a monarch abdicated under duress (e.g., [[Michael I of Romania]]), it is usual (especially outside their former realm) to continue to use their monarchical style for their lifetime as a traditional courtesy.
* Inventing a new title. This is common among founders of [[micronation]]s, and also may or may not come with a claim of sovereignty, not usually recognised abroad. A notable example is [[Paddy Roy Bates]], styling himself the "Prince of Sealand", but not recognized as such by any national government, thus failing at least the [[constitutive theory of statehood|constitutive condition for statehood]] (see [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] for a fuller discussion of his claims). Another known example is that of [[Emperor Norton|Norton I]], who invented the title "Emperor of the United States of America" and later declared himself "Protector of Mexico".
* Usage of a monarchical title by a fictional character. This is common in [[fairy tale]]s and other works geared to children, as well as works of [[fantasy]]. Examples include [[Princess Leia]] and [[Princess Summerfall Winterspring]].
* [[Honorific nicknames in popular music]] and other aspects of popular culture, such as "King of Rock and Roll", [[Count Basie]] or [[Emperor Norton]].

[[Multilingualism]] is a part of everyday life for the population of [[Luxembourg]]. Legally and socially, different sectors of Luxembourg use [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], which is a variety of [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]] with a large number of loanwords from French. Additionally, most citizens learn [[English language|English]] and may study other languages as well. A substantial immigrant population has brought numerous [[immigrant language]]s to the small state, notably [[Portuguese Luxembourger|Portuguese, which is spoken by more than one-fifth of the population]]. However, the different languages are used in different social situations.

==Official languages==
The use of languages for legal and administrative purposes is regulated by a law promulgated in 1984, including the following provisions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} ''Mémorial A'' no. 16 (27 February 1984), pp. 196–197: [http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1984/0162702/index.html "Loi du 24 février 1984 sur le régime des langues".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 1: The national language of the Luxembourgers is [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]].&lt;br&gt;
Article 2: The laws are in [[French language|French]].&lt;br&gt;
Article 3: The language of the government: Luxembourgish, [[German language|German]] and French can be used.&lt;br&gt;
Article 4: Administrative questions: If a citizen asks a question in Luxembourgish, German or French, the administration must reply, as far as possible, in the language in which the question was asked.

In many other multilingual countries, such as [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Canada]], the distribution of the languages is geographic, but in Luxembourg it is functional—that is, the choice of language depends on the situation.

==Education==
At school, all students are taught in all three official languages, although divided by age group and subject matter.  At [[primary school]], the courses are taught in German and explanations are often given in Luxembourgish.  In general, at [[secondary school]], up until the 9th grade, every subject is taught in German, except for mathematics and sciences (which are taught in French). From 10th to 13th grade, the language use depends on what level the students are in: In the more difficult level, as well as at the commerce and administrative division, the courses are mostly in French, but throughout the whole of secondary school, explanations are often given in Luxembourgish. The easier level on the other hand tends not to switch to French.

==Government==
Government websites are primarily written in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gouvernement.lu/|title=gouvernement.lu - Accueil|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gouvernement.lu|language=fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/fr/index.html|title=Luxembourg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; also there are parts are written for foreigners in other languages such as English &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/index.html|title=Luxembourg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/de/index.html|title=Luxemburg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Luxembourg's parliament the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], [[Bill (law)|bills]] are first written in German. Then the language of debate is in Luxembourgish, but sometimes also in French (e.g., when laws are cited). Laws are voted and codified in French. The country's head of state, the [[Monarchy of Luxembourg|Grand-Duke]]'s website is in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/index.html|title=Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - Accueil|website=www.monarchie.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; however his personal Christmas speech is done in Luxembourgish &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tele.rtl.lu/emissiounen/de-journal/3026611.html|title=RTL - de Journal - Chrëschtusprooch vum Grand-Duc|last=|first=|date=2014-12-24|website=RTL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(although a French translation is provided &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/actualites/discours/2014/12/discours-noel-fr/index.html|title=Discours de Noël prononcé par S.A.R. le Grand-Duc (version FR) - Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - Décembre 2014|website=www.monarchie.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;).''

==Mass media==
In the written press, most newspapers such as ''[[Tageblatt]]'' and ''[[Lëtzebuerger Journal]]'' are in German, while there are a few such as [[Le Quotidien (newspaper)|''Le Quotidien'']] that are in French.  On the other hand, the newspaper of record [[Luxemburger Wort|''Luxemburger Wort'']] is trilingual with most articles written in German, but also sometimes written in French and Luxembourgish, often on the same page.

On TV and on the radio, Luxembourgish is mainly used, for example the main news programme [[RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg|RTL]]'s ''de Journal''. Spoken Luxembourgish used in news broadcasts tends to be strongly influenced by standard German in pronunciation and idiom.&lt;ref name="textual"&gt;Fernand Hoffman, "Textual varieties of Lëtzebuergesch", in Newton, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Radio broadcasters are under pressure to translate news releases sourced from German press agencies in real time and have no special training in the prose style of Luxembourgish. As a result, news tends to be superficially translated into Luxembourgish. Syntax mostly follows standard German and many words and idioms from standard German appear unmodified.&lt;ref name="textual" /&gt; Phonology is also affected with the resulting use of intonation phrases alien to Luxembourgish.&lt;ref name="developments"&gt;Fernand Hoffman, "Lëtzebuergesch, spoken and written, developments and desirabilities", in Newton, pp. 114 - 118&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advertising ===
In terms of [[advertising]], which language is used depends on three factors; media, audience and origin. In written advertisements like [[billboard]]s, newspaper and magazine adverts, [[Mail order|catalogues]] and posters, the usual language of communication is French. On occasion to give a local flavour, it is written in part in Luxembourgish. [[Signage|Public signage]] is usually in French, with occasional markings in Luxembourgish, German and/or English.

For [[Advertisement film|television commercials]] broadcasting on RTL, if the advert is for an international product or service like a car or a television, it is entirely in French. However, if it is a domestic product or service like for example like [[:lb:Sources Rosport|Rosport]] mineral water or [[Luxair]], the spoken language is in Luxembourgish with the taglines in French, or less frequently in Luxembourgish or English. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sources Rosport|title=Rosport mat: Introducing Zitroun|date=2018-04-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUmr8BBcUM|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Luxair Luxembourg Airlines|title=Luxair commercial from 1982|date=2015-10-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-Y07TZHfyc|language=Luxembourgish and French|accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everyday life==
Generally, in everyday life, when talking to a foreigner, Luxembourgers will attempt to respond in the language they have been addressed in (mainly French, standard German or English). Due to the large number of foreigners in Luxembourg, locals now expect to use foreign languages in daily life, and as far as they are able, will use the foreigner's native language. For example, American students who have learned standard German are often spoken to in English.&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;Jean-Paul Hoffman, "Lëtzebuergesch and its competitors: Language contact in Luxembourg Today" in Newton, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

By custom, French is used in restaurants and brasseries to the point that Luxembourgers assume that the service staff will be French speaking and make no attempt to use Luxembourgish. In rare cases when foreigners attempt to speak  Luxembourgish in these establishments staff will rebuff them in French with ''"{{lang|fr|Qu'est-ce que vous dites?}}"'' ("What do you say?"){{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. In less formal drinking establishments though, Luxembourgish remains normal.&lt;ref name=Hoffman /&gt;

==Written Luxembourgish==

Luxembourgish has a literary tradition that began in the 1820s with the development of serious forms of poetry, followed by drama and eventually narrative prose.&lt;ref name=developments/&gt; However, the average Luxembourger finds Luxembourgish texts difficult to read. Schoolchildren do not read Luxembourgish until the age of 11 or 12. Even then not all teachers adhere to the curriculum requirement to teach written Luxembourgish, some preferring to teach standard German instead, and consequently some students may not be taught written Luxembourgish. As a result, only a minority of literary-minded intellectuals find reading Luxembourgish easy or enjoyable. The majority of Luxembourgers regard their language as a spoken one only.&lt;ref name=developments/&gt;

For private correspondence, language choice tends to reflect social class. Members of the upper middle and upper classes tend to prefer French, although Luxembourgish may be used to convey a sense of close identification with one's nationality. German tends to be viewed negatively among the upper class, with the assumption that anyone writing in German has a poor mastery of French. Despite this, a minority of members of the upper class do prefer standard German when corresponding with close relatives. Use of German becomes more prominent the lower down the social scale one goes, followed by Luxembourgish, with French tending to be the least popular among the lower classes.&lt;ref name=domains&gt;Fernand Hoffman, "The domains of Lëtzebuergesch", in Newton, pp. 134 - 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, for correspondence between people who are related, standard German is preferred, followed by French and Luxembourgish equally, although social status has an influence. When people who are unrelated correspond, use of Luxembourgish drops off dramatically, and it tends not to be used at all between strangers. The choice of Luxembourgish therefore appears to reflect the closeness of the ties between the two people corresponding.&lt;ref name=domains/&gt;

The '''National Institute for Biological Standards and Control''' ('''NIBSC''') is a global leader in the field of biological standardisation. It is a centre of the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)]]. It is responsible for developing and producing over 90% of the biological international standards in use around the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Institute is the UK's [[Official Medicines Control Laboratory]] (OMCL), responsible for independent regulatory testing of biological medicines within the framework of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nibsc.org/about_us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is also host to the UK Stem Cell Bank and a key UK research centre in the field of pandemic flu. It is situated just west of junction 23 of the [[M25 motorway|M25]]. Half of the building is in Ridge and the eastern half is in the parish of [[South Mimms]].

==History==
The NIBSC began work in May 1972. The National Biological Standards Board was formed in 1975 at the NIMR in [[Mill Hill]]. A site was selected and the new £25m building opened in 1987, although it was officially opened in 1988. It has 4,500 square metres of laboratories. NIBSC employs around 300 staff, 200 of whom are scientists.

In February 2008, it featured in a thirty-minute programme on [[BBC Radio 4]] in the ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/secretscience/ Secret Science]'' two-part series (the other programme was about the [[Health Protection Agency]]'s [[Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response]] at [[Porton Down]]).

In April 2009, NIBSC became centre of the UK [[Health Protection Agency|Health Protection Agency (HPA)]]. In April 2013, the NIBSC left the HPA and was merged with the UK’s [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)]].

==Function==
It produces over 90% of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]'s International Standards for substances such as antibiotics, enzymes, [[Antibody|antibodies]] and hormones, and methods such as [[blood transfusion]]s. These standards form a vital part of global health efforts and pharmaceutical research, and over 10,000 standards a month are shipped worldwide. 
It is the UK's Official Medicines Control Laboratory.

==Facilities==
New buildings for the [http://www.ukstemcellbank.org.uk UK Stem Cell Bank] (which has been on the site [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=188865&amp;sectioncode=26 since] May 19, 2004 and was Europe's first stem cell bank) and [http://www.nibsc.org/flu_site/index.html Influenza Resource Centre] were built on the site in a £12m development by [[Morgan Sindall Group|Morgan Ashurst]] and opened in December 2009.

==Research projects==
About 50 full-time researchers are working on projects at NIA.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nianet.org/researchstaff/ listing of researchers]&lt;/ref&gt;

NIA conducts a broad range of scientific and engineering research sponsored by NASA, other government agencies and the aerospace industry. This work is performed by resident scientists and engineers, faculty, students and consultants in principle areas of investigation to include space exploration, systems engineering, materials science, flight systems, aerodynamics, air traffic management, aviation safety, planetary and space science, and global climate change.

Research programs, led by faculty in residence at NIA, serve as the core of the Institute’s academic research program. Through NIA’s University Research Program, faculty and students at NIA member universities collaborate with NASA research leaders in fundamental investigations in aerospace, mechanical, electrical, and systems engineering; materials science; applied mathematics, meteorology and other related fields.

NIA also collaborate with other research institutions worldwide, including universities, government laboratories, industry and other non-profit institutes to accomplish its research objectives. NIA conducts applied research with and for the aerospace industry. Through NIA, industrial partners can gain access to LaRC personnel, facilities and intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIA Research|url=http://nianet.org/resources/Research.aspx|publisher=nianet.org|accessdate=9 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714064943/http://nianet.org/resources/Research.aspx|archivedate=14 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research projects include:

*Boron nitride nano tubes (BNNT) research and development for aerospace and public safety applications. In collaboration with NASA Langley, and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, NIA has developed a neutron shielding material  using boron-containing nanomaterials, which include boron nanoparticles, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), and boron nitride nano-platelets, as well as the polymer composites thereof. This is proposed for advanced radiation shielding and for shielding against high kinetic energy penetrators (i.e. bulletproof vests, protection against micrometeoroids, etc.)&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://technologygateway.nasa.gov/docs/TOA_LARC107_Radiation4.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Field research in the Republic of Tyva in Siberia to validate satellite studies that show longer periods of drought have strengthened the intensity of fires. Amber Soja, NIA Senior Research Scientist based at NASA’s Langley Researcher Center, conducted research that has shown that these more destructive fires have started to impair the growth of pine-dominated forests after fires and are causing some pine forest areas to transition to steppe that stores far less carbon from the atmosphere.  Likewise, the research shows that the burns cause more destruction when they occur. According to Soja, in other areas where precipitation is limited to begin with, such as the savannas of Australia, longer droughts might actually reduce the number of wildfires because less vegetation would be available to burn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voiland|first=Adam|title=A Look Back at a Decade of Fires|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/fires/main/modis-10.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
NIA's graduate program offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the fields of aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, engineering mechanics, engineering physics, materials science and engineering, electrical engineering, ocean engineering and systems engineering. Degrees are issued through its university partners: Georgia Tech, Hampton University, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, North Carolina State University, the University of Maryland, the University of Virginia, Virginia Tech, Old Dominion University, and the College of William &amp; Mary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24939">The '''Older Dryas''' was a [[stadial]] (cold) period between the [[Bølling oscillation|Bølling]] and [[Allerød oscillation|Allerød]] [[interstadial]]s (warmer phases), about 14,000 years [[Before Present]]), towards the end of the [[Pleistocene]]. Its date is not well defined, with estimates varying by 400 years, but its duration is agreed to have been around 200 years.

The gradual warming since the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (27,000 to 24,000 years BP) has been interrupted by two cold spells: the Older Dryas and the [[Younger Dryas]] (c. 12,900-11,650 BP). In northern [[Scotland]], the glaciers were thicker and deeper during the Older Dryas than the succeeding Younger Dryas, and there is no evidence of human occupation of [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Palaeolithic: Human Societies at the Edge of the Pleistocene World|first1=Paul|last1=Pettit|first2=Mark|last2=White|pages=374 477|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|location=Abingdon, UK|isbn=978-0-415-67455-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northwestern Europe]] was also an earlier [[Oldest Dryas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Allaby|title=Oxford Dictionary of Geology &amp; Earth Sciences|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=181|year=2013|edition=4th|isbn=978-0-19-965306-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dryas are named after an indicator genus, the Arctic and Alpine plant [[Dryas (plant)|Dryas]], the remains of which are found in higher concentrations in deposits from colder periods.

The Older Dryas was a variable cold, dry [[Blytt-Sernander]] period, observed in climatological evidence in only some regions, depending on latitude. In regions in which it is not observed, the Bølling-Allerød is considered a single interstadial period. Evidence of the Older Dryas is strongest in northern Eurasia, particularly part of Northern [[Prehistoric Europe|Europe]], roughly equivalent to [[Pollen zone]] Ic.

==Dates==
In the [[Greenland]] oxygen isotope record, the Older Dryas appears as a downward peak establishing a small, low-intensity gap between the Bølling and the Allerød. That configuration presents a difficulty in estimating its time, as it is more of a point than a segment. The segment is small enough to escape the resolution of most carbon-14 series, as the points are not close enough together to find the segment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12433.full Perry, Charles A., Hsu, Kenneth A.; Geophysical, archaeological, and historical evidence support a solar-output model for climate change]. Section: Model Timeline Calibration, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach to the problem assigns a point and then picks an arbitrary segment. The Older Dryas is sometimes considered to be "centered" near 14,100 BP or to be 100 to 150 years long "at" 14,250 BP.

A second approach finds carbon-14 or other dates as close to the end of the Bølling and the beginning of the Allerød as possible and then selects endpoints that based on them: for example, 14,000-13,700 BP.

The best approach attempts to include the Older Dryas in a sequence of points as close together as possible (high resolution) or within a known event.

For example, pollen from the island of [[Hokkaidō]], [[Japan]], records a [[Larix]] pollen peak and matching [[sphagnum]] decline at 14,600-13700 BP. In the [[White Sea]], a cooling occurred at 14,700-13,400/13,000, which resulted in a re-advance of the glacier in the initial Allerød. In [[Canada]], the [[Shulie Lake]] phase, a re-advance, is dated to 14,000-13,500 BP. On the other hand, [[varve]] chronology in southern [[Sweden]] indicates a range of 14,050-13,900 BP.&lt;ref&gt;Edwige Pons-Branchu, Climatic control on speleothems growth. High precision U/Th dating of speleothems from South and East of France.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capturing the Older Dryas by high resolution continues to be of interest to climatologists.

==Description==
[[Northern Europe]] offered an alternation of [[steppe]] and [[tundra]] environments depending on the [[permafrost]] line and the [[latitude]]. In moister regions, around lakes and streams, were thickets of [[dwarf birch]], [[willow]], [[sea buckthorn]], and [[juniper]]. In the river valleys and uplands, to the south, were open [[birch]] forests.

The first trees, birch and [[pine]], had spread into Northern Europe 500 years earlier. During the Older Dryas, the glacier re-advanced, and the trees retreated southward, to be replaced by a mixture of grassland and cool-weather alpine species. The [[biome]] has been called "[[Park Tundra]]," "Arctic tundra," "Arctic pioneer vegetation," or “birch woodlands." It is now in the transition between [[taiga]] and [[tundra]] in [[Siberia]]. Then, it stretched from Siberia to [[Great Britain]], in a more-or-less unbroken expanse.

To the northwest was the [[Baltic ice lake]], which was truncated by the edge of the glacier. Species had access to [[Denmark]] and southern Sweden. Most of [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic countries]] were under the ice or the lake for most of the period. Northern [[Scandinavia]] was glaciated. Between Britain and the [[Continental Europe]] were rolling hills prolifically populated with animals. Thousands of specimens, hundreds of tons of bones, have been recovered from the bottom of the [[North Sea]], called "[[Doggerland]]," and they continue to be recovered.

There are many more species found for the period than in this article. Most families were more diverse than they are today, and they were yet more so in the last interglacial. A great [[extinction]], especially of mammals, continued throughout the end of the [[Pleistocene]], and it may be continuing today.

== Evidence ==
The Older Dryas is a period of cooling during the [[Bølling-Allerød warming]], estimated to be from 13,900 to 13,600 years before present (BP),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klitgaard-Kristensen|first=Dorthe|last2=Sejrup|first2=H. P.|last3=Haflidason|first3=H.|date=2001|title=The last 18 kyr fluctuations in Norwegian sea surface conditions and implications for the magnitude of climatic change: Evidence from the North Sea|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/1999PA000495|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=16 |issue=5|pages=455–467|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the estimated ages can vary using different age dating methods. Numerous studies on chronology and palaeoclimate of last deglaciation show a cooling event within [[Bølling-Allerød warming]] that reflects the occurrence of Older Dryas. The determination of paleotemperatures varies from study to study depending on the sample collected. [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup href="interstadial"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] measurements are most common when analyzing Ice core samples whereas the changing abundance pattern of fauna and flora are most commonly used when examining lake sediments. Moraine belts are usually studied in places with palaeoglacier presented.

=== Lake sediment evidence ===
A multi-proxy study on late glacial lake sediments of Moervaart palaeolake shows multiple pieces of evidence in various aspects to support Older Dryas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bos|first=J. A.|date=2017|others=et al.|title=Multiple oscillations during the Lateglacial as recorded in a multi-proxy, high-resolution record of the Moervaart palaeolake (NW Belgium)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379117300148|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=162|pages=|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake sediment had an erosional surface prior to Older Dryas suggesting a change to colder climate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Microstructure observation of the sediments shows that fossil soil wedges or frost cracks were observed in the top of Older Dryas deposits,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which indicates mean annual air temperatures below -1 to 0 ℃ and cold winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maarleveld|first=G.C.|date=1976|title=Periglacial phenomena and the mean annual temperature during the last glacial time in The Netherlands|url=|journal=Biuletyn Peryglacjalny|volume=26|pages=57–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion is also supported by the presence of ''[[Juniper]]us'', which indicates a protecting snow cover in winter. This change is also shown on the records at the Rieme sites on the Great SandRidge of Maldegem-Stekene&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bos|first=J. A.|date=2013|title=The influence of environmental changes on local and regional vegetation patterns at Rieme (NW Belgium): implications for Final Palaeolithic habitation|url=|journal=Veget. Hist. Archaeobot.|volume=22|pages=17–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Snellegem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denys|first=L.|date=1991|title=Palaeolimnological aspects of a late-glacial shallow lake in sandy Flanders.|url=|journal=Hydrobiologia|volume=214|pages=273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in NW Belgium, and many other sites in north-western Europe.

[[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] measurements show a decreasing trend in [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup href="Greenland"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] at the transition to the Older Dryas, which corresponds to the ice core record of precipitation in the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Pollen analysis shows a temporary decrease in the pollen levels of trees and shrubs with a short-term increase of herbaceous pollen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The changed pollen pattern suggests an increased abundance of grass as well as a retreat of tree and shrubs. The change of vegetation distribution further indicates a colder and drier climate during this period. As for aquatic plant evidence, both aquatic and semi-aquatic botanical taxa show a sharp decrease, suggesting lower lake levels caused by drier climate. The drier climate is also reflected by increased salinity indicated by diatom analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The change of Chironomids population also indicates a colder climate. ''Microtendipes'' is an indicator of intermediate temperature in Late glacial deposits in northern Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Stephen J.|last2=Birks|first2=H.J.B|date=2001|title=Chironomid-inferred air temperatures from Lateglacial and Holocene sites in north-west Europe: Progress and problems|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0277-3791(01)00038-5|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=20|issue=16-17|pages=1723–1741|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Brooks and Birks, 2001).  The abundance of ''Microtendipes'' peaked in the early part of Older Dryas suggesting a cold oscillation. The mollusc data (''[[Valvata piscinalis]]'' as a cold-water indicator) suggests a lower summer temperature comparing to previous Bølling period.

=== Ocean sediment evidence ===
Recent research on sea surface temperature (SST) for the past 15,000 years in southern Okinawa modelled the Paleoclimate of ocean sediment core (ODP 1202B) using an alkenone analysis.&lt;ref name="ruan" /&gt; The results show a cooing stage at 14,300 to 13,700 years BP between [[Bølling-Allerød warming|Bølling and Allerød warm phases]], corresponding to the Older Dryas event.&lt;ref name="ruan" /&gt;

Another study on an ocean sediment core from Norwegian Trench also suggests a cooling between Bølling and Allerød warm phases.

=== Moraine evidence ===
The study on late-glacial climate change in White Mountains (New Hampshire, USA) refined the deglaciation history of White Mountain Moraine System (WMMS) by mapping moraine belts and related lake sequences.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Woodrow B.|last2=Dorion|first2=Christopher C.|last3=Ridge|first3=John C.|last4=Balco|first4=Greg|last5=Fowler|first5=Brian K.|last6=Svendsen|first6=Kristen M.|date=Jan 2017|title=Deglaciation and late-glacial climate change in the White Mountains, New Hampshire, USA|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research/article/div-classtitledeglaciation-and-late-glacial-climate-change-in-the-white-mountains-new-hampshire-usadiv/DE8663330CE11C8484FAA0C6DD29DDD1|journal=Quaternary Research|language=en|volume=87|issue=1|pages=96–120|doi=10.1017/qua.2016.4|issn=0033-5894|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result suggests that the Littleton-Bethlehem (L-B) readvance of ice sheet occurred between 14,000 to 13,800 years BP. The L-B readvance coincided with the Older Dryas events and provides the first well-documented and dated evidence of Older Dryas.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Another Glacial chronology and palaeoclimate study on moraine suggests a cold oscillation in the second late-glacial (LG2) following the first late-glacial readvance (LG1) at around 14,000±700 to 13,700±1200 years BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makos|first=M|last2=Rinterknecht,V.; Braucher, R.; Żarnowski, M.; Team, A.|date=2016-02-15|title=Glacial chronology and palaeoclimate in the Bystra catchment, Western Tatra Mountains (Poland) during the Late Pleistocene|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379116300063|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|language=en|volume=134|pages=74–91|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.01.004|issn=0277-3791|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LG2 cold oscillation around 14,000 years BP can correspond to the cooling of Greenland Interstadial 1 (GI-1d-Older Dryas)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; that happened around the same time period, which is the first chronological evidence that supports the presence of Older Dryas in the Tatra Mountains.

==Flora==
Older Dryas species are usually found in sediment below the bottom layer of the bog. Indicator species are the Alpine plants:
:*''[[Betula pubescens]]'' or downy birch (Central Europe);
:*''[[Pinaceae]]'' or pine family (Poland);
:*''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', or dryas;
:*''[[Salix herbacea]]'', or dwarf willow;
:*''[[Oxyria digyna]]'', or mountain sorrel.

Grasslands species are the following: 
:*''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]'', sagebrush or wormwood;
:*''[[Ephedra]]'', or joint-fir.
:*''[[Hippophae]]''

==Fauna==
A well-stocked biozone prevailed on the Arctic plains and thickets of the Late Pleistocene. Plains mammals were most predominant:

[[Even-toed ungulate|Artiodactyls]]:
:*''[[Bison priscus]]'', the steppe wisent or steppe bison 
:*''[[Reindeer|Rangifer tarandus]]'', the reindeer or caribou
:*''[[Irish elk|Megaloceros giganteus]]'', the Irish elk
:*''[[Moose|Alces alces]]'', the elk
:*''[[Red deer|Cervus elaphus]]'', the red deer
:*''[[Musk ox|Ovibos moschatus]]'', the musk ox
:*''[[Saiga|Saiga tatarica]]'', the saiga
[[Odd-toed ungulate|Perissodactyls]]:
:*''[[Horse|Equus ferus]]'', the wild horse. Many authors refer to it as ''Equus caballus'', but the latter term is most correctly reserved for the domestic horse. Ferus is presumed to be one or more ancestral or related stocks to caballus and has been described as "caballine".
:*''[[Wooly rhinoceros|Coelodonta antiquitatis]]'', woolly rhinoceros
[[Proboscidea]]:
:*''[[Mammoth|Mammuthus primigenius]]'', the woolly mammoth

So much meat on the hoof must have supported large numbers of [[Carnivora]]:
[[Ursidae]]:
:*''[[Brown bear|Ursus arctos]]'', the brown bear
:*''[[Cave bear|Ursus spelaeus]]'', the cave bear
[[Hyaenidae]]:
:*''[[Hyena|Crocuta crocuta]]'', the spotted hyena
[[Felidae]]:
:*''[[Panthera leo spelaea|Panthera spelaea]]'', the cave lion
[[Canidae]]:
:*''[[Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', the wolf
:*''[[Arctic fox|Alopex lagopus]]'', the Arctic fox
[[Mustelidae]]:
:*''[[Wolverine|Gulo gulo]]'', the wolverine

The sea also had its share of carnivores; their maritime location made them survive until modern times:
[[Phocidae]]:
:*''[[Harp seal|Pagophilus groenlandica]]'', the harp seal
:*''[[Ringed seal|Pusa hispida]]'', the ringed seal
[[Odobenidae]]:
:*''[[Walrus|Odobenus rosmarus]]'', the walrus
Of the [[Cetacea]]n [[Odontoceti]], the [[Monodontidae]]:
:*''[[Beluga (whale)|Delphinapterus leucas]]'', the beluga
[[Delphinidae]]:
:*''[[Orca|Orcinus orca]]'', the killer whale
Of the [[Mysticeti]]an [[Eschrichtiidae]]:
:*''[[Gray whale|Eschrictius robustus]]'', the gray whale

The top of the food chain was supported by larger numbers of smaller animals farther down, which lived in the herbaceous blanket covering the tundra or steppe and helped maintain it by carrying seeds, manuring and aerating it.

[[Leporidae]]:
:*''[[Hare|Lepus tanaiticus]]'', the hare
[[Ochotonidae]]:
:*''[[Pika|Ochotona spelaeus]]'', the pika
[[Cricetidae]]:
:*''[[Lemming|Lemmus obensis]]'', Siberian lemming
:*''[[Lemming|Dicrostonix]]'', collared lemming
:*''[[Steppe lemming|Lagurus lagurus]]'', steppe lemming
:*''[[Microtus|Microtus gregalis]]'', narrow-headed vole
:*''[[European water vole|Arvicola terrestris]]'', water vole
[[Sciuridae]]:
:*''[[Spermophilus]]'', ground squirrel
[[Dipodidae]]:
:*''[[Allactaga|Allactaga jaculus]]'', the jerboa

==Humans==
Eurasia was populated by ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' ([[European early modern humans|Cro-Magnon man]]) during the late [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Bands of humans survived by hunting the mammals of the plains. In [[Northern Europe]] they preferred reindeer, in [[Ukraine]] the [[woolly mammoth]]. They sheltered in huts and manufactured tools around campfires. Ukrainian shelters were supported by mammoth tusks. Humans were already established across [[Siberia]] and in North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palaeolithic.dk/books/JAS_39/excerpt.pdf Eriksen, Berit Valentin; Reconsidering the geochronological framework of Lateglacial hunter-gatherer colonization of southern Scandinavia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two domestic dogs (''[[Canis familiaris]]'') have been found in late Pleistocene Ukraine and were a heavy breed, similar to a [[Great Dane]], perhaps useful to run down [[Elephantidae]]. The large number of mammoth bones at campsites make it clear that even then, the Elephantidae in Europe were approaching the limit of their duration. Their bones were used for many purposes, one being the numerous objects of art, including an engraved star map.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Late Upper Palaeolithic culture was by no means uniform. Many local traditions have been defined. The [[Hamburgian culture]] had occupied the lowlands and Northern Germany before the Older Dryas. During the Older Dryas, contemporaneous with the Havelte Group of the late Hamburgian, the [[Federmesser culture]] appeared and occupied Denmark and southern Sweden, following the reindeer. South of the Hamburgian was the longstanding [[Magdalenian]]. In Ukraine was the Moldovan, which used tusks to build shelters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3346">The '''parallel individuation system''', also called '''object tracking system''' is a non-[[symbol]]ic [[cognition|cognitive]] system that supports the representation of numerical values from zero to three (in [[infant]]s) or four (in adults and non-human animals). It is one of the two cognitive systems responsible for the [[Number sense|representation of number]], the other one being the [[approximate number system]].&lt;ref name="Piazza"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piazza|first=M.|title=Neurocognitive start-up tools for symbolic number representations|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2010|volume=14|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.008|pages=542–551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the approximate number system, which is not precise and provides only an estimation of the number, the parallel individuation system is an exact system and encodes the exact numerical identity of the individual items.&lt;ref name="Hyde"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=D.|title=Two systems of non-symbolic numerical cognition|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|year=2011|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2011.00150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel individuation system has been attested in human adults, non-human animals,&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt; such as fish&lt;ref name= "agrillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|title=Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031923|pages=e31923|pmid=22355405|pmc=3280231}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human infants, although performance of infants is dependent on their age and task.&lt;ref name= "Feigenson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feigenson|first=L|author2=Dehaene S.|author3=Spelke, E.|title=Core systems of number|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2004|volume=8|issue=7|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.05.002|pages=307–314|pmid=15242690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
The evidence for parallel individuation system comes from a number of [[experiment]]s on adults, infants and non-human animals. For example, adults perform error-free when they enumerate elements for numerosities from one to four, after which their error rate rises.&lt;ref name=Feigenson/&gt; Similarly, infants of 10 to 12 months represented the values for "exactly one", "exactly two" and "exactly three", but not for higher numbers, in a task based on hidden object retrieval.&lt;ref name=Feigenson/&gt;

[[Number sense in animals|Parallel individuation system in animals]] was demonstrated in an experiment in which [[guppy|guppies]] were tested on their preference of social groups of different size, under the assumption that they have a preference for bigger size groups. In this experiment, fish successfully discriminated between numbers from 1 to 4 but after this number their performance decreased.&lt;ref name=agrillo/&gt; However, not all studies find confirmation of this system and for example [[Petroicidae|New Zealand robins]] showed no difference in their understanding of small (1 to 4) and larger (above 4) amounts.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Simon|author2=Low, Jason|author3=Burns, K.|title=Adaptive numerical competency in a food-hoarding songbird.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2008|volume=275|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0702|pages=2373–2379|pmc=2603231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pharmaceutical Research Institute (PRI)- Albany''' is an independent, not-for-profit research and development institute for research, pharmaceutical services and education at [[Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences]].

Under the direction of [[Shaker A. Mousa]], Ph.D., formerly a senior researcher at [[DuPont Pharmaceuticals Co]]., PRI-Albany conducts pre-clinical testing and clinical trials to develop drugs for transitioning to industrial manufacture. Through its research capabilities, PRI-Albany endeavors to introduce novel non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of vascular, oncological and neurological disorders.

Experimental research at the Pharmaceutical Research Institute focuses on identifying novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for unmet medical needs, with the initial focus on advancing the development of key concepts for vascular and cardiovascular diseases. In this area, initial research is concentrated on in vitro and in vivo models of angiogenesis, thrombosis and vascular biology. Investigation includes a search for new approaches to modulate angiogenesis in oncology, dermatology and ophthalmology.

An important strategic focus of the Pharmaceutical Research Institute is development of drug formulation and drug delivery units that will facilitate drug development for pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations. These units will function as a resource partner for pharmaceutical and biotech industries operating under the Food and Drug Administration's current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).

During drug discovery and early clinical development, it is essential to have multiple mechanism-related readouts that predict successful clinical outcomes. This segment of research at the Pharmaceutical Research Institute provides key information that will help bridge the gap between experimental and clinical results. Additionally, this segment provides surrogates that are linked to clinical outcomes.

Some activities include identifying potent integrin ligands and other biological targets for therapeutic and diagnostic applications; establishing screening strategy, endothelial cell migration, proliferation, tube information and in vitro neovascularization models; establishing the CAM assay for angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis; screening for anti-platelet and anti-coagulant potency; and collaborating with different groups in search of novel strategies.

'''Philosophical Consultancy''' is a relatively new movement in [[philosophy]] which applies philosophical thinking and debating to the resolution of a person's problem. [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] and Ad Hoogendijk are two, German and Dutch philosophers who established themselves as consultant philosophers in the 1980s (Achenbach 1984, 2002; Hoogendijk 1988) and led the way to a number of other developments all over the world. They proposed an alternative to psychotherapeutic culture by working exclusively within the field of existential investigation with clients or patients, whom they called 'visitors.'

Achenbach argues that it is life that calls to thinking, rather than thinking that informs life. The act of philosophising can, therefore, give direction in its own right, as living precedes thinking and practice precedes theory.

The movement is sometimes referred to as [[philosophical counselling]] and it is also connected with and related to [[Existential Therapy]], which has thrived in the United Kingdom since the establishment of the Society for Existential Analysis (SEA) in London in 1988. This was based on the work of [[Emmy van Deurzen]], also a philosopher who has applied philosophical thinking to the practice of psychotherapy. Philosophical consultancy is often applied to business consultancy as well as to individuals, as it frequently involves a rethinking of values and beliefs and is also a method for rational [[conflict resolution]].

[[Philosophical practice]] has continued to expand and is attractive as an alternative to [[counselling]] and [[psychotherapy]] for those who prefer to avoid a [[medicalization]] of life-problems. Numerous philosophical consultants have emerged and there is a strong international interest and a bi-annual international conference. There are a number of important publications in the field (Lahav and Tillmans 1995, Curnow 2001, Herrestad et al. 2002, Marinoff 1999, Rochelle 2008, 2011).

The '''Plan Zuid''' ("South Plan") is an urban development plan of [[Amsterdam-Zuid|Amsterdam South]] in the city of [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], designed by architect [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.artzuid.nl/en/plan-zuid/ | title=Plan Zuid (1917) | publisher=[http://www.artzuid.nl/en/ artzuid.nl] | accessdate=20 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlage was responsible for the urban concept (1915) and the architects of the [[Amsterdam School]] (partly [[Expressionist architecture|expressionist]] architects) designed the implementation of the plan.

Some years later Berlage was one of the leading architects of a new urban plan in Amsterdam, called [[Plan West (Amsterdam)|Plan West]] (1922-1927). Here Berlage designed the center of Plan West, the architecture of the Mercatorplein (main square), see below.

==First project==

At the beginning of the 20th century, Berlage was asked by the [[Amsterdam]] city council to design a plan for developing the undeveloped area south of the city between the rivers [[Amstel]] and [[Schinkel (river)|Schinkel]]. In 1904, Berlage presented an ambitious plan of winding streets, which was closely joined to the existing city. After research showed that this plan would be very costly and inefficient, Berlage was asked to go back to the drawing board.

==Final project==

Berlage presented a new plan in 1915, with straight narrow streets and long [[urban block|blocks]], intersected by several broad axes. This plan proved much more feasible and efficient. In 1917 the City Council granted approval to the plan. The New South district was built in the style of the [[Amsterdam School]] between 1917 and 1925, consisting of the Stadium District and the Apollo and the Rivers District. A large part of the New Pipe derives from the Plan Zuid.

Berlage's design was only roughly implemented. On the spot where he had planned a teaching hospital, a large housing association designed by [[Michel de Klerk]] and [[Piet Kramer]] called "De Dageraad" (The Dawn) housing complex was built. It was opened in July 1922 by the alderman festive Housing, SR de Miranda.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20122">'''Primary consciousness''' is a term the American biologist [[Gerald Edelman]] coined to describe the ability, found in humans and some animals, to integrate observed events with memory to create an [[awareness]] of the present and immediate past of the world around them. This form of [[consciousness]] is also sometimes called "sensory consciousness". Put another way, primary consciousness is the presence of various [[subjectivity|subjective]] sensory contents of consciousness such as [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s, [[perception]]s, and mental images. For example, primary consciousness includes a person's experience of the blueness of the ocean, a bird's song, and the feeling of pain. Thus, primary consciousness refers to  being mentally aware of things in the world in the present without any sense of past and future; it is composed of mental images bound to a time around the measurable present.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky&gt;Edelman, G. (2004). ''Wider than the sky: The phenomenal gift of consciousness'': Yale Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[secondary consciousness|higher order consciousness]] can be described as being "conscious of being conscious"; it includes reflective thought, a concept of the past, and speculation about the future.

Primary consciousness can be subdivided into two forms, focal [[awareness]] and peripheral awareness. Focal awareness encompasses the center of [[attention]], whereas peripheral awareness consists of things outside the center of attention, which a person or animal is only dimly aware of.&lt;ref name = Johanson&gt;Johanson, M., Revonsuo, A., Chaplin, J., &amp; Wedlund, J.-E. (2003). Level and contents of consciousness in connection with partial epileptic seizures. ''Epilepsy &amp; Behavior'', 4(3), 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
One prominent [[theory]] for the [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] basis of primary consciousness was proposed by Gerald Edelman. This theory of consciousness is premised upon three major assumptions:
# The laws of [[physics]] apply to [[consciousness]], which rules out concepts such as spirits and a soul and allows for a purely [[physiology|physiological]] model of consciousness.
# Consciousness is an evolved characteristic, which means it is a helpful characteristic from a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] perspective.
# There is no such thing as a "[[qualia]]-free" observer. Qualia are collections of personal or subjective experiences, feelings, and sensations that inevitably come with human awareness.&lt;ref name = Edelmantheory/&gt;

Edelman's theory focuses on two [[nervous system]] organizations: the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]]s on one side and the [[thalamus]] and [[cerebral cortex]] on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during [[evolution]] helped animals learn [[adaptive behavior]]s.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt; This connection allows past signals related to values set by the limbic-brain stem system and categorized signals from the outside world to be correlated, resulting in memory in conceptual areas. This memory is then linked to the organism's ''current'' perception, which results in an awareness of the present, or primary consciousness. In other words, Edelman posits that primary consciousness arises from the correlation of ''conceptual'' memory to a set of ''ongoing'' perceptual categorizations—a "remembered present".&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt;

Other scientists have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged with the basic vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from [[sensory neuron|sensors]] and [[sensory receptors|receptors]], both internal and surface, signaling that the well-being of the creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites are the key to consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Merker&gt;Merker, B. (2007). Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 30(01), 63–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuroscientists have believed.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Evidence of this lies in the fact that studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.

==Neurophysiological basis==
Physiologically, three fundamental facts stand out about primary consciousness:&lt;ref name = SethND&gt;Seth, A. K., &amp; Baars, B. J. (2005). Neural Darwinism and consciousness. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 14(1), 140–168.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Waking consciousness is associated with low [[amplitude]], irregular [[EEG]] activity in the 20–70&amp;nbsp;Hz range.
#* Conversely, unconscious states like deep sleep, [[coma]], [[general anesthesia]], and [[epilepsy|epileptic states]] of absence show a predominance of low [[frequency]], high-[[amplitude]] and more regular [[voltage]]s at less than 4Hz.
#Consciousness seems to be intrinsically associated with the thalamus and cortex, even if the extent to which this true is argued among scientists.
#* Damage to the [[brainstem]] or thalamus can abolish consciousness, while damage to the sensory cortex appears to delete specific conscious features such as [[color vision]], visual motion, conscious experiences of objects and faces, and the like.
#Consciousness is distinctively associated with widespread brain activation related to the conscious content.
#*Perhaps two dozen experiments show that sensory input supporting consciousness spreads from the [[sensory cortex]] to [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]], and [[temporal lobe|medial-temporal]] cortex, while closely matched input that does not reach consciousness activates mainly local sensory regions. Further, the widespread activity appears to involve more globally coordinated activity.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;

==Measurement==
To be fully comprehensive, measures of consciousness must not only define and distinguish between [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] states, but must also provide a guide by which the conscious level, or extent of consciousness, can be determined.&lt;ref name = Morin&gt;Morin, A. (2006). Levels of consciousness and self-awareness: A comparison and integration of various neurocognitive views. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 15(2), 358–371.&lt;/ref&gt; Measures of consciousness are each associated with particular theories.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures&gt;Seth, A. K. (2008). Theories and measures of consciousness develop together. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 17(3), 986–988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain defining theories are included below:

'''Worldly discrimination theory''' asserts that any mental state that is manifested in [[behavior]] is conscious; thus, an organism is consciously aware of something in the world if it can discriminate it with choice behavior.
'''Signal detection theory''' quantifies discriminability of a stimulus among a set of different stimuli.
'''Integration theories''' focus on finding a divide between conscious and unconscious processes. According to integration theories, conscious contents are widely available to many [[cognitive]] and/or neural processes.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures2&gt;Seth, A. K., Dienes, Z., Cleeremans, A., Overgaard, M., &amp; Pessoa, L. (2008). Measuring consciousness: relating behavioural and neurophysiological approaches. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 12(8), 314–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are then accompanied with measures of the level of consciousness, which are subdivided into [[behavioral]] measures and [[physiological]] measures.&lt;ref name = Morin/&gt;

===Behavioral measures===

Behavioral measures of primary consciousness can be either objective or subjective. Regarding objective measures, knowledge is unconscious if it expresses itself in an indirect test. For example, the ability to pick which item might come next in a series can indicate unconscious knowledge of regularities in sequences.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt;&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures2 /&gt; "Strategic control measures" use a person's ability to deliberately use or not use knowledge according to instructions. If they use information despite intentions not to use it, it indicates unconscious knowledge.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt; Post-decision wagering can also be used. In this method, subjects make a first-order discrimination (i.e. a choice) and then place a wager regarding the outcome of the discrimination. Some scientists view this as a direct and objective measure of consciousness, and it can be used with children and animals. However, this method has been argued to be subjective and indirect.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt;

===Physiological measures===

[[event-related potential|Event-related cortical potentials (ERPs)]] have been used to assess whether a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] is consciously perceived or not. These [[EEG]] measures either float free of theory, gaining credibility through reliable correlation, or assume a version of integration theory in which the appearance of a particular ERP indicates global availability or locally recurrent processing.&lt;ref name = Sethcomputation&gt;Seth, A. (2009). Explanatory Correlates of Consciousness: Theoretical and Computational Challenges. ''Cognitive Computation'', 1(1), 50–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abundant evidence indicates that consciously perceived inputs elicit widespread brain activation, as compared with inputs that do not reach consciousness.

The '''dynamic core hypothesis (DCH)''' proposes that consciousness arises from neural dynamics in the thalamocortical system, as measured by the quantity '''neural complexity (CN).''' ''CN'' is an information-theoretic measure; the ''CN'' value is high if each subset of a neural system can take on many different states, and if these states make a difference to the rest of the system.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;
The '''information integration theory of consciousness (IITC)''' shares with the DCH the idea that conscious experiences provide informative discriminations among a vast repertoire of possible experiences. In the IITC, the quantity ''phi'' is defined as the information that is integrated across the informational "weakest link" of a system. Importantly, ''phi'' is a measure of the capacity of a neural system to integrate information, whereas ''CN'' is a measure of the actual dynamics of the system. A third measure, '''causal density ''(CD)''''', measures the fraction of causal interactions among elements of a system that are statistically significant.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;

===Challenges in measuring===

It is important to note that subjective measures are always indirect and can be vulnerable to many biases (e.g., reluctance to report uncertain experiences). An|metacognitive]] conscious content assumes primary consciousness but not vice versa, subjective measures risk missing or rejecting the presence of sensory consciousness simply because metacognition isn't observed.&lt;ref name= Morin/&gt;

Furthermore, there is the problem of post-decision wagering, which has been criticized because there is a possibility that advantageous wagering could be learned unconsciously; as a result, post-decision wagering would not in fact be considered a conscious behavior. For example, individual differences in [[risk aversion]] may lead to variations in wagering performance even with the same underlying conscious phenomenology.&lt;ref name= Sethmeasures2/&gt;

Thus, although behavioral measures are mostly used for assessing which contents are conscious, some brain-based measures seem better suited for measuring conscious level. Objective measures also have their challenges, however. First, objective measures still require a response criterion, for example the decision of whether or not to push a button. Second, they may not even measure consciousness at all because many behavioral proxies, such as forced-choice decision accuracy, are capable of being learned unconsciously.&lt;ref name= Edelmansky/&gt;&lt;ref name = Edelman&gt;Edelman, G. (2001). Consciousness: the remembered present. ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 929, 111–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous studies==

===In lucid dreams===

Hobson asserts that the existence of [[lucid dreaming]] means that the human brain can simultaneously occupy two states: waking and dreaming. The dreaming portion has experiences and therefore has primary consciousness, while the waking self recognizes the dreaming and can be seen as having a sort of [[secondary consciousness]] in the sense that there is an awareness of mental state. Studies have been able to show that lucid dreaming is associated with EEG power and coherence profiles that are significantly different from both non-lucid dreaming and waking.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt; Lucid dreaming situates itself between those two states. Lucid dreaming is characterized by more 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power than non-lucid dreaming, especially in frontal regions. Since it is 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power that has been correlated with waking consciousness in previous studies, it can be suggested that enough 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power has been added to the non-lucid dreaming brain to support the increase in subjective [[awareness]] that permits lucidity but not enough to cause full awakening.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt;

Dreaming is thus a [[virtual reality]] experience with a remarkably predictive simulation of external reality. Lucid dreamers may experience primary consciousness (the dream) and secondary consciousness (the waking) separately but simultaneously. Moreover, primary consciousness has recently been proposed by us to be characteristic of dreaming. It remains to be seen whether the enactment of dream behaviors uses the same brain processes as those that mediate those very behaviors in waking, and whether conscious within a dream is governed by the same processes.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt;

===In epileptic seizures===

Studies show that it is possible to retain primary consciousness and even [[secondary consciousness]] during [[complex partial seizure|complex partial epileptic seizures]]. One study analyzed 40 patients with complex partial seizures to determine their level of consciousness during seizures. The data acquired was based on patients' subjective descriptions of their experience and descriptions from family members who witnessed the seizures.&lt;ref name = Johanson/&gt; This study found there was a complete absence of consciousness in only 65% of people during the core period of the seizures. Meanwhile, 35% of seizures included some form of primary consciousness. Five seizure descriptions even reported some form of secondary consciousness, albeit short and intermittent. The level and contents of consciousness during epileptic seizures show considerable variability.&lt;ref name= Johanson/&gt;

===In thirst===

In one study, 10 adult males underwent [[positron emission tomography]] scans in three different scenarios:&lt;ref name=Denton&gt;Denton, D., Shade, R., Zamarippa, F., Egan, G., Blair-West, J., McKinley, M., et al. (1999). Neuroimaging of genesis and satiation of thirst and an interoceptor-driven theory of origins of primary consciousness. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', 96(9), 5304.&lt;/ref&gt;
# During generation of moderate thirst by infusion of [[intravenous]] [[hypertonic]] saline 0.51 M
# After wetting of the mouth with water to remove the sensation of dryness
# 3, 14, 45, and 60 minutes after drinking water to fully quench thirst

The data suggest that the anterior and posterior [[cingulate cortex]] as well as the anterior wall of the third [[ventricular system|ventricle]], are major elements of a circuit including [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites that are needed for the generation of consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Denton/&gt;
This study shows that consciousness of some key sensations like thirst is governed by the oldest regions of the brain, which raises the question of whether it is really then possible to say when primary consciousness developed.&lt;ref name= Denton/&gt;

=== In meditation ===

In some types of meditation/yoga it is possible to have the experience known as Samadhi, where there is inner alertness but no object of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Patanjali's Yoga Sutras.&lt;/ref&gt; This mental state corresponds with specific physiological parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Travis, F. &amp; Pearsoon. C. (2000) Pure Consciousness: Distinct phenomenological and physiological correlates of "consciousness itself", ''International Journal of Neuroscience'', 100 pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Project on the Status and Education of Women''' (PSEW) was the first [[United States]] project focused on gender equity in education. Formed in 1971 by the Association of American Colleges (AAC), known today as the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] (AACU), PSEW worked to improve access to and equity within higher education for women, addressing the needs of university students, faculty, staff, and administrators. PSEW produced and distributed materials about the status of women in higher education, advised colleges and universities about policies related to affirmative action, women's studies programs, and hiring women faculty, and worked with policymakers to introduce legislation to improve gender equity in American higher education. PSEW's periodical, ''On Campus with Women'' (OCWW), ran from 1971-2013 through the AACU, publishing articles and research related to women in higher education. PSEW also played a significant role in the development and passage of [[Title IX]], the portion of the U.S. [[Education Amendments of 1972]] that prohibits discrimination in education on the basis of sex.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid"&gt;Project on the Status and Education of Women (Association of American Colleges) Records, 1969-1991; Finding Aid. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

PSEW was dissolved as a separate project on June 30, 1991 and reincorporated into the AACU as the Program on the Status and Education of Women.&lt;ref name= "Crisis" /&gt; The program was directed by Caryn McTighe Musil until its conclusion in 2012.&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive collection of the materials and publications produced by PSEW is held at the [[Schlesinger Library]] at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="Finding Aid"/&gt;

==History and Formation==
The Project on the Status and Education of Women was founded in 1971 as the first step in a shift by the Association of American Colleges (now the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]]) towards attention to student diversity.&lt;ref name= "Gaff"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the headquarters of the AACU in Washington, D.C., the organization operated with a small staff.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;  PSEW received funding through grants, including from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].

PSEW was integral in the passage of Title IX. As part of this effort, the organization visited schools, educated lawmakers on women's issues in academia, and advocated for policies to improve women's situation on campuses. PSEW pursued a focus on sexual harassment and rape on campus, producing educational materials on these subjects in the 1980s. Notably, the organization coined the term "chilly climate", used in many of its works to describe the challenges faced by women in education.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

===People===
[[Bernice Resnick Sandler]] served as the director of PSEW from 1971-1991. Sandler was also active in the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL), through which she did similar work promoting gender equity in higher education. After Sandler, Caryn McTighe Musil served as director of the successor Program on the Status and Education of Women (PSEW) until 2012.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;

Margaret C. Dunkle served as the Associate President of PSEW from 1972-1977. Roberta M. Hall and Grace L. Mastalli were also important staff members.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

==Main Contributions==
===Publications===
PSEW was founded to aid colleges and universities in developing policies that addressed gender discrimination and sexual harassment. However, their work soon expanded beyond this mission, as PSEW staff began publishing original work on women in higher education.&lt;ref name="Gaff" /&gt; PSEW published over 100 reports, as well as booklets, pamphlets, and their newsletter ''On Campus with Women''.&lt;ref name="Equity"&gt;{{cite web
 | last = Musil
 | first = Caryn
 | title = Gender Equity: Who Needs It?
 | url = https://www.aacu.org/publications-research/periodicals/gender-equity-who-needs-it
 | access-date = 21 March 2017
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their publications addressed a range of subjects including recruiting women students and faculty, issues relevant to minority students, sex discrimination in hiring, sex bias in research, Title IX, financial assistance, sexual harassment on campus, and the academic climate for women. Their materials reached college presidents and faculty as well as policymakers, and not only disseminated information about events and research relating to women in education, but also informed women directly about their own legal rights to education. PSEW published the first papers on women of color in higher education and the first national reports on sex discrimination in college sports, hostile classroom environments, campus gang rape, and sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="Bernice"/&gt;

===="Chilly Climate"====
The organization additionally produced publications addressing a term it coined,&lt;ref name= "Bernice"&gt;{{cite web
 | title = AAC&amp;U Congratulates Bernice Sandler on Induction into National Women's Hall of Fame
 | url = http://www.aacu.org/whats-new/aacu-congratulates-bernice-sandler-induction-national-womens-hall-fame
 | date = 28 October 2013
 | access-date = 21 March 2017
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the "chilly climate" facing women at colleges and universities, a program of discourse which became a defining initiative for the group's contributions to equality in education.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; The "chilly climate" was illustrated by descriptions of challenges experienced by women students and faculty, from disparaging comments made about women and their academic capacities to the sidelining and interruption of women in class. PSEW's discussion of these challenges to women's experiences in a learning environment contributed to wider dialogue about the unequal learning environments experienced by people from various underserved groups.&lt;ref name="Gaff" /&gt;

The project published several influential works on the topic. In 1982, Hall and Sandler published "The Classroom Climate: A Chilly One for Women?" The paper was funded by a grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) of the [[U.S. Department of Education]]. PSEW held a conference in November 1982 called "The Chilly Classroom Climate: Sharing Strategies for Change" to publicize and discuss its findings. The final paper distributed at the conference sold over 40,000 copies between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

====''On Campus with Women''====
Perhaps PSEW's most prominent publication was their periodical, ''On Campus with Women'' (OCWW), which published research and articles on issues pertaining to women in higher education. Founded by Sandler at the inception of the PSEW in 1971, its content focused on women's leadership, campus climate, curriculum and pedagogy, and new research on women's participation in higher education. In the fall of 2002, OCWW moved exclusively online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = On Campus with Women
 | url = http://www.aacu.org/ocww/about_ocww.cfm
 | access-date = 20 March 2017
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the publication of ''On Campus with Women'' as a separate periodical ended,&lt;ref name="Bernice" /&gt; and its mission to cover gender issues in higher education was absorbed by the AACU's other journals, such as ''Liberal Education'' and ''Diversity and Democracy''.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

===Advocacy===
====Title IX====
PSEW played in an integral role in working with Congressional staff and other organizations on the drafting and implementation of Title IX, interfacing with other organizations and Congress to construct and pass the law. PSEW also acted as a resource for universities to consult on potential implementation and policy between the law's June 1972 passage and the 1975 final report on enforcement and regulations from the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]].&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt; The organization helped colleges and universities to institute policies that limited their risk of violating the Title IX requirements.&lt;ref name="Gaff"/&gt; During this interim period, PSEW often worked with the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education (NCWGE), a consortium of organizations founded to advocate for implementation regulations of Title IX on the enforcement, implementation, and funding of women's educational programs.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education 
 | url = http://www.ncwge.org
 | access-date = 21 March 2017
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-Title IX====
After Title IX became law, PSEW continued to educate policymakers and government officials about women's issues on college campuses. PSEW staff often visited college campuses to identify issues and to work with administrations on the implementation and enforcement of Title IX. PSEW also created educational materials on rape and sexual harassment as resources for campuses.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

==Legacy and Absorption into AACU==
The Project on the Status and Education of Women was the first national project directed at women of higher education and was one of first programs to address gender differences regarding campus climate. The project's involvement on the continued enforcement and implementation of [[Title IX]] has had lasting effects, as well as its creation and distribution of educational materials related to sexual harassment. Since its formation, PSEW has spearheaded a number of initiatives advocating gender equity in higher education.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid" /&gt;

PSEW was dissolved as a separate project on June 30, 1991 as part of a push to focus on women's issues throughout the programming of the AAC.&lt;ref name= "Crisis"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandler left her position of leadership and the group was reconstituted as the Program on the Status and Education of Women (PSEW). Upon being absorbed into the AACU, PSEW's primary source of funding no longer came from grants, as they were able to receive funding from the AACU. Musil directed the program until its conclusion in 2012, as the AACU redefined its mission to incorporate issues of gender equity. Some important reports and projects that were created during Musil's tenure were the report "A Measure of Equity: Women's Progress in Higher Education (2008)" and the establishment of the Campus Women Lead, which offered workshops on women's leadership, and the Women's Leadership Project for Inclusive Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26974">'''Religion and environmentalism''' is an emerging interdisciplinary subfield in the academic disciplines of [[religious studies]], [[religious ethics]], the [[sociology of religion]], and [[theology]] amongst others, with [[environmentalism]] and [[ecology|ecological]] principles as a primary focus.

==General overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}

===Crisis of values===
This subfield is founded on the understanding that, in the words of Iranian-American [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], "the environmental crisis is fundamentally a crisis of [[value (personal and cultural)|values]]," and that [[religion]]s, being a primary source of values in any [[culture]], are thus implicated in the decisions humans make regarding the [[Natural environment|environment]].

===Burden of guilt===
[[History|Historian]] [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.|Lynn White, Jr.]] first made the argument in a 1966 lecture before the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], subsequently published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', that [[Western Christianity]], having de-[[sacralized]] and instrumentalized [[nature]] to human ends, bears a substantial "burden of guilt" for the contemporary environmental crisis. White's essay stimulated a flurry of responses, ranging from defenses of [[Christianity]] to qualified admissions to complete agreement with his analysis.

===Eastern religions and indigenous peoples===
Some proposed that [[Eastern religions]], as well as those of [[indigenous peoples]], [[Neopaganism|neo-pagans]], and others, offered more [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] [[World view|worldviews]] than Christianity.  A third, more obscure camp, argued that while White's theory was  indeed correct, this was actually a benefit to society, and that thinning the populations of weaker plant and animal species via environmental destruction would lead to the [[evolution]] of stronger, more productive creatures.  See [[Kaitiaki]] in [[Māori religion]].

===Religion and ecology===
By the 1990s, many scholars of religion had entered the debate and begun to generate a substantial body of literature discussing and analyzing how nature is valued in the world's various religious systems. A landmark event was a series of ten conferences on Religion and Ecology organized by [[Yale University]] professors Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim and held at the [[Harvard University]] Center for the Study of World Religions from 1996 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ecology and Religion|last = Tucker|first = Mary Evelyn|publisher = Island Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-59726-707-6|location = Washington|pages = 6|last2 = Grim|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/religions-of-the-world-and-ecology-archive-of-conference-materials/|title=Religions of the World and Ecology: Archive Of Conference Materials|last=|first=|date=|website=Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 800 international scholars, religious leaders, and environmentalists participated in the conference series. The conferences concluded at the United Nations and at the American Museum of Natural History with more than 1,000 people in attendance. Papers from the conferences were published in a series of ten books (The Religions of the World and Ecology Book Series), one for each of the world's major religious traditions.

From these conferences, Tucker and Grim would form The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/|title=The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum has been instrumental in the creation of scholarship, in forming environmental policy, and in the greening of religion. In addition to their work with the Forum, Tucker and Grim's work continues in the ''Journey of the Universe'' film, book, and educational DVD series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journeyoftheuniverse.org/|title=Welcome - Journey Of The Universe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be the largest international multireligious project of its kind.

An active Religion and Ecology group has been in existence within the [[American Academy of Religion]] since 1991, and an increasing number of universities in [[North America]] and around the world are now offering courses on religion and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;“Religion and Ecology Group.” American Academy of Religion. https://papers.aarweb.org/content/religion-and-ecology-group Accessed July 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship on the field of religion and ecology can be found in the peer-reviewed academic journal ''Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology'' and in reference works such as the encyclopedia ''The Spirit of Sustainability''.

===Religion and nature===
Other landmarks in the emerging field was the publication of the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'' in 2005, which was edited by [[Bron Taylor]].  Taylor also led the effort to form the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture, which was established in 2006, and began publishing the quarterly ''Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture'' in 2007.

==Religions and the environment==
===Buddhism===
The best asset religion offers is the moral framework by which practitioners must abide.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"&gt;Eco-Dharma Center. (N.d.) Buddhism and Ecology. Catalan Pyrenees: Nick Day. Retrieved February 18, 2010, from http://www.ecodharma.com/influences-articles/buddhism-ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many environmental problems have stemmed from human activity, it follows that religion might hold some solutions to mitigating destructive patterns. [[Buddhism]] idealizes and emphasizes interconnection,&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"&gt;Tucker, M.E. &amp; Williams, D.R. (Eds.). (1998). Buddhism and Ecology: The Interconnection of Dharma and Deeds. Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; thereby creating a mindset that creates a productive and cooperative relationship between humans and nature. That all actions are based on the premise of interconnection makes the Buddhist mindset effective in cultivating modesty, compassion, and balance among followers, which may ultimately mitigate the harm done to the environment.

One benefit of the Buddhist interconnected mindset is the inevitable humility that ensues. Because humans are entwined with natural systems, damage done upon the [[Earth]] is also harm done to humans.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"&gt;Badiner, A.H. (1990). Dharma Gaia. United States of America: Parallax Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization is quite modifying to a human race that historically pillages the Earth for individual benefit. When rational humans minimize the split between humanity and nature and bridge the gaps,&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; only then will a mutual respect emerge in which all entities coexist rather than fight. Buddhism maintains that the reason for all suffering comes from attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Knierim, T. (Last modified 2009). Four Noble Truths. Big View. Retrieved February 24, 2010, from {{cite web |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; When release from the tight grasp humanity has on individuality and separateness occurs, then oneness and interconnection is realized. So rather than emphasizing winners and losers, humanity will understand its existence within others; this results in a modesty that ends egoic mind.

Another benefit of Buddhist practice to the environment is the compassion that drives all thinking.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; When humans realize that they are all connected, harm done to another will never benefit the initiator.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Therefore, peaceful wishes for everyone and everything will ultimately benefit the initiator. Through accepting that the web of life is connected&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"/&gt;—if one entity benefits, all benefit&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt;—then the prevailing mindset encourages peaceful actions all the time. If everything depends on everything else, then only beneficial events will make life situations better. Acceptance of compassion takes training and practice, which is also encouraged by Buddhist moral conduct in the form of mediation. This habitual striving for harmony and friendship among all beings creates a more perfect relationship between humanity and nature.

Lastly, Buddhist mindset relies on taking the middle road or striving for balance. [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of Buddhism, spent his life searching for the outlet of human suffering, eventually concluding that a balance must be established between self-destruction and self-indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (Producer) &amp; Bertolucci, B (Director). (1994). [[Little Buddha]]. United States of America: Buena Vista Home Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt; While modern, industrial humans emphasize economic and social aspects of life and lastly environmental aspects, this view is lopsided.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When human preferences are leveled with environmental preferences—giving a voice to natural systems as well as human systems—then can balance and harmony be realized.

Therefore, using this idealized and disciplined framework that Buddhism has to offer can create lasting solutions to amending the broken relationship between humanity and nature.

Buddhists today are involved in spreading environmental awareness. In a meeting with the U.S Ambassador to the Republic of India [[Timothy J.

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian views on environmentalism}}

[[Christianity]] has a historic concern for nature and the natural world. At the same time, ecological concerns operate in tension with [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] values, such as the [[Biblical]] notion of human dominion over the Earth. ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]] 1:28) A broad range of Christian institutions are engaged in the [[environmental movement]] and contemporary environmental concerns.

====Latter Day Saint movement====
[[Mormon]] environmentalists find theological reasons for stewardship and conservationism through biblical and additional scriptural references including a passages from the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]: "And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion" ([[Doctrine and Covenants|D&amp;C]] 59:20).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.20?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 59:20|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] has a complex relationship with environmental concerns, involving not only the religion but politics and economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Mormon-Belief-and-the-Environment.html "Mormon Belief and the Environment"], by [[George B. Handley]] in [[Patheos]] September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1998) ''New Genesis: A Mormon Reader on Land and Community'' Editors: [[Terry Tempest Williams]], Gibbs M. Smith, William B. Smart {{ISBN|978-0-87905-843-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[environmentally friendly]] policies, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a history of utilizing elements of conservationist policies for their [[Meeting house|meetinghouses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/ConservationPractices/|title=Timeline of Construction Practices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church first placed [[solar panels]] on a church meetinghouse in the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Islands]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700027829/Mormon-Church-unveils-solar-powered-meetinghouse.html|title=Mormon Church unveils solar powered meetinghouse|first=Scott|last=Taylor|date=28 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the church unveiled five [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified meetinghouse prototypes that are that will be used as future meetinghouse designs around the world, the first one having been completed in 2010 in [[Farmington, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|title=Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive - The Salt Lake Tribune|first=The Salt Lake|last=Tribune|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104095531/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|archivedate=2012-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], practitioners and scholars find traditional approaches to the natural environment in such concepts as [[dharmic]] ethics or [[prakrti]] (material creation), the development of [[ayurveda]], and readings of [[vedas|vedic literature]]. Hindu [[environmental activism]] also may be inspired by [[Gandhian philosophy]] and practical struggles, such as the [[Bishnoi]] community in Rajasthan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Jain, Pankaj|title=Dharma and Ecology of Hindu Communities: Sustenance and Sustainability|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chipko]] resistance to [[forestry]] policies in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Chappl and Tucker|title=Hinduism and Ecology: The intersection of earth, sky and water|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahatma Gandhi played a major role in Indian environmentalism, and has been called the "father of Indian environmentalism".&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's environmental thought parallels his social thoughts in that environmental sustainability and social inequalities should be managed in similar fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent teachings left a lasting impact, even agriculturally. Contemporary agrarian practices use the Bhagavad-Gita to establish practices that are deemed non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Science}}
Through the tradition from the [[Quran]] and the prophets, the environment was made sacred. It is believed that God did not create the environment for a random reason, but rather a reflection of truth. One can gain profound knowledge from nature thus, human beings are to preserve it and look after it.  Many chapters in the  Quran, refer to the beauties of nature as well as the headings of many chapters indicating the importance of it, such as: "The Sun", "Dawn", and "Morning Hours". Thus man is God's representative on this planet, if he is not charged with sustaining it, then at least he must not destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Holy Quran and the Environment| year=2010| chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man| chapterurl=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129013542/http://rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| archivedate=2010-11-29| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], the concept of a [[Hima (environmental protection)|hima]] or "inviolate zone" refers to a piece of land that has been set aside to prevent cultivation or any use other than [[Spirituality|spiritual]] purposes.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism and environmentalism}}

In [[Judaism]], the natural world plays a central role in [[Jewish law]], literature, and liturgical and other practices. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Within the diverse arena of Jewish thought, beliefs vary widely about the human relation to the environment, though the rabbinic tradition has put Judaism primarily on an [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] trajectory. However, a few contemporary Jewish thinkers and rabbis in the USA and [[Israel]] emphasized that a central belief in Judaism is that the Man (Ha Adam - האדם whose root comes from Haadama (earth) - האדמה, in [[Hebrew language]]), should keep the Earth in the same state as he received it from God, its eternal and actual "owner" (especially for the land of [[Israel]]), thus the people today should avoid polluting it and keep it clean for the future generations. According to this opinion, Judaism is clearly in line with the principles of environmental protection and [[sustainable development]].

In Jewish law (''halakhah''), ecological concerns are reflected in Biblical protection for fruit trees, rules in the [[Mishnah]] against harming the public domain, [[Talmud]]ic debate over noise and smoke [[Nezikin|damages]], and contemporary [[responsa]] on agricultural pollution. In [[Conservative Judaism]], there has been some attempt to adopt [[ecokashrut]] ideas{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} developed in the 1970s by Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]]. In addition, Jewish activists have recruited principles of ''halakhah'' for environmental purposes, such as the injunction against unnecessary destruction, known as [[bal tashkhit]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In contemporary Jewish liturgy, ecological concerns have been promoted by adapting a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[ritual]] for the holiday of trees, [[Tu Bishvat]]. Biblical and rabbinic texts have been enlisted for prayers about the environment, especially in [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Jewish Renewal]] movements.

In the U.S., a diverse coalition of Jewish environmentalists undertakes both educational and policy advocacy on such issues as [[biodiversity]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|title=About COEJL|publisher=Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, New York|url=http://www.coejl.org/~coejlor/about/|accessdate=2008-01-08}} and the [http://jewcology.org/map-of-initiatives/ Jewcology map of Jewish environmental initiatives].&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish environmentalists are drawn from all branches of religious life, ranging from Rabbi [[Arthur Waskow]] to the Orthodox group Canfei Nesharim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|title=Canfei Nesharim Named One of North America’s Most Innovative Jewish Nonprofits|publisher=Canfei Nesharim|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2008-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108231605/http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|archivedate=2007-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]] have formed numerous governmental and [[non-governmental organizations]] to protect nature and reduce pollution. While many Israeli environmental organizations make limited use of Jewish religious teachings, a few do approach Israel's environmental problems from a Jewish standpoint, including [http://www.earthday.org/partner/heschel-center-environmental-learning-and-leadership the Heschel Center for Environmental Learning and Leadership], named after [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]].

===Taoism===
[[Taoism]] offers many ideas that are in line with environmentalism, such as [[wu wei]], [[moderation]], [[compassion]] and Taoist [[animism]]. Parallels were found between Taoism and [[deep ecology]]. Pioneer of environmentalism [[John Muir]] was called "the Taoist of the West". Rosenfeld wrote 'Taoism is environmentalism'.&lt;ref name="Zai 2015"&gt;Dr Zai, J.

Baird Earth's Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback Callicott&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the ancient and perhaps timeless philosophical concepts, like ''Parasparopagraho Jivanam'', were more recently compiled into a [http://www.jainology.org/publications/jain-delaration-on-nature Jain Declaration on Nature], which describes the religion's inherent [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]] and deep ecology.

[[Image:RostamMournsSohrab.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Persian language|Persian]] manuscript painting:Rustam laments for Suhrab]]

The tragedy of '''  Rostam and Sohrab''' forms part of the 10th-century Persian epic [[Shahnameh]] by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet]] [[Ferdowsi]]. It tells the tragic story of the heroes [[Rostam]] and his son, [[Sohrab]].

==Plot==
Rostam lived in [[Sistan]], [[Iran]] (also known as [[Persia]]), hero and one of the favorites of King [[Kay Kāvus|Kaykavous]]. Once, following the traces of his lost horse, he enters the kingdom of [[Samangan]] where he becomes the guest of the king during the search for his horse. There, Rostam meets princess [[Tahmina]]. She admires Rostam and knows of his reputation. She goes into his room at night and asks if he will give her a child and in return, she will bring his horse. Rostam leaves after he impregnates Tahmina and his horse is returned. Before he leaves, he gives her two tokens. If she has a girl, she is to take the jewel and plait it in the girl's hair. If she has a boy, she is to take the seal and bind it on the boy's arm. Nine months later, she bears his child—a son, whom she later names Sohrab. Years go by before Rostam and Sohrab meet. Finally, a new war between [[Persia]] and [[Turan]] is on the horizon. The two armies face each other and prepare for the imminent battle. By then, Sohrab has become known as the best fighter of Turan army. But Rostam's legend precedes him and the Turan army cowers before the hero. No one else dares to fight Rostam, so Sohrab is sent to wrestle with the legendary Khurasaan hero. Though Sohrab knows his father's name, he is unaware that the man before him is Rostam. On the battlefield, Rostam and Sohrab fight for what seems like an eternity, neither knowing the true name of his opponent.

After a very long and heavy bout of wrestling, Rostam breaks Sohrab's back and stabs him. Sohrab, dying, tells Rostam that his father will avenge his death and only then do they realize their identities. Sohrab produces the necklace that Rostam once gave Tahmina, who gave it to her son to keep him safe during the war. Rostam grieves heavily but cannot save his son. When she finds out her son is dead, Tahmina burns Sohrab's house and gives away all his riches. Then "the breath departed from out her body, and her spirit went forth after Sohrab her son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Ferdowsi/kings.8.rustemsohrab.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - The Epic of Kings by Ferdowsi|author=|date=|website=classics.mit.edu|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Tahmineh comes to the battlefield trying to stop the fight; Rustam gives an arm band (not a necklace) large enough to only have fit his stout arms, and now only fit Sohrab´s arm; and, Rustam uses a poisoned knife to stab his son.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">'''Sex on Premises Venue''' ('''SOPV''') is the term used primarily in British and Australian medical literature for the various commercial venues expressly for engaging in public sex, as opposed to spaces such as [[park]]s which may be used for sexual behavior but are intended for general public use.

A similar term, "on-premises club", is used by heterosexual [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]] to describe a [[sex club]] in which non-commercial sexual activity takes place between clients or members.

While the term is primarily used with respect to [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), at least one piece of legislation (the ''Sex Work Act'' in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]]) uses "sex on premises venue" to mean "any venue where a person is required to pay an admission fee or charge to enter the venue for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities with another person who has also entered the venue on the same terms and who did not receive any form of payment or reward, whether directly or indirectly, for engaging in sexual activities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/swa1994129/s3b.html SEX WORK ACT 1994 - SECT 3B], Exemptions for sex on premises venues, Queen's Printer, Victoria, Australia 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This wording, while gender-neutral, would explicitly exclude [[brothel]]s.

==MSM sex-on-premises venues==
Men who have sex with men (MSM) SOPV'ss include [[gay bathhouse]]s, "backrooms", and "club" style venues that have no spa or sauna.&lt;ref name=QX759&gt;{{citation|journal=QX Magazine London |date= |publisher=QX |accessdate=2009-10-25 |issue= |page=50 |title=QX Magazine London Issue 759 24th September 2009|url=http://viewer.zmags.com/showmag.php?mid=rqrdts#/page50 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927044345/http://viewer.zmags.com/showmag.php?mid=rqrdts |archivedate=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most gay bathhouses, bookstores, and bars in the United States do not openly advertise their actual sex-on-premises purpose or activity, as SOPVs elsewhere can.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

"Backrooms" consisting of small cubicles with expensive-to-view video machines are usually attached to an adult bookstore. Sometimes there are [[Glory hole (sexual)|glory holes]] between the cubicles. The cubicles are also referred to as ''private viewing rooms'' or ''cruise lounges''.  "Backrooms" of pubs or bars are usually darkened rooms with or without continuous (and free) [[pornographic]] films, but without any dividers or privacy, encouraging group sex.

Club style SOPVs are an entire venue {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and often consist of small cubicles, sometimes with no bed or mattress,  unlike gay bathhouses which usually have some kind of comfort amenities in individual rooms.

Some bathhouses sell alcohol;{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} pubs and bars sell alcohol but are prohibited from marketing themselves as SOPVs. Sometimes special events are held at pubs or bars that include sexual activity without causing the venue to be classified as an SOPV.

SOPVs are recognized by some city planners as part of the management strategy for [[safer sex|sexually transmitted disease education]] and part of catering for a city's cultural diversity and tourist industry.&lt;ref name=Prior2008 &gt;{{citation | last=Prior | first=Jason | year=2008 | title=Planning for Sex in the City: urban governance, planning and the placement of sex industry premises in inner Sydney | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | journal=[[Australian Geographer]] | pages=339–352 | volume=39 | issue = 3 | issn=0004-9182 | oclc=360672708 | doi=10.1080/00049180802270531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MullensA2009 &gt;{{citation | author=Mullens A.B | year=2009 | title=Sex on premises venue (SOPV) health promotion project in response to sustained increases in HIV notifications | last2=Debattista | first2=J | last3=Staunton | first3=S | last4=Hamernik | first4=E | journal=Sexual Health | pages=41–44 | volume=6 | location=n1 (2009 03 11) | issn=1448-5028 | oclc=423544035 | doi=10.1071/sh07087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waitt2006 &gt;{{citation | last1=Waitt | first1=Gordon | year=2006 | title=Gay tourism: culture and context | first2=Kevin | last2=Markwell | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-7890-1603-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9v84NxERpjQC | page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etiquette ==
Bookstore-backroom SOPVs may be free to enter, costing only for the film or video, or may have an admission charge.

Club style SOPVs may have regular themes such as underwear, boots only,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080330033451/http://www.thefortlondon.com/ The Fort], London, example of Boots Only nights.&lt;/ref&gt; [[fisting]] or [[Urolagnia|piss]] nights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080110055347/http://www.centralstation.co.uk/sop.html Central Station (archive)], London, ''SOP'' piss night example.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been heavily featured in American Apparel’s advertisements and become a common term in the garment industry.[[File:Sweatshopfree.jpg|thumb|right]]

==Versus sweatshop==

===Sweatshop===
A sweatshop is a factory or workplace, especially in the garment industry, where workers are employed at very low wages for long hours and under poor working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jOaTCNNtbIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=sweatshop&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=93FTVMy0BY_g7QbshoH4Dg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sweatshop&amp;f=false|title=Making Sweatshops|work=Google.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sweatshop factories in developing countries such as India, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh employ low-pay worker or even child labour around 10–14 years old to work in their factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/NLC_childlabor.html|title=Children Found Sewing Clothing For Wal-Mart, Hanes &amp; Other U.S. &amp; European Companies  - National Labor Committee|work=Harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers are forced to work up to 16 hours a day seven days a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/sweatshops-and-plantations/sweatshops-in-bangladesh|title=Sweatshops in Bangladesh|work=War On Want|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not receive any basic employee benefits such as health care, maternity leave, sick pay and holiday pay from their employers. They sometime make the female workers to take birth control and take regular pregnancy test to stop maternity leave. And these workers only earn 25p an hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/sweatshops-and-plantations/china-sweatshops|title=Sweatshops in China|work=War On Want|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is much lower than the legal national [[minimum wage]]. Even labours work long hours everyday, their salaries are usually just enough to cover their basic living cost.

Besides, sweatshop factories usually have harsh working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/business/worldbusiness/05sweatshop.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=In Chinese Factories, Lost Fingers and Low Pay |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, no rest break, no air-conditioning and workers have to stand for their entire shift. Some workers even had to work in unsafe and hazardous conditions which may causes working injuries or even fatal factory incidents. Take China as an example, in 2009 alone, approximately one million workers were injured at work and about 20,000 suffered from diseases due to their occupation. The reason for this is that the sweatshop factories did not provide any safety guidance for their employees. Lots of sweatshop workers are also suffering from labour abuse, sexual harassment and discrimination in their workplaces. To avoid labours organising protests or any campaign against unfair labour practise, many sweatshop factories find ways to prevent the establishment of the trade unions.

===Sweatshop-free===
In sweatshop, labours have to work for long hours but receive very low salary which is only half or even less than the legal [[minimum wage]] under a harsh working condition. The aim of sweatshop-free wish to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and products are made in good working conditions. Sweatshop-free standards include the right to collective bargaining, non-poverty wages, safe workplaces, back wages, and non-harassment.

Take American Apparel as an example, they provide all employees and their families lots of employee benefits including health insurance, parking, subsidised public transport, subsidised lunches, free on site massages, a bike lending program, a program of paid days off as well as opening an onside medical clinic for their employees.&lt;ref name="americanapparel.net"/&gt; American Apparel make sure that their workers are treated fairly and working in a good working conditions. They pay average skilled-sewers 25,000 US dollar per year and 12 US dollar per hour&lt;ref name="americanapparel.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1C73D94TwNYC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=sweatshop+free&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWZTVOeiFsOu7AbSzYCwBw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sweatshop%20free&amp;f=false|title=Fashion Brands|work=Google.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that twice the national [[minimum wage]], which is in big contrast to 25p per hour wage commonly found in sweatshop factories abroad.

===Sweatshop-free clothing===
There are a few ways to know that you are buying sweatshop-free clothing:
* Look at the garment label. For example, Unite is an international union which makes sweatshop free clothing.
* Many organisations, for example Green America, publish ethical consumer guides which list their recommendations for sources of sweatshop free clothing.
* The price of sweatshop-free clothing is relatively higher than sweatshop products.

==Sweatshop scandals==

===Apple Inc.===
[[File:Applefactory.jpg|thumb|right| Workers in a China Apple factory. An investigation found some workers had to work 15 hours a day for £27 a month]]
[[File:Iphonee5ss.jpg|thumb|right|The "S" is for Sweatshop]]
[[Apple Inc]]  the world's most valuable technology multinational corporation has been accused that their contractors are forcing workers to do overtime involuntarily at sweatshop working conditions and employing underage workers in its factories. Some labourers are forced to work 24 hours at a time and others are forced to stand for their entire shift. And some workers even had to work at unsafe and hazardous condition. In December 2011, 61 workers in the Riteng Computer Accessory Co factory were injured in a gas explosion whilst trialling aluminium iPad 2 back panels.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2103798/Revealed-Inside-Apples-Chinese-sweatshop-factory-workers-paid-just-1-12-hour.html|title=Revealed: Inside Apple's Chinese 'sweatshop' factory where workers are paid just £1.12 per hour|work=Mail Online|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the pressurised working conditions, in 2009, 18 workers who work in Foxconn factory, one of the Apple manufacturer, committed suicide after losing an iPhone prototype.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; Over next two years, at least 18 other Apple workers try to commit suicide. Besides, undercover Inspectors have been monitoring Pegatron factory, one of the Apple contractor in Taiwan, for five months and found Apple supplier broke 86 laws and regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2381182/Apple-accused-sweatshop-conditions-Far-Eastern-factories.html|title=Apple accused of sweatshop conditions at Far-Eastern factories - This is Money|work=This is Money|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; including workers are forced to work up to 70 hours per week as well as hiring more than 100,000 underage labour to work on the production lines. These sweatshop scandals strongly affected the reputation of the company.

[[File:Portestorr.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters stand outside the Primark shop on Oxford St with SWEATSHOP SHAME banner]]

===Primark===
[[Primark]], a leading high street fashion chain, has been blamed that three of its Indian suppliers are using child labour in their factories. After BBC Panorama’s six months undercover investigation, they discovered the Indian suppliers were sub-contracting middlemen who employed children at Bhavanisagar refugee camp. Investigators found a 9-year-old boy who is working in the refugee camp sweatshop “Sometimes we get major orders in and we have to work double quick. I get paid a few rupees for finishing each garment, but in a good day I can make 40 rupees (60p)” and “The beads we sew are very small and when we work late at night we have to work by candle - the electricity in the camp is poor.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/exposed-primarks-sweatshops-that-pay-children-just-60p-a-day-6875294.html|title=Exposed: Primark's sweatshops that pay children just 60p a day|work=The Evening Standard|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primark sub-contractors hired young children to work under poor working conditions, paying them as little as 13p an hour and they have to work up to 48 hours a week.  After BBC Panorama investigation discovered that the Indian suppliers had used child labour to carry out embroidery and sequin work, Primark then fired the Indian suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7824291.stm|title=BBC News - Primark linked to UK sweatshops|work=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC also reported that TNS Knitwear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nosweat.org.uk/story/2009/01/12/primark-clothes-made-sweatshop-labour-uk-factory|title=Primark: clothes made by sweatshop labour in UK factory|work=Nosweat.org.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Manchester-based supplier that provide Primark with about 20,000 garment a week, was not only employing illegal immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and India, but also paying them as little as £3 per hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/872736/primark-linked-manchester-sweatshop/ |title=Primark linked with Manchester sweatshop |publisher=Managementtoday.co.uk |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is well below than the legal [[minimum wage]] but the company has denied all the allegations.

==Sweatshop-free legislation and activism==
In October 2008, the City of Portland, Oregon passed the "City of Portland Sweatshop Free Procuremenat Policy” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=26882&amp;a=264837|title=ADM-1.17 - Sweatshop Free Procurement Policy Administrative Rules|date=30 January 2013|work=Portlandonline.com|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the pacific northwest’s first city to adopt this policy. Portland Sweatshop-Free Purchasing Policy requires the local apparel manufacturers to guarantee their garments were produced in workplaces free of sweatshop conditions. Local apparel manufacturers have to disclose their manufacturing facility locations and meet ethical souring practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2008/10/20/newscolumn1.html?page=all|title=Portland city officials adopt sweatshop-free policy|work=Portland Business Journal|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from monitoring the local apparel manufacturers, the city also participate and collaborate with public agencies and other non- profit organisation to promote sweatshop free procurement practices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=26882&amp;a=218021|title=ADM-1.16 - Sweatshop Free Procurement Policy and Code of Conduct for Apparel Contractors|date=30 January 2013|work=Portlandonline.com|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is institutionalizing meaningful change. A not-for-profit organisation called SweatsHope &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweatshope.org|title=SweatsHope|work=SweatsHope.org|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to produce ethical factories in Kolkata, India to stop human trafficking (women and children), we also aim to create an ethical place of work for the victims of abuse, freeing them from sex trade. This workplace will become a place of refuge, education, childcare and provide a decent wage. They believe Shutting down one sweatshop, will only create less jobs for people who are already struggling with employment, or that another sweatshop will just open up next door. Retailers are always trying to get cheaper manufacturing costs, this is why we need to stand up and demand ethical treatment and wages for staff. If the consumers demand this, and demand an ‘open book’ of their suppliers, we will create a sweatshop free world.

"'''Time Enough at Last'''" is the eighth episode of the American [[television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. The episode was adapted from a short story written by [[Lynn Venable (writer)|Lynn Venable]] (pen name of Marilyn Venable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hill, Angela (''Oakland Tribune'')|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_22263716/give-em-hill-twilight-zone-el-cerrito-author|title=Give 'Em Hill: El Cerrito woman lends 'Twilight Zone' inspiration|work= San Jose Mercury News|date=December 30, 2012|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short story appeared in the January 1953 edition of the [[science fiction]] [[magazine]] ''[[If (magazine)|If: Worlds of Science Fiction]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Venable, Lynn|title=Time Enough at Last|work=IF: Worlds of Science Fiction|url=https://archive.org/details/If_Worlds_Of_Science_Fiction_v01n06_Quinn_Jan_1953_Gorgon776 |date=January 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Venable, Lynn|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32633 |title=Time Enough at Last|work=IF: Worlds of Science Fiction|date=January 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  about seven years before the television episode first aired. "Time Enough at Last" became one of the most famous episodes of the original ''Twilight Zone'' and has been frequently parodied since. It is "the story of a man who seeks salvation in the rubble of a ruined world"&lt;ref name="preview"&gt;[[Rod Serling|Serling, Rod]]. Promotional spot for "Time Enough at Last". Original airdate: 13 November 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; and tells of Henry Bemis {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|m|ɪ|s}}, played by [[Burgess Meredith]], who loves [[book]]s, yet is surrounded by those who would prevent him from reading them. The episode follows Bemis through the [[post-apocalyptic]] [[world]], touching on such social issues as [[anti-intellectualism]], the dangers of reliance upon [[technology]], and the difference between aloneness (solitude) and loneliness.

==Opening narration==
{{quote|Witness Mr. Henry Bemis, a charter member in the fraternity of dreamers. A bookish little man whose passion is the printed page, but who is conspired against by a bank president and a wife and a world full of tongue-cluckers and the unrelenting hands of a clock. But in just a moment, Mr. Bemis will enter a world without bank presidents or wives or clocks or anything else. He'll have a world all to himself... without anyone.}}

==Plot==
Henpecked, [[Far sightedness|far sighted]] [[bank teller]] and avid [[Bibliophile|bookworm]] Henry Bemis (Meredith) works at his window in a [[bank]], while reading ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', which causes him to shortchange an annoyed customer. Bemis's angry boss (Taylor), and later his nagging wife (deWit), both complain to him that he wastes far too much time reading "[[wiktionary:doggerel|doggerel]]." As a cruel joke, his wife asks him to read [[poetry]] from one of his books to her; he eagerly obliges, only to find that she has inked over the text on every page, obscuring the words. Seconds later, she destroys the book by ripping the pages from it, much to Henry's dismay.

The next day, as usual, Henry takes his lunch break in the bank's [[bank vault|vault]], where his reading will not be disturbed. Moments after he sees a newspaper headline, which reads "[[Teller-Ulam design|H-Bomb]] Capable of Total Destruction," an enormous explosion outside the bank violently shakes the vault, knocking Bemis unconscious. After regaining consciousness and recovering the thick glasses required for him to see, Bemis emerges from the vault to find the bank demolished and everyone in it dead. Leaving the bank, he sees that the entire city has been destroyed, and realizes that a nuclear war has devastated Earth, but that his being in the vault has saved him.

{{quote|Seconds, minutes, hours. They crawl by on hands and knees for Mr. Henry Bemis, who looks for a spark in the ashes of a dead world. A telephone connected to nothingness. A neighborhood bar, a movie, a baseball diamond, a hardware store, the mailbox of what was once his house and is now a rubble. They lie at his feet as battered monuments to what was, but is no more.  Mr. Henry Bemis on an eight-hour tour of a graveyard.}}

Finding himself totally alone in a shattered world with food to last him a lifetime (but no one to share it with) and no means of leaving to look for other survivors, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a [[revolver]] he has found, Bemis sees the ruins of the public [[library]] in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) realizes that he has all the time in the world to read them without interruption.

His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts the books he looks forward to reading for years to come, with no obligations to get in the way. Just as he bends down to pick up the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken remains of the glasses he is virtually [[blindness|blind]] without, and says, "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair!  It's not fair!" and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.

==Closing narration==
{{quote|The best laid plans of mice and men... and Henry Bemis... the small man in the glasses who wanted nothing but time. Henry Bemis, now just a part of a smashed landscape, just a piece of the rubble, just a fragment of what man has deeded to himself. Mr. Henry Bemis... in the Twilight Zone.}}

The closing narration was a sort of nod to Burgess Meredith's acting credits, as he was the lead in the 1939 movie ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]''.

==Production==
[[File:Burgess Meredith The Twilight Zone.jpg|thumb|Burgess Meredith as Henry Bemis]]
"Time Enough at Last" was one of the first episodes written for ''The Twilight Zone''.&lt;ref name="mp3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook35278.htm |title=Time Enough At Last: Twilight Zone Story read by Bill Mills |publisher=Fictionwise eBooks |accessdate=2007-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203030/http://ebooks.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook35278.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It introduced [[Burgess Meredith]] to the series; he went on to star in three more episodes, being introduced as "no stranger to ''The Twilight Zone''" in promotional spots for season two's "[[The Obsolete Man]]". He also narrated for the 1983 film ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', which made reference to "Time Enough at Last" during its opening sequence, with the characters discussing the episode in detail.

Footage of the exterior steps of the library was filmed several months after production had been completed. These steps can also be seen on the exterior of an [[Eloi]] public building in [[MGM]]'s 1960 version of ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]''.&lt;ref name="zicree"&gt;Zicree, Marc Scott. ''The Twilight Zone Companion''. Sillman-James Press, 1982 (second edition).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brahm]] was nominated for a [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] award for his work on the episode.&lt;ref name="Directors Guild of AmeriCa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dga.org/Awards/Explore.aspx|title=Directors Guild of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book that Bemis was reading in the vault and that flips open when the bomb explodes is ''[[A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]'' by [[Washington Irving]].

==Themes==
[[Image:Time Enough themes.jpg|thumb|left|Humanity's propensity for destruction and [[suicide]] are among the episode's themes.]]
Although the overriding message may seem to "be careful what you wish for, you just might get it", there are other themes throughout the episode as well.&lt;ref name="zicree" /&gt; Paramount among these is the question of solitude versus loneliness, as embodied by Bemis' moment of near-suicide. Additionally, the portrayal of societal attitudes towards books speaks to the contemporary decline of traditional literature and how, given enough time, reading may become a relic of the past.&lt;ref name="ochse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storytellersunplugged.com/2006/03/end-of-books-bemis-condition.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506100624/http://www.storytellersunplugged.com/2006/03/end-of-books-bemis-condition.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-05-06 |author=Weston Ochse |title=The End of Books: The Bemis Condition |work=Storytellers Unplugged |accessdate=2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarris"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarris, Andrew|title=Rod Serling: Viewed from Beyond the Twilight Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the ending "punishes Bemis for his antisocial behavior, and his greatest desire is thwarted".&lt;ref name="backstage"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanyard, Stewart T.  |author2=Gaiman, Neil |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Dimensions Behind the Twilight Zone: A Backstage Tribute to Television's Groundbreaking Series|publisher= Ecw Press|date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rod Serling]]'s concluding statement in the episode alludes to [[Robert Burns]]' [[Scots language]] poem "[[To a Mouse]]." The poem concludes: "The best-laid schemes o' mice an men / ''Gang aft agley''" (translation: "Often go awry").

Although "Time Enough at Last" implies that [[nuclear warfare]] has destroyed humanity, [[film criticism|film critic]] [[Andrew Sarris]] notes that the episode's necessarily unrealistic format may have been what allowed its production to commence:&lt;ref name="sarris" /&gt;

{{quote|Much of the implacable seriousness of ''The Twilight Zone'' is seemingly keyed by the clipped, dour delivery of Serling himself and the interlocutor. He never encourages us to laugh, or even smile, even when the plot twist is at least darkly funny. For example, in 'Time Enough at Last' ... The [[Nuclear weapon|H-bomb]] is still lurking in the background of the bookworm's 'accident.' The point is that the bomb could never have gone off on network television were the plot couched in a more realistic format.}}

In the era of the [[Internet]] and [[eBook]]s, the irony depicted in "Time Enough at Last" has an [[information age]] counterpart, according to [[Weston Ochse]] of ''Storytellers Unplugged''. As Ochse points out, when Bemis becomes the last person on Earth, he finally has time to read, with all his books at his fingertips and the only impediment is technology when his medium for accessing them—his glasses—breaks. In a hypothetical world where all books are published electronically, Ochse observes, readers would be "only a lightning strike, a faulty switch, a sleepy workman or a natural disaster away from becoming Henry Bemis at the end of the world"—that is, a [[power outage]] has the potential to give them time to read, yet like Bemis, they too would lose their medium for accessing their books—namely the [[computer]].&lt;ref name="ochse" /&gt;

===Similar episodes===
''The Twilight Zone'' often explored similar themes throughout its run.&lt;ref name="nostalgia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/television/drama/twilightzone.htm |title=The Twilight Zone |work=Nostalgia Central }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Time Enough at Last" has strong thematic ties to a number of other episodes in the series, starting with that of isolation, first explored in the series [[Television pilot|pilot]], "[[Where Is Everybody?]]".  It is also a prominent theme in the previous episode "[[The Lonely (The Twilight Zone)|The Lonely]]". Additionally, in a plot very similar to that of "Time Enough at Last", "[[The Mind and the Matter]]" tells of a man who uses his mind to erase humanity, only to find that  existence without other people is unbearable. The notion of being an outsider, lost in a sea of [[conformity]], was one of the most common themes of the series.&lt;ref name="zicree" /&gt;

Other thematic elements in this episode can be found throughout the series, as well. "[[The Obsolete Man]]" takes the episode's literary subtext—the notion that reading may eventually be considered "obsolete"—to an extreme: The state has declared books obsolete and a librarian (also played by Meredith) finds himself on trial for his own [[obsolescence]]. This notion, akin to [[Ray Bradbury]]'s short story "[[The Pedestrian]]" (1951), is also alluded to in the episode "[[Number 12 Looks Just Like You]]", in which a perfect and equal world contradictorily considers works like those of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] "smut".&lt;ref name="backstage" /&gt;

===Critical and fan favorite===
"Time Enough at Last" was a ratings success in its initial airing and "became an instant classic".&lt;ref name="PresMcGee"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Presnell, Don |author2=McGee, Marty |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A Critical History of Television's the Twilight Zone, 1959–1964|page= 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; It "remains one of the best-remembered and best-loved episodes of ''The Twilight Zone''" according to Marc Zicree, author of ''[[The Twilight Zone Companion]]''.&lt;ref name="zicree" /&gt; When a poll&lt;!---When?---&gt; asked readers of ''Twilight Zone Magazine'' which episode of the series they remembered the most, "Time Enough at Last" was the most frequent response, with "[[To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)|To Serve Man]]" coming in a distant second.&lt;ref name="sander"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonsander.com/article.php?p=295 |author=Gordon Sander |title=Twilight Zone: A Serling Performance |work=The Sander Zone |accessdate=2007-09-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929015238/http://www.gordonsander.com/article.php?p=295 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[TV Land]]'s presentation of ''[[TV Guide]]'''s "100 Most Memorable Moments in Television", "Time Enough at Last" was ranked at #25.&lt;ref name="tvland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvland.com/originals/100moments/page4.jhtml |title=TV Guide and TV Land presents The 100 Most Memorable TV Moments |publisher=[[TV Land]] |accessdate=2007-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704020154/http://www.tvland.com/originals/100moments/page4.jhtml |archivedate=2007-07-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In an interview, Serling cited "Time Enough at Last" as one of his two favorites from the entire series. (The other episode was "[[The Invaders (The Twilight Zone)|The Invaders]]", with [[Agnes Moorehead]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blastr.com/2010/09/rod_serling_picks_his_2_f.php|title=In lost interview, Serling reveals his favorite Twilight Zone eps|work=[[Syfy Wire]]|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=2012-12-14|accessdate=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amusement park attractions===
*[[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]], a theme park ride at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] and formerly [[Disney California Adventure Park]], displays a replica of Henry Bemis' broken glasses in the lobby. It is noted that, while they are indeed reading glasses, Burgess Meredith wears them the entire episode to make Bemis look more bookish.&lt;ref name="ride"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emuck.com/aotw/tower.htm |author1=Bruce A Metcalf |author2=Ronnie O'Rourke |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Twilight Zone Tower of Terror or, Iago &amp; Zazu Learn the Ups &amp; Downs of the Hotel Business |work=Iago &amp; Zazu's Attraction of the Week |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928212510/http://www.emuck.com/aotw/tower.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
The comic book version of ''The Simpsons'', ''Simpsons Comics'', published a story called "The Last Fat Man", based partially on "Time Enough at Last", and includes a short scene where [[Homer Simpson]] shoos a bespectacled man who is reading a book out of a nuclear bunker so he can eat in it, unintentionally taking shelter in it.

===Film===
*In ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983), [[Albert Brooks]] recounts the episode to [[Dan Aykroyd]] as they drive along an empty stretch of highway. "This thing freaked me out when I was 7 years old," says Brooks' character, adding: "I bought another pair of glasses just in case that would happen." 
*The episode's title was borrowed by a 2004 [[independent film]] about a man who tries to escape an office building. The film's official website listed the [[webmaster]]'s e-mail alias as "&lt;tt&gt;rodserling&lt;/tt&gt;".&lt;ref name="2004film"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time-enough.com/home.html |title=Time Enough at Last |publisher=Clock's Ticking Films |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
*The [[personal computer|PC]] game ''[[Fallout Tactics]]'' (2001) includes a librarian in a desolate world who wants the player to find his missing glasses so he can read his books.&lt;ref name="fallout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/fallouttactics/walkthrough/macomb.php |title=Fallout Tactics |work=Game Banshee |accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
*The episode's title was borrowed by a song on [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]'s 1992 album ''[[Code: Selfish]]'' (1992)

===Television===
[[Image:Scary Door Time Enough.jpg|thumb|upright=1.136|alt=A man yelling as his hands and eyes have fallen off.|An episode of ''The Scary Door'' in ''[[Futurama]]'' parodies "Time Enough at Last".]]
*The ''[[Modern Family]]'' episode "Airport 2010" references "Time Enough at Last" when the screen on Jay's electronic reader gets broken. Jay pours the broken glass to the floor while saying "Not fair. It's not fair".
*Episode 12 of [[Revolution (TV series)|''Revolution'']], titled "Ghosts", has Jim Hudson's character who goes by the name of Henry Bemis. Henry (Jim) has become the town librarian, until Miles convinces him to help the rebels and go back to his real name.
*The line, "Seconds, minutes, hours, they crawl by on hands and knees" was referenced to in ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' Season 2 episode, "Speed Demon", where the villain, HIM, torments the Powerpuff Girls before revealing that they have unknowingly arrived 50 years into the future, landing in a Townsville that HIM now controls.
*In the season 14 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Strong Arms of the Ma]]", a postman is accidentally trapped under a car in front of the Simpson house. He intends to read ''The Twilight Zone Magazine'' but discovers that his glasses were broken in the accident while the ''Twilight Zone'' main-theme music is heard in the background.
*''The Scary Door'', a [[show-within-a-show]] on ''[[Futurama]]'' parodying ''The Twilight Zone'', pokes fun at the final twist in "Time Enough at Last". When the man in the episode loses his glasses, he realizes he can still read large print since his eyesight is not as bad as he perceived; his eyes fall out, but he declares he can read [[Braille]]; his hands fall off, and as he screams, his tongue falls out and then his head falls off. [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] comments, "Cursed by his own [[hubris]]."
*The ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Wasted Talent]]" features an end scene similar to the ending of "Time Enough At Last". In the ''Family Guy'' version, a lone brain cell discovers it is the last of its kind (as Peter drank so much alcohol throughout the episode that Brian worries that Peter may have killed his brain cells), and with a book in hand and stacks of other books surrounding him, prepares to begin reading, but looks down and his glasses shatter, after which, dismayed, he picks them up and says " No! It's not fair! There was finally going to be TIME!...", much like what happens to Mr. Bemis.
*The closing credits of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', season 5, episode 1, "Y2K, You're OK", include a parody of the final scene, where Drew is left alone in his bomb shelter with his "literature", in this case pornographic magazines, after the nuclear explosion, only to have his glasses break in the same manner, whereupon he repeated the final lines from Burgess Meredith.
*In the ''[[Fear the Walking Dead]]'' episode "Buried" (Season 4, Episode 4), Nick and Luciana are scavenging in an abandoned library when they see, amid a trail of bloodied books on the floor, a pair of broken spectacles that resemble those belonging to Henry Bemis in "Time Enough At Last." Nearby, they see a zombie who, as a human, had slashed his own wrists, presumably because he could no longer read once his glasses broke.

==Adaptations==
"Time Enough at Last" has been released in numerous formats over the years. 
*In 1988 it was available on [[VHS]] as part of a ''Twilight Zone'' collector's edition.&lt;ref name="1988vhs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BUICWC/ |title=The Twilight Zone |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The story which inspired it has been released in [[eBook]] and [[MP3]] form, capitalizing on the success of the episode.&lt;ref name="mp3" /&gt; 
*In 2003, the Falcon Picture Group produced a series of [[radio drama]]s based on the series—stating, "In the 1950s many radio series were turned into television series – so why not the reverse?"—which were broadcast on about 200 stations through the USA; "Time Enough at Last" was included in volume six.&lt;ref name="radio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twilightzoneradio.com/ |title=Twilight Zone Radio Dramas |publisher=Falcon Picture Group |accessdate=2007-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306025006/http://www.twilightzoneradio.com/ |archivedate=2010-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:kriegerhall.jpg|thumb|[[Murray Krieger]] Hall in the School of Humanities, an example of the [[Brutalist]] architecture of the UC Irvine campus.]]
The '''School of Humanities''' is one of the [[Faculty (division)|academic units]] of the [[University of California, Irvine]]. 
Upon the school's opening in 1965, the '''Division of Humanities''' was one of the five liberal arts divisions that the campus had to offer. Samuel McCulloch was appointed as UC Irvine's founding dean of Humanities 1953.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;https://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/about/history.php&lt;/ref&gt; The School hosts the [[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]]&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; and the [[University of California Humanities Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;http://uchri.org/uchri/about-uchri/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The division of humanities is one of the five liberal arts divisions that opened with the campus in 1965. In 1963, Samuel McCulloch was appointed as the founding dean of UC Irvine Division of Humanities and laid its foundation. Upon the campus' opening day, he created four departments within the divion with a total of thirty-one faculty members. The four departments were: English and Comparative Literature, Foreign Languages and Literature, History, and Philosophy. By 1967, the governing body of UC Irvine turned the five liberal arts divisions into individual schools and the Division of Humanities had become the School of Humanities. In 1970 the Humanities Core Course was implemented and there was a focus on strengthening existing Humanities departments for the rest of the 1970s. The school also launched a doctorate in Critical Theory, making UC Irvine to be the only university in the country to offer a doctorate in the field.
In the 1980s, Dean Ken Bailes founded the Organized Research Unit in Critical Theory and brought the system wide University of California Humanities Research Institute to UC Irvine. The School of Humanities started gaining national recognition and it expanded and grew throughout the 1990s and 2000s. The Humanities Instructional Building and Humanities Gateway were built and completed the Humanities Quad. The school today continues to expand by adding special programs and by creating cross collaboration with different schools on campus. The school has a total of 13 departments and over 20 majors and several interdisciplinary programs.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/about/history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The University of California, Irvine School of Humanities has various programs that are offered to the undergraduate and graduate students. Each program has their own faculty, classes, and events that are aimed to help students develop further into each respective field. Programs in the School of Humanities are among the highest-ranked in the country, contributing to UCI’s reputation as one of the very best public universities. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://uci.edu/academics/humanities.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===African American Studies===
African American Studies is an [[interdisciplinary]] program which offers undergraduate students an opportunity to study those societies and cultures established by the people of the African [[diaspora]]. The program focuses and encourages students to explore the African American experience from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and theoretical approaches. Some topics explored in this program is the process of [[colonization]] and the forced migration of African people, the position of African people in the western  hemisphere, the rhetoric produced by and about African people, and the cultural and [[aesthetic]] values associated with "blackness" and "Africanness." This program offers a B.A. degree program in African American studies and a minor.
&lt;ref name="humanities.uci.edu"&gt;http://www.humanities.uci.edu/esl/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic English===
The Academic English is also known as the [[English as a second or foreign language|English as a Second Language]] Program [[(ESL)]], which offers English language courses for students at UCI. The program offers classes in academic writing, reading and vocabulary development, pronunciation, conversation, and grammar. The goal of the program's courses is to strengthen the English skills of students so they can complete the academic requirements of UCI.
&lt;ref name="humanities.uci.edu"/&gt;

===Culture and Theory===
A Ph.D program offered to graduates in Culture and Theory. The program provides a strong theoretical and critical approach to race, gender, and sexuality studies. The program is most associated with interdisciplinary units in African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Chicano/Latino Studies, and Gender and Sexuality Studies, and works alongside the Critical Theory Emphasis. The program uses a problem-orientated approach to issues of race, gender, and sexuality.
&lt;ref name="humanities.uci.edu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="683">'''Weapon Effects Simulation''' (WES) is the creation of artificial weapons effects such as flashes, bangs and smoke during military training exercises.  It is used in combination with [[Tactical engagement simulation]] (TES), which uses laser projection for training purposes instead of bullets and missiles.  Typically, an accurate laser "shot" hitting a target such as a tank, will trigger cartridge-based WES equipment fitted to the tank which will give a flash, bang and smoke, signifying a hit in the exercise scenario.

'''''Zero Punctuation''''' is a [[Web series|series]] of video game reviews created by English comedy writer and [[Video game journalism|video game journalist]] [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]]. Since the series began in 2007, over 500 episodes have been created, which have been published weekly by internet magazine ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''. Episodes typically range from 5 to 6 minutes in length. Videos provide [[caustic humour]], rapid-fire delivery, [[visual gag]]s and critical insight into recently released video games, with occasional reviews of older games.

== History ==
Prior to Zero Punctuation, Croshaw primarily authored content for his blog, ''Fully Ramblomatic'', and would occasionally review video games, often with an emphasis on humor and criticism.&lt;ref name="fullyramblomatic-reviews"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/reviews/ |title=Reviews on FullyRamblomatic |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |year=2008 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, Croshaw uploaded two game reviews in video format to [[YouTube]] in the same style that would eventually be used for Zero Punctuation: one of the [[Game demo|demo]] of ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]], and the other of ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable: The Lost Chapters]]'' for the [[Personal computer|PC]]. Both were well-received and ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' was one of several publishers to offer Croshaw a contract.&lt;ref name="gamespotinterview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6235040/pressspotting-ramblin-with-ben-yahtzee-croshaw |title=PressSpotting: Ramblin' with Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw |first=Kyle |last=Orland |date=March 22, 2008 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Zero Punctuation" refers to the speed of Croshaw's narration. Since its creation, the series has become popular in the gaming community.&lt;ref name="gamespotinterview" /&gt; Video game developers and publishers have occasionally acknowledged Croshaw's reviews of their games, and at least one [[internet meme]] has resulted from Zero Punctuation.&lt;ref name="kotakumeme"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5307391/infamous-defeats-prototype-in-cross+dressing-playoff |title=inFamous Defeats Prototype in Cross-Dressing Playoff |first=Owen |last=Good |date=July 4, 2009 |work=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamerinterview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/08/05/community-heroes-yahtzee-of-zero-punctuation/ |title=Community heroes: Yahtzee, for Zero Punctuation |first=Tom |last=Francis |date=August 5, 2010 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of every year, Croshaw creates special episodes of Zero Punctuation discussing what he believes were the best and worst games of the year; a practice that started at the end of 2008. He has occasionally dedicated episodes to new technologies or milestones in video gaming rather than games, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] and the coming of the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation of consoles]].&lt;ref name="zpkinect"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/4863-Kinect |title=Zero Punctuation - Kinect |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=October 26, 2011 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/7417-Next-Gen-Buyers-Guide |title=Zero Punctuation - Next Gen Buyer's Guide |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=June 5, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, Yahtzee has released a sub-series of Zero Punctuation, titled "Zero Punctuation’s occasional guide to &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through;"&gt;retarded&lt;/span&gt; special moments in gaming history", where he looks back upon events or periods in gaming that garnered widespread, often infamous, attention; these include the video game ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which helped contribute to the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game industry crash of 1983]], and the controversial ''[[Hot Coffee mod|Hot Coffee]]'' mod for ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E.T. - "The Worst Game Ever"|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/9625-E-T-The-Worst-Game-Ever|website=The Escapist|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Coffee|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/117180-Zero-Punctuation-hot-coffee|website=The Escapist|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2009, Croshaw has also been writing a column on The Escapist known as ''Extra Punctuation''. These articles were originally published every Tuesday and often supplement the previous week's review by discussing a certain topic or trend exhibited by that game. However, after several years writing the column on a weekly basis, Croshaw began to produce entries less frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation|title=Extra Punctuation|publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==

In Zero Punctuation, Croshaw usually reviews a game or games in a highly critical manner using rapid-fire speech delivery accompanied by minimalistic cartoon imagery and animation on a distinctive yellow background, which illustrates what is being said or provides an [[irony|ironic]] counterpoint to it. Subtle references or jokes may be inserted to the visuals for comic effect or to add additional context to the narration. His reviews are intended to be humorous with constant usage of puns, analogies, metaphors, and [[Black comedy|dark humour]] accompanied by liberal use of [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/interview-zero-punctuations-ben-yahtzee-croshaw-reveals-all/|title=Interview: Zero Punctuation's Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw reveals all|first=Nate|last=Lanxon|date=November 4, 2009|website=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/05/zero-punctuation-yahtzee-crys-about-dmc4/|title=Zero Punctuation: Yahtzee cries about DMC4|first=Terrence|last=StasseMarch 5, 2008|website=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|title=Zero Punctuation Review Terrorizes EA Game Development|magazine=[[GameAxis Unwired]]|date=April 2008|issue=55|issn=0219-872X|publisher=[[SPH Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croshaw usually substitutes the main character or himself with his own [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]], a cartoon man distinguished by a [[trilby]]. Another character used often is an [[imp]]-like creature (originally meant to resemble a "darkling" from ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'') which represents antagonists, animals, or less important characters from a video game. Video games, developers, countries, and other entities are often [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] as box arts, logos, or flags with arms and legs when they are being addressed directly, or when an action by that entity is being explained.

Zero Punctuation opens and closes with a [[Theme music|theme song]], a rock track composed and performed by Ian Dorsch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/content/music |title=The Escapist : Sound and Music |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ending credits usually feature humorous notes or other information relating to the review, as well as imagery of characters from the review engaging in [[slapstick]], however in 2014, the videos posted on YouTube omit the credit sequences. Prior to mid-2008, Zero Punctuation featured commercial songs at the beginning and end of each episode, which were usually related to the context of, or at odds with the game in question, such as [[Ramones|The Ramones]]' "[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]" and [[Eric Johnson]]'s "[[Cliffs of Dover (composition)|Cliffs of Dover]]" at the beginning and end, respectively, of his review of ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''.

The series' format has proved inspirational for several other web series, such as the critical and educational series [[Extra Credits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Floyd|first=Daniel|title=Video Games and Storytelling|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jdG2LHair0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CGP Grey]].&lt;ref name="H.I. #13: Nobody Owns the Facts"&gt;{{cite podcast|last2=Grey|first2=CGP|last1=Haran|first1=Brady|title=Nobody Owns the Facts|url=http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/13|work=Hello Internet|number=13|publisher=Hellointernet.fm|accessdate=2014-06-17|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://www.relay.fm/cortex/10 |title=Cortex #10: Zero Artistic Skills |website=Cortex |publisher=Relay FM |host=Grey, C.

Croshaw, more often than not, provides highly critical reviews of games, usually pointing out the faults that he implies other professional reviewers ignore in high-profile releases.&lt;ref name="pcgamerinterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mailbag"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/37-Mailbag-Showdown |title=Zero Punctuation - Mailbag Showdown |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=May 7, 2008 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tends to disdain certain overused tropes and conventions in video games, such as [[quick time event]]s, highly common uses of [[Motion controller|motion controls]], [[cover system|cover-based shooting]] and unbalanced emphasis on [[Video game graphics|graphics]] over story or [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="zpkinect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zpuncharted"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/27-Uncharted-Drakes-Fortune |title = ZeroPunctuation - Uncharted: Drake's Fortune |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=February 27, 2008 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zptlou"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/7638-The-Last-of-Us |title=Zero Punctuation - The Last of Us |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=July 3, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also disapproves of game franchises that release sequels in rapid succession, such as ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'', and ''[[Call of Duty]]''.&lt;ref name="zptop5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/8642-Top-5-Games-of-2013 |title=Zero Punctuation - Top 5 Games of 2013 |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 1, 2014 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croshaw generally does not review certain genres of games, and has openly admitted to not liking most [[Japanese role-playing game|JRPG]]s, [[real-time strategy]] games, [[fighting game]]s, or [[Simulation video game|simulation games]]. More recently{{When|date=August 2018}}, he has begun disliking military-themed [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[Medal of Honor (video game series)|Medal of Honor]]'', and ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'' for being what he believes to be extremely similar in gameplay, poor in ethics, and contrived in story, while using the moniker "spunkgargleweewee" to differentiate them from other styles of first-person shooter game.&lt;ref name="zp2012"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6677-Top-5-of-2012 |title=Zero Punctuation - Top 5 of 2012 |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 2, 2013 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/2486-Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops |title=Zero Punctuation - Call of Duty: Black Ops |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=September 5, 2007 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Croshaw|first1=Ben|date=November 7, 2012|title=Zero Punctuation - Medal of Honor Warfighter &amp; Doom 3 BFG Edition|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6492-Medal-of-Honor-Warfighter-Doom-3-BFG-Edition|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often criticizes publishers or developers with practices that he believes are in some way damaging to [[video games industry]] or otherwise unacceptable, such as [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="destructoid"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-ben-yahtzee-croshaw-69631.phtml |title=Destructoid interview: Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw |date=February 11, 2008 |work=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Zero Punctuation episodes are usually intended to highlight Croshaw's criticisms of video games, his general opinions are not universally negative, and any positive feelings towards the aspects of a game will usually be explicitly stated.&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt; A number of video games have received favorable ''Zero Punctuation'' reviews, which include some of his all-time favorite games such as ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'', ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', and ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reddit AMAA |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/glt5k/iam_yahtzee_croshaw_off_of_the_escapists_zero/c1ojct7 |title=IAM Yahtzee Croshaw off of the Escapist's Zero Punctuation, AMAA |publisher=[[Reddit.com]] |date= |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Silent Hill 2|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/878-Silent-Hill-2|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Prince of Persia Retrospective|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/183-Prince-of-Persia-Retrospective|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation - Shadow of the Colossus|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/1924-Shadow-of-the-Colossus|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croshaw had no criticisms for another favorite, the video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Puncation - The Orange Box|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/10-The-Orange-Box|website=The Escapist|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although by the time ''[[Portal 2 (video game)|Portal 2]]'' was released approximately 4 years later, he stated that the only flaw of the first ''Portal'' was its fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Puncation - Portal 2|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/3153-Portal-2|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened his review of ''[[BioShock]]'' by saying "nobody likes it when I'm being nice to a game," referring to the negative reception of his favorable review of ''[[Psychonauts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/4-BioShock |title=Zero Punctuation - BioShock |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=November 24, 2010 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croshaw cites the work of British television critic and PC Zone journalist [[Charlie Brooker]] as the "main inspiration" for his own reviewing style, as well as the writings of [[Douglas Adams]], Sean "[[Seanbaby]]" Riley, [[Victor Lewis-Smith]], and [[Old Man Murray]]'s [[Chet Faliszek]] and [[Erik Wolpaw]].&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/games/interview-zero-punctuations-yahtzee-572875/ |title=Interview: Zero Punctuation’s Yahtzee |first=James |last=Schneider |date=February 14, 2008 |work=[[Geek.com]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/videos/zeropunctuation/2655-Yahtzee-Visits-Valve-a-Travelogue.2 |title=Yahtzee Visits Valve, a Travelogue |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=November 21, 2007 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed respect towards the late [[Roger Ebert]], noting that he "might one day aspire to being his videogaming equivalent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/7473-Videogames-as-Art |title=Extra Punctuation - Videogames as Art |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=April 27, 2010 |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games of the Year==
At the end of each year since 2008, Croshaw has created episodes of Zero Punctuation showcasing his favorite and most disliked games reviewed in that year. These episodes systematically alternate between his selections for the five best and five worst of the year in ascending order. In 2008 and 2009, however, these were done in a mock awards format. In 2015, he added a new category concerning the blandest and least innovative games of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCFGU79rX34 |title=Top 5 Games of 2015 (Zero Punctuation) |first=Ben |last=Croshaw |date=January 13, 2016 |work=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2013 lists, he also awarded the "Lifetime Achievement Award for Total Abhorrence" to ''[[Ride to Hell: Retribution]]'', expressing that it was so poor in quality that he hardly considered it a game but rather saw it as "congealed failure". He also stated that the game would indefinitely hold the award until a worse game came along, which he claims "should roughly be around the time [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|apes have retaken the earth.]]"&lt;ref name="zptop5" /&gt;

In 2015 he created a category where he gave his top five blandest games of 2015, which he felt had not added anything new or fresh to the franchise they were a part of. He rated [[Halo 5: Guardians]] as the year's blandest game. [[Undertale]] was awarded his Game of the Year but which had not been given its own Zero Punctuation episode beforehand. Having stated before the awards began that all games mentioned must have already been reviewed by him, he promptly gave his own last-minute opinion by merely stating "Undertale is a good game".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Zero Punctuation : Top 5 Games of 2015|url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/116617-Top-5-Best-and-Worst-Games-of-2015|website = The Escapist|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Zero Punctuation has received generally positive reviews, with much of the praise centered towards Yahtzee's sharp wit and style of comedic writing. As of October 2018, the series has an IMDB rating of 7.7 from 409 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation (2007-)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2793136/|website=IMDB|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boing Boing]] called the series "hilariously cutting ... first legitimate breakout hit from the gaming community in recent memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Punctuation|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation|website=The Escapist|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
