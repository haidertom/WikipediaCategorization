The '''Bishop Arts District''' is a small shopping and entertainment district in north [[Oak Cliff]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]), near the intersection of Bishop Street and Davis Street.  Bishop Arts is immediately southwest of [[Downtown Dallas]].

== About ==
The area was originally developed as warehouses and shops in the 1920s.  In the 1930s, a trolley stop along Davis became Dallas' busiest trolley stop.  The district began a decline in the mid-60's through the beginning of the 80's. The reasons for the decline included the rise of the shopping mall, the loss of sizable tenants such as Astor theater and Goodier Cosmetics, neighborhood demographic changes and finally the fact that buses began to replace streetcars making trolley stops like Bishop and Seventh useless.

In the fall of 1984, Jim Lake saw a bargain in the now run down storefronts and began buying up property. He said, "Hopefully we'll make money on this in the future, but in the first three to five years I'm gonna feed it." Lake said of his decision to buy the property, "I just thought it needed saving." As a sign of his commitment, Lake provided, rent-free for a year, space for a police storefront. This was an important element in the area's security and sense of community. Continuing through the 1990s and 2000s, renovations have taken place to transform the two city blocks into a walkable, urban environment, although the surrounding area has yet to undergo revitalization. Murals, brick pavers, and other street elements have polished the rough look of the warehouses and have made the area a popular leisure and dining destination.&lt;ref name="bishopartsdistrict.com"&gt;[http://www.bishopartsdistrict.com Bishop Arts District] - Main page.  Retrieved 25 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area culture has continued to mature with the expanding Oak Cliff Film Festival, which has garnered media attention from Texas Monthly and New York Times.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/us/dallas-has-its-own-indie-film-scene-and-now-a-festival.html] - News Article. Retrieved 13 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the district is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[North Bishop Avenue Commercial Historic District]].

In the painting, a bridal procession crosses a [[fjord]] in boats, after the wedding. The groom, [[Hat tip|tipping his hat]], can be seen in the first boat; the bride, in her [[bridal crown]], is in the second. The boat crew are dressed in [[Bunad|typical Bunad costumes]].

[[File:Clive Bell.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Clive Bell by [[Roger Fry]] (1924 c.)]]

'''Arthur Clive Heward Bell''' (16 September 1881 – 17 September 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/abstract/10.1093/acref/9780199754694.001.0001/acref-9780199754694-e-179|title=Bell, Arthur Clive Heward - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754694.001.0001/acref-9780199754694-e-179|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English [[art critic]], associated with [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] and the [[Bloomsbury Group]].

==Biography==
===Origins===
Bell was born in [[Great Shefford|East Shefford]], Berkshire, in 1881, the third of four children of William Heward Bell (1849–1927) and Hannah Taylor Cory (1850–1942). He had an elder brother ([[William Cory Heward Bell|Cory]]), an elder sister (Lorna, Mrs Acton), and a younger sister (Dorothy, Mrs Hony). His father was a civil engineer who built his fortune in the family coal mines in [[Wiltshire]] in England and [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in Wales – "a family which drew its wealth from Welsh mines and expended it on the destruction of wild animals".&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Quentin ''Bloomsbury'', London: Futura 1974, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; They lived at Cleeve House, [[Seend]], near [[Devizes]], Wiltshire, which was adorned with Squire Bell's many hunting trophies.

===Marriage and other liaisons===
He was educated at the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] [[Marlborough College]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BL899AC|name=Bell &lt;nowiki&gt;[post Clive-Bell]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Arthur Clive Heward}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied history. In 1902 he received an Earl of Derby scholarship to study in Paris, where his interest in art originated. Upon his return to England, he moved to London, where he met and married artist [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa Stephen]], sister of [[Virginia Woolf]], early in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070427090745/http://www.infobritain.co.uk/Virginia_Woolf_Biography_And_Visits.htm Virginia Woolf biography and visits], infobritain.co.uk; accessed 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yomCB&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=Myg8XQLso2%2FEgA9%2FcYHFzA&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry: Bell Arthur Clive H.| accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Transcription of English and Welsh marriage registrations 1837–1983|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yomVS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=fuHZxw%2F0iO%2BQ1Jtk%2BoF00A&amp;scan=1| title=Index entry: Stephen Vanessa| accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Transcription of English and Welsh marriage registrations 1837–1983| publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clive and Vanessa had two sons, [[Julian Bell|Julian]] and [[Quentin Bell|Quentin]], who both became writers. Julian joined the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] side in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as an ambulance driver and was killed in 1937 by an enemy shell, aged 29.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hermione ''Virginia Woolf'', London: Vintage 1997 p. 697&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[World War I]] their marriage was over. Vanessa had begun a lifelong relationship with [[Duncan Grant]], and Clive had a number of liaisons with other women including Mary Hutchinson. However, Clive and Vanessa never officially separated or divorced. Not only did they visit each other regularly, they also sometimes spent holidays together and paid "family" visits to Clive's parents. Clive lived in London but often spent long stretches of time at the farmhouse of [[Charleston, Sussex]], where Vanessa lived with Duncan and her three children by Clive and Duncan. He fully supported her wish to have a child by Duncan and allowed his wife's only daughter, Angelica, to bear his surname.

Vanessa's daughter by Duncan, [[Angelica Garnett]] (née Bell), was raised as Clive's daughter until she married. She was informed, by her mother Vanessa, just prior to her marriage and shortly after her brother Julian's death, that Duncan Grant was her biological father.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hermione ''Virginia Woolf'', London: Vintage 1997 p. 698. This deception forms the central message of her memoir, ''Deceived with Kindness'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
According to historian Stanley Rosenbaum, "Bell may, indeed, be the least liked member of Bloomsbury... Bell has been found wanting by biographers and critics of the Group – as a husband, a father, and especially a brother-in-law. It is undeniable that he was a wealthy snob, hedonist, and womaniser, a racist and an anti-Semite (but not a homophobe), who changed from a liberal socialist and pacifist into a reactionary appeaser. Bell's reputation has led to his being underestimated in the history of Bloomsbury...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.P. Rosenbaum|title=Georgian Bloomsbury: Volume 3: The Early Literary History of the Bloomsbury Group, 1910–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pyl9DAAAQBAJ|year=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-0-230-50512-4|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significant form===
Soon after Bell met [[Roger Fry]], he developed his art theory called "significant form". The two shared a passion for contemporary French art. Bell's book ''Art'' (1914) was the first publication of his theory, which he describes as "lines and colours combined in a particular way, certain forms, and relations of forms, that stir our aesthetic emotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HFFAQAAMAAJ|title=Art|last=Bell|first=Clive|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|year=1916|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form can be seen in art created by many members of the Bloomsbury Group, an example being ''Interior at Gordon Square'' by Duncan Grant.

==Political views==
Bell was at one point an adherent of absolute pacifism, and during the [[First World War]] was a [[conscientious objector]], allowed to perform Work of National Importance by assisting on the farm of [[Philip Morrell]] [[Member of parliament|MP]], at Garsington Manor. In his 1938 pamphlet ''War Mongers'', he opposed any attempt by Britain to use military force, arguing "the worst tyranny is better than the best war."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sellers, ''The Cambridge Companion to Virginia Woolf'' Cambridge University Press, 2010; {{ISBN|0521896940}}, (p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lj"&gt;Lawrence James, ''Warrior Race: A History of the British at War'', Hachette UK, 2010; {{ISBN|0748125353}} (p. 620).&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1940 Bell was a supporter of the British war effort, calling for a "ceaseless war against Hitler".&lt;ref name="lj"/&gt;

The '''Courtauld Institute of Art''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɔər|t|əʊ|l|d|}}), commonly referred to as '''The Courtauld''', is a self-governing college of the [[University of London]] specialising in the study of the [[history of art]] and [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]]. It is among the most prestigious institutions in the world for these disciplines and is widely known for the disproportionate number of directors of major museums drawn from its small body of alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaplin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Sociology and Visual Representation|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415073626|pages=53-56}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spect/&gt; 

The art collection of the Institute is known particularly for its [[Impressionism|French Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] paintings and is housed in the [[Courtauld Gallery]]. 

The Institute and the Gallery are both in [[Somerset House]], in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[London]].

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1932 through the philanthropic efforts of the industrialist and art collector [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], the diplomat and collector [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Lord Lee of Fareham]], and the art historian Sir [[Robert Witt (art historian)|Robert Witt]]. 

Originally the Courtauld Institute was based in [[Home House]], a [[Robert Adam]]-designed townhouse in London's [[Portman Square]].  The Strand block of Somerset House, designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] from 1775–1780, has housed the Courtauld Institute since 1989. The Courtauld celebrated its 75th anniversary during the 2007–08 academic year.

==Academic profile==
The Courtauld Institute of Art is the major centre for the study of the history and conservation of art and architecture in the United Kingdom. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate teaching to around 400 students each year.&lt;ref name=court2/&gt; Degrees are awarded by the University of London.

The Courtauld was ranked first in the United Kingdom for History and History of Art in ''[[The Guardian]]'' 's 2011 University Guide and was confirmed in this rank for research quality in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;&lt;ref name=ref/&gt; [[The Independent]] has called it "probably the most prestigious specialist college for the study of the history of art in the world."&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

The Courtauld was ranked, again, first in the United Kingdom for History and History of Art in ''[[The Guardian]]''’s 2017 University Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2016/may/23/university-league-tables-2017#S345|title=University University league tables 2017 – the full rankings|work=The Guardian|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

According to the 2014 [[Research Excellence Framework]], the Courtauld hosts the highest proportion of the UK's world-leading and internationally excellent research out of all higher education institutions with 95% of research rated in the top two categories (4*/3*), 56% of which was rated in the 4* category, tied for highest in the UK with [[London Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2014/dec/18/university-research-excellence-framework-2014-full-rankings|title=University Research Excellence Framework 2014 – the full rankings|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate study===
The only undergraduate course offered by the Courtauld is a BA in the History of Art. This is a full-time course designed to introduce students to all aspects of the study of western art.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Postgraduate study===

Several taught courses are offered at postgraduate level: [[master's degrees]] in history of art, [[curator|curating]] the [[art museum]], the history of [[Buddhist art]], and the [[conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of [[mural|wall painting]] are taught alongside diploma courses in the conservation of easel paintings and the history of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courtauld.ac.uk/study/postgraduate|title=Postgraduate Taught Courses|work= The Courtauld Institute of Art|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the history of art master's programme have to choose a specialisation ranging from antiquity to early modern to global contemporary artwork. Special options are taught in small class sizes of 5–10 students, allowing an optimal discussion between faculty members and students.

===Study resources===
The Courtauld has two photographic libraries which started as the private collections of two benefactors: the Conway Library, covering [[architecture (built environment)|architecture]], architectural drawings, sculpture and [[illuminated manuscript]]s, named after the [[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|Lord Conway of Allington]] and the Witt Library, after [[Robert Witt (art historian)|Sir Robert Witt]], covering paintings, drawings and [[engraving]]s and containing over two million reproductions of works by over 70,000 artists.&lt;ref name=court3/&gt; In 2009, it was decided that the Witt Library would not continue to add new material to the collection.&lt;ref name=artlyst/&gt; The book library is one of the UK's largest archives of art history books, periodicals and exhibition catalogues. There is a slide library which also covers films, and an IT suite.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

An online image collection provides access to more than 40,000 images, including paintings and drawings from the Courtauld Gallery, and over 35,000 photographs of architecture and sculpture from the Conway Library.&lt;ref name=artandarch/&gt; Two other websites and sell high resolution digital files to scholars, publishers and broadcasters, and photographic prints to a wide public audience.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;&lt;ref name=prints/&gt;

The Courtauld uses a [[virtual learning environment]] to deliver course material to its students.&lt;ref name=vle/&gt; Since 2004, the Courtauld has published an annual research journal, [[immediations]], edited by current members of the research student body. Each cover of the journal has been commissioned by a leading contemporary artist.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Courtauld Gallery==
{{main|Courtauld Gallery}}
[[File:Edouard Manet, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère.jpg|thumb|right|''[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]]'' (1882) by [[Édouard Manet]]]]
The art collection of the Institute is housed in the Courtauld Gallery. The collection was begun by the founder of the Institute, [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], who presented an extensive collection of mainly [[Impressionism|French Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] paintings in 1932. It was enhanced by further gifts in the 1930s and a bequest in 1948, and has since received many significant donations and bequests. The Gallery contains some 530 paintings and over 26,000 drawings and prints.&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt;

The Courtauld Gallery is open to the public. Since 1989 it has been housed in the Strand block of Somerset House, which was the first home of the [[Royal Academy]], founded in 1768. In April 2013 the Head of the Courtauld Gallery was [[Ernst Vegelin]].

'''Czech Cubism''' (referred to more generally as '''Cubo-Expressionism''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4CTBWci4Ld4C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=cubo-expressionism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_vS03HwQ3P&amp;sig=kRBy4DIa3Kh4EK_zGYUQ6JmLnAI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rsjEU9SyAuey7AaquICYDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=cubo-expressionism&amp;f=false Craig Stephen Cravens, ''Culture and Customs of the Czech Republic and Slovaki'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006] {{ISBN|0313334129}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[avant-garde]] [[art movement]] of [[Czechs|Czech]] proponents of [[Cubism]], active mostly in [[Prague]] from 1912 to 1914. Prague was perhaps the most important center for Cubism outside Paris before the start of World War One.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FnjwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Prague+was+to+be+perhaps+the+most%22&amp;dq=%22Prague+was+to+be+perhaps+the+most%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3_qeUbLAJ4mL4gT83oHQCg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA Sadakat Kadri, ''Prague'', Cadogan, Jun 20, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=coop&gt;Cooper, Philip. ''Cubism''. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 102. {{ISBN|0714832502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
Members of this movement realized the epochal significance of the cubism of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] and attempted to extract its components for their own work in all branches of artistic creativity: [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[applied arts]] and [[architecture]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The most notable participants in this movement were the painters [[František Kupka]] (whose interests were rooted more in abstraction), [[Emil Filla]], [[Bohumil Kubišta]], [[Antonín Procházka (painter)|Antonín Procházka]], [[Vincenc Beneš]], and [[Josef Čapek]], the sculptor [[Otto Gutfreund]], the writer [[Karel Čapek]], and the architects [[Pavel Janák]], [[Josef Gočár]], [[Vlastislav Hofman]] and [[Josef Chochol]]. Many of these artists were members of the [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts]].  A major division in Czech architecture occurred after 1912 when many young avant-garde artists from [[Jan Kotĕra]] and his circle divorced themselves from the Mánes Association.  These younger architects were more idealistic in their outlook and criticized the strict rationalism of their forebears, [[Otto Wagner]] and Kotĕra.  Janák, Gočár, and Hofman founded the group [[Skupina výtvarných umĕlců]] (Group of Plastic Artists) and established a journal for the group, [[Umĕlecký mĕsíčník]] (Artistic Monthly).

After [[Czechoslovakia]]'s founding in 1918, architectural Czech Cubism gradually developed into [[Czech Rondocubism]], which was more decorative, as it was influenced by traditional folk ornaments to celebrate the revival of Czech national independence.

==Concept==
Czech Cubists distinguish their work through the construction of sharp points, slicing planes, and crystalline shapes in their art works. These angles allowed the Czech Cubists to incorporate their own trademark in the avant-garde art group of [[Modernism]]. They believed that objects carried their own inner energy which could only be released by splitting the horizontal and vertical surfaces that restrain the conservative design and “ignore the needs of the human soul.”  It was a way to revolt from the typical art scene in the early 1900s in Europe. This evolved into a new [[art movement]], referred to generally as Cubo-Expressionism; combining the fragmentation of form seen in [[Cubism]] with the emotionalism of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mwf6RVGYLjgC&amp;pg=PT415&amp;dq=cubo-expressionism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qcrEU9y4GvCY0QXOqICAAg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=cubo-expressionism&amp;f=false Ian Chilvers, John Glaves-Smith, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', Oxford University Press, 2009] {{ISBN|0199239657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Czech Cubism developed between 1911 and 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.czkubismus.cz/en/czech-cubism-and-its-representatives|title=Czech Cubism and Its Representatives|last=s.r.o.|first=NETservis|website=Czech cubism|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a contemporary development of functionalism generated by architects and designers in Prague. Fifteen years later, the first concept of cubism itself was written off as a decorative purpose, a replacement of [[Art Nouveau|secessionism]] and mistaken departure into ‘aestheticism’ and ‘individualism’. On the contrary, it was a revolt against traditional values of [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. 
  
Czech Cubism was first conceal by the Modern Movement and masked by the aesthetic dictates of Stalinist and post-Stalinist culture in Czechoslovakia. After the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989 and the post modern attraction of ornamentation and decoration, there came to be a rise of fascination in [[Czech culture]] and its own unique forms of cubism. Czech Cubism developed paradoxically as both a product of Czech bourgeois affluence and as an avant-garde rejection of secessionist designers such as Otto Wagner and [[Jan Kotěra]]. Architects such as Josef Chochol and Pavel Janák devised spiritualist philosophies of design and a dynamic ideal of planar form derived from cubist art. As Cubism spread across the European continent in the early 20th century, its greatest impact can be seen today in the [[Czech Republic]]. Pyramid and crystal forms were one of the signature principles seen in Czech Cubism which was incorporated in architecture, furniture, and applied arts.

== Exhibitions ==
The [[Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague|Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague (UPM)]] uses the [[House of the Black Madonna]] as a permanent exhibition space for Czech Cubist art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.czkubismus.cz/en/|title=Czech cubism|last=s.r.o.|first=NETservis|website=Czech cubism|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book==
The subjects covered by Piero della Francesca in these writings include [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and innovative work in both [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref name=D&gt;[http://www.codicesillustres.com/catalogue/de_prospectiva_pingendi/], Codices Illustres&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The script consists of three parts:

* Part One ''Disegno'', describing techniques for painting faces
* Part Two ''Commensurazio'', describing perspectives
* Part Three ''Coloro'', describing techniques for creating perspectives by using colours

==History==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

''De Prospectiva Pingendi'' was probably created in the years between 1474 until 1482.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit13/unit13.html#Francesca], Dartmouth College&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428630/On-Perspective-in-Painting], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The writings were inspired by the book ''[[De pictura]]'' by [[Leon Battista Alberti]]&lt;ref name=A/&gt; written in 1435&lt;ref name=B/&gt; but probably also by works by [[Euclid]].&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329120658/http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}, Computer Animation Lab&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript later came into the possession of the [[Biblioteca Palatina]] in [[Parma]]&lt;ref name=E/&gt; before it was transferred to the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

Much of Piero’s work was later absorbed into the writing of others, notably [[Luca Pacioli]]. Piero’s work on solid geometry appears in Pacioli’s ''[[De divina proportione]]'', a work illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

In 1899 the writings were first published in bookform.&lt;ref name=C&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bnh3FKIKT9AC&amp;pg=PA606&amp;lpg=PA606&amp;dq=De+prospectiva+pingendi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=44K40GH0dO&amp;sig=TW1qcfzitd7mGdpO-mIdCIl3FAw&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=l4DBS43YHOGkOKGZ5JYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=De%20prospectiva%20pingendi&amp;f=false], Google Books.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7971">'''Depletion gilding''' is a method for producing a layer of nearly pure [[gold]] on an object made of gold alloy by removing the other metals from its surface.&lt;ref name="Never Judge A Gold Object by Its Surface Analysis: A Study of Surface Phenomena in a Selection of Gold Objects From the Staffordshire Hoard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blakelock|first1=E. S.|title=Never Judge A Gold Object by Its Surface Analysis: A Study of Surface Phenomena in a Selection of Gold Objects From the Staffordshire Hoard|journal=Archaeometry|date=2015|pages=912–929|doi=10.1111/arcm.12209|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as a "surface enrichment" process.&lt;ref&gt;The Surface Enrichment of Carat Gold Alloys - Depletion Gilding. Mark Grimwade in Gold Technology, Issue 26; July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Most [[gilding]] methods are additive: they deposit gold that was not there before onto the surface of an object. By contrast, depletion gilding is a subtractive process whereby material is removed to increase the purity of gold that is already present on an object's surface.

In depletion gilding, other metals are etched away from the surface of an object composed of a gold alloy by the use of acids or salts, often in combination with heat. Since no gold is added, only an object made of an alloy that already contains gold can be depletion gilded.

Depletion gilding relies on the fact that gold is highly resistant to oxidation or corrosion by most common chemicals, whereas many other metals are not. Depletion gilding is most often used to treat alloys of gold with [[copper]] or [[silver]]. Unlike gold, both copper and silver readily react with a variety of chemicals. For example, [[nitric acid]] is effective as an etching agent for both copper and silver. Under the proper circumstances, even ordinary [[table salt]] will react with either metal.

The object to be gilded is coated, immersed, or packed in a suitable acid or salt, and usually heated to speed the process. These chemicals then attack the metallic copper and silver in the object's surface, transforming it to various copper and silver compounds. The resulting copper and silver compounds can be removed from the object's surface by a number of processes. Washing, chemical leaching, heating, or even physical absorption by porous materials such as brick dust have all been used historically. Meanwhile, the relatively inert gold is left unaffected. The result is a thin layer of nearly pure gold on the surface of the original object.

There is no well-defined minimum gold content required to successfully depletion gild an object. However, the less gold that is present, the more other material must be etched away to produce the desired surface appearance.  In addition, the removal of the other metals usually leaves the surface covered with microscopic voids and pits. This can make the surface soft and "spongy" with a dull or matte appearance. This effect becomes more pronounced as more base metal is removed. For this reason, most depletion gilded objects are [[Burnishing (metal)|burnished]] to make their surfaces more durable and give them a more attractive polished finish.

Like other gilding processes, depletion gilding provides a way to produce the appearance of pure gold without its disadvantages: its cost and rarity, and its softness and denseness. By producing a layer of gold over a layer of copper or other metal, objects can be made that are lighter, sturdier, and cheaper while still appearing to be nearly pure gold.

==Variations==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Keum-boo]] --&gt;
The term depletion gilding usually refers to the production of a layer of gold. However, it can also be used to produce a layer that is an alloy of gold and silver, sometimes referred to as [[electrum]]. Certain chemicals, such as [[oxalic acid]], attack copper but do not affect either silver or gold. Using such a chemical, it is possible to remove only the copper in an alloy, leaving both silver and the gold behind. Thus, if the original object is composed of copper, silver, and gold, it can be given a gold surface by removing both silver and copper, or an electrum surface by removing only the copper.

Likewise, with an appropriate chemical, a layer of nearly pure silver can be produced on an object made of copper and silver. For instance, [[sterling silver]] can be depleted—'depletion silvering'—to produce a [[fine silver]] surface, perhaps as preamble to application of gold, as in the [[Keum-boo]] technique.

However, in the majority of cases depletion gilding is in fact used to produce a gold finish, rather than one of electrum or silver.

==Applications==
Depletion gilding is a decorative process, with no significant industrial applications. It is not widely used in modern times, having been superseded by processes more suited to mass production, such as [[electroplating]]. Some individual artisans and small shops continue to practice it.

However, depletion gilding was widely used in antiquity.&lt;ref name="BatesLiddiard2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bates|author2=Robert Liddiard|title=East Anglia and Its North Sea World in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFDoCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246|date=18 June 2015|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd.|isbn=978-1-78327-036-1|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it requires skill to execute it well, the process itself is technologically simple, and uses materials that are readily available to most ancient civilizations. Some form of depletion gilding has been used by nearly every culture that developed metalworking. The South American [[Sican culture|Sican]] culture in particular developed depletion gilding to a high art.&lt;ref&gt;Precious Metal Objects of the Middle Sican. Izumi Shamada and Jo Ann Griffin in Scientific American Special, Volume 15, Number 1, pages 80-89; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient alloys, such as [[tumbaga]], may have been developed specifically for use in depletion gilding. The technique was not known to be used by [[Anglo-Saxons]] until detailed examination with electron microscopes of treasures such as the [[Staffordshire Hoard]] revealed its use in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/news/britains-greatest-treasure-hoard-reveals-how-goldsmiths-cheated-their-saxon-clients-9799977.html Britain's greatest treasure hoard reveals how goldsmiths fooled the Anglo-Saxon world]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/17/staffordshire-hoard-anglo-saxon-gold-secret-technique-treasure&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbican Research Associates"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blakelock|first1=Eleanor|title=Contextualising Metal-Detected Discoveries: Staffordshire Anglo-Saxon Hoard|url=http://www.barbicanra.co.uk/assets/pd-appendix-3-scientific-analysis.pdf|publisher=Barbican Research Associates|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain cultures are thought to have attached mythical or spiritual significance to the process. Gold was considered sacred in many early civilizations and was highly valued in nearly all of them, and anything relating to it had the potential to take on cultural importance. Moreover, the ability to turn what appeared to be an object made of copper into what seemed to be pure gold would be very impressive. There is some speculation that depletion gilding may have contributed to the concepts of [[alchemy]], a major goal of which was to physically transform one metal into another.

'''Eroticism''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]  ἔρως, ''[[Eros (love)|eros]]''—"desire") is a quality that causes [[Human sexuality|sexual]] feelings,&lt;ref name=merriam&gt;{{cite web |title=Eroticism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eroticism|work=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a philosophical contemplation concerning the [[aesthetic]]s of sexual desire, [[sensuality]] and [[romantic love]]. That quality may be found in any form of artwork, including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[glamor photography|photography]], [[drama]], [[erotic film|film]], [[music]] or [[erotic literature|literature]]. It may also be found in [[Sex in advertising|advertising]]. The term may also refer to a state of [[sexual arousal]]&lt;ref name=merriam /&gt; or anticipation of such – an insistent sexual [[impulse (psychology)|impulse]], [[libido|desire]], or pattern of thoughts.

As French novelist [[Honoré de Balzac]] stated, eroticism is dependent not just upon an individual's [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]], but also the culture and time in which an individual resides.&lt;ref&gt;Balzac, "The Physiology of Marriage" (1826), trans. Sharon Marcus (1997), Aphorism XXVI, 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grande, L., "Laws and Attitudes towards Homosexuality from Antiquity to the Modern Era", Ponte 43:4-5 (1987), pp. 122-129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier, Albert, "La sodomie dans le droit canonique medieval" in L'Erotisme au Moyen Age: Etudes presentees au IIe Colloque de l'Institut d'Etudes Medievales, 3-4 Avril 1976, ed. Roy, Bruno (Montreal: Ed. Aurore, 1977), pp. 109-122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Because the nature of what is erotic is fluid,&lt;ref&gt;Evans, David T., Sexual Citizenship: The Material Construction of Sexualities, (New York: Routledge, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; early definitions of the term attempted to conceive eroticism as some form of sensual or romantic love or as the human sex drive ([[libido]]); for example, the ''Encyclopédie'' of 1755 states that the erotic "is an epithet which is applied to everything with a connection to the love of the sexes; one employs it particularly to characterize...a dissoluteness, an excess".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopédie'' (1755), quoted in Lynn Hunt ed., ''Eroticism and the Body Politic'' (London 1991) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because eroticism is wholly dependent on the viewer's culture and personal tastes pertaining to what, exactly, defines the erotic,&lt;ref&gt;Foster. Jeannette H., Sex Variant Women in Literature: A Historical and Quantitative Survey 2nd ed., (New York: Vantage Press, 1956) (repr. Baltimore: Diana Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, M., &amp; A. Bell, Homosexuality: An Annotated Bibliography, (New York: 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; critics have often{{how often|date=June 2018}} confused eroticism with [[pornography]], with anti-smut activist [[Andrea Dworkin]] saying, "Erotica is simply high-class pornography; better produced, better conceived, better executed, better packaged, designed for a better class of consumer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pornography: Men Possessing Women |last=Dworkin |first=Andrea |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-399-12619-2 |pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion, as [[Lynn Hunt]] writes, "demonstrate the difficulty of drawing… a clear generic demarcation between the erotic and the pornographic": indeed arguably "the history of the separation of pornography from eroticism… remains to be written".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., ''Eroticism'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological evolution ==
Whereas traditionally eroticism has been dealt with in relation to culture and its pornographic outcomes, current evolutionary psychology shows how eroticism has shaped the evolution of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature|last=Miller|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Vintage|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytical approach==
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (8).jpg|thumb|left|An erotic scene from ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' by French illustrator [[Édouard-Henri Avril]]]]
For a [[psychoanalytical]] definition, as early as [[Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Dollmore, Jonathan, Sexual Dissidence: Ausgutine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault, (Oxford: Clarendon, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; psychotherapists have turned to the ancient Greek philosophy's "overturning of mythology"{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} as a definition to understanding of the heightened [[aesthetic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., Eroticism p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Plato]], [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] takes an almost [[transcendent (philosophy)|transcendent]] manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the objectival other: "the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty".&lt;ref&gt;"The Symposium", in Benjamin Jowett trans, ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 746&lt;/ref&gt;

==French philosophy==
Modern French conceptions of eroticism can be traced to [[The Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;Coward, D.A., "Attitudes to Homosexuality in Eighteenth Century France", Journal of European Studies 10, pp. 236 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; when "in the eighteenth century, dictionaries defined the erotic as that which concerned love...eroticism was the intrusion into the public sphere of something that was at base private".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., ''Eroticism'' p. 3 and p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This theme of intrusion or transgression was taken up in the twentieth century by the French philosopher [[Georges Bataille]], who argued that eroticism performs a function of dissolving boundaries between human subjectivity and humanity, a transgression that dissolves the rational world but is always temporary,&lt;ref&gt;L'érotisme, by Georges Bataille, Paris (1957: UK publication 1962) {{ISBN|978-2-7073-0253-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as that, "Desire in eroticism is the desire that triumphs over the taboo. It presupposes man in conflict with himself".&lt;ref&gt;George Bataille, ''Eroticism'' (Penguin 2001) p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; For Bataille, as well as many French theorists, "Eroticism, unlike simple sexual activity, is a psychological quest...eroticism is assenting to life even in death".&lt;ref&gt;Bataille, ''Eroticism'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-heterosexual==
[[File:Ciągliński Symbolic dance.jpg|thumb|right|''Symbolic dance'' by [[Jan Ciągliński]], late 19th-century subtle [[Lesbianism in erotica|lesbian erotica]] ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).]]
[[Queer theory]] and [[LGBT studies]] consider the concept from a [[non-heterosexual]] perspective, viewing psychoanalytical and modernist views of eroticism as both archaic&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Donald, ed., The Material Queer: A LesBiGay Cultural Studies Reader, (Boulder CO: Westview, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]],&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Ed, Talk on the Wilde Side: Towards a Genealogy of a Discourse on Male Sexualities, (New York: Routledge, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; written primarily by and for a "handful of elite, heterosexual, bourgeois men"&lt;ref&gt;Flannigan-Saint-Aubin, Arthur. "'Black Gay Male' Discourse: Reading Race and Sexuality Between the Lines". Journal of the History of Sexuality 3:3 (1993): 468-90.&lt;/ref&gt; who "mistook their own repressed sexual proclivities"&lt;ref&gt;Aries, Philippe &amp; Andre Bejin, eds., Western Sexuality: Practice and Precept in Past and Present, (Oxford: Blackwell, 1985; orig. pub. as Sexualities Occidentales, Paris: Editions du Seuil/Communications, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; as the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Vern L., "Homosexuality and the Medical Model", Journal of Homosexuality 1:6 (1975), pp. 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists like [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]],&lt;ref&gt;from Abelove, Henry, Michele Aina Barale, and David Halperin, eds., The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader, (New York: Routledge: 1993) Eve Kosofsky Sedgewick: Epistemology of the closet, 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gayle S.

A. "Men, Masculinity, and Sexuality: Some Recent Literature". Journal of the History of Sexuality 3:2 (1992): 303-13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Audre Lorde]], a Caribbean-American writer and out-spoken [[Feminism|feminist]] talks of the erotic being a type of power being specific to females.  "There are many kinds of power [...] The erotic is a resource within each of us that lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane, firmly rooted in the power of our unexpressed or unrecognized feelings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches |last=Lorde |first=Audre |last2=Clarke |first2=Cheryl |publisher=Ten Speed Press |year=2007 |origyear=1984 |isbn=978-1-58091-186-3 |location=New York |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Uses of the Erotic" within ''[[Sister Outsider]]'', she discusses how erotic comes from sharing, but if we suppress the erotic rather than recognize its presence, it takes on a different form. Rather than enjoying and sharing with one another, it is objectifying, which she says translates into abuse as we attempt to hide and suppress our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = SIster Outsider|last = Lorde|first = Audre|publisher = Ten Speed Press|year = 2007|isbn = |location = NY|pages = 53–58|chapter = Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic As Power  (1984)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EscolArtOlot.JPG|thumb|left|265px|School's building]]
'''Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot''' is the main Design and Arts &amp; Crafts school of the region of [[Province of Girona|Girona]] ([[Catalonia]], Spain). Since its foundation, it has maintained an active participation in the social, educational, economic and cultural life. The school is in [[Olot]], a city with a population of over 34,000 inhabitants.

==History==
The School was founded as '''Fine Arts School''' on 1 July 1783 by Bishop Tomas Lorenzana. In 1891 was renamed as '''Minor Fine Arts' School''', and during the period 1934–1938 was designed as '''Landscape's School''', depending on the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]].

During the 1986–87 academic year the official teaching of applied arts and crafts began, according to the official plan for 1963 schools; the school at this time depended on Olot's City Council.

On 20 June 1990 the school became part of the Catalonia official network of art schools with the name of '''Escola d'Arts Applicades i Oficis Artístics d'Olot'''; human resources and management switched to the Generalitat de Catalunya.

Since the 2003–2004 academic year the school has become '''Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot''', by completing the training with a Bachelor in Interior Design. Since the 2007–08 academic year the school also teaches a Bachelor of Graphic Design. Since 2010–11 it became one of seven ESDAP (Escola Superior de Disseny i Arts Plàstiques) and began to teach undergraduate Design (adapted to the [[European Higher Education Area]]).

==Location==

The institution is at the "Claustres del Carme" building, the Carmelite Cloisters, which date back to the Renaissance.

'''''Family of Saltimbanques''''' (''{{lang|fr|La famille de saltimbanques}}'') is a 1905 painting by [[Pablo Picasso]]. The work depicts six [[:wikt:saltimbanco|saltimbanques]], a kind of itinerant [[circus performer]], in a desolate landscape.

It is considered the masterpiece of [[Picasso's Rose Period]], sometimes called his circus period.&lt;ref name="ngaguide"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/picteach.shtm Picasso: The Early Years, 1892–1906.] [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and composition==
It was painted during a period from late 1904 to early 1906 when Picasso explored themes using the saltimbanque. Picasso frequently attended the [[Cirque Médrano]] in [[Montmartre]].

The composition groups the saltimbanques together but they seem disconnected and do not look at one another.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;Staff report (October 13, 1947). Picasso: The brilliant Spaniard is this era's most important painter. But is he a truly great artist? ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Critics have suggested ''Family of Saltimbanques'' is a covert group portrait of Picasso and his circle, symbolized as poor, independent and isolated. The painting was removed from the Spanish salon at the [[IX Biennale of Venice]] in 1910, because considered inappropriate by the organization. &lt;ref name=""&gt;Carmean E. A. (1970). ''Picasso, The saltimbanques.'' [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohemian–Austrian poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] (1875–1926) was inspired by this painting as he wrote the fifth of ten elegies in his ''[[Duino Elegies]]'' (1923).  Rilke used the figures in Picasso's painting as a symbol of "human activity ... always travelling and with no fixed abode, they are even a shade more fleeting than the rest of us, whose fleetingness was lamented." Further, although Picasso's painting depicts the figures in a desolate desert landscape,  Rilke described them as standing on a "threadbare carpet" to suggest "the ultimate loneliness and isolation of Man in this incomprehensible world, practicing their profession from childhood to death as playthings of an unknown will...before their 'pure too-little; had passed into 'empty too-much'."&lt;ref&gt;Leishman, J. B.; and Spender, Stephen. ''Rainer Maria Rilke: Duino Elegies'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1939) 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related work in [[gouache]] and [[pastel]] is ''Family of Acrobats'' (1905).&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.picasso-paintings.org/family-of-acrobats-study-1905-by-pablo-picasso/ Picasso-paintings.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Florence Edenshaw Davidson''' (1896–1993) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[First Nations]] artist from the [[Haida people|Haida]] nation who created traditional basketry and button-blankets and was also a respected elder in her First Nations community, the Haida village of [[Masset, British Columbia|Masset]], [[Haida Gwaii Islands]], [[British Columbia]].

== Biography ==
She was born in Masset on September 15, 1896, the daughter of the Haida artist [[Charles Edenshaw]] (Chief Idɨnsaw) and his wife [[Isabella Edenshaw|Isabella]] (K'woiyəng).  She was given the Haida name ''Jadał q'egəngá'' ("Story Maid").  She assisted her mother in sewing [[Button Blanket|button blanket]]s when she was a child.  She was renowned for her blankets and for sewing baskets of spruceroot and cedar bark.

She was of the Raven moiety, of the Y'akwə'lanas lineage, and of the Shark House (''Q'ad Nas''), with crests that included Shark, Two-Finned Killerwhale, and Brown Bear.

She married Robert Davidson (1880–1969), a Haida, on February 23, 1911, and had thirteen children. Her daughter [[Primrose Adams]], also an artist, was the 2011 recipient of the [[Creative Lifetime Achievement Award for First Nations' Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Columbia Achievement Foundation |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/862471/2011-bc-first-nations-art-awards-announced |title=2011 BC First Nations' Art Awards Announced |publisher=Newswire.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s she was consultant on Haida culture and Masset history to the writer [[Christie Harris]], author of ''Raven's Cry.'' She was also a major consultant on [[Haida language]] to [[John Enrico]].

She became well known through her collaborative autobiography written with the anthropologist [[Margaret B. Blackman]], published in 1982.

She died December 13, 1993.

Florence's grandsons include the artists [[Reg Davidson]] and [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]], who are brothers.

'''''Florinda''''' is an oil on canvas painting by a German painter and lithographer [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]]. It was completed in 1853 and is now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;The Letters of William Cullen Bryant: 1809-1836 By William Cullen Bryant, {{ISBN|0-8232-0997-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437944|title=Florinda|publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate= 17 October 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The picture depicts the legend of King [[Roderic]] of Spain spying on [[Florinda la Cava]] and the other palace girls while they bathe in a garden in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], in order to decide the fairest. After Roderic selects and courts Florinda, her father takes revenge by inviting the [[Moors]] to invade and conquer Spain. A replica of the painting was given to [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1852.

The painting is not on view.

'''Gable CAD''', or '''Gable 4D Series''', was a British architectural [[computer-aided design]] package initially developed in the early 1980s.

==History==
Gable CAD was developed at the [[University of Sheffield]] in the mid-1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phiri|first=Michael|title=Information technology in construction design|year=1999|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=978-0727726735|pages=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zn6uLnZEvAUC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;ots=D4yKyYjo2O&amp;dq=%22GABLE%20CAD%22%20sheffield&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=%22GABLE%20CAD%22%20sheffield&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of Professor Bryan Lawson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programme Committee Members’ Short Biographies|url=http://www.creativityandcognition.com/cc_conferences/cc05/aw.php?bios=1|work=Creativity &amp; Cognition 2005|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was spun out into Gable CAD Systems Limited (incorporated in 1984)&lt;ref name="DueDil"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gable Cad Systems Limited |url=https://www.duedil.com/company/gb/01844894/gable-cad-systems-limited |website=DueDil |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retained links with the university until its demise in 1996 when a court order was made for compulsory winding up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 November 1996|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/54583/pages/15306/page.pdf|work=The London Gazette|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early [[building information modeling]] application, Gable CAD was an advanced 2D and 3D design package with different modules, and was operated via a Windows-style interface and mouse running on [[UNIX]]. It was possible to create detailed 3D models and then generate 2D drawings or rendered visualisations from the data.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, R.N.. "[https://cumincad.architexturez.net/doc/oai-cumincadworks-id-610b The Use of Gable OMS (Object Modelling System) in the Building Design Process]" In Proceedings of the International Conference eCAADe: European Computer Aided Architectural Design Education, III1-III18. eCAADe: Conferences. Brussels, Belgium, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The assets of the company were acquired by [[Auxer]] in 1997 and aimed to complete the conversion of Gable CAD to [[Windows NT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auxer Industries Inc. announces the acquisition of Gable CAD Systems|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Auxer+Industries+Inc.+announces+the+acquisition+of+Gable+CAD+Systems...-a019249636|work=The Free Library|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this does not appear to have ever been released.

The '''Ghent-Bruges School''' is a manner or movement of [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] from about 1475 to about 1550 that developed in southern Netherlands, now Belgium. The term was first used in 1891 by Joseph Destree, author of ''Recherches sur les elumineurs flamands'' and art historian [[Paul Durrieu]].&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118"&gt;Jane Turner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6BIXXNwEOv8C&amp;pg=PA118 The Grove Dictionary of Art: From renaissance to impressionism : styles and movements in western art 1400-1900]''. St. Martin's Press; 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-312-22975-7}}. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

It replaced the "courtly style" of about 1440 to 1474 during the southern Netherlands reigns of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Charles the Bold]]. That mid-15th-century style consisted of works in primary colors of "wooden, clumsily painted stock figures".&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118" /&gt; 

The Ghent-Bruges School style created illuminated manuscripts with realistic images of people, including half- and full-length portraits, colorful landscapes and the use of bright and pastel colors.&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118" /&gt;

'''''HaShir Shelanu''''' ({{lang-he|השיר שלנו}}, lit. ''Our Song'') was an [[Israel]]i daily [[comedy|comical]] [[music]]al [[telenovela]] that ran for four seasons on the [[Yes (Israel)|yes]]-5 Israeli Movie Channel (Arutz Ha'kolnoa Hayisraeli) and repeating on [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]]. The last episode was broadcast in April 2007.

==General plot==
===Season 1=== 
'''118 episodes'''&lt;br&gt;
Ninet ([[Ninet Tayeb]]) is a young, unknown girl from the country who comes to Tel-Aviv and works with her cousin Ronnie ([[Niv Raz]]) at his cafeteria in Yardena Tamir's ([[Alisa Rosen]]) Academy of Music. After school hours are over Ninet goes to the classroom and sings. Her talent is revealed accidentally by the music teacher, Doron Sadeh ([[Sa'ar Badishi]]) who has her enrolled in the school. Ninet falls in love with Zohar Lahat ([[Ran Danker]]) and the couple go on a rocky road towards happiness disturbed mainly by Noa Shahar ([[Efrat Boymold]]) who wants Zohar for herself. Her best friend Dana Snir ([[Aliyana Bakyer]]) and her mother Naomi ([[Hana Laslow]]) help her by driving Zohar and Ninet apart.

===Season 2===
'''100 episodes'''&lt;br&gt;
Three years after graduating from the academy, Ninet and Zohar became the country's most well-known couple and they plan to get married. They have moved into the luxury "Sun and Beach" apartment complex in Tel-Aviv and, surprisingly enough, their friends from the academy have also moved into the complex. Due to the ending of the first season in which Givon ([[Guy Zo-Eretz]]) was killed while trying to murder Ninet and frame Naomi, his brother Ariel ([[Oshri Cohen]]) and sister ([[Yael Sharoni]]) are in town and plan their revenge on Ninet, Naomi and Noa. While conspiring to assassinate them, Ariel falls in love with Ninet.

===Season 3===
'''73 episodes'''&lt;br&gt;
At the beginning of the third season viewers find out that the first two seasons of the show were actually a TV show called ''Her Song''. The two leading actors of ''Her Song'', Rani Aviv who played Zohar Lahat ([[Ran Danker]]) and Yonatan Barak who played Ariel Silver ([[Oshri Cohen]]), prepare to go to the army the day after they finish shooting the final episode of the second season. Rani goes to the paratroopers unit and Yonatan goes to an army band. All the other characters from the first two seasons occasionally appear under their real names. New characters join the show.

===Season 4===
'''75 episodes'''&lt;br&gt;
Almost the plot of the third season. The plot mostly concerns the investigation of who tried to murder Tamara and Karin Koren. Karin Koren knows who tied to murder her by shooting her twice in the stomach when she was pregnant and shooting Tamara three times in the chest. Karin Promises Yotam  that she will not tell anyone he shot her if he starts going out with her. After Yotam shot both Karin and Tamara they stayed in the hospital asleep for six months. Tamara wakes up and does not remember anything and does not remember that ten minutes before Yotam shot her she asked Rani Aviv to marry him and he accepted, so she does not love him any more. Rani still fights over her to get her back with him. Later in the season, some people discover that the inspector for the case of the shooting of Tamara and Karin Nora Spector is Karin's mother.

In [[music]], '''harmony''' considers the process by which the composition of individual sounds, or superpositions of sounds, is analysed by hearing. Usually, this means simultaneously occurring [[frequencies]], [[pitch (music)|pitches]] ([[timbre|tones]], [[note (music)|notes]]), or [[chord (music)|chords]].&lt;ref&gt;Malm, William P. (1996). ''Music Cultures of the Pacific, the Near East, and Asia'', p.15. {{ISBN|0-13-182387-6}}. Third edition. "Homophonic texture...is more common in Western music, where tunes are often built on chords (harmonies) that move in progressions. Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music."&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and [[chord progression]]s and the principles of connection that govern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Harmony|author=Dahlhaus, Car|access-date=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from [[melody|melodic line]], or the "horizontal" aspect.&lt;ref name=Jamini&gt;Jamini, Deborah (2005). ''Harmony and Composition: Basics to Intermediate'', p.147. {{ISBN|1-4120-3333-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Counterpoint]], which refers to the relationship between melodic lines, and [[polyphony]], which refers to the simultaneous sounding of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.

In [[popular harmony|popular]] and [[jazz harmony]], chords are named by their [[root (chord)|root]] plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities.  In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant interval]] in relation to the bass.

Typically, in the classical [[common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments.

== Etymology and definitions ==
The term ''harmony'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁρμονία}} ''harmonia'', meaning "joint, agreement, concord",&lt;ref&gt;'1. Harmony' ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology in English Language Reference'' accessed via [http://www.oxfordreference.com/ Oxford Reference Online] (24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(rmoni/a|ἁρμονία|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the verb {{lang|grc|ἁρμόζω}} ''harmozō'', "(Ι) fit together, join".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(rmo/zw|ἁρμόζω|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, ''harmony'' often referred to the whole field of music, while ''music'' referred to the arts in general.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In Ancient Greece, the term defined the combination of contrasted elements: a higher and lower note.&lt;ref name="grovelead"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Harmony|author=Dahlhaus, Carl|access-date=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the simultaneous sounding of notes was part of ancient Greek musical practice; ''harmonía'' may have merely provided a system of classification of the relationships between different pitches.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In the Middle Ages the term was used to describe two pitches sounding in combination, and in the Renaissance the concept was expanded to denote three pitches sounding together.&lt;ref name = "grovelead" /&gt; [[Aristoxenus]] wrote a work entitled ''[[Elementa harmonica|Harmonika Stoicheia]]'', which is thought the first work in European history written on the subject of harmony.&lt;ref name="Aristoxenus, Henry Stewart Macran"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3TseQjV_wogC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=translations+of+Aristoxenus+Elements+of+Harmony&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aDzoOJl1aD&amp;sig=n4ldPcu--zEZ_Kzxv_8MuCe73oY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dL5GVcH6JdjiasmTgPgM&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=translations%20of%20Aristoxenus%20Elements%20of%20Harmony&amp;f=false|author=Aristoxenus, Henry Stewart Macran|title=Harmonika Stoicheia (The Harmonics of Aristoxenus)|publisher=Georg Olms Verlag 1902 {{ISBN|3487405105}}|accessdate=2015-05-04}}(and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/aristoxenoy-armonika-stoicheia-the-harmonics-of-aristoxenus/oclc/123175755 World Cat])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rameau Traite de l’harmonie.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Rameau]]'s ''Traité de l'harmonie'' (''Treatise on Harmony''), 1722]]
It was not until the publication of [[Rameau]]'s ''Traité de l'harmonie'' (''Treatise on Harmony'') in 1722 that any text discussing musical practice made use of the term in the title, although that work is not the earliest record of theoretical discussion of the topic. The underlying principle behind these texts is that harmony sanctions harmoniousness (sounds that please) by conforming to certain pre-established compositional principles.&lt;ref name = "oxfordcompanion"&gt;Arnold Whittall, ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', ed. Alison Latham, (Oxford University Press, 2002) (accessed via [Oxford Reference Online], 16 November 2007  [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?this is gayubview=Main&amp;entry=t114.e3144] )&lt;/ref&gt;

Current dictionary definitions, while attempting to give concise descriptions, often highlight the ambiguity of the term in modern use. Ambiguities tend to arise from either aesthetic considerations (for example the view that only pleasing concords may be harmonious) or from the point of view of musical texture (distinguishing between harmonic (simultaneously sounding pitches) and "contrapuntal" (successively sounding tones).&lt;ref name = "oxfordcompanion" /&gt; In the words of [[Arnold Whittall]]:

{{quote|While the entire history of music theory appears to depend on just such a distinction between harmony and counterpoint, it is no less evident that developments in the nature of musical composition down the centuries have presumed the interdependence—at times amounting to integration, at other times a source of sustained tension—between the vertical and horizontal dimensions of musical space.&lt;ref name = "oxfordcompanion" /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}}}

The view that modern [[tonality|tonal]] harmony in Western music began in about 1600 is commonplace in music theory. This is usually accounted for by the replacement of horizontal (or [[contrapuntal]]) composition, common in the music of the [[Renaissance]], with a new emphasis on the vertical element of composed music. Modern theorists, however, tend to see this as an unsatisfactory generalisation. According to [[Carl Dahlhaus]]:

{{quote|It was not that counterpoint was supplanted by harmony (Bach’s tonal counterpoint is surely no less polyphonic than Palestrina’s modal writing) but that an older type both of counterpoint and of vertical technique was succeeded by a newer type. And harmony comprises not only the ("vertical") structure of chords but also their ("horizontal") movement. Like music as a whole, harmony is a process.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|author=Carl Dahlhaus|title=Harmony, §3: Historical development|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Whittall 'Harmony: 4. Practice and Principle', ''Oxford Companion to Music''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}}}

Descriptions and definitions of harmony and harmonic practice may show bias towards [[Europe]]an (or [[Western culture|Western]]) musical traditions.  For example, South Asian art music ([[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and [[Carnatic music]]) is frequently cited as placing little emphasis on what is perceived in western practice as conventional harmony; the underlying harmonic foundation for most South Asian music is the [[drone (music)|drone]], a held open [[fifth interval]] (or fourth interval) that does not alter in pitch throughout the course of a composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=India, §I, 2(ii): Music and musicians: Art music|author=Regula Qureshi|access-date=16 November 2007}} and Catherine Schmidt Jones, 'Listening to Indian Classical Music', Connexions, (accessed 16 November 2007) [http://cnx.org/content/m12502/latest/]&lt;/ref&gt; Pitch simultaneity in particular is rarely a major consideration. Nevertheless, many other considerations of pitch are relevant to the music, its theory and its structure, such as the complex system of [[Rāga]]s, which combines both melodic and modal considerations and codifications within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=India, §III, 2: Theory and practice of classical music: Rāga|author=Harold S. Powers|author2=Richard Widdess|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, intricate pitch combinations that sound simultaneously do occur in [[Indian classical music]]—but they are rarely studied as [[teleological]] harmonic or [[contrapuntal]] progressions—as with notated Western music. This contrasting emphasis (with regard to Indian music in particular) manifests itself in the different methods of performance adopted: in Indian Music improvisation takes a major role in the structural framework of a piece,&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=India, §III, 3(ii): Theory and practice of classical music: Melodic elaboration|author=Harold S. Powers|author2=Richard Widdess|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Western Music improvisation has been uncommon since the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Improvisation, §II: Western art music|author=Rob C. Wegman|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where it does occur in Western music (or has in the past), the improvisation either embellishes pre-notated music or draws from musical models previously established in notated compositions, and therefore uses familiar harmonic schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Improvisation, §II, 4(i): The Classical period in Western art music: Instrumental music|author=Robert D Levin|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, emphasis on the precomposed in European art music and the written theory surrounding it shows considerable cultural bias. The ''Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (Oxford University Press) identifies this clearly:

{{quote|In Western culture the musics that are most dependent on improvisation, such as jazz, have traditionally been regarded as inferior to art music, in which pre-composition is considered paramount. The conception of musics that live in oral traditions as something composed with the use of improvisatory techniques separates them from the higher-standing works that use notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Improvisation, §I, 2: Concepts and practices: Improvisation in musical cultures|author=Bruno Nettl|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet the evolution of harmonic practice and language itself, in Western art music, is and was facilitated by this process of prior composition, which permitted the study and analysis by theorists and composers of individual pre-constructed works in which pitches (and to some extent rhythms) remained unchanged regardless of the nature of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;See Whittall, 'Harmony'&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical rules ==
Some traditions of Western music performance, [[Musical composition|composition]], and [[music theory|theory]] have specific rules of harmony.  These rules are often described as based on natural properties such as [[Pythagorean tuning]]'s law whole number ratios ("harmoniousness" being inherent in the ratios either perceptually or in themselves) or [[harmonic]]s and [[Acoustic resonance|resonances]] ("harmoniousness" being inherent in the quality of sound), with the allowable pitches and harmonies gaining their beauty or simplicity from their closeness to those properties. This model provides that the minor seventh and (major) ninth are not dissonant (i.e., are consonant).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Early Western religious music often features parallel perfect intervals; these intervals would preserve the clarity of the original [[plainsong]]. These works were created and performed in cathedrals, and made use of the resonant modes of their respective cathedrals to create harmonies. As polyphony developed, however, the use of parallel intervals was slowly replaced by the English style of consonance that used thirds and sixths.{{when|date=September 2014}} The English style was considered to have a sweeter sound, and was better suited to polyphony in that it offered greater linear flexibility in part-writing. Early music also forbade usage of the [[tritone]], due to its dissonance, and composers often went to considerable lengths, via [[musica ficta]], to avoid using it. In the newer triadic harmonic system, however, the tritone became permissible, as the standardization of [[Consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|functional dissonance]] made its use in dominant chords desirable.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Most harmony comes from two or more notes sounding simultaneously—but a work can imply harmony with only one melodic line by using [[arpeggio]]s or [[hocket]]. Many pieces from the [[baroque music|baroque]] period for solo [[string instrument]]s—such as Bach's [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin]] and cello—convey subtle harmony through inference rather than full chordal structures. These works create a sense of harmonies by using arpeggiated chords and implied bass lines. The implied basslines are created with low notes of short duration that many listeners perceive as being the bass note of a chord.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

[[File:Bach cello harmony.JPG|center|thumb|400px|Example of implied harmonies in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach's]] [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suite]] no. 1 in G, BWV 1007, bars 1–2. {{audio|Bach cello harmony.mid|Play}} or {{audio|Bach cello harmony chords.mid|Play harmony}}]]

== Types ==
[[File:C triad.svg|thumb|right|Close position C major triad. {{audio|Major triad on C.mid|Play}}]]
[[File:C triad open position.svg|thumb|right|Open position C major triad. {{audio|C triad open position.mid|Play}}]]

[[Carl Dahlhaus]] (1990) distinguishes between ''coordinate'' and ''subordinate harmony''. ''Subordinate harmony'' is the [[hierarchical]] [[tonality]] or tonal harmony well known today. ''Coordinate harmony'' is the older [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] ''tonalité ancienne'', "The term is meant to signify that sonorities are linked one after the other without giving rise to the impression of a goal-directed development. A first chord forms a 'progression' with a second chord, and a second with a third. But the former chord progression is independent of the later one and vice versa." Coordinate harmony follows direct (adjacent) relationships rather than indirect as in subordinate. [[Interval cycle]]s create symmetrical harmonies, which have been extensively used by the composers [[Alban Berg]], [[George Perle]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Béla Bartók]], and [[Edgard Varèse]]'s ''[[Density 21.5]]''.

Close harmony and open harmony use close position and open position chords, respectively. See: [[voicing (music)]] and [[close and open harmony]].

Other types of harmony are based upon the intervals of the chords used in that harmony. Most chords in western music are based on "tertian" harmony, or chords built with the interval of thirds. In the chord C Major7, C–E is a major third; E–G is a minor third; and G to B is a major third. Other types of harmony consist of [[quartal and quintal harmony]].

A [[unison]] is considered a harmonic interval, just like a fifth or a third, but is unique in that it is two identical notes produced together. The unison, as a component of harmony, is important, especially in orchestration.&lt;ref name="grovelead" /&gt; In pop music, unison singing is usually called ''doubling'', a technique [[The Beatles]] used in many of their earlier recordings. As a type of harmony, singing in unison or playing the same notes, often using different musical instruments, at the same time is commonly called [[monophony|monophonic]] [[harmonization]].

== Intervals ==
An [[interval (music)|interval]] is the relationship between two separate musical pitches. For example, in the melody ''[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]'', the first two notes (the first "twinkle") and the second two notes (the second "twinkle") are at the interval of one fifth. What this means is that if the first two notes were the pitch '''C''', the second two notes would be the pitch "G"—four scale notes, or seven chromatic notes (a perfect fifth), above it.

The following are common intervals:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Root

! [[Minor third]]

|-
| C
| E
| E{{music|b}}
| G

|-
| B{{music|b}}
| D
| D{{music|b}}
| F
|-
| B
| D{{music|#}}
| D
| F{{music|#}}
|}

Therefore, the combination of notes with their specific intervals—a chord—creates harmony. For example, in a C chord, there are three notes: C, E, and G. The note '''C''' is the root. The notes '''E''' and '''G''' provide harmony, and in a G7 (G dominant 7th) chord, the root G with each subsequent note (in this case B, D and F) provide the harmony.

&lt;!-- I will leave the following below for the moment, but is it really relevant to this article?? (Please see talk page)--&gt;
In the musical scale, there are twelve pitches. Each pitch is referred to as a "degree" of the scale. The names A, B, C, D, E, F, and G are insignificant. The intervals, however, are not. Here is an example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 1°
! 2°
! 3°
! 4°
! 5°
! 6°
! 7°
! 8°
|-
| C
| D
| E
| F
| G
| A
| B
| C
|-
| D
| E
| F{{music|sharp}}
| G
| A
| B
| C{{music|sharp}}
| D
|}

As can be seen, no note always corresponds to a certain degree of the scale. The ''tonic'', or 1st-degree note, can be any of the 12 notes (pitch classes) of the chromatic scale. All the other notes fall into place. For example, when C is the tonic, the fourth degree or subdominant is F. When D is the tonic, the fourth degree is G. While the note names remain constant, they may refer to different scale degrees, implying different intervals with respect to the tonic. The great power of this fact is that any musical work can be played or sung in any key. It is the same piece of music, as long as the intervals are the same—thus transposing the melody into the corresponding key. When the intervals surpass the perfect Octave (12 semitones), these intervals are called ''compound intervals'', which include particularly the 9th, 11th, and 13th Intervals—widely used in [[jazz]] and [[blues]] Music.

Compound Intervals are formed and named as follows:
*2nd + Octave = 9th
*3rd + octave = 10th
*4th + Octave = 11th
*5th + octave = 12th
*6th + Octave = 13th
*7th + octave = 14th

The reason the two numbers don't "add" correctly is that one note is counted twice. Apart from this categorization, intervals can also be divided into consonant and dissonant. As explained in the following paragraphs, consonant intervals produce a sensation of relaxation and dissonant intervals a sensation of tension. In tonal music, the term consonant also means "brings resolution" (to some degree at least, whereas dissonance "requires resolution").

The consonant intervals are considered the perfect [[unison]], [[octave]], [[Perfect fifth|fifth]], [[Perfect fourth|fourth]] and major and minor third and sixth, and their compound forms. An interval is referred to as "perfect" when the harmonic relationship is found in the natural overtone series (namely, the unison 1:1, octave 2:1, fifth 3:2, and fourth 4:3). The other basic intervals (second, third, sixth, and seventh) are called "imperfect" because the harmonic relationships are not found mathematically exact in the overtone series. In classical music the perfect fourth above the bass may be considered dissonant when its function is [[contrapuntal]]. Other intervals, the second and the seventh (and their compound forms) are considered Dissonant and require resolution (of the produced tension) and usually preparation (depending on the music style).

Note that the effect of dissonance is perceived relatively within musical context: for example, a major seventh interval alone (i.e., C up to B) may be perceived as dissonant, but the same interval as part of a major seventh chord may sound relatively consonant. A tritone (the interval of the fourth step to the seventh step of the major scale, i.e., F to B) sounds very dissonant alone, but less so within the context of a dominant seventh chord (G7 or D{{music|b}}7 in that example).

== Chords and tension ==
{{Main article|Chord (music)|Consonance and dissonance}}
In the Western tradition, in music after the seventeenth century, harmony is manipulated using [[chord (music)|chord]]s, which are combinations of [[pitch class]]es. In [[tertian]] harmony, so named after the interval of a third, the members of chords are found and named by stacking intervals of the third, starting with the "root", then the "third" above the root, and the "fifth" above the root (which is a third above the third), etc. (Note that chord members are named after their interval above the root.) [[dyad (music)|Dyad]]s, the simplest chords, contain only two members (see [[power chord]]s).

A chord with three members is called a [[Triad (music)|triad]] because it has three members, not because it is necessarily built in thirds (see [[Quartal and quintal harmony]] for chords built with other intervals). Depending on the size of the intervals being stacked, different qualities of chords are formed. In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. To keep the nomenclature as simple as possible, some defaults are accepted (not tabulated here). For example, the chord members C, E, and G, form a C Major triad, called by default simply a C chord. In an A{{music|b}} chord (pronounced A-flat), the members are A{{music|b}}, C, and E{{music|b}}.

In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. Following the tertian practice of building chords by stacking thirds, the simplest first tension is added to a triad by stacking on top of the existing root, third, and fifth, another third above the fifth, giving a new, potentially dissonant member the interval of a seventh away from the root and therefore called the "seventh" of the chord, and producing a four-note chord, called a "[[seventh chord]]".

Depending on the widths of the individual thirds stacked to build the chord, the interval between the root and the seventh of the chord may be major, minor, or diminished. (The interval of an augmented seventh reproduces the root, and is therefore left out of the chordal nomenclature.) The nomenclature allows that, by default, "C7" indicates a chord with a root, third, fifth, and seventh spelled C, E, G, and B{{music|b}}. Other types of seventh chords must be named more explicitly, such as "C Major 7" (spelled C, E, G, B), "C augmented 7" (here the word augmented applies to the fifth, not the seventh, spelled C, E, G{{music|#}}, B{{music|b}}), etc. (For a more complete exposition of nomenclature see [[Chord (music)]].)

Continuing to stack thirds on top of a seventh chord produces extensions, and brings in the "extended tensions" or "upper tensions" (those more than an octave above the root when stacked in thirds), the ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths. This creates the chords named after them. (Note that except for dyads and triads, tertian chord types are named for the interval of the largest size and magnitude in use in the stack, not for the number of chord members : thus a ninth chord has five members ''[tonic, 3rd, 5th, 7th, '''9'''th]'', not nine.) Extensions beyond the thirteenth reproduce existing chord members and are (usually) left out of the nomenclature. Complex harmonies based on [[extended chord]]s are found in abundance in jazz, late-romantic music, modern orchestral works, film music, etc.

Typically, in the classical [[Common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) ''resolves'' to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments. For this reason, usually tension is 'prepared' and then 'resolved',&lt;ref name=Schejtman&gt;Schejtman, Rod (2008). ''The Piano Encyclopedia's "Music Fundamentals eBook"'', p.20-43 (accessed 10 March 2009) [http://PianoEncyclopedia.com PianoEncyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; where preparing tension means to place a series of consonant chords that lead smoothly to the dissonant chord. In this way the composer ensures introducing tension smoothly, without disturbing the listener.&lt;!--this is a contradiction--&gt; Once the piece reaches its sub-climax, the listener needs a moment of relaxation to clear up the tension, which is obtained by playing a consonant chord that resolves the tension of the previous chords. The clearing of this tension usually sounds pleasant to the listener, though this is not always the case in late-nineteenth century music, such as Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner.&lt;ref name="Schejtman"/&gt;

== Perception ==

Harmony is based on consonance, a concept whose definition has changed various times during the history of Western music. In a psychological approach, consonance is a continuous variable. Consonance can vary across a wide range. A chord may sound consonant for various reasons.

One is lack of perceptual roughness. Roughness happens when partials (frequency components) lie within a critical bandwidth, which is a measure of the ear's ability to separate different frequencies. Critical bandwidth lies between 2 and 3 semitones at high frequencies and becomes larger at lower frequencies. The roughness of two simultaneous harmonic complex tones depends on the amplitudes of the harmonics and the interval between the tones. The roughest interval in the chromatic scale is the minor second and its inversion the major seventh. For typical spectral envelopes in the central range, the second roughest interval is the major second and minor seventh, followed by the tritone, the minor third ([[major sixth]]), the major third ([[minor sixth]]) and the perfect fourth (fifth).

[[Image:Major triad.svg|250px|thumb|The harmonious [[Major chord|major triad]] is composed of three tones. Their frequency ratio corresponds approximately 6:5:4. In real performances, however, the third is often larger than 5:4. The ratio 5:4 corresponds to an interval of 386 [[Cent (music)|cents]], but an equally tempered major third is 400 cents and a Pythagorean third with a ratio of 81:64 is 408 cents. Measurements of frequencies in good performances confirm that the size of the major third varies across this range and can even lie outside it without sounding out of tune. Thus, there is no simple connection between frequency ratios and harmonic function.]]

The second reason is perceptual fusion. A chord fuses in perception if its overall spectrum is similar to a [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. According to this definition a major triad fuses better than a minor triad and a major-minor seventh chord fuses better than a major-major seventh or minor-minor seventh. These differences may not be readily apparent in tempered contexts but can explain why major triads are generally more prevalent than minor triads and major-minor sevenths generally more prevalent than other sevenths (in spite of the dissonance of the tritone interval) in mainstream tonal music. Of course these comparisons depend on style.

The third reason is familiarity. Chords that have often been heard in musical contexts tend to sound more consonant. This principle explains the gradual historical increase in harmonic complexity of Western music. For example, around 1600 unprepared seventh chords gradually became familiar and were therefore gradually perceived as more consonant.

Western music is based on major and minor triads. The reason why these chords are so central is that they are consonant in terms of both fusion and lack of roughness. They fuse because they include the perfect fourth/fifth interval. They lack roughness because they lack major and minor second intervals. No other combination of three tones in the chromatic scale satisfies these criteria.

== Consonance and dissonance in balance ==
Post-nineteenth century music has evolved in the way that tension may be less often prepared and less formally structured than in [[Baroque Music|Baroque]] or [[Classical Music|Classical]] periods, thus producing new styles such as post-Romantic harmony, [[Impressionist music|impressionism]], pantonality, [[jazz]] and [[blues]], where dissonance may not be prepared in the way seen in "common practice era" harmony. In a jazz or blues song, the tonic chord that opens a tune may be a dominant seventh chord. A jazz song may end on what in Classical music is a quite dissonant chord, such as an [[altered dominant]] chord with a sharpened eleventh note.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== i Light Marina Bay 2016: In Praise of Shadows ==
The fourth edition of i Light Marina Bay, held from 4 to 27 March 2016, featured 25 innovative and environmentally sustainable light art installations by creative talents from around the world, including Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Norway, United Kingdom and the USA. Beyond its spectacular showcase of visual art and urban space, the festival also offers a dynamic line-up of events and programmes over four weekends.

=== Theme &amp; Curatorial Team ===
The 2016 theme, “In Praise of Shadows”, challenges the obsession that brighter is better and seeks to reframe [[perception]]s of light and sustainability. The festival invites artists and visitors to re-imagine and reconsider sustainability issues in a new light, and to contemplate upon larger issues of light, beauty and the city in relation to the bigger community.

The curatorial direction was driven by Randy Chan, Principal Architect at Zarch Collaboratives, Singapore and Khairuddin Hori, Deputy Director of Artistic Programming at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.

=== Sustainability ===
A key objective of i Light Marina Bay was to advocate environmentally-responsible behaviour for a sustainable future, and to promote Marina Bay as a culturally vibrant and sustainable urban waterfront precinct. From encouraging artists to use recyclable materials as well as adopt energy-efficient lighting technology in the creation of their light art installations, to working with event and programme partners to more effectively manage resources and minimise waste, sustainability was promoted through all aspects of the festival.

==== ''Switch off, Turn up Campaign '' ====
i Light Marina Bay once again conducted the “Switch Off, Turn Up” Campaign, where stakeholders around Marina Bay were invited to switch off non-essential lighting and turn up [[air conditioning]] temperatures whenever possible during the festival period. The energy saving campaign was designed to offset the energy used by the light art installations and associated power use in Asia’s only sustainable light art festival which ran from 7 to 30 March.

52 buildings committed in this third edition to put in place measures to save energy during the festival period. Key developments involved include [[Marina Bay Sands]], [[Marina Bay Financial Centre]], and [[One Fullerton]]. Their participation signified their commitment to play a part in working towards a more sustainable future together. The campaign in 2014 achieved energy savings of 268,890 kWh.

=== Sustainability ===
A key objective of i Light Marina Bay was to advocate environmentally-responsible behaviour for a sustainable future, and to promote Marina Bay as a culturally vibrant and sustainable urban waterfront precinct. From encouraging artists to use recyclable materials as well as adopt energy-efficient lighting technology in the creation of their light art installations, to working with event and programme partners to more effectively manage resources and minimise waste, sustainability was promoted through all aspects of the festival.

==== ''Switch Off, Turn Up ''Campaign ====
In 2012, the initiative successfully extended its reach well beyond the Marina Bay precinct, with buildings across the island pledging their support.&lt;ref name="Switch Off, Turn Up Campaign"&gt;[http://www.ilightmarinabay.sg/switchoff_campaign.html "Switch Off, Turn Up" Campaign] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414010255/http://www.ilightmarinabay.sg/switchoff_campaign.html |date=14 April 2012 }} i Light Marina Bay. Retrieved 12 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign saved more than 200,000 kWh, four times the energy saved in 2010.&lt;ref name="Lighting-up for sustainability"/&gt; This equates to 100 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, enough to generate electricity for 762 4-bedroom HDB flats for three-weeks.&lt;ref name="Lighting-up for sustainability"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://adlibmagazine.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/ i Light Marina Bay 2012 closed on a successful note] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131200446/https://adlibmagazine.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/ |date=31 January 2016 }} Adlib Magazine Singapore. 11 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally part of Marina Bay Invitations 2010, a series of events planned to promote Marina Bay as a vibrant venue and a destination for a brand new live-work-play experience.

It showcased about 25 dynamic light art installations and sculptures as well as interactive and performance-based art displays by 14 artists from Singapore and 20 international artists. The artworks were arranged in a line around the Marina Bay waterfront promenade to form a Light Walk.&lt;ref name="ILIGHT MARINA BAY"/&gt;

The key highlight of the Light Walk was an installation that consisted of 29 large and beautiful light artworks of My Public Garden by French light art group, TILT, depicting a whimsical, fantasy garden which adorned The Promontory@Marina Bay.

The inaugural festival was a success and was attended by more than 433,000 visitors over the three-week duration, of which approximately 71,031 were international visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilightmarinabay.sg/about_festival.html About The Festival] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411135950/http://www.ilightmarinabay.sg/about_festival.html |date=11 April 2012 }} Retrieved 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists that participated in i Light Marina Bay 2012’s light show were selected for the use of energy-efficient LED lights and/or the incorporation of sustainable, recycle and/or re-usable materials into their light artworks. Some of these artworks leveraged on alternative sources of energy such as solar, kinetic or wind in order to generate energy for the light installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Relax/Story/A1Story20120224-329957.html Marina Bay light festival returns in March] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419101615/http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Relax/Story/A1Story20120224-329957.html |date=19 April 2012 }} AsiaOne. 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmap.tv/news_detail.aspx?id=1224 SINGAPORE.

As the rider bounced up and down on the saddle, the toy moved forward in a way somewhat resembling a [[Geometer moth|''Geometer'' caterpillar]], with the ratcheting wheels making a clicking sound.

==Plot==
Protagonist Charlie Bucktin is a 14-year-old boy living in the fictitious rural town of Corrigan in [[Western Australia]]. Charlie spends his days with his best friend Jeffrey Lu, a Vietnamese boy who shares Charlie's love of intellectual banter, and deals stoically with the constant race-hate inflicted on him and his family. Eliza Wishart, a local girl, and daughter of the President of the town hall becomes more and more endeared towards Charlie.

On Christmas evening Charlie is unexpectedly visited by Jasper Jones, an outcast in Corrigan due to his mixed White-Aboriginal heritage and rebellious lifestyle. Jasper begs for Charlie's help, and leads him to his private glade in the bush. Here Charlie is horrified to find the dead body of a young girl, Jasper's girlfriend Laura Wishart, battered and hanging from a tree. Jasper, aware that he is likely to be blamed for Laura's murder, convinces Charlie that they should hide the body, so they throw it into a nearby pond, weighted by a large rock.

Jeffrey is passionate about cricket, but his attempts to join the Corrigan team are thwarted by the racism of the coach and other players. Eventually fortune goes his way, and he finds himself batting in a game against a rival town, watched by Charlie, who has befriended Eliza, Laura Wishart's younger sister. As Jeffrey wins the game on the last ball, Charlie and Eliza hold hands and embrace.

A search for the missing girl is soon organized, focused on the idea that she may have run away. Jasper is interrogated roughly by the local police, but he soon escapes. Meanwhile tension builds in the town, as parents fear more disappearances, and townspeople search for someone to blame. The tension is funneled into strict curfews for the children as well as racial attacks on Jeffrey's family. It is revealed that Charlie's mother, increasingly disillusioned with life in Corrigan and her marriage, is having an affair with the Sarge involved with the investigation into Laura's disappearance. 

Jasper believes that Laura's murderer is Mad Jack Lionel, a reclusive old man who is rumored to have done terrible things in the past.  Jasper determines to confront Lionel on New Year's Eve, and together with Charlie, goes to his house. Lionel manages to defuse Jasper's aggression, and the truth comes out: Lionel is actually Jasper's grandfather who had ostracized his son's family knowing that he had married with an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] woman when Jasper was a baby. His daughter-in-law then took care of him, spurring a change of heart towards her. One night, she needed medical attention, and Lionel had attempted to race her to hospital. In his haste, however, he accidentally crashed his car, causing her death. The incident has left him guilty, broken, and ostracized by the townspeople. Ever since, Lionel has been trying to reach out to Jasper and apologize for his actions.

On the same night, Charlie comes to Eliza's window. They go to Jasper's glade. Here Eliza tells Charlie that she knows everything about Laura's death and hands him the suicide note detailing the gruesome reasons for her apparent suicide. The note said that after rampant sexual abuse by her abusive father, leaving Laura pregnant, and after a particularly violent fight on Christmas day, Laura came looking for Jasper. Eliza followed her to the glade. Finding Jasper away, in despair Laura hanged herself, and Eliza, paralyzed by fear, could not save her. Charlie then confesses that he and Jasper had thrown Laura's body into the pond.  The next day Charlie and Eliza take the note to Eliza's mother. She quietly reads the note then tears it repeatedly, eventually soaking the tiny scraps in her cup of tea without saying a word. The look on her face makes clear that she knew about the abuse and even now has no intention of addressing it. Eliza harshly insists that Charlie leave the house.  He passes her father in the yard and then makes his way to the police station to report what he knows. His attempt is interrupted by news that the Wishart house is on fire and everyone runs to the scene.

Charlie's mother leaves Corrigan. Charlie remains close to Eliza, who exacts revenge on her father by setting fire to their house, injuring him. The secret about Laura's death remains with the three of them.

==Reception==
''Jasper Jones'' received positive reviews from critics and audiences, earning a 74% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

C.J. Johnson of ABC Radio gave a positive review, calling the film "engrossing, surprising and moving, and obviously made with great care and love." Sarah Ward of Playground also gave a positive review, commenting "There's always room for a smart, thoughtful and engaging take on a well-worn premise, and ''[[Bran Nue Dae (film)|Bran Nue Dae]]'' director [[Rachel Perkins]] delivers just that" Alex Doenau of Trespass described the film as "well scripted, shot, and acted, there's very little not to recommend it."

Jim Schembri of 3AW gave a negative review, describing the story as "pitted with plotholes of implausibility that continually take you out of the picture, robbing the film almost entirely of tension." Jake Wilson of The Age gave a mixed review, writing "It's hard to say if there is a centre to a narrative that jumps from one subplot to another in the manner of a soap opera."

The '''Kulturforum''' is a collection of cultural buildings in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It was built up in the 1950s and 1960s at the edge of [[West Berlin]], after most of the once unified city's cultural assets had been lost behind the [[Berlin Wall]]. The Kulturforum is characterized by its innovative modernist architecture; several buildings are distinguished by the organic designs of [[Hans Scharoun]], and the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] was designed by [[Mies van der Rohe]]. Today, the Kulturforum lies immediately to the west of the redeveloped commercial node of [[Potsdamer Platz]].

==Cultural institutions==
Among the cultural institutions housed in and around the Kulturforum are:
*[[Neue Nationalgalerie]]
*[[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]]
*[[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin|Museum of Decorative Arts]]
*[[Berlin Musical Instrument Museum|Musical Instrument Museum]]
*[[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin|Kupferstichkabinett]] ([[Print room]])

*[[Chamber Music Hall]]
*[[Berlin State Library]] ''Haus Potsdamer Straße''
*[[Ibero-American Institute]]
*[[Wissenschaftszentrum]] 
*[[St. Matthäus-Kirche]]

==History==
After [[World War II]], the public art collections were divided by the Berlin Wall, with particularly the Old Master paintings split between the [[Bode Museum]] in what became the east, and a temporary exhibition space in Dahlem, a western suburban district of Berlin. Public opinion at the time of reunification strongly favored a return of the Old Masters to their historical home at the Bode Museum. Yet Wolf-Dieter Dube, the then director-general of the [[Berlin State Museums]], pushed through his plans to move the collection to the Kulturforum, a modernist complex as answer to [[Museum Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Charly Wilder (September 14, 2012), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/berlin-s-culture-war-debate-pits-modern-art-against-old-masters-a-855704.html Berlin's Culture War - Debate Pit Modern Art against Old Masters] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] became the centerpiece of the new complex, completed in 1998 when the long-planned $140 million [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] was opened nearby to house paintings of the 13th to 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Butler (December 2, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/world/berlin-museum-s-revival-bolsters-german-identity.html Berlin Museum's Revival Bolsters German Identity] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laszlo Toth 1972.jpg|thumb|350px|Laszlo Toth is being removed from the ''Pietà'' on 21 May 1972]]
'''Laszlo Toth''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Tóth László''; 1 July 1938 – 11 September 2012) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[Australian]] [[geologist]]. He achieved worldwide notoriety when he vandalised [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'' statue on 21 May 1972. Toth was not charged with any [[criminal offence]] after the incident. He was hospitalized in [[Italy]] for two years. On his release, he was immediately [[deportation|deported]] to [[Australia]]. 

==Early life==
Toth was born in [[Pilisvörösvár]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], to a Roman Catholic family. After graduating in geology, in 1965 he moved to Australia. As his English was poor and his geology diploma was not recognized, Toth initially worked at a soap factory. In June 1971 he moved to Rome, Italy, knowing no [[Italian language|Italian]], and aiming to become recognized as [[Christ]]. He sent letters to [[Pope Paul VI]] and unsuccessfully attempted to meet him.&lt;ref name=Gamboni/&gt;

==Vandalism of ''Pietà''==
On 21 May 1972, at 33 years of age ([[Jesus]]'s traditional age at death), on the Feast of [[Pentecost]], Toth, wielding a [[geologist's hammer]] and shouting, "I am Jesus Christ — risen from the dead",&lt;ref name=Gamboni/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:Lionel Brough.jpg|thumb|right|Lionel Brough]]
'''Lionel Brough''' (10 March 1836 – 9 November 1909) was a British actor and comedian.  After beginning a journalistic career and performing as an amateur, he became a professional actor, performing mostly in [[Liverpool]] during the mid-1860s.  He established his career in London as a member of the company at the new [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre]] in 1867, and he soon became known for his roles in Shakespeare, contemporary comedies, and classics, especially as [[Tony Lumpkin]] in ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]''.

In the 1870s and 1880s, Brough was one of the leading comic actors in London.  Although untrained musically, he also appeared in several successful [[operettas]] in the 1880s and 1890s.  He continued to contribute popular performances into the 20th century and ended his career in comedy roles with [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s company.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Brough was born in [[Pontypool]], Wales, the son of [[Barnabas Brough]], a brewer, publican, wine merchant and later dramatist, and his wife Frances Whiteside, a poet and novelist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/11/25/101823111.pdf "Mrs. Barnabas Brough Dead",] ''The New York Times'', 25 November 1897, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  His brothers, [[William Brough (writer)|William]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Brough, William (1826-1870)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Barnabas Brough|Robert]] (father of actress [[Fanny Brough]]) were also playwrights, and his brother [[John Cargill Brough]] was a science writer.  His father was briefly kidnapped by the [[Chartists]] in 1839 and was a prosecution witness at the trial of the Chartist leader [[John Frost (Chartist)|John Frost]], which resulted in Frost's deportation to Australia.  The family was ostracised and ruined financially as a result, and they moved to [[Manchester]] in 1843.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Banerji, Nilanjana. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32100  "Brough, Lionel (1836–1909)"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 25 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Brough's first job was as an office boy at ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''.  He was then employed as assistant publisher by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and for several years at ''[[The Morning Star (19th century U.K. newspaper)|The Morning Star]]''.  At the former, he introduced to England the American system of selling the newspaper in the streets using newsboys.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'' obituary notice, 9 November 1909, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Brough made his stage debut at age 18 with the company of [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] to play in an extravaganza written by his brother William.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;  In 1858, he was again at the Lyceum but then left the professional stage to work at ''The Morning Star''.&lt;ref name=Waddy&gt;Waddy, Frederick. [https://archive.org/details/cartoonportraits00wadduoft ''Cartoon Portraits and Biographical Sketches of Men of the Day''], Tinsley brothers: London (1873), pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;  He performed in amateur theatricals in the early 1860s.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/11/09/101748746.pdf "Lionel Brough Dead",] ''The New York Times'', 9 November 1909, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; As an amateur he appeared before Queen Victoria at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in 1860 with the Savage Club, in a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of the [[Ali Baba]] story called ''The Forty Thieves'', and was judged by the critic of ''The Times'' to have played like a practised professional.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 March 1860, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; This burlesque was presented as a fund-raiser for the Lancashire Famine Relief Fund.&lt;ref name=Int&gt;Undated interview with Lionel Brough, on file in Manchestre City Library, SC 920 BRO&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moonshine-Saker-Brough-Box-Cox-1883.jpg|upright|right|thumb|[[Edward Saker]] and Brough in ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]'']]

===Professional career===
Brough repeated ''The Forty Thieves'' in [[Liverpool]], where Alexander Henderson, manager of the Prince of Wales Theatre in that city, was impressed enough to engage Brough for his company.&lt;ref name=Int/&gt;  In his ''[[Who's Who]]'' entry, Brough recorded: "joined theatrical profession (permanently) at Prince of Wales's, Liverpool, 1863."&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U184135 "Brough, Lionel",] ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 25 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The company there included [[Squire Bancroft]] and [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; In 1864, he performed there as Iago in ''Ernani'' opposite [[Lydia Thompson]] and Lavinia in ''The Miller and His Men''. He also performed at other Liverpool theatres in the 1860s, including the Amphitheatre and the Alexandra, at the last of which he performed with [[Edward Saker]], with whom he also toured.&lt;ref name=Int/&gt;&lt;ref name=Liverpool&gt;Broadbent, R.

Brough made his London debut in 1865 in ''Prince Pretty Pet'' by his brother William at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; but continued mostly in Liverpool until 1867.&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt; In 1867, he joined the London company that opened the new [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre]], with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], [[Henry Irving]], [[J. L. Toole]], [[Ellen Terry]] and [[Henrietta Hodson]], in a production of [[Charles Reade]]'s ''The Double Marriage''.  ''The Times'' wrote of him, "Mr Lionel Brough, an accession from the Liverpool stage, in the small part of Dard, showed the right and rare quality of humour without gag or grimace.... His appearance in other characters will be looked for with interest."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 26 October 1867, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', he was cast as Grumio.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 29 December 1867, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  He then played the serious role of uncle Ben Garner in ''Dearer Than Life'', by [[H. J. Byron]] together with Toole, Irving and [[Harriet Everard]], in which he was praised for his "very great power", and in which role he frequently toured.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 12 January 1868, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'', [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s parody of ''[[La fille du régiment]]'', in which the same critic said that Brough "appears to understand thoroughly and remarkably for so young an actor the true principles of burlesque acting."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 26 January 1868, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The same company presented many adaptations of the novels of [[Charles Dickens]], including ''Oliver Twist'' in 1868, with Brough as Bumble the beadle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 12 April 1868, p. 7 and ''The Times'', 20 April 1868, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, at the [[St James's Theatre]]'s revival of ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', Brough played Tony Lumpkin for almost 200 nights. Thenceforth, in the words of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', "he was the accepted representative of the character, which he played in all 777 times."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', in its obituary notice, gives this figure as 7777, but that would be the approximate equivalent of playing the part six times every week for 25 years&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Tony Lumpkin and Ben Garner, according to Frederick Waddy, Brough's best-known early roles were Spotty in ''The Lancashire Lass'', Sampson Burr in ''The Porter's Knot'', Mark Meddle in ''London Assurance'' and Robin Wildbriar in ''Extremes''.  In 1873, Waddy wrote of Brough, "to his great natural humour and fun he adds a conscientious and careful study of the characters he undertakes.... He plays them with marked intelligence and appreciation, and a display of genuine humorous power and versatility not too frequently met with on the stage".&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt;

[[File:Lionel-brough-moonshine.jpg|thumb|right|1884 caricatures of Brough]]
In 1870, Brough was the title character in ''Paul Pry'' at the St. James's Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/whoswhointhethea008058mbp/whoswhointhethea008058mbp_djvu.txt ''Who's Who in the Theatre: A Biographical Record of the Contemporary Stage''], John Parker (ed.), Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1871, with [[Mrs. John Wood]], he performed in ''Milky White'' and ''Poll and Partner Joe''.&lt;ref name=Liverpool/&gt;  In 1872, he acted as stage manager for [[Dion Boucicault]] at the [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].&lt;ref name=Waddy/&gt;  Though not trained as a singer, Brough was recruited in 1872 to join Joseph Fell's company at the [[Holborn Theatre]] in leading roles in popular musical works including [[F. C. Burnand]]'s English version of ''[[La Vie parisienne (operetta)|La Vie parisienne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 21 April 1872, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In August of the same year he appeared at Covent Garden in [[Dion Boucicault]]'s fairy drama ''Babil and Bijou''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 31 August 1872, p. 8 and ''The Observer'', 1 September 1872, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1870s, Brough was resident comic lead at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]], Globe, Charing Cross and Imperial theatres. In the 1870s and 1880s he increasingly augmented his popular parts in modern works with more revivals of classic comic roles, including Tony Lumpkin again, Croaker in [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''The Good-Natured Man'', Dromio of Ephesus in ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' and Bob Acres in ''[[The Rivals]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  In 1878, he played opposite Lydia Thompson in burlesques at the [[Folly Theatre]], including as King Jingo in ''Stars and Garters''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchivePressText/20021123.html Footnote Lights 23 November 2002], accessed 21 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  He appeared as Valentine in ''[[Mefistofele]]'' (1880) with Lizzie St Quentin in the title role, [[Frederick Hobson Leslie|Fred Leslie]]  as [[Faust]] and [[Constance Loseby]] as Marguerite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://operetta-research-center.org/le-petit-faust-opera-bouffe-3-acts/ ''Mefistofele''], Operetta Research Center, accessed July 30, 2014; and [http://www.kent.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/theatre/r.php/31437/show.html ''Mefistofele''], Theatre Collection of the [[University of Kent]], accessed July 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Brough's popular characters was Constable Robert Roberts, "Policeman X24", an early example of the archetypical British bobby, which he presented at concerts and benefit performances.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The Era'', 25 April 1869, p. 9; ''Dundee Courier'', 24 May 1869, p. 1; and "Mr. G. W. Moore's Benefit", ''The Era'', 3 May 1874, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  The character was a vehicle for Brough to entertain an audience with banter and comic songs.  In contrast, Brough also played a serious role as a policeman in an 1884 one-act play, ''Off Duty'', as Sergeant Ben Bloss, in which, ''The Morning Post'' said, "Mr Lionel Brough has a pathetic part, which he plays with earnestness and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Post'', 11 September 1884, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Brough originated the role of Nick Vedder in the hit operetta ''[[Rip Van Winkle (operetta)|Rip Van Winkle]]'', in 1882, and played in another operetta, ''[[Nell Gwynne (operetta)|Nell Gwynne]]'', in 1884.  In 1885, he toured the United States with [[Violet Cameron]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  In 1888, he appeared in T. Edgar Pemberton's comedy, ''Steeple Jack''.&lt;ref name=Liverpool/&gt;  Brough played the comic lead, Pietro, in Gilbert and [[Alfred Cellier]]'s [[comic opera]] ''[[The Mountebanks]]'' (1892).&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_gilbert/mountebanks/iln.html Review of ''The Mountebanks''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001072052/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/mountebanks/iln.html |date= 1 October 2009 }} from ''The Illustrated London News'', 9 January 1892&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lionel Brough, Vanity Fair, 1905-03-30.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Brough caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1905]]

===Later years===
In the final phase of his career Brough was a regular member of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s company at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] from 1894 until his death, becoming famous for his comedy roles in Shakespeare, including Sir Toby Belch in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', Touchstone in ''[[As You Like It]]'', Trinculo in ''[[The Tempest]]'', and  the gardener in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt; His last appearances were in 1909 as the grave-digger in ''[[Hamlet]]'' (described by ''The Observer'' as "ideal"), Moses in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', and the host of the Garter Inn in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 4 July 1909, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Brough encouraged all his children to become actors. His elder daughter [[Mary Brough]] ("Polly") had a long and successful career.  His elder son "'Bobbie" (Sydney Brough, 1868–1911) was a popular leading man when he died of complications following a throat infection; he was married to Lizzie Webster, a granddaughter of [[Benjamin Nottingham Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Margaret Webster: A Life in the Theater|author=Barranger, Milly S.|year=2004|publisher=U. of Michigan Press|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0472113909}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lionel Brough's younger daughter "Daisy" (Margaret Brough, 1870–1901) died of peritonitis, and his younger son Percy Brough (1872–1904) toured with the Brough-Boucicault Comedy Company in Australia and New Zealand but died en route from England to China.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Webster Brough, Prompt Copy, Hutchinson, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

Brough died at his home, Percy Villa, in [[South Lambeth]] at the age of 73&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and was buried at [[West Norwood Cemetery]].  ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' said of him in its obituary, "His power of holding his audience and obtaining his effects by the simplest means, and with an expert knowledge of their value, made his work delightful. ...  In private life, Mr Brough was universally popular with a fund of anecdote which often kept the members of the Eccentric and other clubs in roars of laughter till the early hours of the morning."&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 9 November 1909, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Luite Klaver03a.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''[[Aesculus hippocastanum]]'' – Horse chestnut (1905)&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Image:Luite Klaver04a.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''[[Tulipa gesneriana]]'' (1905)&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Luite Klaver''' (21 September 1870 – 28 November 1960) was a Dutch painter, lithographer and inventor.

Klaver was born in [[Hattem]], [[Gelderland]], the son of Hendricus Jacobus Klaver, a carpenter and grocer, and Evelina Lubberta Barendsen.

His talent as artist was apparent from an early age. He worked as an apprentice carpenter for some years and received painting tuition from another Hattem resident, the landscape painter Jan Voerman Snr. In 1892 he arrived in [[Amsterdam]] to study painting. Here he met fellow student Gerarda Jacoba Doyer, born in [[Deventer]] on 4 May 1864, to a family of French [[Hugenot]] descent. They were married in 1898 and settled in [[Oldebroek]], where Luite started a nursery growing flowers and vegetables. He happened to be the first horticulturist to cultivate [[Gerbera]]s. His artistic talent and scientific accuracy in depicting plants is evident in the numerous lithographs that appeared in six books, published by Sederius and S.L. van Looy.

Between 1895 and 1898 Klaver studied at the Rijksnormaalschool in Amsterdam, which trained high school teachers. He also photographed art works for ''van Meurs and Co'', augmenting his income.

Luite and Gerarda had three children born in [[Oldebroek]] – Clare Helena (1899), Eveline Hendrika (1902) and Dirk Anton (1911). Gerarda died in 1915 of [[tuberculosis]]. Luite and the 3 children finally settled in [[Hattem]] on the estate of Molecaten. In 1918 Luite married Gerarda's niece, Egberta Hendrika Barendsen (born in [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]] on 19 October 1875 and died in 1945). They later moved to [[Soestduinen]], where he was part of the management of a factory producing photographic materials.
	
Luite became interested in colour photography and patented various cameras using [[dichroic filters]] and glass plates coated with colour-sensitive emulsions. A gallery of his photographs is at the Prentenkabinet Museum in [[Leiden]]. Most of his paintings belong to his descendants, while some are with the [http://www.voermanmuseumhattem.nl/ Voerman museum] in Hattem.

He died, aged 90, in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and was buried in [[Driebergen]].

'''Luke Oliver Johnson''' (born 2 February 1962), is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[entrepreneur]], best known for his involvement with [[Pizza Express]] chain. He is a former chairman of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] and [[Channel 4]]. He writes a weekly column for ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. Johnson calls himself a "projector", in line with the 17th century term for a man involved in many different businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3021321.stm|title=Pizza Express entrepreneur looks to the future|last=Cummings|first=Laura|date=15 May 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others regard him as just a serial entrepreneur.
He is the part owner and chairman of [[Patisserie Valerie]], Gail's Artisan Bakery and [[Feng Sushi]] among other businesses. He is a former owner of [[The Ivy]], Le Caprice and J Sheekey restaurants and a former part owner of [[Giraffe Restaurants]].

==Early years==
The son of historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] and brother of [[Daniel Johnson (journalist)|Daniel Johnson]], he spent his early years in [[Iver]], [[Buckinghamshire]], and was educated at the state run [[Langley Grammar School]] in [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]], [[Berkshire]], and at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].

Whilst at university Johnson together with fellow student [[Hugh Osmond]] (later founder of [[Punch Taverns]]) interviewed [[Richard Branson]] on his houseboat in [[London]] for the student newspaper. This gave the pair the inspiration to go into business and they began running the ''Era'' nightclub in [[Oxford]]. By the time of graduation, he and Osmond were running businesses from software to clubs.

He initially studied medicine but, like Hugh Osmond, only completed the first part of the course, graduating from Oxford University with a BA in Physiological Sciences in 1983. He began his career as a media analyst at [[stockbroker]] Grieveson Grant (subsequently [[Kleinwort Benson]] Securities).

==Business career==

===Restaurants and leisure===

In 1993, Johnson and Osmond took control of [[Pizza Express]], with Johnson becoming chairman. They expanded the business from 12 owned restaurants to over 250, and the share price from 40p to over 900p.&lt;ref name="aboutluke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lukejohnson.org/about|title=About Luke Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; After selling the business in 1999 Johnson started Signature Restaurants, a ‘crown jewels’ collection of London restaurants which included [[The Ivy]] and Le Caprice, as well as the [[Belgo]] chain. He also started [[Strada]] restaurants from scratch, taking the chain to 30 units. He sold both businesses in 2005; the total proceeds from these two disposals were in excess of £90 million.&lt;ref name="aboutluke" /&gt;

Whilst chairman of the Belgo group, Johnson took part in the [[BBC]] programme "''Back to the Floor''", a programme in which top executives spent a week at the "coal face" of their business.  Some reviewers of the programme were uncomplimentary about Johnson.

From 1993 to date, Johnson has been involved as director and/or owner of various companies in retailing, pubs and bars, including [[Whittard of Chelsea]], My Kinda Town and the private companies Giraffe,&lt;ref&gt;Shrimpton, David (25 March 2004).

Johnson also purchased in 2010 a stake in [[artisan]] bakery Flour Power City, which supplies restaurants, hotels, and caterers. Flour Power City also operates stalls in locations such as [[Borough]] Market in [[London]]. This business also became part of Patisserie Holdings.

=== Patisserie Holdings ===
Johnson is the Executive Chairman, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, and a 37% shareholder [http://investors.patisserieholdings.co.uk/~/media/Files/P/Patisserie-Valerie-IR/results-presentations/20171222-patisserie-holdings-annual-report.pdf] of [http://investors.patisserieholdings.co.uk/ Patisserie Holdings pl]  &lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Jennifer (20 September 2006).[http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/593433/C4-chairman-Johnson-buys-stake-Patisserie-Valerie/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH "C4 chairman Johnson buys stake in Patisserie Valerie"].

The principal trading brand is [[Patisserie Valerie]]; the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker &amp; Spice, and Flour Power City Bakery. The company's auditor is [[Grant Thornton International|Grant Thornton]]. 

On 19 May 2014 the company was admitted to the [[Alternative Investment Market]] [http://investors.patisserieholdings.co.uk/~/media/Files/P/Patisserie-Valerie-IR/documents/14052014a.pdf]. The company had a market value of £446.13 million at close of business on 9th October 2018 [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/exchange-insight/company-news.html?fourWayKey=GB00BM4NV504GBGBXAMSM]  [https://www.dropbox.com/s/axtaoxyb4wd83dk/Market%20cap%20Oct%202018.jpg?dl=0], the closing price being quoted as 425.9 pence [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/other/13822977.html]. That evening [[Sky News]] published a news item headed: 'Patisserie Valerie owner faces crisis 'over £20m accounting hole' [https://news.sky.com/story/patisserie-valerie-owner-faces-crisis-over-20m-accounting-hole-11522365].

==== Fraud investigation at Patisserie Holdings ====
On 10th October the company's shares were suspended from trading. An announcement included information that the board had been notified of significant and potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities, that a potential material mis-statement of the company's accounts had significantly impacted the company's cash position, and that Chris Marsh, the Chief Financial Officer, had been suspended from his role [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/CAKE/13822979.html]. 

On 11 October the company announced that there was a material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business and that without an immediate injection of capital the directors were of the view that there would be no scope for the business to continue trading in its current form. This announcement also stated that the directors and the company's professional advisers were assessing all options available to the business to keep it trading.[https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/CAKE/13825482.html].

On 12 October Hertfordshire police issued a statement saying that 'A 44-year old man from St Albans has been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. He has been released under investigation.' It was widely reported that the individual concerned was Marsh [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/12/finance-director-of-crisis-hit-patisserie-valerie-arrested-chris-marsh], [https://news.sky.com/story/crisis-hit-patisserie-valerie-finance-chief-arrested-by-police-11524081]. The [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] announced on its website that it had opened an investigation into an individual at the company [https://www.sfo.gov.uk/2018/10/12/patisserie-holdings-plc/]. Later that day the company announced details of a rescue plan under which it would borrow £20 million from Johnson [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/CAKE/13827568.html] and place 31,451,100 ordinary shares at 50 pence to raise new capital of approximately £15.7m before payment of expenses [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/CAKE/13827697.html]. Johnson faced the choice of letting the company fail (at which point he would still have been worth over £100m), or lending money to it, albeit on terms that the majority of the loans would be repaid by the proceeds of the placings. The rescue plan prevented the imminent bankruptcy of the company and subsequent loss of 2500 jobs, but was criticised in The Telegraph as being against the interests of smaller shareholders.[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/13/30m-rescue-deal-ignored-patisserie-valerie-bosses/] 

On 14 October it was reported that two unauthorised and unreported overdrafts of almost £10m had been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/patisserie-valeries-secret-overdrafts-xdn0l7dl6|title=Patisserie Valerie’s secret overdrafts|last=Shah|first=Oliver|date=2018-10-14|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Directors' share dealings ====
Johnson was the only director of the company never to have sold shares after flotation {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Earlier in 2018 Paul May, the company's CEO, and Marsh both exercised share options at a price of 418p, allegedly making £1 million and £680,000, respectively. At the end of June Lee Ginsberg, deputy chairman and head of the audit committee, sold 40,000 shares at 469p, making almost £190,000 [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/patisserie-valerie-owner-on-brink-of-collapse-sd5jwpd0k]. These figures relate to legitimate transactions pre-dating the crisis, with no suggestion that the board extracted cash from the company in such a way as to contribute to the alleged accounting fraud. 

==== Criticisms ====
The events at the company have been criticised in a statement that 'If wonky accounting can go unnoticed at a plain-vanilla business like Patisserie Holdings, investors really have nowhere to feel safe.' [https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-10/a-cake-based-accounting-scandal-how-very-british]

==Business approach==

Among Johnson's business maxims are that, consciously or not, every successful company that he knows has followed kaizen, the Japanese management philosophy of constant, incremental improvements, often driven from the bottom up.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL7LGtKBNW4&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Luke Johnson: 20 Entrepreneur Maxims - London Business School|date=16 September 2014|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Lupin III'''''|ルパン三世|Rupan Sansei|lead=yes}}, also written as '''''Lupin the Third''''', '''''Lupin the 3rd''''' or '''''Lupin the IIIrd''''', is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Monkey Punch]]. It follows the escapades of master thief [[Arsène Lupin III]], the grandson of [[Arsène Lupin]], the [[gentleman thief]] of [[Maurice Leblanc]]'s series of novels.

The [[Lupin III (manga)|''Lupin III'' manga]], which first appeared in ''[[Weekly Manga Action]]'' on August 10, 1967, spawned a [[media franchise]] that includes numerous manga, two versions of an [[anime|animated]] [[Television pilot|pilot film]], six animated television series, eight theatrically-released animated films, two live-action films, six [[Original video animation|OVA]] works, [[List of Lupin III television specials|twenty-five animated television special]]s, two musicals, [[List of Lupin III soundtracks|many music CDs]], and [[List of Lupin III video games|several video games]]. Many different companies have owned the English-language distribution rights to various ''Lupin III'' properties at various times, with just the first two animated films having been released by over 10 companies alone. [[Tokyopop]] acquired the license to the original manga in 2002, and later the second series in 2004. [[Funimation Entertainment]] purchased the rights to several of the television specials and films in 2002, and the fourth television series in 2012. [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Geneon]] licensed and [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] 79 episodes of the second television series, 26 of which were broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] during 2003. [[Discotek Media]] licensed the entire first, second and fifth television series and the [[Lupin III: Strange Psychokinetic Strategy (film)|first live-action film]]; they also own the rights to several other ''Lupin'' titles, including some previously released by other companies.

Over fifty years after its creation, ''Lupin III'' remains popular, with a sixth anime series airing in 2018. Critical reception of the franchise has been largely positive across its various incarnations, with the appeal of the lead characters being noted as the primary factor of the series' success. The [[voice acting]] (in both Japanese and English versions) and soundtracks (especially those composed by [[Yuji Ohno]]) of the anime adaptations have also received similar compliments; however, several of the franchise's installments, most specifically the television specials, have been criticized for being formulaic. The manga has also been noted by fans and critics for its darker tone compared to the anime, with its explicit depictions of sex and violence, as well as its [[black comedy|black]], [[Fourth wall|fourth wall-breaking]] sense of humor, contrasting with the mostly [[family-friendly]] animated versions. For several years, issues relating to the copyright of Maurice Leblanc's intellectual property meant that the Lupin name was removed from its releases outside Japan, usually changed to "Rupan" or "Wolf". However, the copyright has since expired, allowing foreign releases to use the Lupin name.

==Premise==
{{Main article|List of Lupin III characters}}

[[Arsène Lupin III]], the grandson of the fictional [[gentleman thief]], [[Arsène Lupin]], is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is [[Daisuke Jigen]], an expert [[marksman]] who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]], a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or [[Fujiko Mine]], a [[femme fatale]] and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector [[Koichi Zenigata]] of [[Interpol]], who has made it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.

==Production==
[[File:Lupin_III_cast.jpg|thumb|left|The main cast of ''Lupin the Third'', as drawn by Monkey Punch. From top to bottom: Lupin, Fujiko, Jigen, Goemon, Zenigata.]]

The series was created by Japanese manga artist Kazuhiko Katō under the pen name [[Monkey Punch]]. His inspiration for the series was the fictional French gentleman thief [[Arsène Lupin]], created by [[Maurice Leblanc]]. Before creating the series he read 15 of Leblanc's stories. The aim of the ''Lupin III'' series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected the traits of Leblanc's character. Originally the intention was to keep the blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however he was convinced by others not to do so.&lt;ref name="MM20"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Manga Mania |issn=0968-9575 |date=March 1995 |number=20 |pages=6–9 |publisher=[[Manga Entertainment|Manga Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monkey Punch combined elements of Arsène Lupin with [[James Bond]] to develop the character of Lupin III and made him a "carefree fellow". Lupin was given a red color jacket which Monkey Punch believes is a flashy, sexy color.&lt;ref name="MM20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MMpostermag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoA"&gt;{{cite AV media |work=[[Lupin the 3rd: Dead or Alive]] | title=Interview with Monkey Punch |publisher=[[Funimation]] |medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the series was to be published in a magazine targeted at adults, Fujiko Mine was created to add a female presence and to fulfill a "[[Bond girl]]" role. Her name was inspired by a picture of [[Mount Fuji]], Monkey Punch added the -ko female suffix to create her first name, and chose "Mine" for her family name because of its meaning as "summit". At the beginning of the series, many of the women Lupin encounters are all named Fujiko, but are treated as different characters from chapter to chapter. Creating a new female each week was too difficult for Monkey Punch so she evolved into a single character who changes style frequently.&lt;ref name="MM20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[Otaku USA]] |last=Surat |first=Daryl |volume=6 |issue=4  |date=February 2013 |issn=1939-3318 |publisher=Sovereign Media |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jigen was based on [[James Coburn]], especially his role in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', and his name was chosen to reflect his unconventional personality. Goemon was created to give an [[oriental]] element into an otherwise western series. Despite Lupin and Goemon originally being enemies, Monkey Punch decided that they were on the same wavelength. While Lupin, Fujiko, Jigen and Goemon frequently operate together for their own goals, the author considers them not to be a true group as they have their own individual interests.&lt;ref name="MM20"/&gt; In the manga they operated individually, however in the anime adaptations the group tend to work together. Inspector Zenigata was conceived as Lupin's archrival to create a "human [[Tom and Jerry]]".&lt;ref name="DoA"/&gt;

When Monkey Punch began ''Lupin III'', he was already working on another series, ''Pinky Punky''. Monkey Punch enjoys writing outlaw characters, and both ''Lupin III'' and ''Pinky Punky'' made use of outlaws as central characters. According to him, this made it easy for him to write two series without much pressure. Monkey Punch enjoys puzzles and mysteries such as ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' and [[Agatha Christie]] novels, and was also inspired by ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and the movies of [[Alfred Hitchcock]].&lt;ref name="MMpostermag"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Manga Mania |issn=0968-9575 |date=May 1996 |number=34 |at=Poster Magazine Insert |publisher=[[Manga Entertainment|Manga Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ann interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2003-11-13 | title=Interview: Monkey Punch | first=Allen | last=Divers | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | date=November 13, 2003 | accessdate=July 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes the characters of Lupin and Fujiko are similar to the characters of [[D'Artagnan]] and [[Milady de Winter]], and describes them as "Not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other".&lt;ref name="ann interview"/&gt; Another influence on the manga was [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]].&lt;ref name="DoDVD"&gt;{{cite video| people = Monkey Punch Interview (DVD Extra)| title = Lupin the 3rd: Dead or Alive| medium = DVD| publisher=[[Funimation Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monkey Punch said the appeal of drawing Lupin comes from the character being able to go anywhere without obstacles and being able to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. However, this is contrasted by the appeal of Zenigata's strict personality. Originally the series was only expected to last three months, but due to its popularity, Monkey Punch continued to draw it. However, despite his happiness at its success, he has expressed confusion over its popularity.&lt;ref name="ann interview"/&gt;

Monkey Punch has said that he believes the story can never end but that if he had to, both Zenigata and Lupin would have to end as equals. They would either both fail, both win or both get very old.&lt;ref name=roughguide&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Manga |last=Yadao |first=Jason S. |publisher=[[Rough Guides]] |isbn=978-1-85828-561-0 |pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright issues==
Monkey Punch did not ask permission to use the Arsène Lupin name and at the time Japan did not enforce trade copyrights. By the time Leblanc's estate launched legal action in Japan, the name was considered to have entered into common use.&lt;ref name="MM20"/&gt; However, this was not the case in North America and Europe and several foreign releases of ''Lupin III'' media dropped the Lupin III title and the character himself was renamed to "Rupan" or "Wolf". In France, the series was known as ''Edgar, Detective Cambrioleur'' (Edgar, Detective Burglar) with Lupin himself renamed "Edgar de la Cambriole" (Edgar of Burglary).&lt;ref name="Lupin Tapes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/the-lupin-tapes/2010-06-06 |title=The Lupin Tapes - The Mike Toole Show |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monkey Punch has stated that using the same character design, behavior and face would be illegal, but using a name alone is not illegal.&lt;ref name="MMpostermag"/&gt; In 2012, Leblanc's original Arsène Lupin entered the [[public domain]] in France due to 70 years passing since his death in 1941, and is in the public domain for any country that enforces the [[rule of the shorter term]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/01/02-1/original-lupin-character-enters-public-domain-in-2012 |title=Original Lupin Character Enters Public Domain in 2012 |publisher=[[Crunchyroll]] |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]'', [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] referred to Monkey Punch's original manga as "a crazy, groovy 1960s world of dynamite and backstabbing, hippies and gangsters", and considered it "a fascinating homage to [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]] and a four star example of comics as pure comedy."

In ''Anime Classics Zettai!'', Brian Clamp and Julie Davis compare the first two anime adaptions. They note that the first series is of a serious style, closer to the original manga with a dark tone and that it focuses on disputes between Lupin and other criminals. In contrast they sum up the second series as a ''caper comedy'' with a more comedic tone and style.&lt;ref name="Zettai"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Camp |first1=Brian |last2=Davis|first2=Julie |title=Anime Classics Zettai! |pages=192–197 |isbn=978-1-933330-22-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Chris Beveridge of Mania.com and Mike Crandol of ANN disliked the dub of the second television series because [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Pioneer Entertainment]] used many modern references and updated dialogue for a series that was released in the late 1970s, although the series itself received a positive overall review from both reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128113034/http://www.mania.com/lupin-3rd-tv-vol-01-world8217s-wanted_article_74850.html | url=http://www.mania.com/lupin-3rd-tv-vol-01-world8217s-wanted_article_74850.html | title=Lupin the 3rd TV Vol. #01: The World’s Most Wanted Review | last=Beveridge | first=Chris | publisher=Mania | date=December 1, 2002 | accessdate=March 11, 2014 |archivedate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/lupin-iii/dvd-1 | title=Lupin III DVD 1: The World's Most Wanted Review | last=Crandol | first=Mike | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | date=January 28, 2003 | accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Lineberger of DVD Verdict wrote, "''Lupin the Third'' is ''[[James Bond]]'' meets ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' with ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' sensibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/lupinthe3rd.php |title=Lupin The Third: The World's Most Wanted Review |last=Lineberger |first=Rob |publisher=[[DVD Verdict]] |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=March 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311223826/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/lupinthe3rd.php |archivedate=March 11, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monkey Punch believes that the voice work of [[Yasuo Yamada]] was a large reason for the popularity of the anime series.&lt;ref name="MMpostermag"/&gt;

Critical reception of [[Lupin III (film)|the 2014 live-action film]] was generally negative among Japanese and Western film critics, especially following the film’s showing at [[LA EigaFest]]. Areas frequently targeted for criticism were [[Ryuhei Kitamura]]'s direction, the film’s supporting characters, screenplay, cinematography and editing (especially in the action scenes), costume design and soundtrack. The film was also criticized for having most of the its dialogue performed in English (resulting in poor delivery and intonation of numerous lines by its Asian cast members), and for overall squandering its potential as an adaptation of Monkey Punch’s manga. [[Shun Oguri]], [[Tetsuji Tamayama]], [[Gō Ayano]], [[Meisa Kuroki]] and [[Tadanobu Asano]] were, however, frequently seen as well-cast in their respective roles. Audience opinions were mixed, with some viewing the film as “an enjoyable time to be had to the whole family”, while others viewed it as part of a “terrible live-action adaptation trend that has been going on through the years”.&lt;ref name="Kotaku AUS"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/things-sound-grim-for-the-lupin-movie/|title= Things Sound Grim For The Lupin Movie|author=Nakamura, Toshi|date=29 August 2014|publisher=[[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kotaku&gt;{{cite web|url= http://kotaku.com/lupin-iii-is-both-a-terrible-adaptation-and-a-horrible-1629442672|title= Lupin III Is Both a Terrible Adaptation and a Horrible Film|author= Eisenbeis, Richard |date=2 September 2014|publisher=[[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Otaku USA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/JPop/News1/Lupin-III-2014-LiveAction-Review-5914.aspx|title= Lupin III (2014) Live-Action Review|author= Schley, Matt |date=8 September 2014|publisher=[[Otaku USA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 1984, the series was the last animated work to be featured on the cover of the Japanese TV Guide magazine before the implementation of a policy limiting the cover to live action images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anime A History |author=[[Jonathan Clements]] |page=137 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |isbn=978-1-84457-390-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Kanye West]]'s "[[Touch the Sky (Kanye West song)|Touch the Sky]]" featured rapper [[Lupe Fiasco]] referencing Lupin III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blerds.atlantablackstar.com/2014/12/24/10-black-celebrities-expressed-love-anime/4/ |title=10 Black Celebrities Who Have Expressed Their Love For Anime |publisher=[[Atlanta Backstar]] |date=December 24, 2014 |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Japanese-Canadian rock band [[Monkey Majik]] created an animated music video in which its members meet the ''Lupin III'' cast. The video, which is set to the band's version of the anime's theme song, promoted the ''Lupin the Third Dance &amp; Drive official covers &amp; remixes'' CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-08-04/monkey-majik-makes-music-video-with-lupin-iii-anime |title=Monkey Majik Makes Music Video with Lupin III Anime |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign titled "Lupin Steal Japan" was launched that same year by NTV, TMS Entertainment, [[Namco Bandai Games]], and [[Heiwa (pachinko)|Heiwa]] — a manufacturer of [[pachinko]] machines. The project's website took suggestions on real-life objects for Lupin to steal. One such example is the [[Moai]] statue in [[Shibuya]], which was taken elsewhere for cleaning on December 7, but was replaced by the calling card of the master thief that read "Thanks for the Moai".&lt;ref name="steal japan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-12-08/lupin-steals-statue-obama-attends-afro-samurai-show |title=Lupin 'Steals' Statue, 'Obama' Attends Afro Samurai Show |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shibukei.com/headline/6578/ |title=「行方不明」のモヤイ像、戻る－ルパン三世「犯行声明」から2週間 |publisher=shibukei.com |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[United States Mint]] released a silver dollar [[commemorative coin]] in honor of the 230th birthday of the [[United States Marine Corps]].

The coin was sold as both as a [[proof coinage|proof coin]] and an uncirculated coin, for a total number of 600,000 coins. They became available to order on July 20, 2005, and by September 21, 2005, all coins had been purchased.

This was the first time the United States released a coin to represent a branch of its military.

== Specifications ==
The coin features one of the most recognizable scenes of Marine Corps history, ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''. Additionally, the Marine Corps official emblem, the [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] is on the reverse.

'''Mintage (max.)''': 600,000
Based on independent market research provided by the recipient organization (the [[Marine Corps Heritage Foundation]]), the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary]] exercised his authority (for the first time) to increase the legislated maximum mintage (500,000) to 600,000.

'''U.S. Mint Facility''': [[Philadelphia Mint|Philadelphia]]

'''[[American administrative law|Public Law]]''': 108-291

'''Minimalism''' describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially [[Visual arts|visual art]] and [[Minimalist music|music]], where the work is set out to expose the essence, essentials or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms, features or concepts. As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western Art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with this movement include [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Frank Stella]]. Artists themselves have sometimes reacted against the label due to the negative implication of the work being simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Amy. Styles, Schools and Movements, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2002.] "The artists themselves did not like the label because of the negative implication that their work was simplistic and devoid of 'art content'."&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalism is often interpreted as a reaction against [[Abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|Postminimal]] art practices.

Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at the [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and the [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture''' shown from April 27 - June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine &lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, "Engineer's Esthetic", pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, "The New Druids", pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]] also in 1966 that showcased [[Geometric abstraction]] in the American art world via [[Shaped canvas]], [[Color Field]], and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 ''Systemic Painting'', Guggenheim Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/systemic-art Systemic art, Oxford-Art encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Systemic+Painting,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NdebCUxYBJ&amp;sig=JLIUKPxFw3KycjSoDwPKLFqRz3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0alTT7m1LcTz0gHhw7y8DQ&amp;ved=0CHsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Systemic%20Painting%2C&amp;f=false Lawrence Alloway, ''Systemic Painting'', Google books online]&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of those exhibitions and a few others the [[art movement]] called ''minimal art'' emerged.

==History==
[[Jean Metzinger]], following the ''[[Succès de scandale]]'' created from the [[Cubist]] showing at the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], in an interview with Cyril Berger published in ''Paris-Journal'' 29 May 1911, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We cubists have only done our duty by creating a new rhythm for the benefit of humanity. Others will come after us who will do the same. What will they find? That is the tremendous secret of the future. Who knows if someday, a great painter, looking with scorn on the often brutal game of supposed colorists and taking the seven colors back to the primordial white unity that encompasses them all, will not exhibit completely white canvases, with nothing, absolutely nothing on them. (Jean Metzinger, 29 May 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, "Chez Metzi'', interview by Cyril Berger, published in the ''Paris-Journal'', 29 May 1911, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten: ''A Cubism Reader, Documents and Criticism, 1906-1914'', University of Chicago Press, 2008, Document 17, Cyril Berger, ''Chez Metzi'', Paris-Journal, 29 May 1911, pp. 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Metzinger's (then) audacious prediction that artists would take [[abstract art|abstraction]] to its logical conclusion by vacating representational subject matter entirely and returning to what Metzinger calls the "primordial white unity", a "completely white canvas" would be realized two years later. The writer of a satirical manifesto, possibly [[Francis Picabia]], in a publication entitled ''Evolution de l'art: Vers l'amorphisme'', in ''Les Hommes du Jour'' (3 May 1913), may have had Metzinger's vision in mind when the author justified amorphism's blank canvases by claiming 'light is enough for us'.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt; With perspective, writes art historian Jeffery S. Weiss, "''Vers Amorphisme'' may be gibberish, but it was also enough of a foundational language to anticipate the extreme reductivist implications of non-objectivity".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jj82ZE_ctIoC&amp;pg=PA86 Jeffrey S. Weiss, ''The Popular Culture of Modern Art: Picasso, Duchamp, and Avant-gardism''], Yale University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|9780300058956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monochrome painting was initiated at the first [[Incoherents|Incoherent arts]]' exhibition in 1882 in Paris, with a black painting by poet [[Paul Bilhaud]] entitled "Combat de Nègres dans un tunnel" (''Negroes fight in a tunnel''). In the subsequent exhibitions of the Incoherent arts (also in the 1880s) the writer [[Alphonse Allais]] proposed seven other monochrome paintings, such as "Première communion de jeunes filles chlorotiques par un temps de neige" (''First communion of anaemic young girls in the snow'', white), or "Récolte de la tomate par des cardinaux  apoplectiques au bord de la Mer Rouge" (''Tomato harvesting by apoplectic cardinals on the shore of the Red Sea'', red).  However, this kind of activity bears more similarity to 20th century [[Dada]], or [[Neo-Dada]], and particularly the works of the [[Fluxus]] group of the 1960s, than to 20th century monochrome painting since Malevich.

In a broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12]&lt;/ref&gt; Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161-172]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide range of possibilities (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging to so many artists, critics, and writers. Although the monochrome has never become dominant and few artists have committed themselves exclusively to it, it has never gone away. It reappears as though a spectre haunting [[high modernism]], or as a symbol of it, appearing during times of [[aesthetic]] and sociopolitical upheavals.&lt;ref&gt;''The Primary Colors for the Second Time: A Paradigm Repetition of the Neo-Avant-Garde,'' [[Benjamin H.

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 essay  "Last Exit: Painting" [[Artforum]], October: 40-47, minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's &lt;ref name="sharecom"&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960]&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson minimalism was the result, even though the term "minimalism" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this incorrect interpretation of what he said; Greenberg wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me—or anyone at all—arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.''&lt;ref name="sharecom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:UntitledGoldBox1964.jpg|thumb|left|[[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], ''Untitled'' (1964), bismuth, chromium, gold, and rhodium on gold-plated brass; [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]]]]
In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, Minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], an influential theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, "Notes on Sculpture 1-3", originally published across three issues of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] - "parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation." Morris later described an art represented by a "marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals..." in "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in ''[[Artforum]]'', 1969, continuing to say that "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transitions into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.
One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter, [[Frank Stella]], whose early "pinstripe" paintings were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's pinstripe paintings were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used for stretchers, visible as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side, used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. The decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a "given" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripe]]s. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Although Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, artists including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in ''Arts Yearbook 8'', 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman Brooklynrail.org]&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticised by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In "Art and Objecthood" (published in ''[[Artforum]]'' in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of ''[[Artforum]]''. Smithson stated the following: "What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing--namely being himself theatrical."

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

"The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."&lt;ref&gt;''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-520-07670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm interview with Dorothy Strickler] (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words,

"When I brought [[Hans Hofmann|Hofmann]] up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann's reaction was — one of the questions he asked Jackson was, ''do you work from nature?'' There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson's answer was, ''I am nature.'' And Hofmann's reply was, ''Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself.'' To which Jackson did not reply at all." The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;

'''''Mythologies''''' is a 1957 book by [[Roland Barthes]]. It is a collection of essays taken from ''Les Lettres nouvelles'', examining the tendency of contemporary social value systems to create modern [[mythology|myth]]s. Barthes also looks at the [[semiology]] of the process of myth creation, updating [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s system of [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] analysis by adding a second level where signs are elevated to the level of myth.

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
''Mythologies'' is split into two: Mythologies and Myth Today, the first section consisting of a collection of essays on selected modern myths and the second further and general analysis of the concept.

==Mythologies==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
The first section of ''Mythologies'' describes a selection of modern cultural phenomena, chosen for their status as modern myths and for the added meaning that has been conferred upon them. Each short chapter analyses one such myth, ranging from ''Einstein's Brain'' to ''Soap Powders and Detergents''. They were originally written as a series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine ''Les Lettres Nouvelles''.

In a typical example, Barthes describes the image that has been built up around red wine and how it has been adopted as a French national drink, how it is seen as a social equaliser and the drink of the [[proletariat]], partly because it is seen as blood-like (as in [[Holy Communion]]) and points out that very little attention is paid to red wine's [[Wine#Health effects|harmful effects to health]], but that it is instead viewed as life-giving and refreshing — 'in cold weather, it is associated with all the myths of becoming warm, and at the height of summer, with all the images of shade, with all things cool and sparkling.'&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

In another chapter, Barthes explores the myth of [[professional wrestling]]. He describes how, unlike in the sport of [[boxing]], the aim of theatrical stunt fighting is not to discover who will win or 'a demonstration of excellence',&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt; it is a staged [[spectacle]] acting out society's basic concepts of good and evil, of 'Suffering, Defeat and Justice'.&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The actors pretending to be wrestlers, like characters in a [[pantomime]], portray grossly-exaggerated stereotypes of human weakness: the traitor, the conceited, the 'effeminate teddy-boy'. The audience expects to watch them suffer and be punished for their own transgressions of wrestling's rules in a theatrical version of society's ideology of [[justice]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In an interview Barthes once mentioned working on an essay on [[hidden track]]s in recorded music. This essay, however, has never been published.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Myth today==
In the second half of the book Barthes addresses the question of "What is a myth, today?" with the analysis of ideas such as: [[myth]] as a type of speech, and myth on the wings of politics.

[[File:Paris Match - child soldier cover.jpg|thumb|left|The front cover of the ''[[Paris Match]]'' magazine that Barthes analyzes]]
Following on from the first section, Barthes justifies and explains his choices and analysis. He calls upon  the concepts of [[semiology]] developed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who described the connections between an object (the [[Sign (linguistics)|signified]]) and its linguistic representation (such as a word, the signifier) and how the two are connected.&lt;ref name="Sanders2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Sanders|title=The Cambridge Companion to Saussure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRy-xWG1MvIC&amp;pg=PA162|date=2 December 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80486-8|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with this structure Barthes continues to show his idea of a myth as a further sign, with its roots in language, but to which something has been added. So with a [[word]] (or other linguistic unit) the meaning (apprehended content) and the sound come together to make a sign. To make a myth, the sign itself is used as a ''signifier'', and a new meaning is added, which is the ''signified''. But according to Barthes, this is ''not'' added arbitrarily.&lt;ref name="Adams2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurie Schneider Adams|title=The Methodologies of Art: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnhQDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT172|date=9 March 2018|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-429-97407-6|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although we are not necessarily aware of it, modern myths are created with a reason. As in the example of the red wine, mythologies are formed to perpetuate an idea of society that adheres to the current ideologies of the [[ruling class]] and its [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref name="WagonerWagoner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Associate Professor of Psychology Brady Wagoner|author2=Brady Wagoner|title=Symbolic Transformation: The Mind in Movement Through Culture and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWeMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|date=4 December 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-15090-7|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barthes demonstrates this theory with the example of a front cover from ''[[Paris Match]]'' edition no. 326, of July 1955,&lt;ref name="EvansHall1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jessica Evans|author2=Stuart Hall|title=Visual Culture: The Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l209XFHIzrIC&amp;pg=PA55|date=6 July 1999|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-6248-9|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing a young black soldier in French uniform [[Salute|saluting]]. The ''signifier'': a saluting soldier, cannot offer us further factual information of the young man's life. But it has been chosen by the magazine to symbolise more than the young man; the picture, in combination with the ''signifieds'' of Frenchness, militariness, and relative ethnic difference, gives us a message about France and its citizens. The picture does not explicitly demonstrate 'that France is a great empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under her flag,' etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p.116&lt;/ref&gt; but the combination of the signifier and signified perpetuates the myth of imperial devotion, success and thus; a property of 'significance' for the picture.

{{Cquote|I am at the barber’s, and copy of Paris-Match is offered to me. On the cover, a young Negro in a French uniform is saluting, with his eyes uplifted, probably fixed on a fold of the tricolour. All this is the meaning  of the picture. But whether naively or not, I see very well what it signifies to me: that France is a great Empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under the flag, and that there is no better answer to the detractors of an alleged colonialism than the zeal shown by this Negro in serving his so-called oppressors ...&lt;ref name="Rosello2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mireille Rosello|title=The Reparative in Narratives: Works of Mourning in Progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Avc88FBCJVMC&amp;pg=PT61|year=2010|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-1-84631-220-5|pages=61–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Myth and power ===
Exploring the concept of myth, Barthes seeks to grasp the relations between language and power. He assumes that myth helps to naturalize particular worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barthes, myth is based on humans’ history, and myth cannot naturally occur. There are always some communicative intentions in myth. Created by people, myth can easily be changed or destroyed. Also, myth depends on the context where it exists. By changing the context, one can change the effects of myth. At the same time, myth itself participates in the creation of an [[ideology]]. According to Barthes, myth doesn’t seek to show or to hide the truth when creating an ideology, it seeks to deviate from the reality. The major function of myth is to naturalize a concept, a belief. Myth purifies signs and fills them with a new meaning which is relevant to the communicative intentions of those who are creating the myth. In the new sign, there are no contradictions that could raise any doubts regarding the myth. Myth is not deep enough to have these contradictions; it simplifies the world by making people believe that signs have inherent meaning. Myth “abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of essences…”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Mythologies
| last = Barthes
| first = 
| publisher = 
| year = 
| isbn = 
| location = 
| pages = 143
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Why do people believe in myth? The power of myth is in its impressive character. It seeks to surprise the audience. This impression is way more powerful than any rational explanations which can disprove the myth. So, myth works not because it hides its intentions, but because the intentions of myth have been naturalized. Through the usage of myths, one can naturalize “the Empire, [the] taste for [[Basque culture|Basque]] things, the Government.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Mythologies
| last = Barthes
| first = 
| publisher = 
| year = 
| isbn = 
| location = 
| pages = 131
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of myth and power, Barthes asserts that myth is a depoliticized speech. He uses the term {{anchor|exnomination}}'''ex-nomination''' (or '''exnomination'''), by which he "means 'outside of naming'. Barthes' point was that dominant groups or ideas in society become so obvious or common sense that they don't have to draw attention to themselves by giving themselves a name. They're just the 'normality', against which everything else can be judged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McKee | first = Alan | chapter = How do I know what's a likely interpretation? | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H2Rn0Wpq5uQC&amp;pg=PA106 | title = Textual analysis: a beginner's guide | page = 106 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780761949930 }} ''See also'': {{cite journal | last = Wasson | first = Richard | title = Myth and the ex-nomination of class in ''The Time Machine'' | journal = [[The Minnesota Review]] | volume = 15 | pages = 112&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | date = Fall 1980 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/article/427124 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example he says, "[the bourgeoisie] makes its status undergo a real ''ex-nominating operation'': the bourgeoisie is defined as ''the social class which does not want to be named''" (italics in original).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lakoff | first = Robin Tolmach | author-link = Robin Lakoff | chapter = The neutrality of the status quo | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xmr3ZBHFbVwC&amp;pg=PA53 | title = The language war | page = 53 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780520928077 }}{{Cite book| title = Mythologies| last = Barthes| first = Roland | page = 138| publisher = Cape| year = 1972| location = London | oclc = 222874772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myth removes our understanding of concepts and beliefs as created by humans. Instead, myth presents them as something natural and innocent. Drawing upon [[Karl Marx]], Barthes states that even the most natural objects include some aspect of politics. Depending on how strong the political side of myth is, Barthes defines the strong and the weak myths (''des mythes forts et des mythes faibles'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Mythologies| last = Barthes| first = Roland| publisher = Éditions du Seuil| year = 1957| isbn = | location = Paris| pages = 218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depoliticization of the strong myths happens abruptly, as the strong myths are explicitly political. The weak myths are the myths which have already lost their political character. However, this character can be brought back by “the slightest thing”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Mythologies | last = Barthes | pages = 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:The model of semiosis.png|thumb|348x348px|The model of semiosis suggested by Barthes.]]

Barthes also provides a list of rhetorical figures in [[bourgeoisie]] myths:
* The inoculation. The government admits the harm brought by one of the institutes. Focusing on one institute, myth hides the inconsistency of the system.&lt;ref name="Sandoval2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chela Sandoval|title=Methodology of the Oppressed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZ-uoDNV7IcC&amp;pg=PT137|year=2000|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-2736-3|pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The privation of History. A history standing behind a myth gets removed. People don’t wonder where the myth comes from; they simply believe it.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Identification. The ideology of bourgeoisie seeks for sameness. It denies all the concepts that don’t fit into the system. The bourgeoisie either ignores subjects that differ from them, or they put the efforts to make this subject the same as the bourgeoisie.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Tautology. The myths of the bourgeoisie define the concepts through the same concepts (Barthes provides an example of theatre, “Drama is drama”)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Mythologies| last = Barthes | pages = 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Neither-Norism (''le ninisme)''. Two concepts are defined by each other, and both of the concepts are considered inconsistent.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* The quantification of quality. Myth measures reality by numbers, not by quality. This way, myth simplifies reality.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* The statement of fact. Myth doesn’t explain the reality. Myth asserts a certain picture of the world without explanation just like a [[proverb]] does.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The model of [[semiosis]] suggested by Barthes seeks to link signs with the social myths or ideologies that they articulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/ | title = International Encyclopedia of Communication | website = International Encyclopedia of Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythologisation and cultural studies==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
In writing about the mythologisation process, Barthes refers to the tendency of [[social constructionism|socially constructed]] notions, narratives, and assumptions to become "naturalised" in the process, that is, taken unquestioningly as given within a particular culture. Barthes finishes ''Mythologies'' by looking at how and why myths are built up by the bourgeoisie in its various manifestations. He returns to this theme in later works including ''The Fashion System''.

Other early Necrorealists included [[Igor Bezrukov]], [[Yevgeniy Kondratiev]], and [[Konstantin Mitenev]]. Their film-making efforts in the 1980s outside of the official Soviet [[State Committee for Cinematography|Goskino State Cinema]] system became known as [[Parallel Cinema (Russia)|Parallel Cinema]]. Necrorealist works often explore the themes of [[death]], [[decomposition|decay]], and the transformation of the body.

The '''PAIN Exhibit''' "is an educational, visual arts exhibit from artists with chronic pain with their art expressing some facet of the pain experience. The mission of the PAIN Exhibit is to educate health care providers and the public about chronic pain through art," and to give a voice to those who have [[chronic pain]].&lt;ref name="PE_Mission"&gt;http://www.painexhibit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[undertreatment of pain]] is a [[public health]] issue&lt;ref name="undertreatment"&gt;http://www.painpolicy.wisc.edu/Achieving_Balance/EG2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated 75 million [[Americans]] suffering from chronic nonmalignant pain.&lt;ref name="75mAmericans"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0885-3924(01)00320-7 |vauthors=Adams NJ, Plane MB, Fleming MF, Mundt MP, Saunders LA, Stauffacher EA |title=Opioids and the treatment of chronic pain in a primary care sample |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=791–6 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11532592 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0885-3924(01)00320-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAIN Exhibit was started in 2001 by Mark Collen, and the PainExhibit.com website was created by James Gregory. The site was launched {{#dateformat:March 8, 2004}} and is available in both English and Spanish languages. PainExhibit.com currently contains 92 art images which are divided amongst nine themes.[http://painexhibit.com/galleryindex.html]

A '''pard''' is a legendary animal that is listed in Medieval [[bestiary|bestiaries]]. They were felines with spotted coats and were extremely fast (reminiscent of a [[cheetah]]). They were believed to mate with [[lion]]s to produce [[leopard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast116.htm|title=Pard|accessdate=2008-12-28|work=The Medieval Bestiary}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were believed to have white or pale spots.

The English noun ''pard'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''parde'', from [[Old French]] via [[Latin]] ''pardus'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πάρδος}} ''párdos'' ("male panther"). The word ''pard'' is probably of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] origin; akin to [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] ''purdhank''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pard ''The Free Dictionary'' - Pard]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Persian language|Persian]] پلنگ ''Palang''.

Designed by Percy Thomas Partnership.&lt;br /&gt;Built 2002–4.]]'''Percy Thomas Partnership''' was the trading name of the award-winning British [[architectural]] practice established some time between 1965 and 1973 as the successor to a series of earlier partnerships originally set up by [[Percy Thomas]] (1883–1969) in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] in 1911/12. Percy Thomas and the Percy Thomas Partnership put their name to a number of landmark buildings in the United Kingdom including the [[Wales Millennium Centre]], Cardiff. It opened offices overseas and completed a number of prestigious buildings in Hong Kong. 

Percy Thomas Partnership came to an end in 2004 when they went into [[Administration (law)|administration]] and were bought by [[Capita Group]].

==History==
[[File:Bute Building Cardiff.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Bute Building, Cardiff (previously the Cardiff Technical College) designed by Percy Thomas and Ivor Davies. Built 1913–16.]]
[[File:Clifton, Catholic cathedral church of Ss. Peter and Paul - geograph.org.uk - 854098.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Clifton Cathedral, Bristol. Designed by Percy Thomas Partnership. Built 1970–73.]]
[[Percy Thomas|Percy Edward Thomas]] was born in the [[North East England|northeast of England]] in 1883, but was well-travelled and started work as at a young age in Cardiff, Wales.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog"&gt;National Library of Wales ''Dictionary of Welsh Biography'' [http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-THOM-EDW-1883.html?query=percy+thomas&amp;field=content THOMAS, Sir PERCY EDWARD (1883–1969)] retrieved 2011-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; He was articled to study architecture, and won the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] architecture competition in 1903.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt; He returned to England to work, but began collaborating with Ivor Jones of Cardiff, in architectural competitions. In 1911 they won the competition to design Cardiff's new Technical College (now known as the [[Bute Building]]), and Thomas returned to Cardiff to work in partnership with Jones.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt;
  
Percy Thomas's architectural practice was set up in 1911/12.&lt;ref&gt;Capita website (Media) [http://www.capita.co.uk/media/Pages/Capita_Symonds_acquires_Percy_Thomas_Architects.aspx Capita Symonds acquires Percy Thomas Architects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406021654/http://www.capita.co.uk/media/Pages/Capita_Symonds_acquires_Percy_Thomas_Architects.aspx |date=2012-04-06 }}, Press release issued 16 June 2004 (retrieved 2011-10-14)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HK History"&gt;PTP Architects (HK) website, [http://www.ptp-architects.com.hk/history/index.html HISTORY] (retrieved 2011-10-26).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s the practice won a large number of commissions to design important civic buildings in Wales and England, including county offices for [[Glamorgan]] and [[Carmarthenshire]], Lord Davies' [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff|Temple of Peace]], [[Guildhall, Swansea|Swansea Civic Centre]], [[Aberystwyth University]] campus and a redesign of London's [[Euston Station]].&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt; 

The partnership with Ivor Jones was amicably dissolved in 1937.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt;  

In 1946 Percy Thomas was knighted. In the same year Percy Thomas's son Norman joined the practice&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt; – which became known as Sir Percy Thomas &amp; Son.

In 1952 William Marsden and Wallace Sweet joined the practice.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt; John Francis Vergette joined (in [[Swansea]]) in 1955.&lt;ref name="JFV obit"&gt;RIBAJournal.com [http://www.ribajournal.com/index.php/feature/article/obituary_april_2010/ Obituary: John Francis Vergette FRIBA 1930–2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330165300/http://www.ribajournal.com/index.php/feature/article/obituary_april_2010/ |date=2012-03-30 }} (retrieved 2011-10-18)&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy Thomas became seriously ill in 1962, retiring from the company in 1963.&lt;ref name="NLW Biog" /&gt;

In 1965 Sir Percy Thomas &amp; Son were commissioned to design a new Roman Catholic cathedral, [[Clifton Cathedral]], for the city of [[Bristol]]. The architect was Ronald Weeks A.R.I.B.A. Dipl Arch.&lt;ref name="Cathedral DandC"&gt;Clifton Cathedral website [http://www.cliftoncathedral.org.uk/about/guide2.html THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF Ss. PETER AND PAUL, CLIFTON] (viewed 2011-10-14)&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Thomas died in 1969.  [[Clifton Cathedral]] was consecrated in 1973, by which time the architectural practice was known as Percy Thomas Partnership.&lt;ref name="Cathedral DandC" /&gt;

John Vergette became Chairman and Chief Executive of Percy Thomas Partnership. He founded the [[Royal Society of Architects in Wales]] (RSAW) and was president 1971–73.&lt;ref name="JFV obit" /&gt;

PRP eventually had six offices in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="HK History" /&gt; as well as offices in Malaysia, Hong Kong and elsewhere.

One of Percy Thomas Partnership's last works was the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] in Cardiff (2004). It was designed by [[Jonathan Adams (architect)|Jonathan Adams]], who had joined the practice in 1998. The award selectors for the [[Gold Medal (National Eisteddfod of Wales)|Wales National Eisteddfod Gold Medal]] for Architecture 2005 described the building as "a special place which will provide a focal point for the unique culture, identity and talents of Wales... The large mass of the building has been successfully formed into an impressive edifice as opposed to an oppressive monolith...

==Administration and buy-out==
In June 2004 Percy Thomas Partnership went into [[Administration (law)|administration]] after cancellation of a large [[Private finance initiative|PFI]] project for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and delays of a number of other key projects. At the time, they had a turnover of £6 million, with 100 staff.&lt;ref name="BD June 2004"&gt;Gates, C. ''PFI fells Welsh giant'' Building Design, Issue 1630, June 18, 2004, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was bought by the large British outsourcing company, [[Capita Group|Capita]], who created a new arm of their property consultancy division called Capita Percy Thomas. The staff and several senior directors were transferred to Capita.&lt;ref name="BD June 2004" /&gt;

In 2007 the name 'Percy Thomas' came to an end in the UK when Capita consolidated the architecture divisions within [[Capita Symonds]] into a new brand called 'Capita Architecture'.&lt;ref&gt;Capita Symonds website [http://www.capitasymonds.co.uk/about_us/an_overview/our_history.aspx Our history] (viewed 2011-10-14)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rabbit-skin glue''' is a [[sizing]] that also acts as an [[adhesive]]. It is essentially refined rabbit [[collagen]], and was originally used as an ingredient in traditional [[gesso]].

==History==
In traditional oil painting as practiced by the [[Renaissance]] painter, skin glue was used to coat the canvas. This is necessary because the [[linseed oil]] that forms the base of most oil paint contains [[α-Linolenic acid|linolenic acid]] that will destroy the canvas fibers over time. Though this did help to seal the canvas, they still had to cover it with another layer of a substance similar to paint in order to protect it. The primary purpose of Rabbit-skin glue is to stretch the canvas.

==Production==
Rabbit skin glue is an animal glue created by [[Animal_glue|prolonged boiling of animal connective tissue]]. Rabbit skin glue can be bought in powder form or in larger chunks. Preparation involves using the correct proportion of water to glue to achieve the correct consistency and strength. It should be heated to just short of the boiling point. Too much heat results in a product with reduced adhesive qualities. Manufacturers of rabbit, and cow &amp; horse hide glue recommend dissolving at {{convert|140|-|145|F|order=flip}}.

==Uses==

===Adhesive===
As an adhesive, Rabbit-skin glue is used in the production of the [[bellows]] of [[concertina]]s, and in other smaller, light instruments—prominently in [[violins]].  Its supreme advantages are very fast bonding; and easy debonding with hot water if an instrument must be disassembled for internal repairs.  It also has very low creep, which is the tendency of some glues to plastically yield under even low but consistent stresses over time. For example, guitar bridges are subject to high lateral stresses that with the wrong glue can lead it to creep forward.

The proteins of the glue soak into the wood and interlace with its pores. Setting of the glue occurs with cooling and drying, so the working time is very short, on the order of minutes, to stick the parts together and get full strength, unlike [[Polyvinyl acetate|PVA]] glue which might provide 20–30 minutes.
Furthermore, since the glue only works by microscopically stitching the wood fibers together, any gaps in the joint are not going to be successfully filled, and so the mating surface must be very smooth.

===Sizing===
When used in painting as a sizing, it is spread thoroughly over a canvas that has been placed on the stretcher. When the glue dries, it tightens the canvas. After this has been allowed to dry, an oil-based [[Primer (paint)|primer]] is then applied. A [[canvas]] sized with rabbit-skin glue can be made tighter than with other alternatives&amp;mdash;such as an [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]]-based gesso&amp;mdash;because of the shrinkage. This type of canvas is also valuable because it can be sanded to a flatter texture, which allows the painter to achieve a finer level of detail than can be achieved with a typical acrylic gesso ground.

This rabbit-skin glue ground is only appropriate for use under oil paint. Acrylic-based media will flake off a canvas prepared with rabbit-skin glue and are therefore not appropriate.&lt;ref name="Gottsegen_Painters_Handbook" &gt;{{cite book
  |author=Gottsegen, Mark D.
  |title=The Painter's Handbook
  |year=1993
  |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications
  |location=New York
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbit skin glue is considered to be a major cause of cracking in oil paintings by most modern conservators.  Because the glue is [[hygroscopic]], it continually absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, causing the glue to swell and shrink as ambient humidity levels change.  Over many humidity cycles, this repeated flexing causes the brittle oil paint to crack.  Modern substitutes for rabbit skin glue are available, such as Gamblin’s PVA size &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title       = Gamblin Artists Colors
 |url         = http://gamblincolors.com/sizes.grounds/index.html
 |deadurl     = yes
 |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025051925/http://www.gamblincolors.com/sizes.grounds/index.html
 |archivedate = 2007-10-25
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Golden Acrylics’ GAC100. These substitutes do not have the hygroscopic properties of rabbit skin glue, while still being very slightly hygroscopic, and should not cause the damage to oil paints that rabbit skin glue does.  However, these modern replacements do not stiffen and tighten the canvas as well as rabbit skin glue does, so some artists still prefer to use rabbit skin glue.

A '''retablo''' in [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[folk art]] (also '''lámina''') is a devotional painting, especially a small popular or [[folk art]] one using [[iconography]] derived from traditional Catholic church art. More generally ''retablo'' is also the Spanish term for a [[retable]] or [[reredos]] above an [[altar]], whether a large [[altarpiece]] painting or an elaborate wooden structure with sculptures.  Typically this includes painting, sculpture or a combination of the two, and an elaborate framework enclosing it. The Latin etymology of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word means "board behind".&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?LEMA=retablo&amp;TIPO_HTML=2&amp;FORMATO=ampliado Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from being found behind the altar, "similar ornamental structures are built and carved over facades and doorways" (Fernandez 23), called [[overdoor]]s. 

Small retablos are devotional or [[votive]] paintings, often on rectangular sheets of tin that illustrate holy images such as [[Christ]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mother]], or one of the hundreds of saints. Many are [[ex-voto]]s ("from a vow") that depict the story that led to their commission, usually dangerous or threatening events that actually occurred, and which the person survived, thanks to the [[intercession]] of a sacred person - God, Mary or a saint. They are made as a way of thanking the sacred person for protection in precarious situations, such as surviving an illness or earthquake. This class of ex-votos often shows the protected humans in the dangerous situation, and the sacred person who protected them, usually with an inscribed explanation of the events, with the date and location.  Both devotional and especially ex-voto retablos may be deposited at a [[shrine]] as a [[votive offering]], or alternatively kept at home. 

Reredos of the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance in Spain grew extremely large and elaborate, typically using carved and [[gilding|gilded]] wood, and rising as high as 40 feet or more.  The tradition of making them was taken to the new [[Spanish Empire]] in America.  There, by the late 18th century at least, the word became used for much smaller popular religious paintings, both conventional [[andachtsbilder|devotional images]] and [[ex-voto]]s (paintings giving thanks for protection through a specific episode). These were typically made to express gratitude towards the Virgin Mary for saving a person or a loved one from a nearly fatal event.

== The small paintings ==
The popular labeling of ex-votos as "Retablos" can be traced back to the late 18th century. In 1950, Mexican artist [[Roberto Montenegro]] published a history of Mexican altarpieces, which included a votive painting dated 1781, that contained an inscription which offers thanks to [[Our Lady of Sorrows|Nuestra Señora de Dolores]] de [[Xaltocan]] for renewing the people's health after a severe illness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJHQ2RKEPtcC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=%20PA5|title=Miracles on the Border: Retablos of Mexican Migrants to the United States|last=Durand|first=Jorge|date=1995|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=9780816514977|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the bottom of the votive painting left, is inscribed a message that read "en cuia memoria dedica a su Magestad este Retablo" (in whose memory he dedicates to her Majesty this ''retablo'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The oil painted retablos generated the need for "small retablo factories" to be established in order to "reproduce the same images" which were then "sold to devout believers who displayed them in home altars to honor their patron Saints."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicanretablos.com/mexican_retablos_history.php Retablo history]&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only were the retablos purchased by those wanting to show devotion to their patron saints, they were also given when the saints were there for their devotees in hard times.  When people wished to express gratitude, they could give retablos that described "the miraculous deed of a saint to whom the petitioner turned to in a time of need" (Correa 113).  People call upon these saints for aid with rain, harvests or other outcomes.  For example, if a farmer needs rain for his crops he might pray for rain. After the rain comes, a retablo might be created to give thanks to San [[Isidore the Laborer|Ysidro Labrador]], the patron saint of farmers. He is "venerated for good weather, agricultural issues and prosperous crops" (Eddy, 1). That figure would most likely be kept in the farmer's house. Each time rain was needed in the future, that farmer might pray in front of that retablo (Eddy, 1).  These traditions are by no means exclusive to Latin America, but are found in all Roman Catholic countries, as well as in classical [[paganism]] and many other religions.  To judge by survivals, similar small paintings were especially common in the German-speaking Catholic areas of Europe in the [[Early Modern period]].  By the 19th century, the process of [[lithography]] became very popular for devotional retablos, replacing earlier [[printmaking]] methods.

=== Form ===
[[File:Puerto Iglesia05.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Baroque]] carved wood [[reredos]], or retablo in the original Spanish sense, [[Tenerife]].]]
The way a retablo and ex-voto look is entirely up to the person designing it, so long as it contains the necessary basic elements. The most important part of the retablo is the representation of the miraculous event. That is why most artists try to use bright, vibrant colors to portray the supremacy of the event. An ex-voto is, more often than not, reduced to a smaller size. It is usually about half the size of the original&lt;!-- what "original"???? --&gt;, while still maintaining its rectangular shape. The largest size was about 280 square inches. The smallest was about 18 square inches. Some of the most common sizes include 140 square inches and 70 square inches (Durand, 9).

=== Significance ===
Retablos are important to Mexican [[folk religion]] because they are a physical representation of holy images such as Christ, the Virgin Mother, or one of the many thousands of saints. They come from the need humans have to interact on a personal level with divine spirits. Retablos are evidentiary support for communication between the divine and humans (Wroth, 2).

This tradition of retablos was also brought into New Mexico and southern Colorado by Franciscan monks. Due to the remoteness of this frontier and lack of metals, retablos were made of wood. These crude retablos were coated with a [[gesso]] made with gypsum and rabbit skin glue. Pigments also were made locally from natural materials, colored earths, plant extracts, cochineal bugs, and lamp black.

These traditional retablos and other indigenous religious art were removed by Bishop Lamy throughout New Mexico after the conquest of these territories by the US Army.  In 1924 the Spanish Colonial Arts Society was formed, and since then these unique traditions of New Mexico have been preserved.

=== Contemporary revival ===
During the 1940s, a resurgence of the art began in Peru, due in large part to the research and philanthropy of Alicia Bustamante, a member of the Peruvian [[Indigenismo|indigenista]] movement, who encouraged an artist named Joaquin Lopez Antay to save and revitalize the retablo art form.  She enlisted him "to make retablos that included themes of everyday life – harvests, markets, and fiestas.  A distinction emerged between the retablo for ritual and religious purposes and the retablo as decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Exhibit Explanation, San Diego Museum of Man, Retablos Exhibit, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Many others in the area, including [[Nicario Jimenez Quispe]], continued along the same path as Antay, creating a popular art that was displayed during annual branding ceremonies of cattle, sheep, and llamas. These retablos have achieved status as important heirlooms passed on within families that symbolize protection, fertility and healing.  They are also sold as art.

'''''Rough Waves''''' ({{Lang-ja|波濤 図 屏風}}) is a painting by the Japanese artist [[Ogata Kōrin]], on a two-panel ''[[byōbu]]'' (folding screen).  The work was created {{circa|1704|1709}}, and depicts a swirl of stormy sea waves.  It has been in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, since 1926, when it was acquired with financial support from the [[Isaac Dudley Fletcher|Fletcher Fund]].&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/44918|title=波濤図屏風 Rough Waves|work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Throughout the history of [[Japanese art]], many artists have sought to convey in their works the fleeting state of rolling sea waves. The theme has been depicted not only on ''[[emakimono]]'' (handscrolls) and silk, but also on fans, ''byōbu'' and decor items.&lt;ref name=felt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://feltmagnet.com/misc/japanese-wave-art|title=Japanese Wave Paintings|work=FeltMagnet|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Ogata's painting ''Rough Waves'' is the most important image of the unapproachable sea elements to be created in Japanese painting before [[Hokusai]]'s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;&lt;ref name=felt/&gt;  To create it, Ogata used an ancient Chinese technique of drawing with two brushes, held together in one hand.&lt;ref name=met/&gt; 

The materials Ogata used for the painting were [[Chinese ink|ink]], paint and [[gilding|gilded paper]].  He conveyed the threatening and dangerous nature of the waves with the help of elongated and contrastingly contoured, finger- or [[dragon]]-claw-like wave crests and sea foam.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;  The expressiveness of the work appears to be unusual for Ogata, with the main means of expression being the use of lines created by ink.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w.histrf.ru/articles/article/show/ogata_korin|work=Энциклопедия «Всемирная история» / The World History Encyclopedia|title=Огата Корин|trans-title=Ogata Kōrin|lang=ru|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screen on which ''Rough Waves'' was painted bears the seal “Dōsū”, a pseudonym that Ogata used from 1704. Recent studies show that Ogata created the painting between 1704 and 1709, during the transitional period in his career when he lived in the city of Edo (now Tokyo).&lt;ref name=met/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; The works of the artist during this period are characterized by a strong influence of the creativity of representatives of the [[Kanō school]].&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

The direct source of inspiration for ''Rough Waves'' may have been the work of the artist [[Sesson Shukei]] ({{Circa|1504|1589}}), whose still-extant paintings include a number of dynamic and mysterious images of sea waves, among them ''Egret, Moon, and Wave'' and ''The Wind and the Waves''.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;&lt;ref name=felt/&gt;  ''Rough Waves'' also reflects the influence of [[Tawaraya Sōtatsu]], who specialized in gloomy landscapes, but is nevertheless an independent interpretation by Ogata of the frightening and violent force of the sea.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cotter|first1=Holland|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/arts/design/rimpa-painters-at-japan-society-and-the-met.html|title=Boldest Color for Total Effect. Rimpa Painters at Japan Society and the Met|work=New York Times|date=September 27, 2012|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''Rough Waves'' impressed Ogata’s follower [[Sakai Hōitsu]], who in 1805 created his work ''Waves'', in which he tried to convey a similar frightening atmosphere and a premonition of danger. At some time in the past, Hōitsu's family had commissioned work from Ogata, and so a collection of Ogata's pictures was available for Hōitsu to study in detail.  The images in ''Waves'', created in ink on silver-plated paper, were more abstract than those in Ogata's work, but retained their demonic character.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

The '''royal arms of Scotland''' is the official [[coat of arms]] of the [[King of Scots]] first adopted in the 12th century. With the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, [[James VI]] inherited the thrones of England and Ireland and thus his arms in Scotland were now quartered with the arms of England (which was itself quartered with France) with an additional quarter for Ireland also added (the arms would continue to alter in later years). Though the kingdoms of England and Scotland would share the same monarch, the distinction in heraldry used in both kingdoms was maintained. When the kingdoms of Scotland and England were united under the [[Acts of Union 1707]] to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain, no single arms were created and instead, the royal arms as used in either Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom would continue to differ.

Poetically described as "the ruddy lion ramping in his field of tressured gold", the arms are still widely used today as a symbol of Scotland, and are [[quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] in the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal arms of Queen Elizabeth II]] along with the arms of England and Ireland.

The [[banner of arms|arms in banner form]] is still used by various officials in Scotland and is called the ''[[Royal Banner of Scotland|Royal Banner]]'', or more commonly, the '''''Lion Rampant'''''.

==Features==
The arms feature a red rampant lion with blue tongue and claws situated within a red double border decorated with [[fleurs-de-lis]] (known as the ''royal tressure''). The fleurs-de-lis in the royal tressure are traditionally said to represent the "[[auld alliance]]" with France, but this is unlikely, as this alliance did not come to exist until the late 13th century, when the royal tressure had been firmly established as part of the arms for many years. It was perhaps added merely to make the arms more distinctive, as the symbol of a rampant lion was already used by several lords and kings.

Atop the shield sits the [[helmet|helm]] and [[crest (heraldry)|crest]]. The helm is full-faced of damasked gold with six bars and features gold [[mantling]] lined with [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]]. Upon the helm sits the crest, depicting the red lion, forward facing and sitting atop the [[Crown of Scotland]], displaying the [[Honours of Scotland]]. (The lion wears the Crown of Scotland and holds both the [[Sceptre]] and the Sword of State).

Above the crest is the [[motto]] "In Defens", a contraction of "[[In My Defens God Me Defend]]" ("defens" being the [[Scots (language)|Scots]] language spelling of "defence"). Surrounding the shield is the [[Livery collar|collar]] of the [[Order of the Thistle|Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle]].

The supporters are two crowned and chained [[unicorn]]s, the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] supporting a banner of the arms, (only in this instance is the lion depicted facing away from the [[lance]], whereas when flown correctly the lion should face towards or ''respect'' the lance or, in most cases, the flag pole); the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] supporting the [[Flag of Scotland|national flag of Scotland]]. The compartment features a number of [[Onopordum acanthium|thistles]], the national flower of Scotland.  In the legend ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Hunt of the Unicorn|date=2018-09-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Hunt_of_the_Unicorn&amp;oldid=859953435|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known as ''The Unicorn Tapestries'' displayed at Stirling Castle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stirlingcastle.scot/discover/highlights/the-stirling-tapestries/|title=The Stirling Tapestries|website=www.stirlingcastle.scot|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New York Metropolitan Museum of Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/The_Unicorn_Tapestries|title=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/The_Unicorn_Tapestries|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the unicorn denotes Jesus Christ: ''Christ will be called the son of unicorns, for the unicorn is irresistible in might and unsubjected to man''. The Hunt of the Unicorn is a love story involving Christ the unicorn, mankind and a maiden. The chained unicorn represents a risen Christ, in the garden of paradise and the chains around the unicorn represent the chains of Christ's love for the maiden and mankind.

===Kingdom of Scotland===

[[File:Fl- 14v Livro do Armeiro-Mor, Rei da Escocia.jpg|thumb|left|The arms in the Portuguese ''Livro de Armerio-Mor'', c. 1509]]
A form of these arms was first used by [[William I of Scotland|King William the Lion]] in the 12th century, though no trace of them can be made out on his seal. However, a lion rampant can clearly be made out on the seal of his son, Alexander II. Over the years many writers have claimed them to be much older; even [[Alexander Nisbet]], considered to be one of the more reliable Scottish heralds, claims that a lion was first adopted as a personal symbol by the legendary [[Fergus I (mythological king)|Fergus]], with the royal tressure being added in the reign of [[Legendary kings of Scotland|Achaius]]. This is clearly untrue as, even if Fergus and Achaius had existed, they predate the existence of heraldry by several centuries.

Throughout the ages the arms passed from monarch to succeeding monarch with only slight variations in detail. In some early examples the lion holds a sword or wears a crown, and the royal tressure has sometimes been interpreted as an ''[[orle (heraldry)|orle]]'' or ''[[bordure]]''. Many of these relatively minor variations will have resulted from the individual efforts of stonemasons, weavers, artists and sculptors throughout the ages in their attempts to create a facsimile of the arms of the period, as well as mistakes and misinterpretations on the part of foreign heraldic artists.

In the reign of [[James III of Scotland|James III]], the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] made a curious attempt to get rid of the royal tressure, passing an act stating that "the King, with the advice of the three Estates ordained that in time to come there should be no double tressure about his arms, but that he should bear whole arms of the lion without any more". This state of affairs does not appear to have lasted very long, with James III soon re-instating the royal tressure, first without its top, and then in its original form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John McWilliam|title=The Royal Arms of Scotland|publisher=The Heraldry Society|url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/scotland/royal_arms_of_scotland.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the creation of the [[Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland]] in 1672 Charles II registered the blazon of the achievement of the King of Scots as:

"Or, a Lyon rampant gules armed and langued azure within a double tressur flowered and counter-flowered with flowers de lis of the second, Encircled with the order of Scotland the same being composed of Rue and thistles having the Image of St. Andrew with his crosse on his brest y unto pendent. Above the shield ane Helment answerable to his Majesties high qualitie and jurisdiction with a mantle or doubled ermine adorned with ane Imperiall Crowne beautified with crosses pattee and flowers de lis surmounted on the top for his Majesties Crest of a Lyon sejant full faced gules crowned or holding in his dexter paw a naked sword proper and in the sinister a Scepter both erected paleways supported be two Unicornes Argent crowned with Imperiall and goarged with open Crownes, to the last chains affixed passing betwixt their fore leggs and reflexed over their backs or, he on the dexter imbracing and bearing up a banner of cloath of gold charged with the Royall Armes of Scotland and he on the sinister another Banner azure charged with a St Andrews Crosse argent, both standing on ane compartment placed underneath from which issue thistles one towards each side of the escutcheon, and for his Majisties Royall Motto's in ane escroll over all In defence, and under on the table of the compartment Nemo me impune Lacessit."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924029798927 Fox-Davies, Charles, ''The Book of Public Arms'' (1915), p712]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom of France===
When [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] married [[Francis II of France|Francis, Dauphin of France]], in 1558, Mary's Royal arms of Scotland were impaled with those of the Dauphin, whose arms were themselves quartered with those of Scotland to indicate his status as [[List of Scottish consorts|King consort of Scotland]]. When Francis ascended to the throne of the [[Kingdom of France]] in 1559 as King Francis II, the arms were again altered to indicate his status as [[King of France]], with those of Mary also being altered to reflect her elevated status as [[Queen consort]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.predecimal.com/p12scottish.htm Coinage of Great Britain.

Part 12, Scottish Coins.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609000000/http://www.predecimal.com/p12scottish.htm |date=9 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottishmoney.net/coins/mary.html Scottish Coins ~ Mary (1542–1567)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Francis in 1560, Mary continued to use the arms showing Scotland and France impaled, (with a minor alteration of the arms to reflect her change of status from queen-consort to [[Queen dowager]]), until her marriage to [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Henry, Lord Darnley]], in 1565. (Such symbolism was not lost upon [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I of England]], given that the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchy]] had for centuries held a historical claim to the throne of France, symbolised by the arms of France having been quartered with those of England since 1340). Following the marriage to Darnley, the arms of Scotland reverted to the blazon which had preceded the marriage to Francis.

On the death of Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1603, [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]], inherited the thrones of England and Ireland. The arms of England were quartered with those of Scotland, and a quarter for Ireland was also added. At this time the King of England also laid [[English claims to the French throne|claim to the French throne]], therefore the arms of the Kingdom of England were themselves already quartered with those of the [[Kingdom of France]]. James used a different version of his royal arms in Scotland and this distinction in royal protocol continued post the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] of 1707. (Today, the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom used in Scotland continue to differ from those used elsewhere).

During the reign of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], the royal arms used in Scotland were augmented with the inclusion of the [[Latin]] motto of the [[Order of the Thistle]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5szc9GBZLwwC&amp;pg=RA3-PA462&amp;lpg=RA3-PA462&amp;dq=%22in+my+defence+god+me+defend%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=b9wOnHA6rd&amp;sig=8EA-dKRp2-pytq2aYngJD7E2xpM&amp;hl=en Public Sculpture of Glasgow by Ray McKenzie, Gary Nisbet]&lt;/ref&gt; the highest [[Chivalric order]] of the Kingdom of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page3588.asp British Monarchy web site]&lt;/ref&gt; The motto of the Order of the Thistle, ''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]'', appears on a blue [[scroll]] overlying the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrimgeour.co.uk/clan/scrim/scriminfo/heraldry/scrimheraldry.htm Heraldry – The Arms of the Earl of Dundee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827193300/http://www.scrimgeour.co.uk/clan/scrim/scriminfo/heraldry/scrimheraldry.htm |date=27 August 2008 }} (taken from a book "Scottish Heraldry" by MD Dennis, published in 1999 by the Heraldic Society of Scotland: {{ISBN|0-9525258-2-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; (Previously, only the [[Livery collar|collar]] of the Order of the Thistle had appeared on the arms).

The addition by King Charles of ''Nemo me impune lacessit'' ensured that the [[blazon]] of his Royal arms used in Scotland complemented that of his Royal arms used elsewhere, in that two mottoes were displayed. The blazon used elsewhere had included the French motto of the arms, ''[[Dieu et mon droit]]'', together with the [[Old French]] motto of the [[Order of the Garter]], the highest Chivalric order of the [[Kingdom of England]]. The motto of the Order of the Garter, ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'', appears on a representation of the [[Garter (stockings)|garter]] surrounding the [[Shield (heraldry)|shield]]. Henceforth, the versions of the Royal arms used in Scotland and elsewhere were to include both the motto of the arms of the respective kingdom ''and'' the motto of the associated order of chivalry.

From the accession of the [[Stuart dynasty]] to the throne of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1603, the Royal Arms have featured the [[harp]], or [[Cláirseach]], of Ireland in the third quadrant, the style of the harp itself having been altered several times since. The position of King of Ireland ceased with the passage by the [[Oireachtas]] of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], when the office of [[President of Ireland]] (which had been created in late 1937) replaced that of the King of Ireland for ''[[external affairs|external]]'' as well as ''[[home affairs|internal]]'' affairs. The Act declared that the Irish state could be described as a republic, following which the newly created [[Republic of Ireland]] left the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. However, the modern versions of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland used both in Scotland and elsewhere, and also the [[arms of Canada]], continue to feature an Irish harp to represent [[Northern Ireland]].

===Changes to the blazon of the arms===
* Following the marriage of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], in 1558, the [[blazon]] of the royal arms of Scotland included elements from the arms of:

:The Electorate of Hanover, (1801–1814)
:The [[Kingdom of Hanover]], (1814–1837)
* Following the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1837, the modern [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal arms of the United Kingdom]] were adopted.

==As a banner==
{{main|Royal Standard of Scotland|Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Royal Standard of Scotland.svg|thumb|[[Royal Standard of Scotland|Royal Banner of Scotland]]]]

Since the formation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the Scottish arms are now generally used in combination with the arms of England and Ireland. However, the original [[Royal Standard of Scotland|royal banner of Scotland]], also known as the "Lion Rampant", continues to be used officially in Scotland; being flown from royal residences when the Queen is not in residence and used in an official capacity by the [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]], [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] and [[Lord Lieutenant]]s in their Lieutenancies. Unofficially, the royal banner is often used as a secondary national flag, being most often seen at sporting events involving Scottish national teams. (Both the [[Scottish Football Association]] and [[Scotland national football team]] use a logo based upon the royal arms).

==Current uses==

The royal arms in their current form were adopted on the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1837. They show the Scottish arms in the first and fourth quarters of the shield, with the English arms in the second quarter and the Irish in the third. The [[Scots (language)|Scots]] motto ''In Defens'' appears as in the original arms, and the Latin motto of the Order of the Thistle, ''Nemo me impune lacessit'', also appears on a blue scroll overlying the compartment. The Scottish unicorn and English lion hold lances flying the banners of St Andrew and St George, in imitation of the two unicorns in the original arms. The unicorn is placed in the dominant position on the dexter side, and the shield is encircled by the collar of the Order of the Thistle instead of the Garter.

The arms of the [[Duke of Rothesay]] quarter the arms of the [[Great Steward of Scotland]], with the arms of the [[Lord of the Isles]]. In the centre, on an [[inescutcheon]], are the arms of the heir apparent to the King of Scots, namely the royal arms of Scotland with a three-pointed [[Label (heraldry)|label]].

The [[Royal Coat of Arms of Canada|royal arms of Canada]] correspond to the British royal arms in that they also feature the Scottish arms in the second quarter of the shield and use the unicorn as the sinister supporter. The Canadian version also mirrors the Scottish version in that each supporter not only supports the shield but also a lance displaying a flag.

Both the [[Flag of Nova Scotia|flag]] and [[Coat of Arms of Nova Scotia|arms]] of [[Nova Scotia]] feature elements of the Scottish arms. However, unlike the royal arms of Canada, those of Nova Scotia portray the unicorn as the royally crowned dexter supporter, in the Scottish style. The shield depicts an inverse representation of the flag of Scotland and features the Royal arms of Scotland on an [[inescutcheon]]. The motto ''munit haec et altera vincit'' appears above the crest in keeping with the Scottish heraldic style. (Both the flag and shield of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]] also feature the Scottish arms on an inescutcheon).

The royal tressure appears on the arms of numerous Scottish families and institutions as a mark of royal favour, known in heraldry as an [[augmentation of honour]]; prominent examples occur in the arms of the cities of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] and [[Aberdeen]]. In 2002, the Queen granted arms to the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] which featured a royal tressure with maple leaves instead of the usual fleurs-de-lis. A royal tressure with roses and thistles can be found in the arms of the [[Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Marquis of Aberdeen and Temair]].

'''''Survival of the Fattest''''' is a sculpture of a small starved boy, carrying a fat woman, the sculpture was made by [[Jens Galschiøt]], and Lars Calmar, in 2002, as a symbol of the imbalanced distribution of the world’s resources.

[[File:Survival_of_the_fattest.jpg|thumb|The sculpture in China 2005]]

== Sculpture and symbols ==
The 3.5 metre tall bronze sculpture was made in 2002 and depicts a huge fat woman from the west, sitting on the shoulders of a starved African boy. The woman is holding a pair of scales as a symbol of justice, but her eyes are closed to show that justice is degenerating into self-righteousness and unwillingness to see the obvious injustice.

The sculpture intended to send out a message to the rich part of the world, and seems to create focus on our obesity due to over consumption while people in the third world are dying of hunger. Due to the imbalanced distribution of the resources in the world, the most people in the western countries are living comfortably, they are oppressing the poor people by means of an unjust world trade. The rich countries are by means of tariff barriers and subsidies keeping the poor countries out of the markets of the West.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aidoh.dk/new-struct/About-Jens-Galschiot/CV.pdf the official CV of Jens Galschiot&lt;/ref&gt;

On the sculpture there is an inscription, which states: "I'm sitting on the back of a man. He is sinking under the burden. I would do anything to help him. Except stepping down from his back."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/2010/02/12/reading-a-sculpture|title=Reading a Sculpture|date=2010-02-12|work=Reason.com|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Exhibition at COP15 ==
In 2009 at the 15th Climate Change Conference ([[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP15]]), Jens Galschiot exhibited a series of sculptures titled [[SevenMeters]], in which ''Survival of the Fattest'' perhaps was the most poignant sculpture.

''Survival of the Fattest'' was placed in the harbour of Copenhagen, next to the internationally famous statue, ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Based on a fairy tale by the Danish fairy tale writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' is a national monument and seen by an estimated 1 million tourists a year.

By placing his sculpture in the water [http://www.google.dk/search?q=%22The+Little+Mermaid%22+%22survival+of+the+Fattest%22&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:da:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=da&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=fkYpT5XlNsfe4QTgtZC-Aw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=629&amp;sei=iUYpT5vDOsz34QTasuDZAw next to ''The Little Mermaid''], Galschiot was assured that its explosive message would receive international attention. The act also highlighted that the goals and objectives of the wealthy nations at the [[Climate Change]] Conference to be nothing more than fairy tales.&lt;ref&gt;http://art-for-a-change.com/blog/2009/12/cop15-survival-of-the-fattest.html an article from art-for-a-change.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2951">'''''A Toltec Symphony'''''  (also known as '''''Symphony No. 7 "A [[Toltec]] Symphony"''''') is a [[2005 in music|2005]] [[symphony]] by [[Philip Glass]].  The [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]] commissioned Glass to write it to commemorate the 60th birthday of [[conducting|conductor]] [[Leonard Slatkin]].  Slatkin conducted the debut concert on January 20, 2005 at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]], which Philip Glass attended. 

==Composition==
The symphony is scored for [[piccolo]], 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, [[Cor anglais|English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[E-flat clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]] 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]], [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]], [[wood block]], [[glockenspiel]], [[piano]], [[celesta]], [[harp]], [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[double bass|basses]], [[organ (music)|organ]], and [[choir|chorus]].  

At 30 minutes long, it has three [[movement (music)|movements]]:
# The Corn
# The Hikuri (the Sacred Root)
# The Blue Deer

==Inspiration==
Glass said that he wrote the symphony about [[Mesoamerica]] and the life of [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Americans]] centuries before the arrival of European explorers.  The first movement, "The Corn," focuses on the interplay between [[Mother Nature]] and those she provides for.  "The Hikuri (the Sacred Root)" is not a root (it is a cactus) that grows in the northern and central Mexican deserts and is thought to be a gateway to the [[spirituality|spiritual]] world, hikuri.  Finally, the last movement is about "the holder of the Book of Knowledge," whom every truth-seeking person must face.

Glass has integrated three transcendental concepts of ancestral culture (Huichol) : The first is the " corn " which means, desire to return to the innocence before adulthood (the connection with Mother Earth); the second, the hikuri is the sacred vision of corn and Blue Deer, and this represents the third symbolism, from this world to the hereafter can do it, because when get the blue deer, stop being ordinary, and the man will be transformed.

[[File:Ranelagh.jpg|thumb|Viscount Ranelagh at the Volunteer gathering in Brighton, 1863, depicted in the [[Illustrated London News]]]] 
[[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] '''Thomas Heron Jones, 7th Viscount Ranelagh''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCB}} (9 January 1812 – 13 November 1885) was known for his involvement in the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|volunteer movement]] to recruit amateur soldiers for the defence of Britain, and for his links to glamorous women, notably the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] model [[Annie Miller]] and the actress [[Lillie Langtry]]. 

Heron Jones succeeded to the baronetcy becoming [[Viscount Ranelagh]] and Baron Jones of Navan in 1820 on the death of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Lodge, ''The genealogy of the existing British peerage: with brief sketches of the family histories of the nobility'', Saunders and Otley, 1832, p.301&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volunteer movement==
Ranelagh was an enthusiastic supporter of the movement to create a volunteer army, which had arisen from fears of a French invasion. He created and commanded the 2nd South Middlesex Rifle Volunteers in 1859, the nucleus of which was formed from members of the Ranelagh Yacht Club. Ranelagh became a ''de facto'' leader of the Volunteer movement and was introduced as such to the French emperor [[Napoleon III]]. In 1863 Ranelagh helped to organise a show of force in Brighton at which he gave a speech defending the movement from attempts by the government to take control of it. He insisted that an independent volunteer militia was both cheaper and more effective for the country than a centrally organised force. He asserted that the English character prefers independence and distrusts "organisation", claiming that "we trust to our own pluck, that indomitable pluck that all Englishmen possess".&lt;ref&gt;LORD RANELAGH WITH THE EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH, ''Otago Witness'', 7 Feb 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; At this period Ranelagh was calling for a volunteer "people's army", an aspiration supported by a section of the press at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Frederick William Beckett, ''The amateur military tradition, 1558–1945'', Manchester University Press ND, 1991, p.181-2.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to command the Volunteers until his death in 1885.

==Relationships==
[[File:Viscount Ranelagh Vanity Fair 25 June 1870.jpg|thumb|"He has succeeded in volunteering". Ranelagh depicted in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']].]]Ranelagh started a relationship with Annie Miller when her fiancé [[William Holman Hunt]] was away in the Middle East. He was described in the letters of Hunt and his friends as a "notorious rake" because of his womanising. When Hunt learned of the relationship he broke off the engagement, leading to a meeting between Annie and Ranelagh in which he suggested that she should sue Hunt for [[breach of promise]]. In the end, she married Ranelagh's cousin.&lt;ref name = "ann"&gt;Anne Clark Armor, ''William Holman Hunt'', Constable, p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranelagh was also responsible for introducing [[Lillie Langtry]] to London high society. According to Langtry herself "he completely changed the current of my life".&lt;ref&gt;Lillie Langtry, ''The Days I Knew'', p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; She became the centre of attention at a party to which he invited her, and was asked by both [[John Everett Millais]] and [[Frank Miles]] to sit for a portrait.  

With his partner, Ranelagh had two daughters, but no sons. The titles of Viscount Ranelagh and Baron Jones of Navan became extinct upon his death in 1885.

Jones had two prominent relatives from his maternal grandmother:
* American Revolutionary War hero and former British Army officer Major General [[Richard Montgomery]]
* Colonel [[Alexander Montgomery (1720–1800)|Alexander Montgomery]], M.P. for County Donegal in 1768 and British Army officer

His sister Barbara married [[Count Johann Bernhard von Rechberg und Rothenlöwen|Count von Rechberg]] (1806-1899), Foreign Minister of Austria, 1859-1864.

The '''''Time Pyramid''''' ({{lang-de|Zeitpyramide}}) is a work of [[public art]] by Manfred Laber under construction in [[Wemding]], [[Germany]]. The [[pyramid]], begun in 1993, at the 1,200th anniversary of Wemding, will take almost another 1,166 years to complete and is scheduled to be finished in the year 3183. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the first {{Str number/trim|{{#expr:({{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1983) / 10}}}} of its scheduled 120 concrete blocks have been placed.&lt;ref name="Conception"&gt;[http://www.zeitpyramide.de/ Conception] Official ''Zeitpyramide'' website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portal-vg-wemding.de/wemding/Content?do=doSide&amp;action=content&amp;mandant=1&amp;id=36&amp;lev=3&amp;parent=3&amp;hauptmenue=0&amp;sideid=52 ''Die Stadt der Zeitpyramide''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719073112/http://www.portal-vg-wemding.de/wemding/Content?do=doSide&amp;action=content&amp;mandant=1&amp;id=36&amp;lev=3&amp;parent=3&amp;hauptmenue=0&amp;sideid=52 |date=2011-07-19 }} (The city of the time pyramid) {{de icon}} Official Wemding website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The town of Wemding dates back to the year 793 and celebrated its 1,200th anniversary in 1993. The time pyramid was conceived to mark this 1,200-year period.&lt;ref name="Conception" /&gt;

== Concept ==
[[File:Zeitpyramide.svg|thumb|300px|[[Trimetric projection]] of the design of the ''Time Pyramid (Zeitpyramide)'' in [[Wemding]], Germany.]]

The pyramid, when completed in the year 3183, is scheduled to consist of 120 stone or concrete blocks, each measuring {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Adjacent blocks are separated by gaps of half a block or {{convert|0.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. One block is scheduled to be placed every ten years, taking 1,190 years (see [[Fencepost error]]) in total.

The base layer, measuring {{convert|13.8|by|13.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, will consist of 64 blocks arranged in 8 rows and 8 columns. The second layer will consist of 36 blocks, in a 6 by 6 format. The third layer will consist of 16 blocks arranged in 4 by 4. The final, fourth layer, will consist of 4 blocks, arranged in 2 by 2. A model of the final artwork is exhibited at Wemding, at the ''Haus des Gastes''.&lt;ref name="Conception" /&gt;

The pyramid, as far as it exists today, is on a concrete pad on a rounded hilltop, the ''Robertshöhe'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/Home/Lokales/Donauwoerth/Lokalnachrichten/Artikel,-Ein-Wolf-an-der-Wiege-und-ein-Gebaeude-mit-1200-Jahren-Bauzeit-_arid,2235402_regid,5_puid,2_pageid,4496.html Ein Wolf an der Wiege und ein Gebäude mit 1200 Jahren Bauzeit] {{de icon}} ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', published: 4 September 2010, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; on the northern edge of Wemding. The first block was placed in October 1993.&lt;ref name="Conception" /&gt; The {{convert|6.5|tonne|ton|adj=on}} third and most recent block was placed at 16:14 on 29 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/donauwoerth/Denkmal-oder-Utopie-id25859776.html Denkmal oder Utopie? Der dritte Dekadenstein auf der Wemdinger Robertshöhe ist gesetzt], Helmut Bissinger&lt;/ref&gt;

The project's finance was mostly achieved through donations by local companies, which, for example, supplied the materials for the concrete slab for free. Additionally, the material of the blocks used is not fixed and may be altered in future generations depending on availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitpyramide.de/ Zeitpyramide] {{de icon}} Official ''Zeitpyramide'' website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The project is administrated by a foundation based in Wemding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitpyramide.de/ Stiftung Wemdinger Zeitpyramide] {{de icon}} Official ''Zeitpyramide'' website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timing ==
The significance of the number 12, 1,200 years and 120 stones is coincidental, with a construction date beginning in 1993 being the most practical. The reason for this is that the closest similar combinations before and after were or would have been possible only in 1633 (7 by 7, 840 years, 84 blocks) and 2443 (9 by 9, 1,650 years, 165 blocks).&lt;ref name="Conception" /&gt;

== Artist ==
The project is the brainchild of the artist Manfred Laber. The project began in June 1993. The idea of the concept is to give people a sense of what the span of 1,200 years really means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitpyramide.de/ Spatenstich für Projekt des Künstlers Manfred Laber] {{de icon}} Official ''Zeitpyramide'' website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Manfred Laber was born in Wemding in 1932 and studied painting at the ''Hochschule für Bildende Künste'' in [[Berlin]] in the 1950s. He has other artwork on permanent display on the Isla San Antonio, and in [[Alcanar]], [[Spain]], and [[Mormoiron]], [[France]]. Alcanar is also his part-time place of residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitpyramide.de/ Biographie Manfred Laber] {{de icon}} Official ''Zeitpyramide'' website, accessed: 14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''usher''' is a person who shows people where to sit, especially at a theatre or when attending a wedding. An example of an usher is a person who is friends with the groom who directs people where to sit as they enter the church for a wedding.

[[File:Princess Museum Edmonton Ushers.jpg|thumb|right|[[Princess Theatre (Edmonton)|Princess Theatre]] Ushers]]

==History==
The word comes from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:ostiarius|ostiarius]]'' ("porter", "doorman") through Norman French, and is a cognate of the French ''[[:fr:Huissier|huissier]]''. 

Ushers were servants or [[courtier]]s who showed or ushered visitors in and out of meetings in large houses or palaces.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], a variety of titles for courtiers in the [[Royal Household]] include the word ''usher''. In [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], from the early sixteenth century until at least the end of the nineteenth century, the term denoted an assistant to a schoolmaster or head-teacher; an under-master, assistant-master.&lt;ref name="OEDUsher"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/220658?rskey=WqlPa7&amp;result=1 |title=usher, n.|publisher=OED Online|accessdate=2013-07-25|format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such use, however, the term is now rare.&lt;ref name="OEDUsher" /&gt;

==Duties==
{{globalize/US|section|date=June 2016}}
[[File:The Republic exhibition - NM Prague 14.JPG|thumb|right|Cinema ticket. The usher checks the tickets in the entrance of cinemas and theaters, directing visitors to their seat and assists people who sit in the wrong place]]
Ushers assist visitors by formally showing the way in a large building or to their appropriate seats. This may coincide with a security role.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

At weddings, friends of the groom and bride may be recruited to direct guests at the ceremony, and generally be available for assistance.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

Ushers help those in attendance at entertainment and sporting events in theatres and stadiums. Duties include checking tickets, directing people to their assigned seats, distributing programmes, answering questions and assisting people in finding restrooms and refreshments.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

According to the [[United States Department of Labor]], ushers, lobby attendants and ticket takers earn an average wage of $8.41 an hour and $17,500 a year. Approximately 102,000 are employed in this line of work. Most of these workers are employed by the motion picture and video industries, secondly they work in the performing arts and sporting events venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes393031.htm |title=Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other jobs also come under the name 'Usher', such as baseball field personnel. A field usher coordinates not only the baseball diamond grounds but also the stadium itself.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

Ushers are also expected to help with security and to ensure that only people with proper authority have access to backstage areas. Ushers also monitor the crowds and can summon security when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes393031.htm |title=Careers: Ushers and Ticket Takers |accessdate=2008-02-06 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Movie theater|cinema]]s and theaters, it was common for ushers to check tickets and show people to their seats to watch the film being shown. If actually during the film, when lights were dimmed, the usher would shine a [[Flashlight|torch]] to light the row of seating in question.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30627">'''Visual arts of Chicago''' refers to [[paintings]], [[printmaking|prints]], [[illustrations]], [[Textile arts|textile art]], [[sculpture]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]] and other visual artworks produced in Chicago or by people with a connection to Chicago. Since [[World War II]], Chicago visual art has had a strong individualistic streak, little influenced by outside fashions. "One of the unique characteristics of Chicago," said [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] curator Bob Cozzolino, "is there's always been a very pronounced effort to not be derivative, to not follow the status quo."&lt;ref name=Loviglio&gt;Joann Loviglio, "Chicago Art Stars in Philly Exhibition", [[Chicago Sun-Times]], Wednesday, February 22, 2006, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago art world has been described as having "a stubborn sense ... of tolerant pluralism."&lt;ref name=Thodos&gt;Diane Thodos, "Self-Portraits 2000", ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', May–June 2001, Vol. 28, no. 8-9, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chicago's art scene is "critically neglected."&lt;ref name=Vine&gt;Richard Vine, "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_/ai_19385182 Where the Wild Things Were]", ''[[Art in America]]'', May 1997, pp. 98-111 {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Andrew Patner has said, "Chicago's commitment to figurative painting, dating back to the post-War period, has often put it at odds with New York critics and dealers."&lt;ref name=Patner&gt;Andrew Patner, "Chicago: Special Report: Contemporary Art", ''[[Art and Antiques Magazine]]'', Summer 1996, p. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that Chicago art is rarely found in Chicago museums; some of the most remarkable Chicago artworks are found in other cities (such as the brilliantly warped epic drawings of [[Henry Darger]] at the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in [[New York City]], or [[Carlos Cortez|Carlos Cortez']] collection of early twentieth-century Chicago "Wobbly" ([[Industrial Workers of the World]]) woodcut prints, now in the [http://www.reuther.wayne.edu/taxonomy/term/12 Walter P. Reuther Library] at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]]).&lt;ref name=Sherlock&gt;Maureen P. Sherlock, "Missing/Inaction: 'Art in Chicago, 1945-95'", ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', February 1997, Volume 24, no. 5, pp. 23-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days: before the War==
[[File:Davies-Elysian Fields, undated oil on canvas painting, The Phillips Collection (Washington, D. C.).jpg|thumb|right|Arthur B. Davies, ''Elysian Fields,'' undated, oil on canvas, [[The Phillips Collection]] (Washington, D. C.)]]

The [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] was founded in 1879, from the remains of an earlier school founded in 1866 (thus the school predates the museum of the same name).&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Marzio, "A Museum and a School: An Uneasy But Creative Union", ''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring 1979, Vol. VIII, number 1, pp. 20-23; 44-52&lt;/ref&gt; Early students and faculty were conservative and derivative in their tastes, imitating popular European models. [[Arthur B. Davies]], a former SAIC student and one of "[[Ashcan School|the Eight]]" was considered a disappointment for being a member of a radical group of urban modernists. In 1913, SAIC students held a protest with costumes and bonfires against the Chicago showing of the [[Armory Show]], a collection of the best new modern art; the newspapers described the students' activity as a riot.&lt;ref name=Martinez&gt;Andrew Martinez, "A Mixed Reception for Modernism: The 1913 Armory Show at the Art Institute of Chicago", The Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 19, no. 1, 1993, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a year later the African-American [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] [[Archibald Motley|Archibald J. Motley]], graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago; he kept his modern, jazz-influenced paintings secret for some years after.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine D. Woodall, "Looking Backward: Archibald J. Motley and the Art Institute of Chicago: 1914-1930", ''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring 1979, Vol. VIII, number 1, pp. 53-57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mary Agnes Yerkes, Blue Boat.jpg|thumb|right|''"Blue Boat"'' by Mary Agnes Yerkes, circa 1920, oil on canvas.]]

For many years the Art Institute of Chicago regularly held annual exhibits of local artists,&lt;ref name=Martinez/&gt; but these ended decades ago. [[Mary Agnes Yerkes]], (1886–1989), was an American Impressionist painter and one such exhibitor at AIC from 1912-1915. Born in Oak Park, she studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, where she also taught, and the at the currently named School of the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Miss Yerkes' Exhibit|newspaper= Oak Leaves|date= October 23, 1915| pages = 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is noted for her plein-air painting while camping the American West and its National Parks.

==Interbellum: Chicago arts between the World Wars==
The time period between the World Wars witnessed an outpouring of artistic creativity in Chicago, led by artists of the calibre of  [[Stanislav Szukalski]], [[Todros Geller]]&lt;ref name="occgeller"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oakton.edu/museum/Geller.html|title=Todros Geller (1889-1949)|publisher=Oakton Community College|accessdate=21 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322160221/http://www.oakton.edu/museum/Geller.html|archive-date=22 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albin Polasek]].

The Chicago art scene was not strictly an all-boys club however; [[Sr. Maria Stanisia]] was able to overcome the patriarchal attitudes both within early twentieth century [[Chicago]] and the hierarchy of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to become acclaimed as one of the greatest painters in the field of [[religious art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040428164700/http://stmargaretofscotland.com/stations.htm Stations of Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[Women Artists|woman artist]] [[Gertrude Abercrombie]] who like Stanisia attended the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], sold her [[surrealist]] paintings in art fairs that took place near the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;Warren, Lynne, ''Art in Chicago 1945-1995'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-500-23728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940s==
Early evidence of Chicago's unique style came with [[Ivan Albright]], with his "excruciatingly detailed surfaces depicting things in states of decay."&lt;ref name=Holg&gt;Garret Holg, "Art of the City: The Imagists -- and Beyond" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Sunday, March 22, 1998, Section B, pp. 1, 14&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eldzier Cortor]] documented African-American life for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]].&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;  [[Vera Berdich]], an influential [[surrealist]] printmaker, taught many future [[Chicago Imagists]] at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

==1950s: individuality, realism, surrealism==
[[Claes Oldenburg]] was born in Sweden and only spent a few years in the 1950s in Chicago, but he sold his first works here, 5 pieces at the [[57th Street Art Fair]] for $25.&lt;ref&gt;David McCracken, "The Art Fair That's Been In the Picture the Longest", [[Chicago Tribune]], June 5th, 1987, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-War art in Chicago was more figurative and less abstract than the [[New York City|New York]] fashion dictated, and was largely ignored by New York dealers and critics.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;  Chicago artists rejected the abstract aesthetics of New York [[modernists]], preferring strong surrealism, "following their own vision,"&lt;ref name=Loviglio/&gt; and "savage political satire."&lt;ref name=Sherlock/&gt;

==1960s==

[[Claire Zeisler]], a fiber artist, switched from weaving to large, free-standing fiber sculptures which "redefined the art form".&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

===The Chicago Imagists===
In the late 1960s, a group of former students of the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], many of whom had been mentored by teacher-artist [[Ray Yoshida]],&lt;ref&gt;Larry Finley, "Influential Figure in Chicago Art World: Teacher, Mentor to Artists in Imagism School of 1970s", [[Chicago Sun-Times]], Monday, January 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; organized a series of exhibits at the [[Hyde Park Art Center]].  Their art was notable for its surrealism and cartoon-influenced grotesques.

Strictly speaking, they were three different groups:  The earliest was the "Monster Roster", which included [[Cosmo Campoli]], [[Leon Golub]], [[Nancy Spero]], and [[Karl Wirsum]]; then the "Hairy Who", which included [[Art Green (artist)|Art Green]], [[Gladys Nilsson]], and [[Jim Nutt]]; and finally the [[Chicago Imagists]], which included [[Roger Brown (artist)|Roger Brown]], [[Ed Paschke]], and [[Barbara Rossi (artist)|Barbara Rossi]].&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;

According to Imagist [[Ed Paschke]], the Imagists felt liberated by a lack of critical coverage.  "There was a sense that no one much cared what we did here.  We weren't going to get a whole lot of national attention.  We could do what we wanted to do."&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;  After Paschke's death, in 2004, a New York critic infamously said that Paschke's "contribution to the art of his time was somewhat obscured by his distance from New York."&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Smith, "Ed Paschke, Painter, 65, Dies; Pop Artist With Dark Vision", New York Times, December 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  At that same time, Chicago artists Tony Fitzpatrick and Wesley Kimler and art consultant Paul Klein stirred outrage when they reported that not a single Chicago museum had any of Paschke's work on display (a claim that was later disputed).&lt;ref name=Foumberg&gt;Jason Foumberg, "Art in Chicago 2000-2009: At Zeroes End", [[Newcity]], December 3, 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the Chicago Imagists were given recognition in a show at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Imagist Art'', Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Illinois 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Chicago Surrealist Group===
Under the leadership of [[Penelope Rosemont|Penelope]] and [[Franklin Rosemont]], the [[Chicago Surrealist Group]] came together with both artistic and political ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jack J.|last=Spector|title=Surrealist Art and Writing, 1919-1939: The Gold of Time|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-55311-3|year=1997|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the group played a major role in organizing the World Surrealist Exhibition at the [[Gallery Black Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.corpse.org/issue_10/critiques/postel.html |title="Women and the Surrealist Revolution: an interview with Penelope Rosemont" by Danny Postel, in 'Exquisite Corpse: A Journal of Letters and Life' |access-date=2014-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020620/http://www.corpse.org/issue_10/critiques/postel.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s==

Chicago produced several [[Photorealism|photorealists]], including [[Arne Besser]], and [[Richard Estes]].  Many photorealists were collected by Morton Neumann "against the grain of the prevailing critical thought at the time" (which espoused abstract expressionism),  and exhibited at Chicago's [[Terra Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;"American Super Realism from the Morton G. Neumann Family Collection", Terra Museum of American Art, Evanston, Illinois 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago artists internationally==

Over the last few decades, many contemporary Chicago artists have become internationally successful. A persistent problem for the development of art scenes in Chicago has been the fact that, in the past, a large number of artists began in Chicago, but had to relocate elsewhere before gaining attention. [[Curator]] Robert Cozzolino sees this positively, stating that we must "recognize a powerful Chicago diaspora." Such artists include [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cozzolino, "Post:Correcting the Chicago Record", ''artblog'', February 3, 2006, http://fallonandrosof.blogspot.com/2006/02/correcting-chicago-record.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no overarching theme or style characterizes Chicago's contemporary art, many contemporary critics contend that institutional support has favored Neo-Conceptual work almost to exclusion. Chicago art is nevertheless diverse and pluralistic, as is art in general. Contemporary Chicago artists continue to explore personal styles.  Although abstraction has never been as strong in Chicago as in New York, there are noteworthy Chicago abstract artists, such as [[William Conger]], who paints brightly colored, sprightly designs, and [[Rodney Carswell]], whose work is more formal and cooler; and conceptual artists such as photographer [[Jeanne Dunning]] and installation artist [[Kay Rosen]].&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Holg, "City Focus Chicago: Industrious Evolution", ''[[ARTnews]]'', April 1998, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's other notable contemporary artists are too numerous to name; but a few who would make any list are [[Kerry James Marshall]], [[Dan Peterman]], [[Gregg Bordowitz]], [[Julia Fish]], [[Wesley Kimler]], [[Tony Fitzpatrick (artist)|Tony Fitzpatrick]] and [[Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle]].



===Painters===
[[Robert Guinan]] paints psychologically penetrating portraits of bar patrons and jazz musicians which are very popular in France, but he is almost unknown in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;John Golden, "Hunting Guinan: An Artist Renowned in France Finds Fame Elusive in His Native Land", [[New York Times]], Sunday, March 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurie Hogin continues the grotesque Chicago tradition with lush, Dutch-style portraits of cartoonishly savage animals.&lt;ref&gt;Alan G. Artner, "Hogin's Horrors: How a Gifted Representational Painter Became an Angry Philosopher-Activist", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Friday, February 28, 1997, Section 7, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  Ellen Lanyon's paintings show "fairy-tale gentleness and antiquarian whimsy."&lt;ref name=Artner&gt;Alan G.

John F. Miller taught for a few decades at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|SAIC]] and, during the bulk of that period, produced paintings and some drawings in an abstract style. Since the late 1990s, Miller has produced most of his work using compters and graphics software.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Nance, "The Outsider With Loads of Talent, Rivaled Only by His Ego", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 29 January 2006.

===Sculptors, textile art===
[[Cat Chow]] constructs dresses out of subversive materials.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Cole, "Artist Spotlight: Cat Chow", ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'', May/June 2004, Vol. 27, no. 3, pp. 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard Hunt (sculptor)|Richard Hunt]] sculpts ruggedly abstract commentaries on social issues.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;  [[Kerry James Marshall]] paints and sculpts multi-media works commenting on African-American life.&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

===Photography===
These same impulses also appeared in Chicago's lively [[Street photography]] scene, gaining notoriety through artists centered around the [[IIT Institute of Design|Institute of Design]] such as [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]], [[Aaron Siskind]], [[Leon Lewandowski]] as well as in the work of nanny-savant [[Vivian Maier]]. Ray K. Metzker and Barbara Crane studied at the Institute of Design in the 1950s. They spread the ideas of the Institute of Design teaching photography in the second half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Metzker was Philadelphia based and Crane was based in Chicago. [[Bob Thall]]'s beautiful, bleak photographs of Chicago-area architecture have also won much acclaim.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;

===Illustration, printmaking===

===Public art===

Chicago had a revival, dating to the 1960s, of public [[mural]] art, involving local artists and community members.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Eric Hoyt, "The Explosion of a Dormant Art Form: Chicago's Murals", ''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring-Summer 1974, Vol. III, number 1, pp. 28-35&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chicago Public Art Group]] is a non profit cultural organization in [[Chicago]] that organizes and promotes creation of community public art. Founded in 1971, several of its recent works have been large [[bricolage]] mosaics in city [[underpass]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/06/29/your-chicago-ornate-underpass-murals/ |title=Your Chicago: Ornate Underpass Murals |publisher=[[CBS]]Chicago|date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeoutchicago2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Lauren|url=http://www.timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/art-design/65809/lake-shore-thrives |title=Lake Shore thrives - Art &amp; Design |publisher=Time Out Chicago|date=2009-07-20|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irreverence, satire==
[[File:Cowardly lion2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|W. W. Denslow's illustration of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.]]

Chicago has a strong tradition of satirical, even grotesque art and illustration.  The early books of [[L. Frank Baum]] were illustrated with the strange work of [[William Wallace Denslow]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell P. Macfall, "The Baum Explosion",''Chicago History: The Magazine of the Chicago Historical Society'', Spring 1978, Vol. VII, number 1, pp. 59-62&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chicago tradition of political satire is seen in installation artist [[Öyvind Fahlström]], cartoonish artist [[Hy Roth]], and actual cartoonists [[Heather McAdams]] and [[Nicole Hollander]].&lt;ref name=Sherlock/&gt;  Other Chicago cartoonists recognised by the art world include [[Lynda Barry]], [[Dan Clowes]], [[Jay Lynch]] and [[Chris Ware]] (whose work was shown at the 2002 [[Whitney Biennial]]).&lt;ref&gt;Christa Donner, ""Drawing the Line: Midwest Comics &amp; Contemporary Art", ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'', Nov/Dec 2002, Volume 25, Number 4, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant comics artists from Chicago include [[Jessica Abel]],&lt;ref&gt;Joy Press, "The Further Adventures of Artbabe: Brooklyn Graphic Novelist Jessica Abel, Up From Underground", ''[[Village Voice]]'', Tuesday, March 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herblock|"Herblock" (Herbert Block)]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert C.

==Self-taught artists and Outsider Art==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Xdx - Manierre Dawson - overall.jpg|right|thumb|Xdx by Manierre Dawson from ca. 1910]]

"Chicago emerged early on as an outpost for [[Outsider Art|outsider art]]," according to critic Andrew Patner.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

[[Manierre Dawson]] was an early self-taught artist, who began painting abstracts in 1910.  He was invited to display in the [[Armory Show]].&lt;ref name=Holg/&gt;

In the 1990s, a group of Chicago collectors, including Bob Roth, founder of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', and Ann Nathan and Judy Saslow, both of whom have opened acclaimed galleries, organized [[Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art]], which leads tours of Midwestern self-taught artists and has its own exhibition space.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

Paul Waggoner, an eccentric himself, was an art dealer and champion of outsider art.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Jenses, "Offbeat Gallery Owner", Chicago Tribune, Saturday, March 22, 2008, section 1, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Hammer, an art dealer in Chicago, has handled much strange, figurative [[outsider art]], including the epic novel, illustrated with hermaphroditic girls traced from coloring books, of [[Henry Darger]], and the naive portraits of society ladies of [[Lee Godie]].  Hammer also represents [[Mr. Imagination (Gregory Warmack)|Mr. Imagination]], a self-taught bottlecap muralist&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt; Mr. Imagination, whose work is in several museums, also participated in the 2007 public art project, "[[Cool Globes: Hot Ideas for a Cooler Planet]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Cool Globes: Hot Ideas for a Cooler Planet: Guidebook", For Her Information Media, Chicago, Illinois 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Troubles and controversies==
In the 1980s, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]], along with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and Chicago's Department of Cultural Affairs, attempted to put on a show of contemporary Chicago art.  Called "The Chicago Show", it was supposed to celebrate Chicago's artistic diversity.  Embarrassingly, 84 of the 90 artists chosen by the 5-member blind jury were found to be white.  The organizers published an apology in the exhibit catalogue and invited twenty minority artists who  had not been juried in to participate.  Half of the invited artists, angered by this condescension, refused and organized a counter-exhibit at the [[Chicago Cultural Center]].&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;

On April 15, 1989, the same night that the [[Hyde Park Art Center]] celebrated its 50th anniversary, a devastating fire destroyed most of an entire block of important galleries and art spaces in the [[River North Gallery District, Near North Side, Chicago|River North gallery district]].&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

In spring of 1996, the Feigen, Inc. gallery's exhibit of [[Gregory Green (artist)|Gregory Green]]'s "10,000 Doses" and "Recipe for Making '[[LSD]]' in the Kitchen" was raided by the [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police]], who confiscated and broke open the artworks.  No drugs were found.&lt;ref name=Patner/&gt;

In 1996 the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]], to get over the embarrassment of "The Chicago Show", attempted a survey of Chicago Art called "Art in Chicago: 1945-1995".  It was criticized by the press as cramped, inadequate, and incomprehensive.&lt;ref name=Vine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherlock/&gt;  Its catalogue was judged a disappointment by Dennis Adrian, an art critic and participant, who called it "visually ... an atrocity of staggering proportions."&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Adrian, "This Map is Not to Scale", ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', February 1997, Volume 24, no. 5, pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual arts coverage===
In the last decade, all major print publications in Chicago have ceased seriously covering the visual arts .  In 2009, the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', an [[alternative newspaper|alternative]] weekly newspaper, reduced its formerly complete art listings of galleries and museums and regular art reviews by [[Fred Camper]] to "a smattering of listings and pictures".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Jason Foumberg, "Art in Chicago 2000-2009: At Zeroes End", [[Newcity]], December 3, 2009, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', one of Chicago's two major newspapers, never had gallery or art listings and fired its sole dedicated fine arts reporter, [[Alan G. Artner]], in 2009.&lt;ref name=Foumberg/&gt;
And the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', the other of Chicago's two major newspapers, has no gallery or art listings and no dedicated arts reporter, although [[Kevin Nance]] has covered some fine art issues along with movies and popular culture.

Additionally, The ''[[New Art Examiner]]'' (from Chicago) and ''[[Dialogue (magazine)|Dialogue]]'' magazine ([[Columbus, Ohio]]) reported on Chicago and midwestern arts communities until they both folded in 2002, though the ''[[New Art Examiner]]'' relaunched in 2015'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Art Examiner|url=http://www.newartexaminer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Gallery News]]'', a glossy color magazine published three times a year, lists gallery shows but has no articles.  ''[[Gallery Guide]]'' magazine publishes a Chicago/midwest edition which is similar.

However, smaller online and print publications have continued to cover the art scene in Chicago and have increased dramatically in number in recent years. Since 1988, [[NewCity Magazine|New City Magazine]] has covered the visual arts in Chicago, joined in the 1990s by [[Lumpen (magazine)|Lumpen Magazine]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. [[Gapers Block]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gapers Block|url=http://www.gapersblock.com|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Chicago-focused web publication established in 2003, added coverage with their arts and culture section. They were soon followed by Paul Klein's Art Letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Letter|url=http://www.artletter.com/info.html|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 and the [[Bad at Sports|Bad At Sports]] podcast and blog in 2005. In 2008, print-based Proximity Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proximity Magazine About|url=http://proximitymagazine.com/information/about/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established, joined by two more print publications, Jettison Quarterly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jettison Quarterly|url=http://jettisonquarterly.com/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The School of the Art  Institute's F News Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F News Magazine|url=http://fnewsmagazine.com/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 2009. Also in 2009, Chicago Art Magazine broke off of Art Talk Chicago, part of the Chicago Tribune-sponsored blog network, to start their own independent online platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Art Magazine - About|url=http://chicagoartmagazine.com/about/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago Art Review, which ran from 2009-2011 and is currently in hiatus, began in 2009 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Art Review|url=http://www.Chicagoartreview.com|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Sixty Inches From Center was established and includes The Chicago Arts Archive, a web publication focusing on visual art in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sixty Inches From Center|url=http://sixtyinchesfromcenter.org/|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org Chicago Artists Resource], launched by the Department of Cultural Affairs in 2005, provides articles on visual art in addition to providing resources and tools for Chicago artists.

Local artists' interests are represented by the [[Chicago Artists' Coalition]], a nonprofit advocacy organization, which has a monthly newsletter, the ''[[Chicago Artists' News]]''.
