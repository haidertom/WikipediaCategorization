==History==

The building was originally a town house, but in 1659, soon after it was built, it was bequeathed to the parish of [[St Michael's Church, Chester|St&amp;nbsp;Michael]] for use as a [[rectory]].  It ceased to be used as a rectory in 1907, and was converted into a shop by an antique dealer named Crawford.&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| page = 102|  isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored in the late 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;

==Architecture==

Constructed in [[timber framing]] with plaster panels, the shop has a grey [[slate]] roof.  It has four storeys, and consists of a single, narrow [[bay (architecture)|bay]].  A portion of the [[Chester Rows]] passes through the first floor.  At street level is a modern shop front, behind which is the former undercroft.  At the front of the first floor is a rail on [[baluster]]s, behind which is a stallboard, the paved walkway of the Row, and a modern shop front.  Above this is a row of five ornately shaped panels.  The second floor contains a three-light [[mullion]]ed and [[transom (architectural)|transomed]] [[casement window]], with two panels on each side.  The top storey is [[jettying|jettied]] and [[gable]]d.  It contains a row of six plain panels, above which is a small three-light casement window with two panels on each side, and a [[queen post]] gable with patterned [[bargeboard]]s and a [[finial]].&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; The interior has retained part of a 17th-century [[molding (decorative)|moulded]] ceiling, the form of the galleried former [[great hall]], and an 18th-century staircase.  In also contains four panels depicting the [[Stations of the Cross]].  These appear to be [[Middle Ages|medieval]], but are in fact plaster panels painted to resemble wood that were installed by Crawford when the rectory was converted into a shop.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;

==Current use==

As of October 2012 the building is occupied by previously Porr's Collection costume jewellery. As of November 2013 is now 2 Good 2 B True fashion Jewellery and accessories shop at street level and by Mad Hatters Tea Room &amp; Bakery at row level and above.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

''Miles Gloriosus'' (literally, "braggart-soldier", in [[Latin language|Latin]]) is a [[stock character]] of a boastful soldier from the [[Comedy (drama)|comic]] [[theatre of ancient Rome]], and variations on this character have appeared in [[drama]] and [[fiction]] ever since.&lt;ref name=Frye /&gt; The character derives from the ''alazṓn'' or "braggart" of the [[Ancient Greek comedy#Old Comedy|Greek Old Comedy]] (e.g. [[Aristophanes]]).  The term "Miles Gloriosus" is occasionally applied in a contemporary context to refer to a posturing and self-deceiving boaster or bully.

=== Literary instances ===
In the play ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]'' by [[Plautus]], the term applies to the main character Pyrgopolynices. This foolish ''Miles Gloriosus'' brags openly and often about his supposed greatness, while the rest of the characters feign their admiration and secretly plot against him. Heavily borrowing from Plautus, the [[Stephen Sondheim]]-[[Burt Shevelove]]-[[Larry Gelbart]] musical ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' features a warrior named Miles Gloriosus.

Shakespeare uses the type most notably with the bombastic and self-glorifying ensign [[Ancient Pistol]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor L. Cahn, Shakespeare the Playwright: A Companion to the Complete Tragedies, Histories, Comedies, and Romances, Praeger, Westport, 1996. p.468.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are  "fashion's own knight", the Spaniard Armardo, in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', the worthless Captain Parolles in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'', and [[Falstaff]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]'', and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''.

[[Baron Munchausen]] is a braggart soldier.

In [[Commedia dell'arte]], the figure of [[Il Capitano]] is a ''miles gloriosus''.&lt;ref&gt;John Rudlin, ''Commedia dell'Arte: An Actor's Handbook'', p. 120, {{ISBN|0-415-04770-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, the title role of ''[[Háry János]]'' by [[Kodály]] is an example of the character.

In PC game ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'', there is a non-playable character named Miles Gloriosus, willing to brag about his accomplishments as soldier.

==''Senex iratus''==
The ''senex iratus'' or heavy father figure is a comic [[archetype]] character who belongs to the alazon or impostor group in [[theater]], manifesting himself through his rages and threats, his obsessions and his gullibility.

His usual function is to impede the love of the [[lovers (character)|hero and heroine]], and his power to do so stems from his greater social position and his increased control of cash.  In the [[New Comedy]], he was often the father of the hero and so his rival.  More frequently since, he has been the father of the heroine who insists on her union with the bad fiancé; as such, he appears in both ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', where he fails and so the play is a comedy, and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', where his acts are successful enough to render the play a tragedy.

[[Pantalone]] in [[Commedia dell'arte]] acts as a ''senex iratus''.

In his ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', [[Northrop Frye]] considered all blocking humors in comedy to be variations on the basic function of the ''senex iratus''.

The '''Alberta Foundation for the Arts''' (AFA), based in [[Edmonton]], is a [[Crown Agency|crown agency]] of the [[Government of Alberta]]. As the primary [[arts funding]] body in [[Alberta]], it plays a key role in supporting the Spirit of Alberta,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.alberta.ca/about/premiers-council/pdf/SpiritofAlberta.pdf Spirit of Alberta Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; Alberta's Cultural Policy. 
The AFA exists to fund, encourage, and support the development of the [[art]]s as a valuable contributor to quality of life in Alberta and, to develop the AFA art collection as a cultural resource for all Albertans.

== Background ==
The AFA was founded in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/A19.pdf Alberta Foundation for the Arts Act]&lt;/ref&gt; Its mandate is to support and contribute to the development of the arts in Alberta. It brought under its mandate: the Alberta Art Foundation, the Alberta Foundation for the Performing Arts, the Alberta Foundation for the Literary Arts, and the arts and cultural grant programs of Alberta Culture and Multiculturalism. The AFA is governed by a Board of Directors.

The AFA reports annually to Alberta's Minister of Culture and Community Spirit and supports the Ministry's [[business plan]] through its arts policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.alberta.ca/about/premiers-council/pdf/SpiritofAlberta.pdf Spirit of Alberta Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;  The AFA receives an annual allocation from the Alberta Lottery Fund, which it distributes to [[artist]]s and art organizations across Alberta through a variety of programs.

== Activities ==

===Granting programs===
Grants are available by application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.affta.ab.ca/Grants Grant Program]&lt;/ref&gt; All AFA project [[Grant (money)|grants]] are awarded by independent juries whose members are selected from the Canadian arts community.

The granting programs are organized into the following three categories, with specific streams below:

===AFA art collection===

The AFA art collection,&lt;ref&gt;[https://hermis.alberta.ca/afa/ Alberta Art Collections]&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1972, is the only collection of its kind dedicated to showcasing the development of Alberta's [[visual arts]] achievements. Art maintenance and conservation ensures that the handling, preparation and preservation of artwork are conducted according to museum and archival standards.

The collection contains over 8,000 works of art and is valued at over $10 million. More than 1,700 Alberta artists, many of whom are historically important individuals in the growth of the visual arts in Alberta, are represented in this collection. The AFA also hosts a virtual art museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alberta.emuseum.com/ Virtual Art Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travelling Exhibition Program===
Since the program's introduction during Alberta's 75th Anniversary Celebrations in 1980, the AFA has supported a provincial [[Travelling exhibition|Traveling Exhibition]] (TREX) program. The TREX program strives to ensure every Albertan is provided with an opportunity to enjoy a visual arts exhibition in their community. The TREX program allows exhibitions from the Alberta art collection to be hosted in communities throughout Alberta. Venues include public libraries, [[school]]s, post-secondary institutions, [[hospital]]s and [[health care]] facilities, community halls and tourism centers. The TREX program also offers educational support material for [[educator]]s to integrate visual arts into the school curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;
Four regional organizations now coordinate the program for the AFA: 
*The Prairie Art Gallery, [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]] - Northwest Alberta 
*[[Art Gallery of Alberta]], [[Edmonton]] - Northeast and North Central Alberta 
*Alberta Society of Artists, [[Calgary]] - Southwest Alberta 
*Esplanade Arts &amp; Heritage Centre, [[Medicine Hat]] - Southeast Alberta

===Arts promotion and capacity building===
The AFA supports the arts through various promotional strategies such as [[Alberta Culture Days]]   which activities help to generate awareness of the arts with both the public and key [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s. This is overseen by the Premier's Council for the Arts  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.alberta.ca/about/premiers-council/default.aspx Premier's Council]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the AFA strives to build capacity among Alberta artists and art organizations by providing expert consulting support and grant application advice. These resources are used to build stronger, more sustainable arts organizations.

'''American craft''' is craft work produced by independent studio artists, working with traditional [[craft]] materials and/or processes such as [[wood]], [[woodworking]] or [[furniture|furniture making]], [[glass]] or [[glassblowing]],  [[clay]] or [[ceramic]]s, [[textiles]], [[metal]] or [[metalworking]]. Studio craft works tend to either serve or allude to a functional or utilitarian purpose, though they are as often as not handled and exhibited in ways similar to visual art objects.

==History==
The American studio craft movement is a successor to earlier European craft movements.  Modern studio crafts developed as a reaction to [[modernity]] and, particularly, the [[Industrial Revolution]].  During the nineteenth century, Scottish historian [[Thomas Carlyle]] and English social critic [[John Ruskin]] warned of the extinction of [[handicrafts]] in [[Europe]].  English designer and theorist [[William Morris]] continued this line of thought, becoming father of [[England's]] [[Arts &amp; Crafts Movement]].  Morris distinguished the studio craftsman in this way:  "[O]ur art is the work of a small minority composed of educated persons, fully conscious of their aim of producing beauty, and distinguished from the great body of workmen by that aim."  Both European and American craft traditions have also been influenced by [[Art Nouveau]].  Both of these movements influenced the development of the contemporary studio craft movement in the [[United States]] during the late nineteenth century, throughout the twentieth century and to the present.

==American craft pioneers==
[[File:Tiffany Window of St Augustine - Lightner Museum.jpg|left|border|thumb|[[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], Window of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], in the [[Lightner Museum]], [[St. Augustine, Florida]]]]
In the early nineteenth century it became popular for rural Americans of modest means to take the decoration of their homes and furniture into their own hands.  The artist [[Rufus Porter (inventor)|Rufus Porter]] was an early proponent of the American craft movement. In 1825 he published  ''A Select Collection of Valuable and Curious Arts, and Interesting Experiments Which are Well Explained, and Warranted Genuine, and May be Prepared, Safely and at Little Expense'', which is a book of instructions for domestic decorative arts, including wall, floor, and furniture painting.

By the end of the nineteenth century, the preindustrial craft trades had almost disappeared.  Industrial expansion and westward movement had largely severed American culture from early Colonial American and Native American craft roots.  Against this backdrop, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was a pioneer of the American craft movement, arguing for the placement of well-designed and crafted objects in the American home.  Tiffany's elegant [[stained glass]] creations were influenced by the values of [[William Morris]] and became America's leading embodiment of [[art nouveau]].

{{main|Gustav Stickley}}
[[Gustav Stickley]], the [[cabinetmaker]] was an early leader in the development of [[Studio Furniture]] and the American craft movement.  Stickley's designs were distinguished by their simplicity and by their harmony between interior [[decorative art]] and [[architecture]].  Stickley's magazine, "[[The Craftsman (magazine)|The Craftsman]]," was a forum for this movement from 1901 through 1916.  Originally focused on expounding ideas from the [[England]]'s [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], "The Craftsman" increasingly developed American craft concepts over the years of its publication. Stickley's ideas later had influence on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and future generations of American craftsmen, artists and architects.

The [[Roycroft]] movement was an American adaptation of the British arts and crafts movement founded by [[Elbert Hubbard]] and his wife [[Bertha Crawford Hubbard]] in the small-town of [[East Aurora, New York]] in 1895.  Its focus was on writing and publishing ornate books, but it also made furniture and metal products. Roycroft was organized as a living/working artisans' community along the lines of a [[Medieval]] European [[guild]].

==Early craft institutions==
The studio crafts movement was fostered by the establishment of crafts programs within post-secondary educational institutions.  In 1894, for example, North America's first [[university]] [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] department was begun at [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].  This was followed in 1901 by the establishment of the first ceramics art school at [[Alfred University]] in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]].  Similarly, the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] established the first metal arts class in 1901 and the first textiles class in 1903.

After World War I, a postwar spirit of internationalism influenced the establishment of other important craft institutions, such as the [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]] in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]].  Cranbrook craftsmen translated organic and geometric forms into the style that would be known as [[Art Deco]].  At Cranbrook, teachers like [[Maija Grotell]] produced important work in their own right while also teaching a new generation of young studio craft artists.

==The Depression years and World War II==
During the [[Great Depression|Depression]] years, the federal Works Progress Administration funded crafts projects as well as public works and murals as a way to both keep workers working and as a way to increase national morale.  This enabled crafts to flourish at a local level.  At the same time, American art programs began to include craft studies into their curricula.

[[World War II]] brought an influx of European artists and craftsmen. These European exiles brought with them a range of historical traditions including not only European craft practices but also knowledge of Asian and other non-Western cultures. One example of this influx is Tage Frid, a Danish furniture maker, who established the reputation of the Furniture Making program at Rhode Island School of Design, and there are certainly others. Also during the post World War II period a general dissatisfaction with industrial society began to fuel further support for handmade art objects.  In 1943, the [[American Craft Council]] was founded to support craftspeople and cultivate an appreciation for their work.  The ACC's founder, [[Aileen Osborn Webb]] was a potter interested in creating marketing opportunities for studio craftsmen.  The organization eventually grew to include [[American Craft (magazine)|''American Craft'']] magazine and the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] (then called the Museum of Contemporary Crafts and at one point known as the American Craft Museum).  As a result of these phenomena, post-war American craft became stylistically more refined as well as technically more proficient.

==The 1950s and Peter Voulkos==
{{main|Peter Voulkos}}
[[File:Voulkos-Balistreri.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peter Voulkos]] (left) assisted by [[John Balistreri]].]]During the 1950s, some artists turned to the '''[[truth-to-materials]]''' doctrine.  This movement also entailed an emphasis on the collective production of crafts work.  Craftsmen sometimes worked together during this period to develop more ambitious projects.   Throughout the 1950s and afterwards, [[Pottery|potter]] [[Peter Voulkos]] developed increasingly largescale and nontraditional [[ceramic]] works, influenced by [[Abstract Expressionism]], which transformed traditional understandings of the [[craft]] media.  Like the [[Abstract Expressionists]], Voulkos emphasized performance, process and primal expression in his ceramic forms.  In some cases, Voulkos deconstructed and reconstructed traditional ceramic [[Bowl (vessel)|vessel]] forms such as plates, ice buckets, and [[tea bowls]].  In other works, Voulkos created new nonutilitarian forms, such as his purely sculptural, large-scale cylindrical "stacks."

Voulkos was also influenced by [[Zen Buddhism]] after a 1952 encounter with Japanese potter [[Shoji Hamada]].  Hamada encouraged Voulkos to embrace a Zen approach to ceramics based not only upon technical proficiency but also upon a mental and spiritual union between creator and art object.  Voulkos later cited Hamada's statement that it "took him ten years to learn the potter's wheel and another ten years to forget it"—an insight that inspired Voulkos' early attempts to fully form a teapot in two minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anglin Burgard, The Art of Craft: Contemporary Works from the Saxe Collection, [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]], 1999 at 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Voulkos taught at [[Black Mountain College]] in 1953, where he was further exposed to the [[avant-garde]] movements.   In 1954, he founded the [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] department at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]] (then called the Los Angeles County Art Institute).  In [[California]], Voulkos' [[pottery]] rapidly became abstract and sculptural.  Voulkos then moved to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he founded another [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] department and taught from 1959 until 1985.  At Berkeley, Voulkos became increasingly prominent for his massive, cracked and slashed pots.

==The 1960s and the new glassblowing movement==
The culture of the 1960s was even more conducive to the development of studio crafts.  This period saw a rejection of [[materialism]] and exploration of alternative ways of living.  For some, the creation of [[handicrafts]] provided just such an outlet.  In 1962, then-[[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] professor [[Harvey Littleton]] and chemist [[Dominick Labino]] began the contemporary  [[glassblowing]] movement.  The impetus for the movement consisted of their two workshops at the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], during which they began experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art. Thus Littleton and Labino were the first to make molten glass feasible for artists in private studios. [[Harvey Littleton]] extended his influence through his own important artistic contributions and through his teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=1792 The Corning Museum of Glass. "Decades in Glass: The '60s."]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, [[Harvey Littleton]] trained many of the most important contemporary glass artists, including [[Marvin Lipofsky]], Sam Herman (Britain), Fritz Dreisbach and [[Dale Chihuly]].  These Littleton students in turn developed the new movement and spread it across the country.  [[Marvin Lipofsky]], for example, is credited with being one of the founders of the [[Glass Art Society]] and introducing studio glass to California.   In 1967, Lipofsky founded the glass program at the [[California College of Arts and Crafts]], which he headed for two decades.

In 1971, [[Dale Chihuly]] began the influential [[Pilchuck Glass School]] near the rural town of [[Stanwood, Washington]]. Influenced by the [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]] (the first school to have a glass furnace), and the [[Penland School of Crafts]],  [[Pilchuck Glass School]] has become a center of the contemporary American [[studio glass movement]], of which Chihuly is a leading figure. Artist [[Toots Zynsky]], a Pilchuck pioneer, observed that the choice of a Western location for the school reflected a conscious rejection of the Eastern art establishment. The naming of the school also reflected the founders' countercultural attraction to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture.  Chihuly chose the name "Pilchuck," derived from the [[Chinookan]] words for "red" and "water," alluding to the iron-rich waters of the nearby [[Pilchuck River]].

==The Renwick Gallery==
{{main|Renwick Gallery}}
[[File:RenwickGallery.jpg|left|thumb|border]]
In 1972, the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Renwick Gallery]] was founded as a studio craft department of the [[National Museum of American Art]].  Housed in the original [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] building across [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] from the [[White House]], it provided a distinguished setting for American studio craft objects in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==The Year of American Craft==
In 1992, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] signed a proclamation designating 1993 as '''The Year of American Craft'''.  As part of this commemoration, [[Renwick Gallery]] director Michael Monroe selected seventy-two works by seventy American craftsmen which were donated to the [[White House]] to serve as [[The White House Collection of American Crafts]].  This collection was displayed for four months at the [[National Museum of American Art]] in 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37901">[[File:Crosby Garrett Helmet on auction at Christies.jpg|300px|thumb|An art auction, as in this one at Christies, is an example of one part of the art market where buyers and sellers of art meet to conduct transactions in the art market]]
:{{see also|Art valuation|Art auction}}
The art market is represented by a marketplace of buyers and sellers trading in the commodities, services, and works-of-art commonly associated with the various arts. The art market is also concerned with the production of new art which enters the art market. The art market is an example of one type of marketplace, among many different types of markets which occur in economics. In particular, the art market has many similarities with other marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet, as well as significant distinguishing factors indicative of its differences from other types of markets in economics.

==The art market economic model==
The [[Economics of the arts and literature#The market for artworks|art market]] operates in an economic model that considers more than [[supply and demand]]: it is a hybrid type of [[prediction market]] where art is bought and sold for values based not only on a work's perceived cultural value, but on both its past monetary value as well as its predicted future value. The market has been described as one where producers don't make work primarily for sale, where buyers often have no idea of the value of what they buy, and where middlemen routinely claim reimbursement for sales of things they have never seen to buyers they have never dealt with.&lt;ref name="platter"&gt;Plattner, Stuart, [http://www.stuartplattner.com/AA-ART-Paradox.pdf A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Market for Contemporary Fine Art], ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100(2):482-493, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the market is not transparent; private sales data is not systematically available&lt;ref name="Coslor"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|date=April 2016|title=Transparency in an opaque market: Evaluative frictions between "thick" valuation and "thin" price data in the art market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300307|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=50|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private sales represent about half of market transactions.

===Market size===
Unlike the volumes in the [[securities market]] where millions of people and firms participate in buying and selling financial interests, or the [[Commodity market|commodities market]] where measures of raw or primary products are exchanged using standardized contracts, art market activity largely follows the demands of a more limited array of private collectors, museums, and large corporate interests as the principal market participants.&lt;ref name="microcosm"&gt;The art market sees itself as a microcosm: it lists its collectors in the hundreds, as opposed to the securities market which has millions of participants. ''ARTnews'': [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 The Top Ten] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003020/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 |date=16 October 2009 }}, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 The ARTnews 200 Top Collectors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003056/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 |date=16 October 2009 }}. One art writer, however, answered the question: "Do you see the art world as a microcosm of other broader, power communities?" with the following observation: "I'm not sure if it's a microcosm or the shape of things to come. Its manic internationalism...." [http://www.vmagazine.com/2008/11/111208-insider-art/ Insider Art]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''V Magazine'', 2008-11-12, vmagazine.com.  Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate collectors, however, can have a disparately large market impact, for instance, ''[[Spear's Wealth Management Survey|Spear's]]'' reported in 2015 that [[British Rail]] began investing in art for its pension fund beginning in 1974 (prior to privatization), spending about £40M or approximately 3% of its funds on art, before selling those assets between 1987&amp;ndash;1999.&lt;ref name="britrailspears"&gt;Lindsay, Ivan, [http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/#.U4W0eSj8iZQ Go Figure], ''Spear's'', spearswms.com, 21 January 2011; free [https://web.archive.org/web/20140529052940/http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/ archived version]. Accessed 17 November 2015. The article also mentions that British Rail Pension realized an annualized return of 11.3% because of a number of factors particular to the market at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; British Rail's efforts realized profits, particularly due to the Impressionist portfolio, but the collection was liquidated because it came to be seen as an illegitimate investment area, particularly as alternative investments became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|last2=Spaenjers|first2=Christophe|date=November 2016|title=Organizational and epistemic change: The growth of the art investment field|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300782|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=55|pages=48–62|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because original artworks are not [[Fungibility|fungible]] like [[stock]]s, they have valuation challenges not similarly affecting securities,&lt;ref name="baumol"&gt;Baumol, William J., [http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf Unnatural Value: Or Art Investment as Floating Crap Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425235014/http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf |date=25 April 2012 }}, ''The American Economic Review'', 76:2 (May 1986), pp. 10-14, Papers and Proceedings of the Ninety-Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association,; ''Journal of Arts Management and Law'' (now ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''), 15:3, 1985, pp. 47-60. {{DOI|10.1080/07335113.1985.9942162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with dynamics of what Karpik calls singularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9215.html|title=Valuing the Unique|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, because the art market's participants are far more limited in number than the securities or commodities markets, because artworks are not fungible, and because art valuation relies to a great extent on the advice and enthusiasm of a variety of specialized market analysts, these limitations each in turn dictate the size of the market and increase the risk that some items may be over or undervalued.

===Market timing===
The art market moves in cycles with activity generally peaking in the spring and autumn when the major auction houses traditionally schedule auctions, and results in the market being seasonal rather than ongoing.&lt;ref name="sched"&gt;[http://www.artmarket.com/ Art Market Cycles], artmarket.com, retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  While private sales take place all year, those sales are often not publicized as auctions are and thus do not affect the market until they become known.

Art valuations made for an autumn auction may be unrealistic for the following spring auction season because fortunes in the financial markets during one season can affect the art market in the following season, and equity markets do significantly impact the art market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goetzmann|first=William N|last2=Renneboog|first2=Luc|last3=Spaenjers|first3=Christophe|date=May 2011|title=Art and Money|url=http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=101|issue=3|pages=222–226|doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volatility in the financial markets often causes volatility in the art market as happened in the contraction of the art market during the [[2008–2012 global recession|2008-2009 recession]]&lt;ref&gt;For more on the economic background causing the market contraction, see also the [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence]].&lt;/ref&gt; when sales at [[Sotheby's]], [[Christie's]], and [[Phillips de Pury &amp;amp; Company]] were less than half the previous year: November 2008, $803.3 million compared to November 2007, $1.75 billion; and between 2000 and 2003 when the annual volume of art works sold at auction dropped 36%.&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;&lt;ref name="contraction"&gt;Esterow, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 How to Buy in 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015210756/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 |date=15 October 2009 }}, ''ARTnews'', March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, the art market can fare reasonably well despite volatility in the stock market such as happened from January 1997 through May 2004 when the average quarterly fluctuation in the Artprice Global Index was two to three times smaller than the same statistic for the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] and the [[S&amp;P 500]].&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;

As art market participants' fortunes wax and wane in the financial markets, buying power evolves and affects participants' ability to afford highly valued works, resulting in new buyers and sellers entering, leaving, or re-entering the market, and an artwork sold to offset losses in the financial market might be sold for substantially more or substantially less than its last {{H:title|price for which work sold at auctioneer's hammer strike|hammer value|link=no}} at auction.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;Gerber, Manuel, [http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf Primary Art Market Investments - A Safe Haven when All Else Suddenly Correlates?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002174957/http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf# |date=2013-10-02 }}, Prime Art Management Ltd., published in ''Art Fund Tracker'', Nov. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s during the stock-market boom, the art market expanded in turn with prices soaring to new heights, and investment firms took a greater interest in the art market and began to study it in-depth.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, [http://i1.exhibit-e.com/collectionofmodernart/39049d22.pdf The Art of Portfolio Diversification]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Maastricht University, March 2004.

Art sometimes has transient fashionability that also can affect its value: what sells well for a time may be supplanted in the market by new styles and ideas in short order. For instance, in the spring of 2008 a collector offered over $80 million for Jeff Koons' stainless-steel ''Rabbit'', and yet a year later, of four works in the fall auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York, only two of his pieces sold well and one failed to sell entirely.&lt;ref name="inflatable"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14941205 Inflatable investments, The volatile art of Jeff Koons], ''[[The Economist]]'', 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Christie's sold Koons' ''Balloon Flower'' sculpture for $16.9 million.&lt;ref name="koonsballoon"&gt;Christie's, [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/jeff-koons-balloon-flower/5371708/lot/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5371708&amp;sid=e5ce29ac-d2b6-41b6-9092-7aacf3e6974b Auction result, Sale 2355 / Lot 23], christies.com, retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary and secondary markets===
The art market as a whole is affected by its two main parts: the primary art market, where new art comes to the market for the first time, and the secondary market, for existing art that has been sold at least once before. Once a work is sold on the primary market it enters the secondary market, and the prices for which it sold in the primary market have a direct bearing on the work's value in the secondary market. Supply and demand affect the secondary market more than the primary market because works new to the market, mainly contemporary art, have no market history for predictive analysis and thus valuation of such work is more difficult, and more speculative.&lt;ref name="gerald"&gt;Gerard and Louis, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V64-3YRSMF4-28/2/44fafa98be1c97504c5a1fdc722b55ba On pricing the priceless: Comments on the economics of the visual art market], ''European Economic Review'', Elsevier, vol. 39(3-4), April 1995, pp. 509-518. (membership required).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery, dealer, consultant, and agent promotion as well as collectors acting as [[alpha consumer]]s (trend-setters) are the forces at work in valuing primary market works.

===Market entry barriers===
As with [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] stocks, works by "blue-chip" or well-known artists are generally valued more highly than works by unknown artists since it is hard to predict how an unknown artist's work will sell, or whether it will sell at all. [[barriers to entry|High barriers to market entry]] for artists&lt;ref name="jeffri"&gt;Jeffri, Joan, Philanthropy and the American artist: A historical overview, ''[[International Journal of Cultural Policy|The European Journal of Cultural Policy]]'', 3(2), 2009, pp. 207-233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barriers"&gt;Jackson, M.R., et al, [http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411311_investing_in_creativity.pdf Investing in Creativity: A study of the support structure for US artists], ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society'', 2004.

All these concerns are in play when gallerists set prices for emerging artists at a much lower level than for established artists.

===Market transparency===
With the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]], the art market faced criticism for its lack of transparency, its [[Byzantinism|Byzantine]] valuation methods, and a perceived lack of ethical behavior enabled by structural inadequacies in the market itself. In response, a 2009 debate occurred between valuation-setting members of the art market on the proposition that "the art market is less ethical than the stock market". At the end of the debate the audience determined that those debating in agreement with the proposition won the debate.&lt;ref name="morality"&gt;Saltz, Jerry, [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/saltz/saltz3-6-09.asp Morality Play], artnet.com, 2009-03-06, discussing the debate and its outcome. Participants included art dealers Richard Feigen and Michael Hue-Williams, collector Adam Lindemann on the "pro" side, and artist [[Chuck Close]], critic Jerry Saltz, and auctioneer Amy Cappellazzo opposing. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpsTNdYeG6U debate video] is available on [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note in the debate was the identification of "chandelier bidding" as a practice perceived as ethically questionable. The debaters described "chandelier bidding" as bids from the chandelier, or bids from an unknown source, meaning both the bidding by the auction houses on behalf of the sellers whose items the houses are auctioning (a [[conflict of interest]]), and bidding by unidentified bidders having no intention of buying but bidding in order to drive prices up, all practiced because the auction houses keep secret from bidders a seller's [[Reservation price|reserve price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/arts/design/as-art-market-rise-so-do-questions-of-oversight.html|title=As Art Market Soars, So Do Questions of Oversight|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=27 January 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=9 June 2017|last2=Flynn|first2=Kevin|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate also included the issue of first and third-party guaranteed bids, and whether sellers' reserve prices should be disclosed so that participants no longer bid on an object they have no chance of buying. In response to criticisms regarding chandelier bidding and unidentified third-party guaranteed bids, Christie's International chairman Edward Dolman countered that, without a secret reserve, illegal cartels of bidders would know in advance information that could facilitate their manipulation of the market and corruption of final valuation by selling price at auction.&lt;ref name="transpADAA2"&gt;ADAA, video 3 at 22:05 min, et seq..&lt;/ref&gt;

With the art market's weaknesses (especially lack of transparency and conflicts of interests) becoming better known, serious external conversations about market regulation have begun among major market players; for example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' noted that in early 2015, participants at the January [[World Economic Forum]] meeting attended a lunch seminar where the speaker warned that the global art market needs to be regulated because of systemic weaknesses which enable inside information trading, tax evasion, and money laundering.&lt;ref name="gapper"&gt;Gapper, John, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150125081849/http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2015/01/art-worlds-shady-dealings-under-scrutiny-at-davos Art world’s shady dealings under scrutiny at Davos], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 22 January 2015.

In terms of academic research, there is work on the opacity of price formation in finance and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Géraldine|last2=Oosterlinck|first2=Kim|last3=Szafarz|first3=Ariane|title=Art market inefficiency|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033|journal=Economics Letters|volume=121|issue=1|pages=23–25|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Competitors ===
Christie's and Sotheby's are the leading auction venues. In 2002, [[LVMH]] acquired Swiss art advisory firm de Pury &amp; Luxembourg and merged it with Phillips to form [[Phillips de Pury &amp; Company]], with the aim of breaking the duopoly at the top of the market.

=== Segments ===
Fine art auctions are generally held separately for Impressionist and Modern art as well as for Post-war and Contemporary Art. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s works remain the most coveted lot as of 2004. In 2008 just over  million of art by [[Damien Hirst]] was sold at auction, a world record for a living artist; however in 2009, Hirst’s annual auction sales had shrunk by 93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Estimates ===
"Estimates" often reflect the [[consignor]]'s ambitions as much as the auction specialist's considered opinion. They do not reflect commissions. To secure consignments, auction houses concede high estimates to suit the requirements of art owners.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/arts/08iht-melikian08.html When Auction Estimates Go Haywire], ''[[The New York Times]]'', nytimes.com, October 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Before an auction, interested buyers typically turn for advice to the auction house specialist who quotes the estimate and often recommends going beyond in order to secure the item.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/arts/18iht-melik19.1.9319140.html Behind stellar sales of art market, a dangerous game], ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commissions and Buyer's Premium ===
Auction houses operate contractually on behalf of sellers of goods, charging sellers a fixed [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] (fee) amounting to a percentage of the “hammer price” for which a lot is sold.&lt;ref name="horror"&gt;{{cite journal

Objects sold are also subject to a further fee called the "[[buyer's premium]]", 15% being typical, with the term implying that by virtue of selling an object, the auction house performs a service for the buyer subject to remuneration. Thus, both the seller and the buyer of an object or lot sold by the major auction houses pay a fee. First implemented in 1975 by Christie's, the assessment of a buyer's premium is one of several auction-house practices to which art dealers object.&lt;ref&gt;Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Kathryn Graddy, Anatomy of the Rise and Fall of a Pricefixing Conspiracy: Auctions At Sotheby’s And Christie’s, ''Journal of Competition Law and Economics'', 1(1), 3–20, March 2005, {{doi|10.1093/joclec/nhi003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance-based fees ===
Beginning in 2014, Christie's charged 2 percent of the hammer price of a work that meets or exceeds its high estimate. The fee does not apply to online only sales.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Gerlis (September 26, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 Christie's takes another 2%] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928075542/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 |date=2014-09-28 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guarantees ===
An auction house may offer a guaranteed selling price, or "guaranteed minimum", a practice designed to give sellers confidence to consign works and to give potential bidders reassurance that there are others willing to buy an item.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thornton]], [https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/11/art-market Financial machinations at auctions], ''The Economist'', economist.com, November 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Auction houses have offered guarantees since the early 1970s to encourage collectors to sell their artworks: ''The Art Newspaper'' reported that guarantees were first introduced in 1971 at Sotheby’s, when 47 [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]s and other works from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] were offered with a guaranteed minimum; similar arrangements followed in 1972 and 1973 for the Ritter and Scull collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 2008 when the market turned sour, Christie's and Sotheby's had to pay out at least  million on works for which they guaranteed a minimum price but which failed to sell. In order to reduce their exposure to such losses, boost the market, and reduce volatility, the main auction houses now prefer that third parties take on this financial risk via "third-party guarantees" or "irrevocable bids": using this practice the auction houses sell a work to a third party for a minimum price prior to the auction and this selling price then becomes the “reserve” below which the artwork will not be sold. If bidding for specified works stops at the minimum price, which remains undisclosed, the "third party" acquires the lot; if bidding exceeds the reserve, the third party splits any profit from its sale with the consignor and with the auction house, the percentage going to each party varying with the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Online sales ===
[[File:Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art).jpg|thumb|A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade]]
In May 1999, [[Teo Spiller]] sold a web art project Megatronix to Ljubljana Municipal Museum, which was by the New York Times announced as the first sell of an [[Internet art]] [[net.art]].&lt;ref&gt;Mirapaul, M [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/artsatlarge/13artsatlarge.html "There May Be Money in Internet Art After All"], ''The New York Times, 1999-05-13''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Sotheby's abandoned its partnership with [[eBay]] after it lost millions through its various attempts to sell fine art over the internet.&lt;ref name="duopoly"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/1612774 Just the two of us - The duopoly in fine-art auctions is weakened but very much alive] ''The Economist'', economist.com, February 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;


==What Counts==
The [[art sale|art market]] can also be used to understand what “counts” as part of art history. [[Art dealers]] and auctioneers organize material for distribution to collectors. Two of the largest, and oldest, art auction houses are [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]], and each hold frequent sales of great [[antiquities]] and [[Art Object|art objects]].

==Black Market==
In addition to upstanding practices, a [[black market]] exists for great art, which is closely tied to [[art theft]] and [[art forgery]]. No auction houses or dealers admit openly to participating in the black market because of its illegality, but exposés suggest widespread problems in the field. Because demand for art objects is high, and security in many parts of the world is low, a thriving trade in [[illicit antiquities]] acquired through [[looting]] also exists. Although the art community nearly universally condemns looting because it results in destruction of [[Archaeological site|archeological sites]], [[looted art]] paradoxically remains omnipresent. Warfare is correlated with such looting, as is demonstrated by the recent [[archaeological looting in Iraq]].

Criticism of the arts can be broadly divided into two types. There is [[academia|academic]] criticism such as that found in scholarly works and specialist journals, then there is criticism of a more journalistic nature (often called 'a [[review]]') which is seen by a wider public through newspapers, television and radio. The academic criticism will be of a more vigorous and analytical nature than the journalistic, the journalistic may even focus on entertaining the reader at the expense of detail about the art under discussion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

'''''Carol Symphony''''' is a collection of four preludes, written by [[Victor Hely-Hutchinson]] in 1927.

==History==
It had its first performance on 26 September 1929 at a [[promenade concert]] at the [[Queen's Hall]] which was broadcast live on the BBC's [[2LO]], with other music by [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and [[Percy Pitt]]. It was conducted by the composer.

==Structure==
It is based on four [[Christmas carol]]s, given additional orchestration and [[counterpoint]] arrangements. The four movements are written to be played uninterrupted consecutively.

===Movements===
* The first movement (Allegro energico) is based on ''[[O Come All Ye Faithful]]''. It is in the style of a [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] [[chorale prelude]].
* The second movement is a scherzo (Allegro molto moderato) on ''[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]'', similar to the Russian [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]] compositions.
* The third movement (Andante quasi lento e cantabile) is a slow movement whose outer sections are based on the [[Coventry Carol]], with a central interlude on ''[[The First Nowell]]''.
* The finale (Allegro energico come prima) recapitulates material from the first movement, and also uses ''[[Here We Come A-Wassailing]]'' before concluding with a re-statement of ''[[O Come All Ye Faithful]]'' similar to a style of [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] in a [[Fugue|fugal]] structure.

==Usage for theme music==
Two sections from the ''First Nowell'' section were used for the 1943 [[Children's Hour]] adaptation of [[John Masefield]]'s ''[[The Box of Delights]]''. The work was later used as the opening and closing titles of the [[The Box of Delights (TV series)|1984 BBC Television adaptation]] of the same novel. It featured a recording conducted by [[Barry Rose]] in 1966 of the [[Pro Arte Orchestra]] at [[Guildford Cathedral]]. During [[World War II]], the book had been adapted for radio on the BBC's ''[[Children's Hour]]'', and Hely-Hutchinson's same music had been used. Prof Hely-Hutchinson later became the BBC's Director of Music, in 1944, until his death in 1947.

During the 1940-50s, the first movement was used to assist tuning into the [[BBC]]'s Home Service station before the start of the morning transmission during the Christmas period.

'''''A Treatise on Painting''''' is a collection of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s writings entered in his notebooks under the general heading "On Painting". The manuscripts were gathered together by [[Francesco Melzi]] some time before 1542 and first printed in French and Italian as ''Trattato della pittura'' by Raffaelo du Fresne in 1651. The main aim of the treatise was to argue that painting was a science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/336408/Leonardo-da-Vinci/59104/Science#ref=ref360266 |title=Science: Science of Painting |publisher=Britannica |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygU6MRiXBN8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=The Collected Essays and Criticism: Affirmations and refusals, 1950-1956 By Clement Greenberg, John O'Brian, page 259 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo's keen observation of expression and character is evidenced in his comparison of laughing and weeping, about which he notes that the only difference between the two emotions in terms of the "motion of the [facial] features" is "the ruffling of the brows, which is added in weeping, but more elevated and extended in laughing." &lt;ref&gt;Chapter CLXXII, trans.

Marketers and manufacturers of cosmetic products must be compliant to these regulations to be able to market their cosmetic products in the corresponding [[Jurisdiction (area)|areas of jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Is the Standard ISO 22715 on Cosmetic Packaging legally binding?|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/is-the-standard-iso-22715-on-cosmetic-packaging-legally-binding|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The term cosmetic packaging includes primary and the secondary packaging. Primary packaging, also called cosmetic container, is housing the cosmetic product. It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic containers. An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging. 
The cosmetic container shall carry the name of the [[distributor]], the [[ingredient]]s, define storage, nominal content, product identification (e.g., batch number), warning notices and directions for use.
The secondary packaging shall in addition carry the address of the distributor and information on the cosmetic's mode of action. The secondary packaging does not need to carry any product identification notice.
In cases where the cosmetic product is only wrapped by one single container, this container needs to carry all the information.&lt;ref name="Cosper-PackagingFDA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to FDA regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-fda-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of cosmetic packaging==
There are multiple reasons why care must be put into cosmetic containers. Not only must they protect the product, they need to provide conveniences for vendors and ultimately consumers.

===Protection===
The  main purpose of a container is to store the product so that it is not degraded through storage, shipping and handling.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt; Degradation and damage can be caused by various causes. These causes can be categorized into [[Biological process|biological]], [[Chemical reaction|chemical]], [[temperature|thermal]] causes, damage caused by [[Radiation damage|radiation]] and damage caused by human interaction, by electric sources or by [[pressure]].&lt;ref name="Cosper-PackagingFDA" /&gt;

In addition to protecting the product, packaging also play a big role [[marketing]] cosmetic products. While product quality is a major factor in the product's success, its packaging must be attractive since that's the essence of beauty marketing. Package design must capture the imagination and be associated with enhancing appearance. One of the keys to attractive packaging is artistic use of colors. Most relevant for the marketer is the outer secondary packaging. However, there are cosmetics which are distributed in one single cosmetic container.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;

===Creation of brand awareness===
Cosmetic packages must not only convey [[beauty]], they must equate to [[brand awareness]]. Since the package is what the consumer initially sees, it is very influential in shaping perceptions about the product. Part of building brand awareness for a cosmetic product is associating it with [[emotion]]. Since it's not a survival product it's marketed to appeal to the desire to enhance appearance. The packaging must stimulate this emotion.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;

===Labelling===
[[Label]]s tell consumers what they need to know about the product, as far as how to use it and where it comes from. Companies must list the ingredients and the function of the product, especially when it is unclear. The label  must contain contact information of the entity responsible for putting the product on the market. Labels also provide product tracking information.

The label must be easy to read, particularly for a customer where the product is being displayed. Certain compositions, such as perfumes, can be listed as one ingredient. Secondary packages are what the consumer sees as the outermost package. Primary packages are within the secondary package. Certain information can appear just on secondary packages. The most important information, particularly if the product is prone to misuse, must be displayed on both the primary and secondary packaging.&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CosmeticsEurope"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the label|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetic-products/understanding-label/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Information accuracy====
One of the most important aspects of regulations on labelling is that the information is accurate. Although the FDA does not have the resources to inspect all cosmetic products on the market, it can issue penalties for various violations involving packaging and labelling. It is the manufacturer's responsibility to make sure that its product is safe for public consumption.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;

====Avoidance of misleading information====
None of the information, including name and address, may be misleading. Words can be abbreviated only if it is clear what they represent. All text must be printed clearly on the packaging. Smaller packages in which text is too difficult to read, should include tags with legible text.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

====Listing of ingredients====
Ingredients must be listed in a certain order with priority given to ingredients that represent 1% or more of the volume. These ingredients must be listed in descending order, based on weight. This group of ingredients is then followed by those that represent 1% or less of the product and listed in any order. Colorants may also be listed in any order.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

===Packaging in multiple layers===
Many times cosmetic products are packaged in multiple layers. Whenever it is difficult to detect for the consumer, the number of units should be listed on the outer package, which should contain details about how to use the product and warnings on what to do if it is misused. It is essential that the product is protected from environmental elements such as [[mould]] and [[bacteria]].

The packaging must be sufficient enough to protect the mechanical, thermal, biological and chemical properties of the product. It should also be strong enough to withstand human tampering and [[radiation damage]].&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

==FDA and EU regulations==
The FDA overseas cosmetic packaging but does not test products. It leaves testing for safety up to manufacturers. It still provides regulations and can issue recalls when a product is associated with safety hazards. While the FDA does not have many restrictions on ingredients for cosmetic products, it does require that certain chemicals and colorants be listed.&lt;ref name="Cosper-PackagingFDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA-CosmeticsLaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmetics &amp; U.S. Law |url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm2005209.htm|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as [[EU regulation]]s regarding packaging, manufacturers must be compliant with EC No. 1223/2009. One of these requirements involves the manufacturer issuing a safety report before putting the product on the market. The manufacturer must also disclose any serious undesirable effects (SUE) to the EU. Marketers are required to list nano-materials. 
The EU's definition of "ingredients" does not include raw or technical materials used in production that do not end up in the final product. In some cases when durability is an issue, the manufacturer must list an expiration date after the product has been opened. The words "best used before" are common for identifying the product expiration date.&lt;ref name="EU-Regulation-On-Cosmetics"&gt;{{cite web|title=REGULATION (EC) No 1223/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  of 30 November 2009  on cosmetic products|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32009R1223|publisher=THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosper-Packaging-in-EU"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to EU regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-eu-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CosmeticsEuropeRegulation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO-Standard==
Standard [[ISO 22715]] provides specifications for the packaging and labeling of all cosmetic products that are sold or distributed at no charge; i.e. free samples. National regulations dictate what products are to be regarded as cosmetics. While ISO 22715 is not legally binding, national regulations regarding cosmetic products can be even stricter than those laid out in ISO 22715. The link between [[International standard|standards]] and [[regulation]]s is that a standard often represents the common denominator of [[national law]], as the [[standardization]] committee consists of members of most countries.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13235">The '''destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts''' became publicly known on February 26, 2015 when the group known as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] released a video showing their destruction.

==Mosul Museum==
The [[Mosul Museum]], opened in 1952, is the second largest museum in Iraq, with the first being the [[National Museum of Iraq]]. The museum is split into four areas of focus: The Assyrian hall, the Hatrene hall, the Islamic hall, and the Prehistoric hall.

===Importance of the region===
Iraq's present day borders overlap with the historic extent of [[Mesopotamia]]. Mesopotamia is considered to be one of the first areas in which urbanization evolved, beginning around the 4th millennia B.C. The "city" became the center of the new social system, resulting in the need of centralized power.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically, the land of Iraq holds evidence of the switch from stylized and schematic figures to more realistic representations of the human form. Writing evolved during this time period as well, allowing people to describe divine figures and conceptualize religion.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological efforts uncovered evidence of Mesopotamia as a world contemporary with the Bible, with many stories on cuneiform tablets describing versions of similar biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 22) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's understanding of Iraq and its history comes from the archaeological efforts that have taken place on its land. Because of a lack of visible architectural remains in the area, Mesopotamia, and Iraq in particular, are where the "treasure hunting" of old transformed into the beginnings of  the real archaeological research we know today. Archaeologists have been researching in Iraq for over a century and a half, lending us a great amount of time to truly understand the region's impact on those who live there and ultimately, the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction (2015)==

===Contents of ISIL video===
In a video shared on February 26, 2015, ISIL entered the Mosul Museum with the purpose of destroying artifacts they deemed "idolatrous". Members of the group can be seen pushing over many statues, while using jackhammers and sledgehammers to damage the faces of others. A spokesperson appears in the beginning of the video, explaining the rationale behind the group's actions. The rationale pertains to the assumption that these objects (statues, figurines, etc.) were once worshiped instead of Allah.

A translation from the video is as follows: "These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The so-called Assyrians and Akkadians and others looked to gods for war, agriculture and rain to whom they offered sacrifices…The Prophet Mohammed took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries." &lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage===
Not all of the museum's collection was damaged by ISIL. However, the most impacted were the Assyrian and Hatrene areas of the museum. The Islamic hall, which still held many priceless antiquities, was not shown in the video. The Prehistoric hall was also never shown, though most of those artifacts had been removed prior to the destruction.

====Assyrian====
*Nergal Gate: The Nergal Gate is located on the north side of [[Nineveh]], an ancient Mesopotamian city located in present-day Mosul. The gate was built sometime between 704 and 690 BC, which was a time of expansion for Nineveh under the ruler [[Sennacherib]]. The gate is related to the ancient Mesopotamian god [[Nergal]], who was associated with the summer solstice, war, destruction, and the netherworld.   
*Lamassu: At the Nergal Gate's entrance, and just within the entrance, stand the [[lamassu]]. These mythological figures first began appearing in art and architecture during the first half of the second millennium B.C., and are described as large winged human-headed bulls. Aside from being decoration, the lamassu are protective figures, more specifically described as "a benevolent spirit attached to an individual, group, a place or an entrance." The lamassu erected at the entrance of the Nergal Gate at Nineveh are surrounded by relief sculpture that depicts the stages of transport of the human-headed bulls from quarries in Balatai.&lt;ref&gt;[Danrey, V. (2004). Winged Human-Headed Bulls of Ninevah: Genesis of an Iconographic Motif. Papers of the 49th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale. Vol. 66, Ninevah.]&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 13 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + -Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's) &amp; Full Projection.2.JPG|thumb|Lamassu and Balawat Gate in the British Museum]]

Before the release of the ISIL video on February 26, 2015, the lamassu were in various states of preservation. Of the two figures at the entrance of the gate, one still had its upper portion preserved. The video shows an ISIL member jackhammering face of the lamassu at the right side of the gate. The left one was probably untouched, as it has been missing its upper portion since the late 19th century. The ones located inside the gates were less well-preserved than their counterparts at the entrance. However, both were seen being damaged by jackhammers and sledgehammers. The Assyrian section within the Mosul Museum also holds other lamassu of an earlier style. These may also have become damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Balawat Gates====
The Mosul Museum holds in its collection numerous bronze bands of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). The bands are decorated with scenes of Assyrian war, hunt, and tribute.&lt;ref&gt;[J.E. Curtis &amp; N. Tallis. (2009). The Balawat gates of Ashurnasirpal II. In ''Journal of the American Oriental Society''. American Oriental Society. Vol. 129, No. 3. pp. 552-554.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Balawat Gates are of archaeological and historical significance because they are considered a "'major' find from a 'minor'" site.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt; Tell-Balawat, the site from which the Balawat Gates originate, was considered a small site in comparison to the neighboring Assyrian sites of Nineveh and Nimrud. Through further research, Tell-Balawat (also known as the city of Igmur-Enlil), was found to be within a "hollow-way" between Nineveh and Nimrud, suggesting that its purpose included defending these two cities.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The displayed bands are shown on ISIL's video, but it is unknown whether they were destroyed at that time. Because the Mosul Museum was previously looted in 2003, some of the bands were already missing. Since the bands are considered portable, it is assumed that some were sold on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum holds a second pair of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Shalmaneser III. These are well documented, and can be used to aid in the identification of the Ashurnasirpal's bands if they arise.

====Hatrene statues====
Hatra was an ancient city located between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, to the south of present-day Mosul. Its significance is great, as its historical and archaeological record indicate it was a wealthy trading city, influenced heavily by its neighboring peoples and empires. Hatra's artworks are of interest to scholars because they have been analyzed as hybrids of artistic styles from the West and East of the city. For example, a Hatrene statue of a seated goddess is described as having drapery consistent with Buddhist style, while also having the large, protruding eyes typical of Mesopotamian works.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. Said (1972). Hatra, Iraq. In ''Archaeology''. Archaeological Institute of America. Vol. 25, No. 2. pp. 103-111.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hercules Hatra Iraq Parthian period 1st 2nd century CE.jpg|thumb|Hatrene statue of Hercules]]

The Mosul Museum was home to a variety of Hatra's sculptures. Most of the sculptures were images of Hatrene kings or noblemen. The ISIL video shows many of these sculptures being hit with sledgehammers and toppled to the ground. Of the 27 known Hatrene sculptures of kings, 4 were seen damaged in the ISIL video. This represents a 15% loss of these sculptures that are known to be in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-2-the-sculptures-from-hatra/ Assessing the Damange at the Mosul Museum, Part 2: The Sculptures from Hatra]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Questioned authenticity of damaged artifacts====
According to Iraqi archaeologists, some of the collection belonging to the Mosul Museum was moved to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad six months prior to the release of the ISIL video. This spared many priceless artifacts from becoming damaged. Additionally, sources have suggested that a portion of the artifacts shown being damaged in the video were in fact reproductions or reconstructions. However, Iraqi archaeologists state this may not be the case entirely. Some artworks known to have been genuine were not shown in the video, leading archaeologists to believe that the portable objects were looted, while larger, non-portable objects were the only ones to be damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/full-story-isil-takeover-mosul-museum-150309053022129.html/ The full story behind ISIL's takeover of Mosul Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===

The 2003 looting of the National Museum of Iraq showed the cultural heritage community the extreme importance of documentation within a museum or archaeological setting. The National Museum of Iraq lacked a complete inventory, which includes photographs of all objects. The problem became exacerbated when salvaged archaeological materials came into the museum in the late 1990s until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The influx of artifacts made it very difficult for the staff to keep up with its documentation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajaonline.org/online-review-museum/364 Learning from the Iraq Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://professorhistoryx.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/what-isis-destroys-why-and-why-we-must-document-it-hyperallergic/ What ISIS Destroys, Why, and Why We Must Document It]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mosul Museum may be in this same situation, though information on its documentation processes has not come to light. If photographs of their artifacts are in existence, they will be useful in identifying and recovering the looted artifacts.

'''''Diana''''' &amp;ndash; also known as '''''Diana of the Tower''''' &amp;ndash; is an [[Cultural icon|iconic]] statue by sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]].  Once a famous New York City landmark, the second version stood atop the tower of [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] from 1893 to 1925. Since 1932, it has been in the collection of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

The statue represents the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].

==First version (1891-1892)==
''Diana'' was commissioned by architect [[Stanford White]] as a [[weather vane]] for the tower of Madison Square Garden, a theater-and-dining complex at [[26th Street (Manhattan)|26th Street]] and [[Madison Avenue]] in Manhattan. He talked his friend Saint-Gaudens into creating it at no charge, and picked up the cost of materials.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"The Architect of Desire: Beauty and Danger in the Stanford White Family," Suzanna Lessard&lt;/ref&gt; Model Julia "Dudie" Baird posed for the body of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgnhs.org/Augustus%20SGaudens%20CD-HTML/Models/Dudie.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Its face is that of Davida Johnson Clark, Saint-Gaudens's long-time model and mother of his illegitimate son Louis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/17571 Davida Johnson Clark], from Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first version &amp;ndash; built by the [[W. H. Mullins Manufacturing Company]] in [[Salem, Ohio]] &amp;ndash; was {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and weighed {{convert|1800|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgnhs.org/Augustus%20SGaudens%20CD-HTML/Monuments/Ideal/Diana1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Gaudens's design specified that the figure appear to delicately balance on its left toe atop a ball. However, the Ohio metal shop was unable to pass the rotating rod through the toe, so the design was altered and the figure instead was poised (less-gracefully) on its heel.

''Diana'' was unveiled atop Madison Square Garden's tower on September 29, 1891. The 304-foot (92.66 m) building had been completed a year earlier, and was the second-tallest in New York City. But the addition of the statue made it the city's tallest, by 13 feet (3.96 m).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JVzYO1TyZ6AC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=madison+square+garden+tower+height&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yk6wC1Fcyd&amp;sig=mHLM8zLgVHCygH_8JP3I35PvQak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBmoVChMIy-ydxsf5yAIVCmg-Ch26cwHp#v=onepage&amp;q=madison%20square%20garden%20tower%20height&amp;f=false Joseph J. Korum, ''The American Skyscraper, 1850&amp;ndash;1940'' (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; The figure's billowing copper [[foulard]] (scarf) was intended to catch the wind, but the statue did not rotate smoothly because of its weight. ''Diana''{{'}}s nudity offended [[morality|moral crusader]] [[Anthony Comstock]] and his [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s9l5TIzarCUC&amp;pg=PT61&amp;dq=american+eve+the+statue&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iYm5TtDtMaOQsALkvejZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=American Eve: Evelyn Nesbit, Stanford White, the Birth of the "It" Girl, and the Crime of the Century | author= Paula Uruburu| publisher= Penguin| year= 2009| isbn= 978-1-59448-369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To placate Comstock and to increase the likelihood of its catching the wind, Saint-Gaudens draped the figure in cloth, but the cloth blew away.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project. ''New York City Guide''. New York: Random House, 1939 {{ISBN|0-403-02921-X}} (Reprinted by Scholarly Press, 1976; often referred to as WPA Guide to New York City), pp.330–333&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Soon after installation, both White and Saint-Gaudens concluded that the figure was too large for the building, and decided to create a smaller, lighter replacement. Following less than a year atop the tower, the statue was removed and shipped to Chicago to be exhibited at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. New Yorker W. T. Henderson wrote a [[tongue-in-cheek]] poetic tribute &amp;ndash; "Diana Off the Tower" &amp;ndash; a play on both the statue's name and situation.&lt;ref&gt;W. T. Henderson, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/09/18/106890362.pdf "Diana Off the Tower" (PDF),] ''The New York Times'', September 18, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint-Gaudens served as head of the Chicago exposition's sculpture committee. His initial plan had been to place ''Diana'' atop the Women's Pavilion, but the city's [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] protested and insisted that the controversial nude figure be clothed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Instead, it was placed atop the Agricultural Building.

The original ''Diana'' does not survive. In June 1894, eight months after the exposition's closing, a major fire tore through its buildings. The lower half of the statue was destroyed; the upper half survived the fire, but was later lost or discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jssgallery.org/other_artists/augustus_saint-gaudens/diana_of_the_tower.html|title=Augustus Saint-Gaudens' Diana of the Tower|first=|last=Natasha|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second version (1893-present)==
[[File:Madison Square Garden Diana.jpg|thumb|right|Second version of ''Diana'' with her copper foulard.]]
''Diana'' was completely redesigned by Saint-Gaudens &amp;ndash; with a more elegant pose, a different thrust to the body, a thinner figure, smaller breasts and a more graceful angle to the leg.  To better fit the proportions of Madison Square Garden's tower, the statue's height was scaled down to 14.5 feet (4.4 m).&lt;ref&gt;The Philadelphia Museum of Art's website lists the height of the figure as 13 ft 1 in (398.8 cm), and the height of the ball as 17 in (43 cm).[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/44513.html?mulR=241195760|1]&lt;/ref&gt; The second version was made of hollowed copper, and weighed 700&amp;nbsp;lb (318&amp;nbsp;kg) &amp;ndash; more than 60% less than the first version &amp;ndash; light enough to rotate with the wind. As Saint-Gaudens originally envisioned, the figure was balanced on its left toe atop a ball. The statue was hoisted to the top of the tower on November 18, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/11/18/109733483.pdf| title=New Diana of the Tower| work=The New York Times| date=November 18, 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the day, the gilded figure caught the sun and could be seen from all over the city and as far away as New Jersey.  Electric lights, then a novelty, illuminated it at night; it was the first statue in history to be lit by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgnhs.org/Augustus%20SGaudens%20CD-HTML/Monuments/Ideal/Diana2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison Square Garden was slated to be demolished in 1925, to make way for construction of the [[New York Life Building]]. Prior to the building's demolition, ''Diana'' was removed and put in storage. The intention was for the statue to remain in New York City, however a seven year search to find a place to display it proved futile.  In 1932, the [[New York Life Insurance Company]] presented ''Diana'' to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] as a gift. It remains there today, displayed on the balcony of the museum's Great Stair Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/44513.html?mulR=967189961|8 Object record] in the Philadelphia Museum of Art's online collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
[[File:Diana of the Tower Philadelphia Museum of Art cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Second version of ''Diana'' (restored, 2013-14), Philadelphia Museum of Art.]]
When ''Diana'' was removed from Madison Square Garden in 1925, much of its gilded exterior was gone, having eroded away over three decades of exposure to the elements. The Philadelphia Museum of Art cleaned and repaired the statue in 1932, but the gold leaf was not replaced.

In 2013, scaffolding was constructed around the statue in the museum's Great Stair Hall for a year-long restoration.  Conservators carefully cleaned its copper surface with chemicals and steam, removing nearly a century of dirt and grime.  Samples of the small patches of remaining gold leaf on the statue were taken in an effort to match the carat, weight and color with its replacement.  The statue's surface was then repaired and regilded with 180 square feet of gold leaf.  Because it was known from contemporary sources that Saint-Gaudens did not like the look of bright gold at eye level, the conservators matted the gilding to reduce the glare and museum lighting designers adjusted the display lights for the interior display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/21.html|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Research  :  Conservation|first=Philadelphia Museum of|last=Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2014, the restored statue was unveiled and rededicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2687882/Philadelphia-museums-golden-goddess-glows-again.html#ixzz3mOfi0n9r|title=Philadelphia museum's golden goddess glows again|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural references===

In the popular 1975 novel ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'', author [[E.L. Doctorow]] suggests in a single line that showgirl [[Evelyn Nesbitt]] had posed for the second version of the ''Diana'' statue.  Having grown up poor in the streets of a Pennsylvania coal town, Nesbitt had risen up to become “the Gaudens statue Stanny White had put at the top of the tower of Madison Square Garden, a glorious bronze nude Diana, her bow drawn, her face in the skies.”

The 1981 film version of [[Ragtime (film)|''Ragtime'']] expanded upon this incident as the cause of a major conflict between Stanford White and Nesbitt's millionaire husband [[Harry K. Thaw]].  In the film, Thaw demands that the statue be taken down from the top of the Garden as it is an embarrassment to him.  The character is seen glaring angrily at the statue before shooting White to death at the Rooftop Theatre at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] on June 25, 1906.

Both situations are completely fictional.  The second version of ''Diana'' was placed atop the tower in 1893, when Nesbitt was only about nine years old, and eight years before she was introduced to White.

===Half-sized statues===
[[File:Swanson4715.jpg|thumb|Half-sized ''Diana'' (1928), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]
[[Stanford White]] was so pleased with the 1893 second version that he asked Saint-Gaudens to create a half-sized copy in cement. This was installed in 1894 in the garden of White's Long Island estate, [[Box Hill Estate|Box Hill]], where it stood for many years. For the half-sized copy, Saint-Gaudens poised the figure on a half-ball. White's cement statue later was used to produce two bronze casts in 1928, and six bronze casts in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Dryfhout, ''The Works of Augustus Saint-Gaudens'' (UPNE, 2008), cat. 154, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The cement statue is now in the collection of the [[Amon Carter Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/33417 Diana], from Princeton University Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] owns a bronze statuette of Saint-Gaudens's first version of ''Diana''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=14467JO08361U.605&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!293600~!11&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Saint-Gaudens&amp;index=.AW&amp;uindex=&amp;oper=&amp;term=Diana&amp;index=.TW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1 ''Diana'' (first version)], from SIRIS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalizing on the popularity of the second version, Saint-Gaudens modeled statuettes in two sizes: 31 inches (78&amp;nbsp;cm), with the figure poised on a half-ball, and 21 inches (53&amp;nbsp;cm), with the figure poised on a full ball. These were cast in bronze beginning in 1899, and vary in the configuration of bow, arrow, string, hair, patination, and base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1985.353|title=Diana - Augustus Saint-Gaudens - 1985.353 - Work of Art - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dribbble''' is an [[community|online community]] for showcasing user-made [[Work of art|artwork]]. It functions as a [[Promotion (marketing)|self-promotion]] and [[Business networking|networking]] platform for [[graphic design]], [[web design]], [[illustration]], [[photography]], and other creative areas. It was founded in 2009 by [[Dan Cederholm]] and [[Rich Thornett]], becoming publicly available in 2010. It is one of the largest platforms for designers to share their work online&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dribbble.com/stories/2017/01/23/2016-year-in-review|title=2016 Year in Review|work=Dribbble|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; competing directly with [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]-owned [[Behance]] — the latter being the largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2013/05/07/adobes-behance-the-creative-graph-lets-your-work-do-the-networking/|title=Adobe's Behance: The Creative Graph Lets Your Work Do The Networking|last=Kosner|first=Anthony Wing|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is fully remote with no central headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.getflow.com/blog/project-management-at-dribbble|title=How Dribbble’s 23 Remote Employees Keep Half a Million Designers…|last=|first=|date=2018-06-27|website=Flow|language=en-us|others=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dribbble became a part of Tiny, a family of internet startup companies, in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dribbble.com/stories/2017/01/17/transition-game|title=Transition Game|work=Dribbble|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@awilkinson/dribbble-2-0-c2cd1fa184c5|title=Dribbble 2.0|last=Wilkinson|first=Andrew|date=2017-01-17|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership and Controversy==
Dribbble has an [[Invitation system|invite-only]] membership system, where a number of invitations are handed out to artists and designers to freely distribute them amongst their peers. There is also a Pro subscription service with added features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dribbble.com/pro|title=Dribbble - Show and tell for designers|author=|date=|work=dribbble.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been discussions around their invite-only membership system, which has caused some controversy. The system has been used as a way to control the growth of the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/05/interview-with-dribbbles-founder-dan-cederholm/|title=Interview with Dribbble's co-founder Dan Cederholm|last=|first=|date=2011-05-24|work=Webdesigner Depot|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon joining the website the user is first listed as a ''Prospect'', only being able to effectively post work once they get an invitation from another user.

'''''Driving Miss Daisy''''' is a filmed performance of the 2013 [[Australia]]n [[theatrical production]] of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|play of the same name]] by [[Alfred Uhry]] starring [[Angela Lansbury]], [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Boyd Gaines]] which was produced as a 2014 film by Broadway Near You (United States) in association with [[Umbrella Entertainment]] (Australia).

==Synopsis==
Miss Daisy Werthan ([[Angela Lansbury]]) is a widowed, 72-year-old Jewish woman living in mid-century [[Atlanta]] who is deemed too old to drive by her son Boolie ([[Boyd Gaines]]). He then hires Hoke, an African-American man ([[James Earl Jones]]) to serve as her chauffeur, and what begins as a troubled and hostile pairing soon blossoms into a profound, life-altering friendship that transcends all the societal boundaries placed between them.

==Cast==

*[[James Earl Jones]] as Hoke

==Production background==
The Australian tour of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Driving Miss Daisy'' performed to sold-out audiences in [[Brisbane]], [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth]] from February 9 to June 16, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/stage-version-of-driving-miss-daisy-starring-angela-lansbury-and-james-earl-214126# "Stage Version of Driving Miss Daisy, Starring Angela Lansbury and James Earl Jones, Filmed for Distribution"] Playbill, January 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; James Earl Jones and Boyd Gaines, who originally starred in the play's [[Driving Miss Daisy (play)#Broadway .282010.E2.80.932011.29|2010 Broadway revival]] and subsequent [[Driving Miss Daisy (play)#West End revival .282011.29|2011 West End transfer]] (opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]]), both reprised their Broadway roles for the Australian tour.

The '''''Ethiopic Collectio Monastica''''' is a book that includes some original sayings of the [[Desert Fathers]], and which is textually independent of the more well known ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' (''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''). It was first published by Victor Arras in 1963, based on two separate manuscripts that were likely based on Greek or Coptic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arras|first=Victor|title=Collectio monastica: Ethiopic text|year=1963|publisher=Secrétariat du CorpusSCO|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Collectio_monastica.html?id=D_A2cgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmless2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harmless, William  |year=2000 |title=Remembering Poemen Remembering: The Desert Fathers and the Spirituality of Memory |journal=Church History |publisher=American Society of Church History |volume=15 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66380509.html}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection consists of sixty-eight chapter of widely different lengths. Included in the book are collections of Desert Father sayings, most of which have no parallel in the ''Apophthegmata Patrum''. The original work appears to have been written by a 5th-century monk who either lived with the Desert Fathers at [[Scetis]], or knew the monks who lived there. He also appears to have known [[Abba Poemen]], because of several unique stories and sayings attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Harmless2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harmless, William |title=Desert Christians: an introduction to the literature of early monasticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=Appendix 8.5|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004|isbn=0-19-516222-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIM0pWejvBgC&amp;pg=PT504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Etruscan architecture''' was created between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of [[ancient Rome]] finally absorbed [[Etruscan civilization]]. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood and other materials of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources we have a good deal of information on what once existed.

From about 630 BC, Etruscan architecture was heavily influenced by [[Greek architecture]], which was itself developing through the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 34; see Izzet, 20–21 for a discussion of Etruscan cultural importing in general&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn it influenced [[Roman architecture]], which in its early centuries can be considered as just a regional variation of Etruscan architecture.  But increasingly, from about 200 BC, the Romans looked directly to Greece for their styling, while sometimes retaining Etruscan shapes and purposes in their buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 220, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

The main monumental forms of Etruscan architecture, listed in decreasing order of the surviving remains, were: the houses of the wealthy elite, the mysterious "monumental complexes", temples, city walls, and rock-cut tombs.  Apart from the podia of temples and some house foundations, only the walls and rock-cut tombs were mainly in stone, and have therefore often largely survived.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples==
The early Etruscans seem to have worshipped in open air enclosures, marked off but not built over; sacrifices continued to be performed outside rather than inside temples in traditional [[Roman religion]] until its end. It was only around 600 BC, at the height of their civilization, that they began to create monumental temples, undoubtedly influenced by the Greeks&lt;ref&gt;Taylor&lt;/ref&gt;  That these buildings developed essentially from the largest types of Etruscan house has been both asserted and challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, only the [[podium]] or base platform used stone, with the upper parts of wood and mud-brick, greatly reducing what survives for archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 48; Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is evidence for the portico columns sometimes using stone, as at [[Veii]].&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 31–32; Boethius, 59&lt;/ref&gt;  This has left much about Etruscan temples uncertain. The only written account of significance on their architecture is by [[Vitruvius]] (died after 15 BC), writing some two centuries after the Etruscan civilization was absorbed by Rome. He describes how to plan a "Tuscan temple" that appears to be a Roman "Etruscan-style" ("tuscanicae dispositiones") temple of a type perhaps still sometimes built in his own day, rather than a really historically-minded attempt to describe original Etruscan buildings, though he may well have seen examples of these.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani; Boethius, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of his description fit what archaeologists can demonstrate, but others do not. It is in any case clear that Etruscan temples could take a number of forms, and also varied over the 400-year period during which they were being made.&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Vitruvius remains the inevitable starting point for a description, and a contrast of Etruscan temples with their [[Greek temple|Greek]] and [[Roman temple|Roman]] equivalents.  There are also a few model temples in pottery, and depictions on tombs or vases.  Remains of the architectural terracotta elements sometimes survive in considerable quantities, and museums, mostly in Italy, have good collections of attractively shaped and painted [[antefix]]es in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitruvius specifies three doors and three [[cella]]e, one for each of the main Etruscan deities, but archaeological remains do not suggest this was normal, though it is found.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman sources were in the habit of ascribing to the Etruscans a taste for triads in things such as city planning (with three gates to cities, for example), in ways that do not seem to reflect reality.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 35&lt;/ref&gt;  The orientation of the temple is not consistent, and may have been determined by a priest watching the flight of birds at the time of foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Museo archeologico di Firenze, frontone di Talamone 1.JPG|thumb|left|380px|Late terracotta pediment (part-reconstructed) from [[Talamone]]]]
The exteriors of both Greek and Roman temples were originally highly decorated and colourful, especially in the [[entablature]] and roofs, and this was if anything even more true of Etruscan temples. When wood was used for columns, the bases and capitals were often encased in painted terracotta.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 59&lt;/ref&gt; All the edges of the roof were decorated, mostly in brightly painted terracotta, and there seem often to have been a row of sculptures along the central ridge of the roof, going beyond the [[acroterion]] group above a [[pediment]] in Greek and Roman temples. The [[Apollo of Veii]] was part of an acroterion group.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 59–63; Boardman, 255&lt;/ref&gt;  Substantial but broken remains of late sculptured pediment groups survive in museums, in fact rather more than from Greek or Roman temples, partly because the terracotta was not capable of "recycling" as [[marble]] was.  The groups from [[Luna (Etruria)|Luni]] and [[Talamone]] (both now in [[Florence]]) are among the most impressive.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani; Banti, 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Features shared by typical Etruscan and Roman temples, and contrasting with Greek ones, begin with a strongly frontal approach, with great emphasis on the front facade, less on the sides, and very little on the back. The podia are also usually higher, and can only be entered at a section of the front, just presenting a blank platform wall elsewhere.  There may only be columns at the front portico.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;  In Etruscan temples, more than Roman ones, the portico is deep, often representing, as Vitruvius recommends, half of the area under the roof, with multiple rows of columns.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;

At least in later temples, versions of Greek [[Aeolic order|Aeolic]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]] and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals are found, as well as the main [[Tuscan order]], a simpler version of the [[Doric order|Doric]], but the attention to the full Greek detailing in the entablature that the Romans pursued seems to have been lacking.  Fluted Tuscan/Doric columns can also be found, against Greek and later Roman conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 49–54&lt;/ref&gt;

Etruscan architecture shared with [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]] the use of large [[cavetto]] mouldings as a [[cornice]], though not on the same massive scale.  The cavetto took the place of the Greek [[cymatium]] in many temples, often painted with vertical "tongue" patterns (as in the reconstructed Etruscan temple at [[Villa Giulia]], illustrated above), and combined with the distinctive "Etruscan round moulding", often painted with scales.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, 61-67; [[:File:Villa Giulia ricostruzione del tempio etrusco 01.JPG|Another view of the reconstructed Etruscan temple]] at [[Villa Giulia]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus===
[[File:TempleofCapitoliumRome.jpg|thumb|Speculative model of the first [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] in Rome]]
The first building of the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]] was the oldest large temple in Rome, dedicated to the [[Capitoline Triad]] consisting of Jupiter and his companion deities, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]], and had a cathedral-like position in the official religion of Rome. Its first version was traditionally dedicated in 509 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.8&lt;/ref&gt; but in 83 BC it was destroyed by fire, and the rebuilt Greek-style temple completed in 69 BC (there were to be two more fires and new buildings).  For the first temple Etruscan specialists were brought in for various aspects of the building, including making and painting the extensive terracotta elements of the [[entablature]] or upper parts, such as [[antefix]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Stamper, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;  But for the second building they were summoned from Greece.

The first version is the largest Etruscan temple recorded,&lt;ref&gt;Christofani; Boethius, 47&lt;/ref&gt; and much larger than other Roman temples for centuries after.  However, its size remains heavily disputed by specialists; based on an ancient visitor it has been claimed to have been almost {{convert|60|×|60|m|abbr=on}}, not far short of the largest Greek temples.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever its size, its influence on other early Roman temples was significant and long-lasting.&lt;ref&gt;Stamper, 33 and all Chapters 1 and 2.  Stamper is a leading protagonist of a smaller size, rejecting the larger size proposed by the late [[Einar Gjerstad]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Reconstructions usually show very wide eaves, and a wide colonnade stretching down the sides, though not round the back wall as it would have done in a Greek temple.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;  A crude image on a coin of 78 BC shows only four columns, and a very busy roofline.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Tempel Jupiter Optimus.JPG|Denarius of 78 BC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monumental complexes==
[[File:Terracotta architectural details Acquarossa.jpg|thumb|Frieze from [[Acquarossa, Italy|Acquarossa]] (Zone F)]]
"Monumental complex" or building is a term used for a few large sets of buildings relatively recently uncovered by archaeology, the term reflecting a lack of certainty over their function. The two leading examples are "[[Poggio Civitate#The large Archaic building|the Archaic building]]" at [[Poggio Civitate]] and another at [[Acquarossa, Italy|Acquarossa]] (Zone F); both are 6th-century or earlier.  Both have sets of buildings round a courtyard, which use stone, at least in the foundations, roof tiles, and elaborate decorations in architectural terracotta.  Their size is exceptional for their early date. One obvious possible function is as palatial dwellings; another is as civic buildings, acting as places for assembly, and commemoration of aspects of the community.  Only the stone foundations and ceramic fragments remain for excavations to discover.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Houses==
It seems clear from the richer tombs that the Etruscan elite lived in fairly spacious comfort, but there is little evidence as to what their homes looked like, although some furniture is shown in tomb frescos.  The rock-cut tomb chambers often form suites of "rooms", some quite large, which presumably resemble in part the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] homes of the better-off Etruscans.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 75–89; Banti, 27–28; Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;   Unlike several of the necropoli, Etruscan cities have generally been built over from the Romans onwards, and houses have left little trace. Where remains survive, there are tightly-packed tufa bases, with perhaps mud-brick above, but in some places the lower parts of tufa walls survive even in small houses.  One complete set of foundations shows a house 7.9m by 3.9m (25 x 13 feet).&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 75–77&lt;/ref&gt;  At large farms, mines, quarries and perhaps other sites employing many people (many or mostly slaves), workers lived in dormitories.
[[File:Maquettes of houses from c 1000 BC.jpg|thumb|left|Selection of hut urns]]

A form of models of houses in pottery, and sometimes bronze, called "hut urns" gives us some indications.  These were apparently used to hold cremated ashes, and are found in the preceding [[Villanovan culture]] and early Etruscan burials, especially in northern areas.&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 25; Boethius, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;  The hut urns show a conventional model with a single interior space.  They are usually round or slightly oval, often with prominent wooden beams laid in two rows on the sloping roof, which cross at the central ridge and project some way in "V"s into the air; these projections seem to have been sometimes carved or otherwise decorated.  The urns always have a large square-ish door for access, sometimes two, and the outline of windows in the walls may be indicated by ridges or marks in the clay.  There is very often a window and exit for smoke, above the door in the roof, and at the opposite end.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Such houses were made of earth and organic materials, using mud brick and [[daub and wattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone [[hearth]]s and perhaps stone rings at the base are found.  Even the well-off seem rarely to have lived in stone houses, and rock-cut tomb chambers often represent wooden ceilings in stone.  The "Tomb of the Reliefs" at Banditaccia suggests that possessions such as tools and weapons were often hung from the walls for storage.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome, the [[Casa Romuli]] ("House of [[Romulus]]") was long preserved, and when necessary rebuilt as before.  It was a hut made of wood posts and roof beams, [[wattle and daub]] walls and a [[thatch]]ed roof,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 74&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly typical of ordinary Etruscan housing outside crowded city centres.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani&lt;/ref&gt;  The site cannot be identified with certainty, but at one candidate location circle of six [[post-hole]]s plus a central one have been found, cut into the tufa bedrock, with an ovoid 4.9m x 3.6m perimeter.

==Tombs and tumuli==
[[File:Banditaccia Tomba Dei Capitelli.jpg|thumb|[[Banditaccia]] necropolis, Tomb of the Capitelli]]
Rich Etruscans left elaborate tombs, mostly gathered in large [[necropoli]] some way outside their cities.  These were generously filled with [[grave goods]],&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 20–21, 26, 28&lt;/ref&gt;  especially ceramics, which give us most of our understanding of Etruscan culture.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 16&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, in the tufa regions of southern Etruria, the burial chamber was cut from solid rock below ground, which is relatively easy with this rock, but there was a structure above, often rather large. In other regions they are normally built up above ground.&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 21&lt;/ref&gt;  They were reused for further burials in the same family over several generations, and would often have become very crowded with sarchophagi and grave-goods, though the known survivals have now been emptied, either by looters or archaeologists.

Some tombs are stone buildings, often in rows, rather like small houses. Others are round [[tumuli]] with stone retaining walls, with steps down to rock-cut chambers below. Both types are found closely packed together in necropoli like [[Banditaccia]] and [[Monterozzi necropolis|Monterozzi]], the latter containing some 6,000 burials. Several different types of tombs have been identified, reflecting a development through time as well as differences in income.  Some types clearly replicate aspects of the richer houses, with a number of connected chambers, columns with capitals, and rock-cut ceilings given beams.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani; Izzet, 16–17, cautions against transferring such details automatically&lt;/ref&gt;  Many tombs had [[fresco]] paintings, which does not seem to have been a Greek influence (though the style of the paintings are certainly based on Greek art), as the Greeks had ceased to use [[chamber tomb]]s well before the Etruscans started to paint theirs in about 600; the Egyptians had also ceased painting tombs by then.&lt;ref&gt;Banti, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walls and fortifications==
[[File:Orbetello12.jpg|thumb|Wall at Orbetello]]
Etruscan cities, which often sat on hill-tops, became walled from about the 8th century, first in mud-brick, then often in stone.  Even before the Romans began to swallow up Etruscan territory, Italy had frequent wars, and by the later period had [[Celts|Celtic]] enemies to the north, and an expanding Rome to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; There was an [[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]] or rampart and a ''fossa'' or ditch in front of the wall.  The towns had a number of gates where roads entered, which were sometimes given arched gateways.  The best survivor of these is the 2nd-century Porta Marzia at [[Perugia]] (illustrated above) from the end of the period. Here, as in many cases, surviving work comes from the period just around the Roman takeover, but appears to represent Etruscan traditions.  By the 4th century, [[Volterra]] had two walls, the second enclosing the whole city.&lt;ref&gt;Christofani; Boethius, 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;

The stonework is often of fine quality, sometimes using regular rectangular blocks in a rough [[ashlar]], and sometimes "cyclopeian", using large polygonal blocks, partly shaped to fit each other, somewhat in the manner of the well-known [[Inca architecture|Inca masonry]], though not reaching that level of quality.  Gaps are left, which are filled in with much smaller stones.&lt;ref&gt;Boëthius et al, 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Polygonal masonry wall of Rusellae.JPG|Polygonal masonry wall at [[Rusellae]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Road network==
[[File:Una via cava.JPG|thumb|240px|Sunken road or [[via cava]]]]
Several important and unimportant [[Roman road]]s, such as the [[Via Cassia]], overlie Etruscan precursors, but there are sufficient Etruscan sites that were neglected after their conquest to allow an understanding of the considerable Etruscan road system. Roads did not just run between cities, but out into the countryside to allow agricultural produce to be easily brought in.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 193–195&lt;/ref&gt;  While not as heavily engineered as Roman roads, considerable efforts went into creating a road surface that on major routes could be as wide as 10.4 metres, on a 12 kilometre stretch connecting [[Cerveteri]] with its port [[Pyrgi]], made in the 5th century.  This had a gravel surface, between tufo edging-blocks, and a central drainage channel.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 193&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vie Cave]], narrow cuttings often running deeply through hills, are probably little changed since Etruscan times.  As well as connecting sites, these may have had a defensive function in times of war.  Their construction may have mainly resulted from the wearing through soft tufo bedrock by iron-rimmed wheels, creating deep ruts that required the road to be frequently recut to a smooth surface.  Their dating can only be deduced by that of settlements they pass between, and objects from tombs beside them.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  The 7th and 6th centuries show a move to replace earlier tracks only suitable for mules and pedestrians with wider and more engineered roads capable of taking wheeled vehicles, using gentler but longer routes through hilly country.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridges were common, though fords more so where these would suffice.  Presumably many were in timber, but some at least used stone underneath a timber roadway.&lt;ref&gt;Izzet, 195&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greenwich Dance''' is a [[dance]] organisation based in [[Greenwich]], [[London]]. Founded in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://londondance.com/articles/features/greenwich-dance-agency-the-first-10-years/|title=Greenwich Dance Agency - the first 10 years - LondonDance|work=LondonDance|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Greenwich Dance operates from The Borough Hall, the former [[Seat of local government|town hall]] of the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://manchesterhistory.net/architecture/1930/greenwichTH.html|title=Greenwich Town Hall (former), London|website=manchesterhistory.net|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Greenwich Dance is a [[registered charity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1029506&amp;subid=0|title=Charity Details|website=beta.charitycommission.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and receives regular funding from [[Arts Council England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/our-investment-2015-18/national-portfolio-organisations|title=National Portfolio Organisations {{!}} Arts Council England|website=www.artscouncil.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Royal Borough of Greenwich.

Greenwich Dance is based in The Borough Hall, a historic Art Deco building in the heart of West Greenwich.

== Historic usage of The Borough Hall ==
The Borough Hall was designed by [[architect]] Clifford Culpin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1213855|title=THE BOROUGH HALL AND MERIDIAN HOUSE (FORMER GREENWICH TOWN HALL), Greenwich - 1213855{{!}} Historic England|last=England|first=Historic|website=historicengland.org.uk|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and built in 1938-1939, and acted as the town hall for the [[Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich]] until a local authority merger in 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-05-18|title=Royal Borough of Greenwich|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Royal_Borough_of_Greenwich&amp;oldid=780923200|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in the relocation of the Borough's town hall to Woolwich. The building was split into two in 1972-1974&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://manchesterhistory.net/architecture/1930/greenwichTH.html|title=Greenwich Town Hall (former), London|website=manchesterhistory.net|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with [[Greenwich School of Management]] operating out of offices now named Meridian House.  

The Borough Hall remained vacant until 1993 when Greenwich Dance began to operate from the venue. The building is [[Grade I and II* listed buildings in Greenwich|Grade-II* listed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1213855|title=THE BOROUGH HALL AND MERIDIAN HOUSE (FORMER GREENWICH TOWN HALL), Greenwich - 1213855{{!}} Historic England|last=England|first=Historic|website=historicengland.org.uk|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The band [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] performed their first gig at The Borough Hall in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/squeeze-debut-gig|title=Squeeze debut gig|website=London Remembers|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[PRS for Music]] erected a [[blue plaque]] on the side of the building to commemorate the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prsformusic.com/press/2010/prs-for-music-honours-squeezes-first-gig|title=PRS for Music honours Squeeze's first gig|website=prsformusic.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1993 - present day ==
Since 1993, Greenwich Dance has operated the building on behalf of the owner, the Royal Borough of Greenwich. Nowadays the building hosts daily classes for professional dance artists, evening classes, events, performances and workshops.  

The Borough Hall today contains three functional dance studios - The Borough Hall, The Minor Hall, and Studio 3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rehearsalspacefinder.com/listing/greenwich-dance-the-borough-hall-royal-hill-se10-8re-the-borough-hall/|title=Greenwich Dance - The Borough Hall - Rehearsal Space Finder|work=Rehearsal Space Finder|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Borough Hall, the largest of the three, has a stage and an original 21m x 21m semi-sprung dance floor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rehearsalspacefinder.com/listing/greenwich-dance-the-borough-hall-royal-hill-se10-8re-the-borough-hall/|title=Greenwich Dance - The Borough Hall - Rehearsal Space Finder|work=Rehearsal Space Finder|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was originally constructed in the 1930s as a social dance floor. As part of the organisation's support for professional dance artists, rehearsal spaces are hired out at reduced rates for independent dance artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://londondance.com/directory/dance-resources/studio-space-space-xchange/greenwich-dance/|title=Greenwich Dance - LondonDance|work=LondonDance|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Borough Hall also houses the offices of other prominent local arts organisations, including [[Protein Dance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proteindance.co.uk/contact/|title=Protein Dance :: Contact|website=www.proteindance.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greenwich+Docklands International Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival.org/about/contact/|title=Contact us - Greenwich+Docklands International Festival|website=www.festival.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Each year, Greenwich Dance produce two festivals as part of the [[Royal Greenwich Festivals]] - Greenwich Dances&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/24545/greenwichs-series-summer-festivals-kicks-literary-family-fun/|title=Greenwich's series of summer festivals kicks of with literary and family fun|last=Little|first=Mandy|date=2017-05-22|work=London News Online|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greenwich World Cultural Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visitgreenwich.org.uk/events/greenwich-world-cultural-festival-2016/|title=Greenwich World Cultural Festival 2016|work=Visit Greenwich|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; (based at [[Eltham Palace]]). These are delivered on behalf of Royal Borough of Greenwich, the commissioners of Royal Greenwich Festivals. 

== Role as Big Dance Hub ==
Acknowledging its role as the dance provider for South East London, in 2010 [[Big Dance UK|Big Dance]] commissioned Greenwich Dance &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigdance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/big-dance_press-release_20012010-2-Copy.pdf|title=Big Dance 2010 press release|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to act as the Big Dance Hub for the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]], [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]], Greenwich and [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]].

'''Harrington College of Design''' (1931–2015) was a [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit college]] in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] area of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] that closed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrington students settle in at Columbia after college closing|url=http://www.columbiachronicle.com/campus/article_6229d152-93a8-11e5-a66c-9784cd6abc0b.html|website=The Columbia Chronicle|accessdate=2017-08-31|date=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offered students programs leading to either a [[Master's degree|master's]], [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], or [[associate's degree]] upon completion of the [[Interior Design]] Program, [[Digital Photography]] Program, or [[Communication Design]] Program. Each program was credentialed with multiple levels of accreditation. The school was owned by [[Career Education Corporation]].

==History==
The school traced its history to 1931 when [[Frances Harrington]], a practicing interior designer, traveled to Chicago to provide a series of lectures for interior design professionals. She soon found a growing interest in the study of interior design and expanded her offerings by creating the Harrington Institute of Interior Design.

As Harrington Institute grew, Ms. Harrington began providing diplomas to her qualified day division students. When she retired in 1959, her former student Robert Marks assumed leadership of the school. Marks added many programs and degree options to the school's curriculum. Changes in programs, which are now under the guidance of the school's professional Advisory Board, are driven by input from the design industry's professional organizations.&lt;ref name="OEDB"&gt;[http://oedb.org/campus/harrington-college-of-design ''Online Education Database''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118204857/http://oedb.org/campus/harrington-college-of-design |date=January 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Harrington Institute changed its name to Harrington College of Design after being purchased by Career Education Corporation, and proceeded to expand the school's design-related programs of study. The school moved to its current location at 200 W. Madison Street and mandated an annual 20% enrollment increase, which they were able to sustain for a few years until the economy faltered then crashed in 2008.  The campus at 200 W. Madison Street in Chicago closed at the end of the summer semester in August 2015.

'''''In Mourning and in Rage''''' was a work of [[performance art]] and activism by [[Suzanne Lacy]] and [[Leslie Labowitz-Starus|Leslie Labowitz]]. The performance took place in [[Los Angeles]], California in 1977 as a response to the rapes and murders covered by the media in the "[[Hillside Strangler]]" case.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Labowitz-Starus|first=Leslie|last2=Lacy|first2=Suzanne|date=1978-01-01|title="In Mourning and in Rage ..."|jstor=3345993|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=52–55|doi=10.2307/3345993}}&lt;/ref&gt;"As if the horror of these crimes wasn't enough, the press coverage of the events sensationalized the sexual nature of the crimes.  For feminist activists in Los Angeles involved in the movement to end violence against women, this analysis was unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moravec|first1=Michelle|title=In Mourning and In Rage|url=http://historyinthecity.blogspot.com/2011/09/in-mourning-and-in-rage.html|website=History of the City|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A continuation of ''Three Weeks in May,'' Lacy and Labowitz designed ''In Mourning and in Rage'' as a personal response to the sensationalized media coverage of violence against women as well as an expression of grief and rage towards the loss of life. The performance was a collaboration between Lacy, Labowitz, Bia Lowe, [[Holly Near]], City Councilwoman Pat Russel, the [[Woman's Building]], Women Against Violence Against Women, and Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. The event was staged for mass media coverage at the [[Los Angeles City Hall]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suzannelacy.com/in-mourning-and-in-rage-1977/|title=In Mourning and In Rage (1977)|website=SUZANNE LACY|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/women-art-and-society/oclc/930389708&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Women, art, and society|last=Chadwick|first=Whitney|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500204054|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance consisted of a large funeral motorcade of black-clad women lead by a hearse from the [[Woman's Building]] to the Los Angeles City Hall. Once there, nine seven-feet-tall women draped in black emerged from the hearse along with a women dressed in red. The mourners then climbed the steps of city hall where each of the nine women gave a statement into a microphone expressing their solidarity with the murdered women, emphasized by a chorus of "In memory of our sisters, we fight back!" from the rest of the motorcade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By making this performance public as well as highly crafted for media coverage, Lacy and Labowitz looked to highlight not only the deaths of the ten women killed by the [[Hillside Strangler]], but the significantly larger population of women victims whose stories went uncovered by mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801307168|title=Pacific standard time : Los Angeles art 1945-1980|last=Rebecca.|first=Peabody,|last2=Calif.)|first2=J.

The piece concluded with direct statements to the press explaining the rationale for the piece as well as a speech demanding resources for women's self defense. Singer-songwriter [[Holly Near]] performed her song "Fight Back"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Near|first1=Holly|title=Fight Back|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBE4Au5myko|website=Youtube|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written specifically for this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish|first1=Sharon|title=Suzanne Lacy: Spaces Between|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0fCKMCOdO0C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=fight+back+holly+near+composed+lacy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q4DGhJL3eI&amp;sig=kM9wgfqVxJWggucbF-__So5cXqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHro--i_zSAhXmsFQKHdNmDVsQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=fight%20back%20holly%20near%20composed%20lacy&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Univ Of Minnesota Press (February 12, 2010)|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
''In Mourning and in Rage'' was highly covered by the press and resulted in increased support from Los Angeles City Council members and a pledge from the Rape Hotline Alliance to provide self defense classes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To further the conversation about social action and art, Lacy and Labowitz produced a video documenting ''In Mourning and in Rage'' as well as a pamphlet entitled ''What is Social Art?.''

'''Jonathan David Anthony Bowden''' (12 April 1962 – 29 March 2012)&lt;ref&gt;[http://efp.org.uk/jonathan-bowden-1962-2012/ Jonathan Bowden 1962-2012]&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[Far-right politics in the United Kingdom|far-right]] writer and politician. 

==Early life and formal education==
Bowden was born in [[Kent]], [[England]], and attended [[Elvian School|Presentation College]] in Reading, Berkshire. His mother died when he was 16 years old. In 1984, he completed one year of a Bachelor of Arts history degree course at [[Birkbeck College]], [[London University]], as a mature student, but left without graduating. He subsequently enrolled at [[Wolfson College Cambridge|Wolfson College]], [[Cambridge University]], in autumn 1988, but left after a few months.

==Political career==
===Conservative Party===
He began his political career as a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the [[Bethnal Green and Stepney]] Constituency Association.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. In 1990, he joined the Conservative [[Monday Club]], and the following year made an unsuccessful bid to be elected onto its Executive Council. In 1991, he was appointed co-chairman with Stuart Millson of the club's media committee,&lt;ref&gt;''Monday Club News'', July 1991 edition, p.2. – Monday Club Executive Council Minutes, 13 May 1991. This position did not, however, afford Bowden a seat on the Council&lt;/ref&gt;  and was also active in the [[Western Goals (UK)|Western Goals Institute]].&lt;ref name="Interview with Bowden"&gt;[http://www.jonathanbowden.co.uk/interview.html Interview with Bowden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807084040/http://www.jonathanbowden.co.uk/interview.html |date= 7 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Bowden was expelled from the Monday Club.&lt;ref name="Gable"&gt;Sonia Gable and Adam Carter, [http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/new-right-chairman-dies "New Right chairman dies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121083653/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/new-right-chairman-dies |date=21 November 2015 }}, ''Searchlight'', 26 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary Conservative Caucus===
Bowden and Stuart Millson co-founded the [[Revolutionary Conservative Caucus]] in November 1992&lt;ref&gt;''The Revolutionary Conservative'', issue no.2, 1993, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of introducing "abstract thought into the nether reaches of the Conservative and Unionist party".&lt;ref name="Interview with Bowden"/&gt; The group published a quarterly journal entitled ''The Revolutionary Conservative Review''. By the end of 1994, Millson and Bowden parted company and the group dissolved.

In 1993, Bowden published the book ''Right'' through the European Books Society. He was also reported to be a prominent figure in the creative milieu responsible for the emergence of ''[[Right Now! (magazine)|Right Now!]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/othersrv/isar/archives2/genewar/ritenow.htm Right Now!]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom Party===
Bowden then joined the [[Freedom Party (UK)|Freedom Party]], for which he was treasurer for a short time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedompartyuk.net/public/partynews/index.html Freedom Party website]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in company with [[Adrian Davies (barrister)|Adrian Davies]] was a member of the Bloomsbury Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2005/uk.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221154441/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2005/uk.htm |archivedate=21 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British National Party===
In 2003, Bowden broke with attempts to influence [[Conservatism]] and moved into political activity by joining the [[British National Party]] (BNP), becoming a popular speaker. He was appointed Cultural Officer, a position its leader [[Nick Griffin]] created to give Bowden officer status within the organisation. However, in July 2007, Bowden resigned and left the BNP.

Although he resumed public speech-making at BNP organised meetings in the localities away from the party's national events, he never re-joined the party and cut all ties after the May 2010 general election.

===London Forum===

Bowden made speeches on many topics to The London Forum, a far-right discussion forum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jonathan+bowden YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creative works ==
Bowden was an artist whose works are collected in three book volumes.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[File:Keep-calm-and-carry-on-scan.jpg|thumb|The original 1939 ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' poster]]

'''''Keep Calm and Carry On''''' is a [[motivational poster]] produced by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] in 1939 in preparation for [[World War II]]. The poster was intended to raise the [[morale]] of the British public, threatened with widely predicted mass air attacks on major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Slocombe |title=British Posters of the Second World War |location=London |publisher=Imperial War Museum |year=2010 |isbn=9781904897927 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww2poster.co.uk/2009/04/1939-3-posters/ |title=1939: The Three Posters (PhD Extract) |first=Rebecca, PhD |last=Lewis |work=Keep Calm and Carry on and other Second World War Posters: British Home Front Propaganda Posters of the Second World War |date=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although 2.45&amp;nbsp;million copies were printed, and although [[the Blitz]] did in fact take place, the poster was hardly ever publicly displayed and was little known until a copy was rediscovered in 2000 at [[Barter Books]], a bookshop in [[Alnwick]]. It has since been re-issued by a number of private companies, and has been used as the decorative theme for a range of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7869458.stm|title=The Greatest Motivational Poster Ever?|work=''BBC News''|date= 4 February 2009|first=Stuart|last=Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evocative of the Victorian belief in British stoicism – the "[[stiff upper lip]]", self-discipline, fortitude, and remaining calm in adversity – the poster has become recognised around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keep calm and carry on … bidding for rare poster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/25/wartime-poster-secret-auction|work=The Guardian|date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that only two original copies survived until a collection of approximately 15 was brought in to the ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' in 2012 by the daughter of an ex-[[Royal Observer Corps]] member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2105518/Keep-calm-carry-Only-surviving-stash-original-iconic-poster-appears-Antiques-Roadshow.html|accessdate=13 May 2012|location=London|work=Daily Mail|first=Chris|last=Slack|title=Keep Calm and Carry On... to the bank: Original wartime poster shows up on Antiques Roadshow|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few further examples have come to light since.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' poster was designed by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] during the period of 27 June to 6 July 1939.&lt;ref name="irving"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://history.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/27/keep-calm-and-carry-on-the-compromise-behind-the-slogan/ |title=Keep Calm and Carry On – The Compromise Behind the Slogan |first=Henry |last=Irving |publisher= History of Government Blog |date= 27 June 2014 |accessdate= 27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced as part of a series of three "Home Publicity" posters (the others read "&lt;u&gt;Your&lt;/u&gt; ''Courage,'' &lt;u&gt;Your&lt;/u&gt; ''Cheerfulness,'' &lt;u&gt;Your&lt;/u&gt; ''Resolution Will Bring Us Victory''" and "''Freedom Is in Peril / Defend It With All Your Might''"). Each poster showed the slogan under a representation of a "[[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor Crown]]" (a symbol of the state). They were intended to be distributed to strengthen morale in the event of a wartime disaster, such as mass bombing of major cities using high explosives and poison gas, which was widely expected within hours of an outbreak of war.&lt;ref name="PhD"/&gt;

A career civil servant named A. P. Waterfield came up with "Your Courage" as "a rallying war-cry that will bring out the best in everyone of us and put us in an offensive mood at once".&lt;ref name="PhD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 45–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Others involved in the planning of the early posters included: [[John Hilton (industrial relations)|John Hilton]], [[Montague Burton Professor of Industrial Relations|Professor of Industrial Relations]] at [[Cambridge University]], responsible overall as Director of Home Publicity; William Surrey Dane, managing director at [[Odhams Press]]; [[Gervas Huxley]], former head of publicity for the [[Empire Marketing Board]]; William Codling, controller of [[HMSO]]; [[Harold Nicolson]], MP; W. G. V. Vaughan, who became Director of the General Production Division (GPD); H. V. Rhodes, who later wrote an occasional paper on setting up a new government department; [[Ivison Macadam]]; "Mr Cruthley"; and "Mr Francis". [[Ernest Wallcousins]] was the artist tasked with creating the poster designs.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 42, 44, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Detailed planning for the posters had started in April 1939 and the eventual designs were prepared after meetings between officials from the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] and [[HM Treasury]] on 26 June 1939 and between officials from the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] and [[HMSO]] on 27 June 1939.&lt;ref name="irving"/&gt; Roughs of the poster were completed on 6 July 1939, and the final designs were agreed by the Home Secretary [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood]] on 4 August 1939. Printing began on 23 August 1939, the day that Nazi Germany and the USSR signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], and the posters were ready to be placed up within 24 hours of the outbreak of war.&lt;ref name="irving"/&gt;

The posters were produced in 11 different sizes, ranging from {{convert|15|xx|10|in|cm}} up to large 48-sheet versions.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The background colour was either red or blue.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The lettering was probably hand-drawn by Wallcousins:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kominek|first1=Lex|title=Keep Calm and Carry On – WWII Posters |url=http://www.typophile.com/node/39466#comment-242245|publisher=Typophile|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 44, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; it is similar, but not identical, to [[humanist sans-serif typeface]]s such as [[Gill Sans]] and [[Johnston (typeface)|Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep Calm and Carry On: Fonts|url=http://www.k-type.com/keep-calm-carry-on/|publisher=K-Type|accessdate=28 September 2014}} For distinctive features, see for example the terminals of the "C".&lt;/ref&gt; 

Almost 2,500,000 copies of ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' were printed between 23 August and 3 September 1939 but the poster was not sanctioned for immediate public display.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; It was instead decided that copies should remain in "cold storage" for use after serious air raids (with resources transferred to ''Your Courage'' and ''Freedom is in Peril''). Copies of ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' were retained until April 1940, but stocks were then pulped as part of the wider [[Paper Salvage 1939–50|Paper Salvage]] campaign.&lt;ref name="irving"/&gt; A very few copies do appear to have been displayed, but such instances were rare and unauthorised: an October 1940 edition of the ''[[The Yorkshire Post|Yorkshire Post]]'' reports the poster hung in a shop in [[Leeds]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=22 October 1940 |title=Ban on Silk Stockings: Should They Have Been Rationed? |newspaper=[[The Yorkshire Post|Yorkshire Post and Leeds Mercury]] |page=4 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results?basicsearch=%22few%20had%20eyes%20for%20the%20poster%22 |accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a photograph discovered in 2016 shows it on the wall of a government laboratory in [[Bedfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Patrick |last1=Sawer |first2=Paul |last2=Hooley |title=Wartime rebels who broke the ban by displaying keep calm and carry on poster |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=30 October 2016 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/29/wartime-rebels-who-broke-the-ban-by-displaying-keep-calm-and-car/ |accessdate=5 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] publicity campaign was cancelled in October 1939 following criticism of its cost and impact. Many people claimed not to have seen the posters; while those who did see them regarded them as patronising and divisive.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 52–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Nigel Rees |last=Rees |first=Nigel |date=20 July 2011|title=Cheer up, the worst is yet to come|work=[[Today programme]]|publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9543000/9543352.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design historian Susannah Walker regards the campaign as "a resounding failure" and reflective of a misjudgement by upper-class civil servants of the mood of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Walker 2012, pp.6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
In late May and early June 1941, 14,000,000 copies of a leaflet entitled "Beating the Invader" were distributed with a message from Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]. The leaflet begins "If invasion comes..." and exhorts the populace to "Stand Firm" and "Carry On". The two phrases do not appear in one sentence, as they applied to different segments of the population depending on their circumstances, with those civilians finding themselves in areas of fighting ordered to stand firm (i.e., stay put) and those not in areas of fighting ordered to carry on (i.e., continue vital war work). Each mandate is identified as a "great order and duty" should invasion come. The leaflet then lists 14 questions and answers on practical measures to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=If Invasion Comes. Mr. Churchill's Orders. "Stand Firm and Carry On."|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47326422|work=The West Australian|date=26 May 1941|location=Perth, WA, Australia|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rediscovery and commercialisation===
[[File:Keep Calm And Carry On - Original poster - Barter Books - 17-Oct-2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The poster discovered at Barter Books]]
[[File:Keep Calm merchandise.jpg|thumb|right|2013 shop display of "Keep Calm" merchandise, including the original slogan and variants such as "Keep Calm and Drink Tea".]]
In 2000, Stuart Manley, co-owner with his wife Mary of [[Barter Books]] Ltd. in [[Alnwick]], Northumberland, was sorting through a box of used books bought at auction when he uncovered one of the original "Keep Calm and Carry On" posters. The couple framed it and hung it up by the cash register; it attracted so much interest that Manley began to produce and sell copies.&lt;ref name="Rediscovery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keepcalmhome.com/about.htm |title=About Keep Calm and Carry On}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/first-person-i-am-the-keep-calm-and-carry-on-man-1672398.html |first=Stuart |last=Manley |title=First person: 'I am the Keep Calm and Carry On man' |newspaper=The Independent |date=25 April 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2005, ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist Susie Steiner featured the replica posters as a Christmas gift suggestion, raising their profile still further.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies followed the Manleys' example, and the design rapidly began to be used as the theme for a wide range of products.&lt;ref name=feud&gt;{{cite news |title=Keep Calm and carry on ... into a feud |url= http://www.smh.com.au/world/keep-calm-and-carry-on--into-a-feud-20130503-2ix55.html |accessdate= 4 May 2013 |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= 4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Manley later commented, "I didn't want it trivialised; but of course now it's been trivialised beyond belief."&lt;ref name=feud/&gt;

In early 2012, Barter Books debuted an informational short film, ''The Story of Keep Calm and Carry On'', providing visual insight into the modernisation and commercialisation of the design and the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=FrHkKXFRbCI|title=The Story of Keep Calm and Carry On}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poster has become an evocation of British stoicism: the "[[stiff upper lip]]", self-discipline, fortitude and remaining calm in adversity. Susannah Walker comments that it is now seen "not only as a distillation of a crucial moment in Britishness, but also as an inspiring message from the past to the present in a time of crisis".&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; She goes on to point out, however, that such an interpretation overlooks the circumstances of its production, and the relative failure of the campaign of which it formed a part.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker 2012, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trademark claims ===
{{update|section|date=March 2015}}
In August 2011, it was reported that a UK-based company called Keep Calm and Carry On Ltd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepcalmandcarryon.com |title=Keep Calm and Carry On Ltd |publisher=Keepcalmandcarryon.com |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (managed by entrepreneur Mark Coop) had registered the slogan as a [[community trade mark]] in the EU, CTM No: 009455619, and in the United States, No. 4066622,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2011/10/keep-calm-and-carry-on-trademark-fight|title=The Vicious Trademark Battle Over 'Keep Calm and Carry On'|date=5 October 2011|publisher=[[The Awl]] |first=Maria |last=Bustillos |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301012125/http://www.theawl.com/2011/10/keep-calm-and-carry-on-trademark-fight |archivedate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Jeremy |title=Monday miscellany |date=22 August 2011|url = http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2011/08/monday-miscellany_22.html|publisher=IPKitten blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; after failing to obtain its registration as a trademark in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Rayner"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/8785585/Battle-rages-over-Keep-Calm-and-Carry-On-souvenirs.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Gordon |last=Rayner |title=Battle rages over 'Keep Calm and Carry On' souvenirs | date=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lew74"&gt;Lewis 2017, pp. 74–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The company issued a take-down request against a seller of ''Keep Calm and Carry On'' products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15014748|title=Battle over trademark of 'keep calm' phrase|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keep calm and carry on items removed from my ebay account |publisher=justanswer.com |date=August 2011 |url=http://www.justanswer.com/uk-law/5e2l0-keep-calm-carry-items-removed.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's right to claim the trademark was questioned by, among others, the Manleys of Barter Books, as the slogan had been widely used before registration and was not recognisable as indicating trade origin.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lew74"/&gt; An application was submitted by British intellectual property advisor and UK trademarking service Trade Mark Direct to cancel the registration on the grounds that the words were too widely used for one person to own the exclusive rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freelanceuk.com/news/3912.shtml|title=IP group aims to reclaim 'Keep Calm &amp; Carry On'|publisher=freelanceuk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the request for cancellation was rejected and the trade mark is still protected in all EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The company subsequently tried to register the slogan as its trademark in both the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=85297485 |title=Serial Number: 85297485 Keep Calm and Carry On USA Trademark|work=Official Gazette|date=20 September 2011|publisher=[[USPTO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada.&lt;ref name="Rayner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do;jsessionid=0001K46wR_Bu__TfKBulXGEhGen:-14J2QPI?lang=eng&amp;status=&amp;fileNumber=1524133&amp;extension=0&amp;startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1 |title= Canadian Trade-mark Data |publisher= IC.GC.CA |date= 13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imitations==
As the popularity of the poster in various media has grown, innumerable parodies, imitations and co-optations have also appeared, making it a notable [[Internet meme|meme]]. Messages range from the cute to the overtly political, typically with references to other aspects of popular culture raging from [[Land Rover]] and [[Disney]] to [[Star Wars]] and [[Thomas the Tank Engine]]. Examples have included "Now Panic and Freak Out" (with an upside-down crown), "Get Excited and Make Things" (with a crown incorporating [[wrench|spanners]]), "Keep Calm and Have a Cupcake" (with a [[cupcake]] icon), "Don't Panic and Fake a British Accent", "Keep Spending and Carry On Shopping",&lt;ref name="NYT mag story"&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Walker (journalist) |title=Remixed Messages |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/magazine/05FOB-consumed-t.html?_r=2&amp;ref=magazine  |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate= 21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Keep Calm and Don't Sneeze" during the [[2009 flu pandemic in the United Kingdom|2009 swine flu pandemic]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2017, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; "Keep Calm and Call Batman" (with the Batman logo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://batman-news.com/2013/07/09/new-batman-easter-egg-from-man-of-steel-revealed|title=New Batman Easter egg from 'Man of Steel' revealed|author=Chris Begley |date=9 July 2013 |website=batman-news.com |access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Keep Calm and Switch to Linux" (with [[Tux (mascot)|Tux]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep calm and switch to Linux |url=http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/265/2/a/keep_calm_and_switch_to_linux_by_devianteles-d4am5ur.png}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March–April 2012, the British pop-rock band [[McFly]] undertook a theatre tour entitled "[[The Keep Calm &amp; Play Louder Tour|The Keep Calm and Play Louder Tour]]", promoted with a poster closely based on that of 1939. In late 2012 and early 2013, the "Save Lewisham Hospital" campaign (a protest against proposed cuts in services at [[University Hospital Lewisham]]) made widespread use of a poster with the slogan "Don't Keep Calm Get Angry and Save Lewisham A&amp;E".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Little |first=Mandy |title=Protestors show unity |newspaper=South London Press |location=London |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2013 |url=http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/News.cfm?id=44283&amp;headline=Protestors%20show%20unity |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023806/http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk/News.cfm?id=44283&amp;headline=Protestors%20show%20unity |archive-date=28 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2013 |publisher=Save Lewisham Hospital campaign |url=http://www.savelewishamhospital.com/ |title=Save Lewisham Hospital! |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of [[Naheed Nenshi]], mayor of [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada, to encourage and motivate his citizens in the wake of the [[2013 Alberta floods]] made him the subject of parody "Keep Calm and Nenshi On" fundraising T-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dean Bennett |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mayor-nenshi-has-captured-calgarys-heart-but-the-worst-at-least-politically-is-yet-to-come/article12884159/ |title=Mayor Nenshi has captured Calgary's heart, but the worst, at least politically, is yet to come |work=The Globe and Mail |date=28 June 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2014 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kokoon Arts Club''', sometimes spelled Kokoon Arts Klub, was a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] artists group founded in 1911 by [[Carl Moellman]], [[William Sommer]] and [[Elmer Brubeck]] to promote [[Modernism]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moellman had been a member of [[New York City]]'s Kit Kat Club, which served as inspiration for Kokoon. From 1913 to 1946 Kokoon's annual Bal-Masque balls scandalized Cleveland with risqué activities, provocative art, and nudity, and was sometimes wagishly referred to as the "Cocaine Club". A fierce rivalry stood between Kokoon and the more conservative [[Cleveland Society of Artists]].

The first 25 and the 39th Tom Swift Sr. books are in the [[public domain]] all around the world and are available as downloadable texts from [[Project Gutenberg]].  However, in Canada, due to its life plus 50 years policy, and because [[Howard R. Garis]] and Thomas Moyston Mitchell died in 1962, on January 1, 2013 volumes 1 to 35 (written by Garis) and 39-40 (written by Mitchell) entered into the Canadian Public Domain. (Canadian Copyright Act, Sections 6.1 and 6.2)  This applies to other countries as well that have a life plus 50 policy.  Volumes 36 to 38, which were written by [[Harriet Adams|Harriet Stratemeyer-Adams]], will enter the Canadian Public Domain on January 1, 2033.

The '''Minoan bull leaper''' is a bronze group of a bull and leaper in the [[British Museum]]. It is the only known largely complete three-dimensional sculpture depicting [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[bull-leaping]].&lt;ref name=BBC20080922&gt;{{cite web |title=A History of the World - Object: A bronze statue of an acrobat leaping over a bull from the island of Crete. |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=6 June 2010 |publisher=BBC and British Museum |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/eU0DV7kOQ5inxmklD__YIw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although bull leaping certainly took place in Crete at this time, the leap depicted is practically impossible and it has therefore been speculated that the sculpture may be an exaggerated depiction.&lt;ref name=BBC20080922/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMexplore&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/minoan-bull-leaper/JgEavxWd-gLX9w|title=Minoan bull leaper|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This speculation has been backed up by the testaments of modern-day bull leapers from [[France]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=A history of the world in 100 objects|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00qg5mf |series=1 |network=BBC |station=Radio 4 |airdate=February 10, 2010|number= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Minoan Bull-leaper 2.jpg|thumb|right|The Minoan bull leaper from the front.]]
The group was cast in a single mould using the [[lost-wax casting]] technique. The group's homogeneity was demonstrated by analysing the composition of the bronze of bull and leaper: both contain about 96% [[copper]] and 1.5% [[tin]], with 1% [[zinc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Craddock|1976|pp=93–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low proportion of tin in the alloy would have made it difficult for the bronze to fill the mould, resulting in the missing lower legs of the leaper, and probably the arms.&lt;ref name=BMexplore/&gt; Stylistically, the group is coherent, since the arched back of the leaper mirrors the flying gallop posture of the bull.

==Background==
[[Arthur Evans]], the excavator of [[Knossos]], first published this object in the ''[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]]''.&lt;ref name=Evans1921&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1921|pp=247–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Evans dated the bull-leaper to the Late Minoan I period, so that this object dates to approximately 1600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was acquired by the British Museum in 1966 as part of the collection of Captain Edward George Spencer-Churchill (1876-1964). He acquired it in Crete in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The object was widely known before its acquisition and display in the Museum. It was illustrated in several general books&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Hall|1928|p=172, fig. 221&amp;222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hutchinson|1962|p=265, pl.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamb|1929|p=27, pl.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibited at the British Academy in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Myres|1936|pp=9, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bull-leaping==

Bull leaping and bulls in general are believed to have been an important part of Minoan culture; excavations at Knossos have revealed several [[fresco]]s depicting bull-leaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/bronzeage/ss/091008Minoan.htm|title=Knossos - Minoan Art work|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested bulls may have had some religious significance to them for example the large, exaggerated size of the bull compared to the human leaper may give an idea of the Minoans' reverence for the power of the animals.&lt;ref name=BBC20080922/&gt;

This object has been central to discussions of bull-leaping, since Arthur Evans used it as the basis for his reconstruction of the mechanics of the leap: the leaper grabs the bull's horns, executes a back flip onto the bull's back and then dismounts.&lt;ref name=Evans1921/&gt; As John Younger has pointed out, although this reconstruction has become part of bull-leaping in the popular imagination, comparatively few Minoan depictions show exactly this schema. The majority show the leaper diving over the bull's horns onto the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Younger|1976|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size of ancient Minoan bull leaping bulls ===

Archaeological evidence has now uncovered that the type of bull used by ancient Minoan bull leapers was a cross breed giant aurochs bull, now extinct in Europe. It had a shoulder height of over 6&amp;nbsp;ft (180&amp;nbsp;cm) and a hoof size similar to the size of a human head.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev-WeyQjCWk&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}

==Media appearances==
The bull-leaper was object 18&lt;ref name=hotwlist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/a-history-of-the-world-in-100-objects |title=A History of the World in 100 Objects |publisher=Radio Times |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the BBC Radio 4 Series [[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]. Week 4 of the series was 'The Beginning of Science and Literature': [[Neil MacGregor]] emphasised the importance of bronze, used to manufacture tools as well as art objects, and its central role in Mediterranean trade in the Bronze Age.

The BBC promoted ''A History of the World in 100 Objects'' with television adverts. One of these was a 30-second commercial featuring a Spanish [[:es:Recortador (tauromaquia)|recortador]] (bull-leaper) created by the ad agency [[Fallon Worldwide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Hiroshige, The moon over a waterfall.jpg|thumb|220px|Hiroshige, ''The moon over a waterfall'']]
The depiction of '''night in paintings''' is common in [[Eastern art]]. [[Painting]]s that feature the night scene as the [[theme (arts)|theme]] are mostly [[portrait]]s and [[landscape]]s. Some artworks which involve [[religious]] or [[fantasy]] topics use the quality of dim night light to create mysterious atmospheres. They tend to illustrate the illuminating effect of the light reflection on the subjects under either [[moonlight]] or [[artificial light]] sources.

==Historical overview==
[[File:Yoshiwara bij nacht-Rijksmuseum AK-MAK-1571.jpeg|thumb|[[Utagawa Kunisada II]], ''Yoshiwara by night'']]
Early oriental artists created works that focused on design and spiritual interpretation of their subjects rather than realistic, three-dimensional representations. For centuries, eastern night paintings were spiritually and emotionally evocative works with unshaded, two-dimensional imagery. Like the western world, the moon, candles, and stars helped set the nocturnal scene. But there were also items, such as clothing and tree leaves, that might be used in a specific way to express nighttime from an eastern perspective.

The 16th century [[Mughal painting|Mughal painter]] [[Basawan]] was an early artist who integrated western techniques and perspective into eastern art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/60050334 ''The Origin of Music: Page from a Tutinama Manuscript.''] New York: Metropolitan Museum. Retrieved 29 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; When trade opened up between the far east and the west art slowly changed in both sides of the world. For instance, Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] prints influenced Parisian artists. And, Jesuit priests, like [[Matteo Ricci]], brought artwork to China that introduced western approaches for [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] and [[shading]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Capon|Capon, Edmund]] and Mae Anna Pang (1981). ''Chinese Paintings of the Ming and Qing Dynasties''. Catalogue. International Cultural Corporation of Australia. p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; These factors broadened the way in which nighttime was portrayed everywhere.

==Symbolism==

===China===
Traditional Chinese artists sought to capture the interrelated, vast and multifaceted aspects of nature here are on earth and in the heavens. From the article "The Great Art of China's 'Soundless Poems'", Heaven appears "before us only this bright shining mass; but in its immeasurable extent, the sun, the moon, stars and constellations are suspended in it, and all things are embraced under it."&lt;ref name=SchillerInstitute&gt;[http://www.schillerinstitute.org/fid_97-01/99sp_leni_rubenstein_chinese_art.pdf ''The Great Art of China's 'Soundless Poems'.''] The Schiller Institute.

Symbolism plays an enduring role in the telling of a story through painting or other Chinese art. For instance, stars and the moon are important both for religious significance and as an illustration of [[Chinese mythology]].&lt;ref name="Welch, 2008. p. 10"&gt;Welch, Patricia Bjaaland. (2008). ''Chinese Art: A Guide to Motifs and Visual Imagery.'' Art and Design Series.

Tuttle Publishing. p. 12. {{ISBN|0-804-83864-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of symbols include bats which means both good wishes and good luck. The moon, aside from religious and mythical connotations, can also mean a month.&lt;ref name="Welch, 2008. p. 10"/&gt; The particular way an image is depicted has meaning - like a round eyed-cat means it's a night scene.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Patricia Bjaaland.

Artists use rice paper, silk or wood panels to paint night scenes. Silk has illuminating effect, while wood panels create a dark background.

''Dream of the Red Chamber'' and ''Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio'' were inspiration for night time paintings.

Almost 500 legendary tales written by [[Pu Songling]] are compiled in ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' or ''Liaozhai Zhiyi''. The tales, inspired by oral storytelling, include strong mythical characters like ghosts, immortals, beasts and foxes. They also offer commentary about people, particularly the privileged and court officials, whose human frailties may result in unfair, unjust and other unfavorable treatment to others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.cultural-china.com /en/221H12432H14964.html ''Themes of Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio.''

Nighttime is a symbol for people's inability to understand the world around them. And the supernatural beings are meant to be a mirror to examine the nature of man. From a preface by T'ang Meng Lai to the book, Lai states that the book should prompt the readers to reflect upon the following: "We marvel at devils and foxes: we do not marvel at man. But who is it that causes a man to move and to speak?"&lt;ref&gt;Sung-ling, Pu (author) and Herbert A. Giles (translator). (1880).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Many of the Chinese ghost beliefs have been accepted by neighboring cultures, notably Japan and south-east Asia.
Ghost beliefs are closely associated with the traditional Chinese religion based on ancestor worship, many of which were incorporated in [[Taoism]]. Later beliefs were influenced by [[Buddhism]], and in turn influenced and created uniquely Chinese Buddhist beliefs.

[[Zhong Kui]] is a [[Chinese mythology|mythological]] figure, generally a vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings, and reputedly able to command 80,000 [[demon]]s. Another mythological figure is ''Yan luo'', the judge of Hell.

In Chinese night paintings, the moon often symbolizes loneliness of the painting's character. It also sets the mood for a romantic setting.

For traditional art, there is little difference between the way night and day are illustrated and the colors that are used. For instance in early [[Rajput painting|Rajput (also called Rajasthani) paintings]], the only way to read that the painting is a night scene is through the presence of torches or candles. Later in the Rajput period, both somewhat influenced by Western art, night scenes were painted dramatically with shadows and [[Mughal paintings]] used [[chiaroscuro]] for shading.&lt;ref name=Coomaraswamy&gt;Coomaraswamy, Ananda K.

Buddhism was an important part of Korean art since about the time of the [[Unified Silla]] period when there was a desire to be open to other religions. This resulted in the use of Buddhist themes in art work and the creation of Buddhist temples. In the 14th century, a work was made of ''Water-Moon Avalokiteshvara'',&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Judith G.

''Brahma with Attendants and Musicians'' depicts a [[Brahma]] ([[Korean language|Korean]]: Beomcheon) heaven scene which was painted during the early Joseon dynasty in Korea. Brahma, a Hindu deity, also became part of the Buddhist religion and protected the Buddhist teaching. The heavenly scene is includes musicians with flutes, violins, lutes and other instruments.&lt;ref name=MM-Brahma&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/60006939 ''Brahma with Attendants and Musicians''.] Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The work, replete with evidence of grandeur, includes two figures who represent the moon and sun.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Judith G. (1998) ''Arts of Korea.'' Metropolitan Museum of Art. p. 178. {{ISBN|0870998501}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] made ''Okabe'' about 1844 which depicts the death of Buddha. In recounting the death of Buddha, cats are supposed to be the only animals that not to weep. In Kuniyoshi's time, it was believed that when a girl visited a temple after dark, she took the risk of being greeted by an old woman who would offer her to stay the night. Once inside the house, the old woman would become a witch and devour her. Therefore, a cat around temples could be the witch in a cat form.

'''Norwich University of the Arts''' ('''NUA''') is a [[public university]] in [[Norwich, Norfolk]], United Kingdom. It is a former [[higher education institution]] and specialises in art, design and media. Norwich University of the Arts was founded as '''Norwich School of Design''' in 1845 and has a long history of arts education. It gained full university status in 2013. 

NUA is the smaller of two universities in Norwich, the other being the [[University of East Anglia]].

==History==

The history of the university dates back to 1845 when the Norwich School of Design was established to provide designers for local industries. Its founders were the artists and followers of the '[[Norwich School (art movement)|Norwich School of Painters]]', the only provincial British group to establish an international reputation for landscape painting.

Degree-level provision has been offered since 1965, when it was approved to offer the Diploma in Art and Design, validated by the [[National Council for Diplomas in Art and Design]] (NCDAD). After 1965 the School of Art made its own mark on the national art and design scene when twin strengths in Painting and Graphic Design emerged under a group of exceptional practitioners and teachers. From 1975, after NCDAD's merger with the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA), the School offered its first BA Honours degree courses in [[Fine Art]] and [[Graphic Design]], validated by CNAA.

In 1989 the School merged with [[Great Yarmouth]] College of Art to form the '''Norfolk Institute of Art and Design''' (NIAD). In 1991 Norfolk Institute of Art and Design become an Associate College of the new [[Anglia Polytechnic]] with the polytechnic assuming validation responsibilities from CNAA from September 1992. This agreement extended to postgraduate provision, with the first MA course being introduced in 1993 (MA Fine Art) and the first research degree student being registered in 1995.

In 1994 NIAD was incorporated as a Higher Education Institution (HEI), renamed as '''Norwich School of Art and Design''' and re-launched with a new corporate identity.

In November 2007 the School was granted the power to award its own degrees up to Masters level and was renamed '''Norwich University College of the Arts'''.

In January 2013 the institution was given permission by the [[Privy Council]] to become a university and became Norwich University of the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nua.ac.uk/about/|title=About Norwich University of the Arts - A TEF Gold University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2018}}

==Buildings==
[[File:University College of the Arts, Duke St - geograph.org.uk - 1398450.jpg|thumb|Duke Street building which houses the library and student's union.]]
The university campus comprises seven buildings located in [[Norwich]] city centre.
Francis House which is located on Redwell Street is the main reception for NUA, while the majority of academic facilities are a two-minute walk away, along the pedestrianised St Georges Street, with additional sites on the neighbouring Duke Street and St Andrews Street.

Teaching facilities include a large Apple Mac and Windows suite, A1 style printing rooms, wood and metal workshops with a functioning forge, stop-motion animation studios, professional sound booths, open-plan design and illustration studios, constructed textiles and fashion workshops, lecture theatre and comprehensive library.

There are three areas of accommodation for year one students: the newly developed All Saints Green halls of residence comprising a total of 228 rooms, the Beechcroft complex off Sprowston Road and Harvard Court.

==Organisation and structure==
The Vice-Chancellor is Professor John Last and the first Chancellor, appointed on the promotion of the institution to university status in January 2013, Sir [[John Hurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-21281532|title=Actor Hurt takes chancellor post|date=13 August 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Riley, Movement in Squares.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=Black and light grey checkered pattern of squares that is horizontally shrunk at one third to the right side of the image|''Movement in Squares'', by [[Bridget Riley]] 1961]]
'''Op art''', short for '''optical art''', is a style of visual [[art]] that uses [[optical illusion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Artspeak, Robert Atkins, {{ISBN|978-1-55859-127-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Op art works are abstract, with many better known pieces created in black and white. Typically, they give the viewer the impression of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibrating patterns, or of swelling or warping.

== History ==
[[File:Francis Picabia, c. 1921-22, Optophone I, encre, aquarelle et mine de plomb sur papier, 72 x 60 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Picabia]], c. 1921–22, ''Optophone I'', encre, aquarelle et mine de plomb sur papier, 72 × 60 cm. Reproduced in Galeries Dalmau, ''Picabia'', exhibition catalogue, Barcelona, November 18 – December 8, 1922.]]
[[Image:Soto Sphere.jpg|thumb|alt=Daytime photo of sky, mountains, vegetation, a billboard, and, in the center of the image, poles with an orange circle in the center|[[Jesús Soto]], Caracas]]
The antecedents of op art, in terms of graphic and color effects, can be traced back to [[Neo-impressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Dada]].&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10139|title=The Collection - MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time Magazine'' coined the term ''op art'' in 1964, in response to [[Julian Stanczak]]'s show ''Optical Paintings at the Martha Jackson Gallery'', to mean a form of abstract art (specifically non-objective art) that uses optical illusions.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Borgzinner. "Op Art", ''Time'', October 23, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/op-art.htm|title=Op-Art: History, Characteristics|website=www.Visual-Arts-Cork.com|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works now described as "op art" had been produced for several years before ''Time's'' 1964 article. For instance, [[Victor Vasarely]]'s painting ''Zebras'' (1938) is made up entirely of [[curvature|curvilinear]] black and white stripes not contained by contour lines. Consequently, the stripes appear to both meld into and burst forth from the surrounding background. Also, the early black and white "dazzle" panels that [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]] installed at the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibit in 1956 and his ''Pandora'' series at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in 1962 demonstrate proto-op art tendencies. [[Martin Gardner]] featured op Art and its relation to mathematics in his July 1965 [[Mathematical Games column]] in ''Scientific American''. In Italy, [[Franco Grignani]], who originally trained as an architect, became a leading force of graphic design where op art or [[kinetic art]] was central. His Woolmark logo (launched in Britain in 1964) is probably the most famous of all his designs.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
[[Image:Hungary pecs - vasarely0.jpg|thumb|An [[optical illusion]] by the Hungarian-born artist [[Victor Vasarely]] in [[Pécs]]]]

Op art perhaps more closely derives from the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] practices of the [[Bauhaus]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} This German school, founded by [[Walter Gropius]], stressed the relationship of form and function within a framework of analysis and rationality. Students learned to focus on the overall design or entire composition to present unified works. Op art also stems from [[trompe-l'œil]] and [[anamorphosis]]. Links with psychological research have also been made, particularly with [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt theory]] and [[psychophysiology]].&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; When the Bauhaus was forced to close in 1933, many of its instructors fled to the United States. There, the movement took root in [[Chicago]] and eventually at the [[Black Mountain College]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], where [[Anni Albers|Anni]] and [[Josef Albers]] eventually taught. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Op artists thus managed to exploit various phenomena," writes Popper, "the after-image and consecutive movement; line interference; the effect of dazzle; ambiguous figures and reversible perspective; successive colour contrasts and chromatic vibration; and in three-dimensional works different viewpoints and the superimposition of elements in space."&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1955, for the exhibition « Mouvements » at the [[Denise René]] gallery in Paris, Victor Vasarely and [[Pontus Hulten]] promoted in their "Yellow manifesto" some new kinetic expressions based on optical and luminous phenomenon as well as painting illusionism. The expression ''[[Kinetic art#Apparent Movement and Op Art|kinetic art]]'' in this modern form first appeared at the [[Museum für Gestaltung]] of [[Zürich]] in 1960, and found its major developments in the 1960s. In most European countries, it generally includes the form of optical art that mainly makes use of [[optical illusion]]s, like op art, as well as art based on movement represented by [[Yacov Agam]], [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]], [[Jesús Rafael Soto]], [[Gregorio Vardanega]] or [[Nicolas Schöffer]]. From 1961 to 1968, the ''[[Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel]]'' (GRAV) founded by [[François Morellet]], [[Julio Le Parc]], [[Francisco Sobrino]], Horacio Garcia Rossi, [[Yvaral]], Joël Stein and [[Vera Molnár]] was a collective group of opto-kinetic artists that—according to its 1963 manifesto—appealed to the direct participation of the public with an influence on its behaviour, notably through the use of interactive [[labyrinth]]s.

Some members of the group [[Nouvelle tendance]] (1961–1965) in Europe also were engaged in op art as Almir Mavignier and [[Gerhard von Graevenitz]], mainly with their serigraphics. They studied optical illusions. The term ''op'' irritated many of the artists labeled under it, specifically including Albers and Stanczak. They had discussed upon the birth of the term a better label, namely ''perceptual art''.&lt;ref&gt;Bertholf. "Julian Stanczak: Decades of Light" Yale Press&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964, Arnold Schmidt ([[Arnold Alfred Schmidt]]) had several solo exhibitions of his large, black and white shaped optical paintings exhibited at the [[Terrain Gallery]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terraingallery.org/Some-History.html|title=A Brief History of the Terrain Gallery|website=TerrainGallery.org|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Responsive Eye'' ===
In 1965, between February 23 and April 25, an exhibition called ''The Responsive Eye'', created by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City and toured to St Louis, Seattle, Pasadena and Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seitz|first1=William C.|title=The Responsive Eye (exhibition catalog)|date=1965|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|location=New York|url=http://ubu.com/historical/responsive/ResponsiveEyeMOMA1965.pdf|access-date=January 23, 2016|oclc=644787547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=February 25, 1965|title=The Responsive Eye|url=https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/3439/releases/MOMA_1965_0015_14.pdf?2010|location= New York|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|agency= |access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works shown were wide-ranging, encompassing the minimalism of [[Frank Stella]] and [[Ellsworth Kelly]], the smooth plasticity of [[Alexander Liberman]], the collaborative efforts of the [[Anonima group]], alongside the well-known  [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Wen-Ying Tsai]], [[Bridget Riley]] and [[Getulio Alviani]]. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships.
[[File:Wen-Ying Tsai, "Super-imposed Painting- Random Field," 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Wen-Ying Tsai]], "Super-imposed Painting: Random Field" (1963)]]
The exhibition was enormously popular with the general public (the attendance was over 180,000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Gordon Hyatt]] (writer and producer), [[Mike Wallace]] (presenter)|date=1965|title=The Responsive Eye|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSVQqJo0Pmk|medium=Television production|publisher=Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.}} (Available on YouTube in three sections.)&lt;/ref&gt; though less so with the critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2006/02/moma_1965_the_r.php|title=MoMA 1965: The Responsive Eye|website=CoolHunting.com|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics dismissed op art as portraying nothing more than ''trompe-l'œil'', or tricks that fool the eye.  Regardless, op art's popularity with the public increased, and op art images were used in a number of commercial contexts. One of [[Brian de Palma]]'s early works was a documentary film on the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people= [[Brian De Palma]] (director)|date=1966|title=The Responsive Eye|url=http://ubu.com/film/depalma_responsive.html|medium=Motion picture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method of operation ==

=== Black-and-white and the figure-ground relationship ===
Op art is a perceptual experience related to how vision functions. It is a dynamic visual art that stems from a discordant [[figure–ground (perception)|figure-ground]] relationship that puts the two planes—foreground and background—in a tense and contradictory juxtaposition.  Artists create op art in two primary ways. The first, best known method, is to create effects through pattern and line.  Often these paintings are [[black-and-white]], or otherwise [[grisaille]]—as in Bridget Riley's famous painting, ''Current'' (1964), on the cover of ''The Responsive Eye'' catalogue. Here, black and white wavy lines are close to one another on the canvas surface, creating a volatile figure-ground relationship. [[Getulio Alviani]] used aluminum surfaces, which he treated to create light patterns that change as the watcher moves (vibrating texture surfaces).  Another reaction that occurs is that the lines create after-images of certain colors due to how the retina receives and processes light. As [[Goethe]] demonstrates in his treatise ''[[Theory of Colours]]'', at the edge where light and dark meet, color arises because lightness and darkness are the two central properties in the creation of color.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

=== Color ===
Beginning in 1965 [[Bridget Riley]] began to produce color-based op art;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFuXfLYqQVsC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA147&amp;dq=op+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=RA1-PA147#v=onepage&amp;q=op+art&amp;f=false|title=After Modern Art 1945-2000|first=David|last=Hopkins|date=September 14, 2000|publisher=OUP Oxford|page=147|access-date=November 5, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, other artists, such as [[Julian Stanczak]] and [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], were always interested in making color the primary focus of their work.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Color Function Painting: The Art of Josef Albers, Julian Stanczak and Richard Anuszkiewicz'' Wake Forest University, reprinted 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josef Albers]] taught these two primary practitioners of the "Color Function" school at [[Yale]] in the 1950s. Often, colorist work is dominated by the same concerns of figure-ground movement, but they have the added element of contrasting colors that produce different effects on the eye.  For instance, in Anuszkiewicz's "temple" paintings, the juxtaposition of two highly contrasting colors provokes a sense of depth in illusionistic three-dimensional space so that it appears as if the architectural shape is invading the viewer's space.

==== Color interaction ====
{{Quote|text=There are three major classes of the interaction of color: ''simultaneous contrast, successive contrast, and reverse contrast (or assimilation)''. (i) Simultaneous contrast may take place when one area of color is surrounded by another area of a different color. In general, contrast enhances the difference in brightness and/or color between the interacting areas ... Such contrast effects are mutual, but if the surround area is larger and more intense than the area it encloses, then the contrast is correspondingly out of balance, and may appear to be exerted in one direction only. (ii) In successive contrast, first one color is viewed and then another. This may be achieved either by fixing the eye steadily on one color and then quickly replacing that color with another, or by shifting fixation from one color to another. (iii) In reverse contrast (sometimes called the assimilation of color or the spreading effect) the lightness of white or the darkness of black may seem to spread into neighbouring regions. Similarly, colors may appear to spread into or become assimilated into neighbouring areas. All effects tend to make neighbouring areas appear more alike, rather than to enhance their differences as in the more familiar simultaneous contrast, hence the term reverse contrast (Jameson and Hurvich). Note that in the interaction of color the constituent colors retain much of the own identity even though they may be altered somewhat by contrast.|sign=Floyd Ratliff|source=The Theory of Color and the Practice of Painting&lt;ref&gt;Floyd Ratliff.

== Photographic op art ==
Although being relatively mainstream, photographers have been slow to produce op art. In painting, [[Victor Vasarely]] and [[Bridget Riley]] were producing large amounts of art and the same can be said for many [[digital art]]ists, such as [[Akiyoshi Kitaoka]]. One of the primary reasons for the lack of photographers doing op art, is the difficulty in finding effective subject matter. [[László Moholy-Nagy]] produced photographic op art and taught the subject in the [[Bauhaus]]. One of his lessons consisted of making his students produce holes in cards and then photographing them.

[[File:Rasa Renaissance Masterpiece, Forest Women by Artist Mumbiram.jpeg|thumb|Rasa Renaissance Masterpiece "Forest Women" by Artist [[Mumbiram]].]]

'''Rasa Renaissance''' is a movement in the art of painting that makes evocation of rasas (emotional moods) the prime aim in the creation and appreciation of a work of art. [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]] is the quality of emotional fulfilment that a work of art produces through the personalities, their expression and the situation presented in a painting. Rasa is a [[Sanskrit]] word that denotes the quality of emotional fulfilment that a work of art brings about. Rasa Theory is a theory of aesthetic criticism that has been prevalent in appreciation of literary works in Sanskrit language for millenniums (see: [[Indian aesthetics|Indian aesthetic]]).

The idea of Rasa Renaissance evolved in the last quarter of the twentieth century in the domain of painting, as a countermovement to [[abstract art |abstract]] and conceptual art. Rasa Renaissance is led by artist, philosopher and Sanskrit scholar Dr. [[Mumbiram]] of India (Ph.D. Berkeley California). In the twentieth century, the art of painting progressively became dissociated from depiction of personalities in real-world situations. It concerned itself with exploration of forms and colours for their own sake. It became more or less an exercise in clever intellectual sophistication. Art of Rasa Renaissance presupposes personalities in various situations, and in various emotional states, as being central to a work of art.

== Rasa art and personalist art ==
The emotions that the creator of a painting has in mind, the emotions that personalities who appear in a painting share with each other, as also the emotions that are aroused in the viewer of a painting, are all of concern in appreciation of a work of rasa art.
As emotions are states in the minds of personalities, rasa art presupposes depictions of personalities in various situations and various emotional states to be the subject matter of a rasa painting. Painting that concerns itself with depictions of personalities in various situations and various emotional states is "personalist art". The realm of personalist art is '''personalism'''.

== Personalist and impersonalist in history of art ==
Throughout the long history of art there has always been personalist as well as impersonal art. Portraits of kings, demigods, gods, mythological figures, saints as also ordinary people are examples of personalist art. Scenes in the lives of important as well as ordinary people are other examples. There were also battle scenes, domestic scenes, mythological and religious events. Impersonal Art existed in the form of landscapes, still-life and decorative designs. Till the late 19th century, art remained more or less representational. The beginning of the 20th century saw art indulging in deliberate distortions in depictions of personalities as well as inanimate objects. Soon afterwards, art saw itself dissociating from representation of real-world objects and personalities. Exploration of colours and forms for their own sake, without reference to any real-world entities became the subject matter of abstract paintings. Art became impersonal.

== Origins of personalist art and Rasa Renaissance ==
The idea of Rasa Renaissance first appeared in the art and writings of artist [[Mumbiram]] of India. The idea of personalist art first appears in two articles that Mumbiram wrote in 1985 in his native Marathi language in Pune's ''Ravivar Sakal''. "In Search of an Art that transcends Culture" and "The Practice of Personalist Art". In these autobiographical articles, Mumbiram describes his affectionate rapport with his artist grandfather, his success as a prodigious child artist, his giving up art to devote himself to mathematics, his years in the graduate school at Berkeley, his ''déjà vu'' with art, his search for art that does not align itself with any culture (''sanskritinirapeksha''), his falling in love with Krishna and his arrival back in India as a personalist artist.

Here Mumbiram calls his own art ''Vyaktisaapeksha Kalaa''. ''Saapekshataa'' would translate to relativity. ''Saapeksha'' would translate to 'depending on' or 'in expectation of'. ''Kalaa'' translates to Art, Art in reference to persons - Art in the context of persons. This is where the usage ''Personalist Art'' first appears.

In an article appearing in the ''Sunday Maharashtra Herald'', "Waiting in the Wings" in 1986, journalist Ashok Gopal introduces Mumbiram: "Mumbiram calls his Art Personalist Art..." The same article carries an Artist's Manifesto which makes clear reference to Personalism: "Personalism is a frontal attack on materialism on the aesthetic front", "Personalism leaves no room for the existential void".

The idea of Rasa Theory as basic to appreciation of art appears in an article about Mumbiram appearing in Mumbai's ''Sunday Observer'' in 1988 written by Sudhir Sonalkar. An interview with Mumbiram for the Mumbai tabloid ''Mid-Day'' has Mumbiram talking about Rasa Theory.

Distant Drummer Publishing has produced ''High Five of Love'', a five-volume ensemble of English translations of Sanskrit Rasa classics wherein Mumbiram's original Rasa art is juxtaposed with Rasa literature. A catalog of exhibition of Mumbiram's ''Book Readers: Love on the Gutenberg Galaxy'' cites Rasa theory of aesthetic appreciation as relevant to appreciation of Mumbiram's art. It also gives an extensive bibliography of classical works on Rasa theory. Another extensive catalog of Mumbiram's work is titled: ''Rasa Renaissance''.

[[File:Rasa Art, "I let him persuade me", Charcoal by Mumbiram.jpg|thumb|Rasa Art Charcoal "I let him persuade me" by Artist [[Mumbiram]].]]

== ''Prema vivarta'' mood ==
According to [[Vaishnavism]] theology, Krishna is Rasaraj, the supreme source of all rasas. Depictions of incidents in Krishna's biography are most attractive subjects for Rasa art. In the ''prema vivarta'' mood of attachment to Krishna, everything in the phenomenal world appears to the lover of Krishna as a ''[[déjà vu]]'' of something related to Krishna. Many Rasa masterpieces are made in the prema vivarta mood. Ashok Gopal quotes Mumbiram: "My raven-dark rambunctious, roaming, rag-picking girlfriends remind me of Krishna and his boys in the forests of Vrindavan."

== Comparison with the Pre-Raphaelites (a paradigm shift) ==
[[Pre-Raphaelites]] were rebelling against the 'stodgy' Royal Academy. Somehow the romance was missing in the artists' lives. This group formed a secret brotherhood. Real life muses inspired their works. The inspiration was reflected in their paintings. The real lives of the artists and their works had a symbiotic relationship between them.

Rasa art, or art of Rasa Renaissance, is rebelling against the far more 'stodgy' art establishment of the twentieth century. Art degenerated into creation of 'brand equity' in logos. Depiction of persons was pigeonholed into the category of 'figurative' and 'representational' art for the less intelligent simpletons. Art museums, auction houses, art galleries and art schools all descended into a rut of vested interests. Rasa Renaissance rebels by bringing back into the purview of contemporary art the noble situations of human existence, the innate beauty of personalities and love amongst individuals. By the standards of the Rasa Theory of aesthetics, only Personalist Art can genuinely evoke rasas. So-called 'abstract' art is merely Impersonal Art, severely limited in its ability to invoke any rasa.

The Pre-Raphaelites used muses as models. They used monochrome, posed photographs of their muses/models to achieve realism. They spent considerable effort in painting carpets and folds in clothing. They strived to make paintings appear 'as good as' colour photographs.

Rasa art is inspired by real-life muses. They are not professional models. They are from an entirely different milieu. The artist meets them through personal encounter of the [[Romanticism|romantic type]]. Living in an era when color photography and photoshop are commonplace, rasa art is predominantly charcoal renderings. They are effortless quick live renderings. They don't aspire for photorealism. The person is of prime importance. The surroundings are not even depicted. The drama of the meeting and also the rendering is the 'high' the artist and the muses share. The admirers meet the artist in equally surprising ways. They are thrilled to be caught in the real life milieu of a classical painter. They are impulsively inspired to buy the work from the artist himself, from the environment where the work was produced.

== Personalism in theology, love and art ==
According to tenets of Personalism, an Impersonal paradigm of divinity gives rise to the existential void and absence of values.
Love of impersonal objects, in preference to love of individuals, gives rise to materialism. Impersonalism in art is epitomized in abstract art.

Proponents of Rasa Renaissance see distortions in painting as sarcastic and cynical expressions. Rasa Art strives for simplicity, innocence, faith and devotion. Rasa Art strives for honesty to an indigenous aesthetic and an awareness of one's own beauty. Personalism sees man made in the image of God. There is no room for 'existential void'. Personalism focuses attention on love and grace amongst individuals, in preference to fascination with matter.

'''''Rent''''' is a [[rock musical]] with music, lyrics, and book by [[Jonathan Larson]],&lt;ref name="Rent: Bible"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; loosely based on [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s [[opera]] ''[[La bohème]]''. It tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in [[New York City]]'s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] in the thriving days of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]]&lt;!-- The exact time in which the story takes place is never mentioned but is generally considered to be the early 1990s--&gt;, under the shadow of [[HIV/AIDS]].

The musical was first seen in a [[workshop production]] at [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in 1993. This same [[Off-Broadway]] theatre was also the musical's initial home following its official 1996 opening. The show's creator, [[Jonathan Larson]], died suddenly of an [[aortic dissection]], believed to have been caused by undiagnosed [[Marfan syndrome]], the night before the Off-Broadway premiere. The musical moved to Broadway's larger [[Nederlander Theatre]] on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent | last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| pages=54–64| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Broadway, ''Rent'' gained critical acclaim and won several awards. The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008, after a 12-year run of 5,123 performances. On February 14, 2016, the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' surpassed ''Rent''{{'}}s number of performances with a 2pm matinee, pushing ''Rent'' from the [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|tenth- to eleventh-longest-running Broadway show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/WICKED-Passes-RENT-to-Become-10th-Longest-Running-Show-on-Broadway-Today-20160214]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/75222-Long-Runs-on-Broadway]&lt;/ref&gt; The production grossed over $280 million.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[[Time Magazine]], March 10, 2008 issue, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions. In 2005, it was adapted into a [[Rent (film)|motion picture]] featuring most of the original cast members.

==Concept and genesis==
In 1988, playwright [[Billy Aronson]] wanted to create "a musical based on [[Puccini]]'s ''[[La Bohème]]'', in which the luscious splendor of Puccini's world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York."&lt;ref name="Aronson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billyaronson.com/musicals.php#rent |title=Musicals|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed together "Santa Fe", "Splatter" (later re-worked into the song "Rent"), and "I Should Tell You". Larson suggested setting the play "amid poverty, homelessness, spunky gay life, [[Drag queen|drag queens]] and [[Punk subculture|punk]]" in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], which happened to be down the street from his [[Greenwich Village]] apartment. He also came up with the show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that "rent" also means torn apart). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make ''Rent'' his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for ''Rent''; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera "to bring musical theater to the [[MTV Generation|MTV generation]]".&lt;ref name="Odyssey"&gt;{{cite news | last=Tommasini| first=Anthony| title=The Seven-Year Odyssey That Led to ''Rent''| work=The New York Times| date=1996-03-17| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E1D91639F934A25750C0A960958260| pages=Section 2 Page 7 | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for "original concept &amp; additional lyrics".&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;

Jonathan Larson focused on composing ''Rent'' in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the [[Moondance Diner]] to support himself. Over the course of years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of ''Rent''{{'}}s script. When ''Rent'' had its first staged reading at [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;

As of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of ''Rent'' featured songs that never made it to the final version, such as:

* "You're a Fool"
* "Do a Little Business", the predecessor of "You'll See", featuring Benny, Mark, Roger, Collins and Angel
* "Female to Female A &amp; B", featuring Maureen and Joanne
* "He's a Fool"
* "He Says"
* "Right Brain", later rewritten as "One Song Glory", featuring Roger
* "You'll Get Over It", the predecessor of "Tango: Maureen", featuring Mark and Maureen
* "Real Estate", a number wherein Benny tries to convince Mark to become a real estate agent and drop his filmmaking
* "Open Road", the predecessor of "What You Own", with a backing track similar to this in "Your Eyes"

This workshop version of ''Rent'' starred [[Anthony Rapp]] as Mark and [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] as Mimi. Larson continued to work on ''Rent'', gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions.&lt;ref name="Memoir"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rapp, Anthony|title=Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent|year=2006|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |ISBN=0-7432-6976-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 1996, after the musical's final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson had his first (and only) newspaper interview with music critic [[Anthony Tommasini]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera. Larson would not live to see ''Rent''{{'}}s success; he died from an undiagnosed [[aortic aneurysm]] (believed to have resulted from [[Marfan syndrome]]) in the early morning of January 25, 1996. Friends and family gathered at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the first preview of ''Rent'' became a sing-through of the musical in Larson's memory.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RentEW"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Rent star tells story of show’s first preview, after Jonathan Larson died| date=April 11, 2017| url=http://ew.com/theater/2017/04/11/rent-jonathan-larson-wilson-jermaine-heredia/| pages=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its Off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theater Workshop.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;  Due to such overwhelming popularity and a need for a larger theater, ''Rent'' moved to Broadway's recently remodeled Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;

==Sources and inspiration==
Larson's inspiration for ''Rent''{{'}}s content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera ''La Bohème'', the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before ''Rent''{{'}}s premiere.&lt;ref name="Rent: Leap of Faith"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent ("Leap of Faith")| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| pages=18–37| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Bohème'' was also about the lives of poor young artists. [[Tuberculosis]], the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in ''Rent''; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of ''Rent''{{'}}s characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in ''Rent'' represents the character of Alcindoro in ''Bohème'', but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only ''Rent'' character whose predecessor in ''La Bohème'' is the opposite sex.

Other examples of parallels between Larson's and Puccini's work include Larson's song "Light My Candle", which draws melodic content directly from "Che gelida manina";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisbet|first=Ian|title=Transposition in Jonathan Larson's RENT|journal=Studies in Musical Theatre|date=2012|volume=5|issue=3|page=237|doi=10.1386/smt.5.3.225_1|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=12998/|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Quando me'n vo'|Quando me'n vo]]'" ("Musetta's Waltz"), a melody taken directly from Puccini's opera; and "Goodbye Love", a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini's and Larson's work.&lt;ref name="Libretto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impresario.ch/libretto/libpucboh_e.htm|title=La Bohème&amp;nbsp;—Libretto in English|accessdate=|publisher=Kernkonzepte: Impresario|author=Puccini, Giacomo|authorlink=Giacomo Puccini}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Quando me'n vo'" is paralleled in the first verse of "[[Take Me or Leave Me]]", when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, "Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song..."  Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, "...that  ''doesn't'' remind us of 'Musetta's Waltz'." This part of "Musetta's Waltz" is also later used in "Your Eyes", a song Roger writes.

''Rent'' is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer [his guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in "Rent"]) made their way into the play.&lt;ref name="Beals"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beals, Gregory|title=The World of ''Rent''|journal=Newsweek|date=1996-05-13|volume=CXXVII|issue=20|pages=58–59}} ([http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/larson-jonathan/gregory-beals-essay-date-13-may-1996 Abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson's own girlfriend left him for a woman.  The Mark Cohen character is based on Larson's friends, cinematographer and producer Jonathan Burkhart and documentary filmmaker Eddie Rosenstein.

Playwright [[Sarah Schulman]] alleged that ''Rent'' bore striking similarities to her novel ''People in Trouble''.&lt;ref name="Schulman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2131017|accessdate=2011-03-03|title=Sarah Schulman: the writer Rent ripped off|date=November 23, 2005|first=June|last=Thomas|publisher=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line, "I'm more of a man than you'll ever be... and more of a woman than you'll ever get!", attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at her funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1987) and ''[[Mannequin Two: On the Move]]'' (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women's clothing. This line was originally in the film ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' (1976), delivered by [[Antonio Fargas]] as a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser.

The earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off [[Oedipus]] in her performance piece instead of [[Hey Diddle Diddle]]; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a [[jazz]] [[philosopher]], while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like "Real Estate", which was later cut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siteforrent.com/intro.html SiteforRent.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406222216/http://www.siteforrent.com/intro.html |date=2007-04-06 }} accessed April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WSTM Team Dustizeff 0098.jpg|thumb|Life Café]]

Many actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. Life Café, where the "La Vie Bohème" numbers are set, was an actual restaurant (closed 2013) on 10th Street and Avenue B in the East Village of New York City.&lt;ref name="Life Cafe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifecafenyc.com/ls_press.shtml |title=Making Rent; A Spell for Alphabet City|accessdate=2007-01-05|publisher=Life Cafe|year=1998|author=Ben Lerman |author2=Andrew Jacobs |work=Life Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rent: Connection"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rent ("Connection")|last=Larson|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997|pages=138–141|publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village [[Tompkins Square Park riot (1988)|riot in 1988]] that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in [[Tompkins Square Park]].&lt;ref name="Rent: Connection" /&gt;

"Will I?", a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with [[AIDS]], was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of [[Friends in deed|Friends in Deed]], an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or have died from AIDS.&lt;ref name="Rent: Friends In Deed"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent ("Leap of Faith: Friends in Deed")| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| page=21| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene and song "Life Support" were also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the "forget regret" refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this "credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?" Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, "Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?" Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, "Then why choose fear?" Gordon says, "I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life."

===Lynn Thomson lawsuit===
Lynn Thomson was a [[dramaturge|dramaturg]] who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework ''Rent''. She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a "new version" of the musical. She sued the Larson estate for US$ 40 million and sought 16% of the show's royalties, claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the "new version" of ''Rent''.&lt;ref name="dramaturgy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/147/f3d/195/thomson-v-s-larson|title=147 f3d 195 Thomson v. S Larson|accessdate=2014-07-07|publisher=OpenJurist.com|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, Thomson could not recall the lyrics to the songs that she allegedly wrote, nor the structures of the libretto she claimed to have created.&lt;ref name = Playbill97&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/rent-dramaturg-suit-dismissed-com-71067|title =Rent Dramaturg Suit Dismissed|last = Lefkowitz|first = David|website = [[Playbill]]|date = July 23, 1997|accessdate = July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge ruled against her and gave the Jonathan Larson Estate full credit and right to ''Rent''. A federal appellate court upheld the original ruling on appeal. In August 1998, the case was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/10/theater/family-of-rent-creator-settles-suit-over-authorship.html|title = Family of 'Rent' Creator Settles Suit Over Authorship|last = McKinley|first = Jesse|date = September 10, 1998|website = [[The New York Times]]|accessdate = July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[Image:Rentt.JPG|thumb|250px|right|''Rent'' at David Nederlander Theatre in Manhattan, New York City]]

===Act I===
On Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates—Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician—struggle to stay warm and produce their art ("Tune Up #1"). Mark's mother leaves him a voicemail wishing him a merry Christmas and trying to comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him ("Voice Mail #1"). Their friend Tom Collins, a gay anarchist professor at New York University, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger's former roommate and friend Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year's rent, before shutting down their electrical power ("Tune Up #2"). However, Mark and Roger rebel and resolve not to pay the rent they cannot pay and which they were promised wouldn't be a problem ("Rent"). Meanwhile, Angel, a [[cross-dressing]] street drummer (presently out of drag), finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him ("You Okay Honey?") - the two are immediately attracted to each other, both learning that the other is [[HIV positive]]. It is revealed that Roger too has HIV which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who committed [[suicide]] after learning of her diagnosis, which has caused Roger to fall into depression. Mark goes to see one of Maureen's shows while Roger stays home ("Tune Up #3"), trying to compose on his guitar without success; he wishes desperately to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies ("One Song Glory"). An exotic dancer, junkie, and neighbor, Mimi, shows up at their apartment asking for help with lighting her candle, flirting with Roger in the process; however, he is clearly hesitant to return her affections ("Light My Candle"). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen's girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents ("Voice Mail #2").

At last, the missing Collins enters the apartment, presenting Angel, who is now in [[drag queen|full drag]] and shares the money she made and the amusing story of how she killed a dog to earn it ("Today 4 U"). Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen's upcoming protest against his plans to evict the [[homeless]] from a lot where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves ("You'll See"). Mark leaves to fix Maureen's sound equipment for the protest, unexpectedly meeting Joanne at the stage. Initially hesitant with each other, the two eventually bond over their shared distrust of Maureen's promiscuous behaviors ("Tango: Maureen"). Mark joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting ("Life Support"), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment ("Out Tonight"). Roger is extremely upset by Mimi's intrusion, demanding she leave him alone and resisting any romantic feelings he may harbor for her ("Another Day"). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying an undignified death from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts ("Will I").

Collins, Mark, and Angel protect a homeless woman from police harassment, but she chastises them ("On the Street"). To lighten the mood, Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York City to open a restaurant in Santa Fe ("Santa Fe"). Soon, Mark leaves to check up on Roger and while alone, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other ("I'll Cover You"). Joanne hectically prepares for Maureen's show, trying to balance all of the people calling her at once ("We're Okay"). Before the performance, Roger apologizes to Mimi, inviting her to come to the protest and the dinner party his friends are having afterwards. At the same time, police, vendors, and homeless people prepare for the protest ("Christmas Bells"). Maureen begins her avant-garde, if not over the top, performance based on "[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]" ("Over the Moon"). At the post-show party at the Life Café, Benny arrives, criticizing the protest and the group's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle. In response, Mark and all the café's bohemian patrons defiantly rise up to celebrate their way of living ("[[La Vie Bohème]]"). Mimi and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive and hesitantly decide to move forward with their relationship ("I Should Tell You"). Joanne explains that Mark and Roger's building has been padlocked and a riot has broken out; Roger and Mimi, unaware, share their first kiss. The celebration continues ("La Vie Bohème B").

===Act II===
[[Image:Cast of Rent performing "Seasons of Love" at Broadway on Broadway, 2005.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Cast of ''Rent'' performing "Seasons of Love" at ''Broadway on Broadway'', 2005]]

The cast lines up to sing together before the plot of the second act begins, affirming that one should measure life "in love" ("[[Seasons of Love]]"). Afterwards, Mark and Roger gather to break back into their locked apartment with their friends ("Happy New Year"). A new voicemail reveals that Mark's footage of the riot has earned him a job offering at a [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] news company called Buzzline ("Voice Mail #3"). The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives, saying he wants to call a truce and revealing that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind. Mimi denies rekindling her relationship with Benny, but Roger is upset, and although they apologize to each other, Mimi goes to her drug dealer for a fix ("Happy New Year B").

Around Valentine's Day, Mark tells the audience that Roger and Mimi have been living together, but they are tentative with each other. It is also told that Maureen and Joanne are preparing another protest, and during rehearsal, Maureen criticizes Joanne's [[controlling behavior]] and Joanne criticizes Maureen's promiscuous mannerisms. They break up dramatically following an ultimatum ("[[Take Me or Leave Me]]"). Time progresses to spring ("Seasons of Love B"), but Roger and Mimi's relationship is strained by Mimi's escalating [[heroin]] usage and Roger's lasting jealousy and suspicion of Benny. Each alone, Roger and Mimi sing of love and loneliness, telling each other how they feel, as they watch Collins nurse Angel, whose health is declining due to AIDS ("Without You"). By the end of the summer, Mark continues to receive calls offering a corporate job at Buzzline ("Voice Mail #4"). A dance is performed representing all the couples' sex lives ("Contact"). At the climax of the number, the two former couples break up, and Angel suddenly dies. At the funeral, the friends briefly come together to share their memories with Collins being the last to reminisce ("I'll Cover You [Reprise]"). Mark expresses his fear of being the only one left surviving when the rest of his friends die of AIDS, and he finally accepts the corporate job offer ("Halloween"). Roger reveals that he is leaving for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, and between Maureen and Joanne. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel's funeral, causing Maureen and Joanne to reconcile, but not Mimi and Roger. The group shares a sad moment, knowing that between deaths and leaving, their close-knit friendships will be breaking up. Everyone leaves except Mark and Roger, and so Mark tries to convince Roger to stay in New York. Roger, unable to handle Mimi's declining health, becomes angry with Mark and leaves. Mimi returns to say goodbye, overhears everything Roger says, and, terrified, agrees to go to rehab ("Goodbye Love"). Collins is forcibly removed from the church for being unable to pay for Angel's funeral; Benny shows compassion by paying and offering Mark and Collins drinks; Collins accepts, causing him and Collins to rekindle their old friendship, but Mark has to turn down the offer due to work commitments.

Some time later, both Mark and Roger simultaneously reach an artistic [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel's memory; Roger decides to return to New York in time for Christmas, while Mark quits his job to devote his efforts to working on his own film ("What You Own"). The characters' parents, concerned and confused about their respective situations, leave several worried messages on their phones ("Voice Mail #5"). On Christmas Eve, exactly one year having passed, Mark prepares to screen his now-completed film to his friends. Roger has written his song, but no one can find Mimi for him to play it to. Benny's wife, discovering Benny's relationship with Mimi, has pulled Benny out of the East Village. The power suddenly blows and Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] at a grocery store to provide money to anybody with the code 'ANGEL'. Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who had been homeless and is now weak and close to death. She begins to fade, telling Roger that she loves him ("Finale"). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, revealing the depth of his feelings for her ("Your Eyes"). Mimi appears to die, but abruptly awakens, claiming to have been heading into a [[near-death experience|white light]] before a vision of Angel appeared, telling her to go back and stay with Roger. The remaining friends gather together in a final moment of shared happiness and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other, affirming that there is "no day but today" ("[[Finale B]]").&lt;ref name="Rent: No Day but Today"&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent (''no day but today'')| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson |author2=McDonnell, Evelyn |author3=Silberger, Katherine |year=1997| pages=188–189| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==

===Main characters===
&lt;!--NOTE: DO NOT ADD SINGING RANGES. This is original research--&gt;
* '''Mark Cohen''' (Lead): A struggling Jewish-American documentary filmmaker and the [[narrator]] of the show. He is Roger's roommate; at the start of the show, he was recently dumped by Maureen.
* '''Roger Davis''' (Lead): A once-successful-but-now-struggling musician and ex-lead singer and rock guitarist who is HIV-positive and an ex-junkie. He hopes to write one last meaningful song before he dies.  He is having a hard time coping with the fact that he, along with many others around him, knows that he is going to die. His girlfriend, April, killed herself after finding out that she was HIV-positive. He is roommates with Mark.
* '''Mimi Márquez''' (Lead): A Hispanic-American S&amp;M club dancer and drug addict. She lives downstairs from Mark and Roger, is Roger's love interest, and, like him, is HIV-positive. She is also Benny's ex-lover.
* '''Tom Collins''' (Support): An [[Anarchism|anarchist]] professor with AIDS. He is described by Mark as a "computer genius, teacher, and vagabond anarchist who ran naked through the [[Parthenon]]." Collins dreams of opening a restaurant in Santa Fe, where the problems in New York will not affect him and his friends. He was formerly a roommate of Roger, Mark, Benny, and Maureen, then just Roger and Mark, until he moves out.
* '''Angel Dumott Schunard''' (Support): A young drag queen who uses both she/her pronouns when in drag and he/him pronouns when out of drag. Angel is a  street percussionist with a generous disposition, who has AIDS; Collins' love interest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtishows.com/full-cast-info/1157&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''{{visible anchor|Maureen Johnson}}''' (Support): A [[performance art]]ist who is Mark's ex-girlfriend and Joanne's current girlfriend. She is very flirtatious and cheated on Mark (presumably with Joanne). Larson considered Maureen a lesbian, despite her previous relationships with men, and he specifically identified her as "lesbian" in the script itself.&lt;ref name="Rent: Leap of Faith" /&gt;
* '''Joanne Jefferson''' (Support): An Ivy League-educated public interest [[lawyer]] and a [[lesbian]]. Joanne is the woman for whom Maureen left Mark. Joanne has very politically powerful parents (one is undergoing confirmation to be a judge, the other is a government official).
* '''Benjamin "Benny" Coffin III''' (Support): [[Landlord]] of Mark, Roger, and Mimi's apartment building and ex-roommate of Mark, Collins, Roger, and Maureen. Now married to Alison Grey of the Westport Greys, a very wealthy family involved in real estate, and he is considered [[yuppie]] scum and a sell-out by his ex-roommates. He at one time had a relationship with Mimi.

== Reception ==
''Rent'' received several awards including a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] and four [[Tony Award|Tony Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/cast-rent-article-1.2478997|title=Where the cast of "Rent" is now|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reception of ''Rent'' was positive not only for its acting and musical components, but for its representation of HIV-positive individuals. Many critics praised the portrayal of characters such as Angel and Collins as being happy, with positive outlooks on life, rather than being resigned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/rkee5nh4_woa/no-day-but-today-the-critical-reception-of-rent/|title=No Day But Today: The Critical Reception of RENT|website=prezi.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; While critics and theatre patrons had largely positive reviews of the show, criticism was given to the show for the stereotypically negative portrayal of lesbian characters and the "glamourization" of the East Village in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121331730861070229|title=Among the 'Rentheads'|last=Hymowitz|first=Kay S.|date=2008-06-13|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billy Aronson said, "For the record, although I was ambivalent about Jonathan’s ideas for ''Rent'' when we were working together on it, I have come to love the show. And as tragic as it is that he didn’t live to see his work become a huge success, I believe he knew it would be. In our last conversation I asked how the show was going and he said, with complete assurance, that it was incredible."&lt;ref name="Aronson"/&gt;

==Cultural impact and legacy==
The song "Seasons of Love" became a successful pop song and often is performed on its own. Because of its connection to [[New Years]] and looking back at times past, it is sometimes performed at graduations or school holiday programs.

===RENT-heads===
''Rent'' gathered a following of fans who refer to themselves as "RENT-heads."  The name originally referred to people who would camp out at the Nederlander Theater for hours in advance for the discounted $20 rush tickets to each show, though it generally refers to anyone who is obsessed with the show.&lt;ref name="Time for 'Rent'"&gt;Adams, Bob.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20021024083952/http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Village/1432/phillynews8.html "Time for 'Rent'",] ''The Philadelphia Gay News'', August 14, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  These discounted tickets were for seats in the first two rows of the theater reserved for sale by lottery two hours prior to each show.&lt;ref name="Time for 'Rent'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reidel Party"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Riedel, Michael|title=Every Day a 'Rent' Party: hardcore fans of the hit musical form a squatters camp at the box office|date=1997-03-03|page=27|location=New York |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Broadway shows have followed ''Rent''{{'}}s example and now also offer cheaper tickets in efforts to make Broadway theater accessible to people who would otherwise be unable to afford the ticket prices.

The term originated in ''Rent''{{'}}s first months on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The show's producers offered 34 seats in the front two rows of the orchestra for $20 each, two hours before the performance. Fans and others interested in tickets would camp out for hours in front of the [[Nederlander Theater]] – which is on 41st Street, just outside [[Times Square]] – to buy these tickets.&lt;ref name="Reidel Party"/&gt;

==Productions==

===New York workshops and off-Broadway production===
''Rent'' had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;  A further two-week [[New York Theatre Workshop]] version was performed in 1994 starring Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and more workshops followed. The show opened on 1996, again at New York Theatre Workshop, and quickly gained popularity off-Broadway, receiving enthusiastic reviews.  ''The New York Times'' theater critic [[Ben Brantley]] called it an "exhilarating, landmark rock opera" with a "glittering, inventive score" that "shimmers with hope for the future of the American musical."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E7DC1239F937A25751C0A960958260 "Rock Opera A la 'Boheme' And 'Hair'",] ''The New York Times'', February 14, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reviewer wrote, "''Rent'' speaks to [[Generation X]] the way that the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' spoke to the [[baby boomers]] or those who grew up in the 1960s," while the ''New York Times'' similarly called it "a rock opera for our time, a ''Hair'' for the 90s."&lt;ref name="Comet"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Birth of a Theatrical Comet|journal=The New York Times|date=1996-03-17|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B10F83D5D0C748DDDAA0894DE494D81|pages=Section 2 page 1|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show proved extremely successful off-Broadway, selling out all of its performances at the 150-seat theatre.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;

===Original Broadway production===
Due to its overwhelming popularity and the need for a larger theater, ''Rent'' moved to Broadway's previously derelict Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="Rent: Glory"/&gt;  On Broadway, the show achieved critical acclaim and word-of-mouth popularity. The production's ethnically diverse principal cast originally included [[Taye Diggs]], [[Wilson Jermaine Heredia]], [[Jesse L. Martin]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Adam Pascal]], [[Anthony Rapp]], [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] and [[Fredi Walker]].

The production's controversial topics and innovative pricing, including same day-of-performance $20 tickets, helped to increase the popularity of musical theater amongst the younger generation.&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Marks, Peter| title=Looking on Broadway For Ramshackle Home| journal=The New York Times| date=February 26, 1996| page=C9| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FD3A5D0C758EDDAB0894DE494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fN%2fNew%20York%20Theater%20Workshop| access-date=February 12, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529083704/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FD3A5D0C758EDDAB0894DE494D81&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FN%2FNew%20York%20Theater%20Workshop| archive-date=May 29, 2007| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production was nominated for ten [[Tony Awards]] in 1996 and won four: Best Musical, Best Book, Best Original Score and Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical (Heredia)&lt;ref name="Tonys Search"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search?year=1996&amp;show=Rent|title=Past Winners Search|accessdate=November 30, 2006 |publisher=IBM Corp., Tony Award Productions|work=The Official Website of the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2006, the original Broadway cast reunited for a one-night performance of the musical at the Nederlander Theatre. This performance raised over $2,000,000 for the [[Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation]], [[Friends In Deed]] and New York Theatre Workshop. Former cast members were invited, and many from prior tours and former Broadway casts appeared, performing an alternate version of "Seasons of Love" as the finale of the performance.&lt;ref name="Playbill 10th"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98789.html|title=''Rent''{{'}}s 10th Anniversary Celebration Will Reunite Past Bohemians, for Three Good Causes|publisher=Playbill, Inc.|date=2006-03-30|author=Jones, Kenneth|accessdate=November 30, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224123746/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98789.html|archivedate=December 24, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American touring productions===
Successful United States national tours, the "Angel Tour" and the "Benny Tour", launched in the 1990s. Later, the non-[[Actors' Equity|Equity]] tour started its run. There was also a Canadian tour (often referred to as the "Collins Tour").

The Angel tour began in November 1996 in Boston. Anthony Rapp joined the cast for the Chicago run, and Daphne Rubin-Vega joined for the Los Angeles run. The tour finished in San Francisco in September 1999. Other members of the Angel Cast included [[Carrie Hamilton]], [[Amy Spanger]], [[Luther Creek]], [[Kristoffer Cusick]], [[Tony Vincent]].

The Benny Tour began in July 1997 in San Diego, CA at the LaJolla Playhouse. Michael Grief, the original director of the Broadway show was also the artistic director of the LaJolla Playhouse and was instrumental in arranging for the Benny tour to begin in the smaller city of San Diego rather than Los Angeles, CA. It originally featured [[Neil Patrick Harris]] in the role of Mark Cohen. The Benny tour generally played shorter stops and often-smaller markets than the Angel Tour did. Other cast members included [[Wilson Cruz]] and [[d'Monroe]].

Tours ran each season from 2005 to 2008. Cast members throughout the run included [[Aaron Tveit]], [[Ava Gaudet]], [[Declan Bennett]], [[Rebecca Naomi Jones]], [[Constantine Maroulis]], [[Dan Rosenbaum]], [[Heinz Winckler]], [[Anwar Robinson]] and [[Karen Olivo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} In 2009, a national tour starring Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp, reprising their original Broadway roles, launched in Cleveland, OH.

The show made its UK premiere on April 21, 1998, at the West End's [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] and officially opened on May 12, 1998. The original cast included Krysten Cummings as Mimi Marquez, Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel Schunard, Bonny Lockhart as Benjamin Coffin III, Jesse L. Martin as Tom Collins, Adam Pascal as Roger Davis, Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, and Jessica Tezier as Maureen Johnson. The show closed on October 30, 1999, after one-and-a-half years.

On October 16, 2007, the heavily revised production titled ''Rent Remixed'' opened at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London's West End.

The Guardian gave it only one out of five stars, writing, "They call this 'Rent Remixed'. I'd dub it 'Rent Reduced', in that the late Jonathan Larson's reworking of La Bohème, while never a great musical, has been turned into a grisly, synthetic, pseudo pop concert with no particular roots or identity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/reviews/story/0,,2192137,00.html Rent | Theatre story|Guardian Unlimited Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The production closed on February 2, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113661.html|title=New  London Production of Rent to Close in February 2008|work=Playbill|accessdate=23 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229072708/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113661.html|archivedate=29 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production radically altered elements of the musical including defining the characters of Mimi, Angel and Mark as British. Songs were reordered (including Maureen's first appearance as the Act I finale).  The rehaul of the score was masterminded by [[Steve Anderson (musician)|Steve Anderson]] and featured radically rearranged versions of Out Tonight, Today 4 U, Over the Moon and Happy New Year.

A one-off Rent - The 20th Anniversary Concert was held at the Blackpool Opera house   Monday November 11, 2013

===Off-Broadway revival===
The show was revived [[Off-Broadway]] at Stage 1 of [[New World Stages]] with previews starting July 14, 2011 and a scheduled opening of August 11, 2011. This was the first New York Revival of the show since the original production closed less than three years earlier. The production was directed by ''Rent'''s original director [[Michael Greif]].  Almost the entire show was different from the original yet the reinvention did not please the critics, who complained that the new actors did not have a feel for the characters they were playing and it made the show feel contrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/theater/reviews/rent-revival-at-new-world-stages-review.html?scp=1&amp;sq=rent&amp;st=cse |work=The New York Times|first=Ben|last=Brantley|title=‘Rent' Revival at New World Stages – Review|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Off-Broadway production of RENT closed on September 9, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/169812-Off-Broadways-Rent-Closes-Sept-9 |title=Off-Broadway's Rent Closes Sept. 9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913000902/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/169812-Off-Broadways-Rent-Closes-Sept-9 |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring''''' is a 1943 painting by the British painter [[Laura Knight]] depicting a young woman, '''Ruby Loftus''' (1921–2004), working at an industrial lathe as part of the [[Home front during World War II#Britain and Commonwealth|British war effort in World War II]]. The painting was commissioned by the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] (WAAC), and is now part of the [[Imperial War Museum]]'s art collection. The painting brought instant fame to Loftus, and has been likened to the American figure of "[[Rosie the Riveter]]".&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard A.

==Background==
The [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] (WAAC) commissioned the British painter [[Laura Knight]] to paint a portrait to bolster female recruitment to the ordnance factories as the [[Ministry of Supply]] were concerned at the level of disaffection and absenteeism among women in the factories. The resulting painting, made in the autumn of 1942, is one of the largest oil paintings in the entire WAAC collection and the largest single figure portrait it acquired throughout the war.&lt;ref name="Foss"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brain Foss|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|title=War paint: Art, War, State and Identity in Britain, 1939–1945 |ISBN=978-0-300-10890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted in the [[Royal Ordnance Factory]] in [[Newport, South Wales]], and shows a young woman, Ruby Loftus, performing a highly skilled piece of work on an industrial lathe. The component being worked is the breech ring of a Bofors anti-aircraft gun designed to fire one hundred twenty rounds per minute. Any lack of precision in forming the breech ring could result in the gun being destroyed when fired. In peacetime this task would only be performed by a man with eight or nine years' experience but the 21-year-old Loftus mastered the technique after only a year or two of training.&lt;ref name="Canadian War Museum-Ruby Loftus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cwm/exhibitions/artwar/artworks/ld_2850_screwing-breech-ring_e.shtml |title=Ruby Loftus screwing a breech-ring&amp;nbsp;– Dame Laura Knight RA (1877–1970) |publisher=[[Canadian War Museum]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wartime Newport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wartimenewport.virtuallyhere.co.uk/pages.php?page_id=54|title=A Gun Girl&amp;nbsp;– Ruby Loftus&amp;nbsp;– Dame Laura Knight's Newport commission|publisher=Wartime Newport: The Home Front|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318192932/http://www.wartimenewport.virtuallyhere.co.uk/pages.php?page_id=54|archivedate=18 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Imperial War Museum-Ruby Loftus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/15504 |title=Ruby Loftus screwing a breech-ring&amp;nbsp;– Dame Laura Knight RA (1877–1970) |publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Knight was initially offered 75 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for the commission, which she regarded as quite low for the effort and trouble involved in creating the work, and asked that the fee be raised to "100 guineas and expenses...which is infinitely lower than I should ask for any other work than that connected with the war".&lt;ref name="Wartime Newport"/&gt; Her request was granted. Knight stayed in Newport to paint the picture, and over four weeks painted Loftus at work on her lathe.&lt;ref name="Wartime Newport"/&gt;

The painting was first shown on 30 April 1943 at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]]. The next day it was reproduced in eight British newspapers. A British Paramount News [[newsreel]] film, shot two days before the painting's unveiling and featuring the painting, Knight and Loftus, was shown in Britain's cinemas.&lt;ref name="Foss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LoftusStory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loftusgardenvillage.co.uk/the-story/ruby-loftus/|title=Loftus Garden Village – The story – Ruby Loftus|publisher=Loftus Garden Village|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221181047/http://www.loftusgardenvillage.co.uk/the-story/ruby-loftus/|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus was suddenly famous; she was interviewed on the [[BBC]] and her picture appeared in newspapers all over Britain.&lt;ref name="LoftusStory"/&gt; The painting was also reproduced in a poster version by WAAC.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite book|author=Caroline Fox |title= Dame Laura Knight|year= 1988 |publisher= [[Phaidon Press]] |location= Oxford |isbn= 0-7148-2447-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the painting led to further industrial commissions for Knight throughout the 1940s. In 1945 she painted ''Switch Works'' at Ellison Switchgear in [[Birmingham]]. This was followed by paintings of operations at the Dow Mac concrete railway-sleeper works and at the Skefko ball bearing factory.&lt;ref name="Broadley"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosie Broadley|publisher= National Portrait Gallery,London|year=2013|title=Laura Knight Portraits|ISBN=978-1-85514-463-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Loftus married [[Lance corporal#United Kingdom|Lance Corporal]] John Green in September 1943, and took her husband's surname. After the war, she was offered an opportunity to take an engineering course, but decided against it and emigrated to Canada with her husband, eventually settling in [[Winfield, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="LoftusStory"/&gt;{{deadlink|date=April 2018}} Loftus was later diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]]. In British Columbia, she worked as an apple packer, in a post office, and as a correspondent for a local newspaper. Loftus travelled to London to see her portrait in the [[Imperial War Museum]] in May 1962, where she was accompanied by Laura Knight. Loftus's husband died in 2003, and she died in June 2004 at the age of 83.&lt;ref name="LoftusStory"/&gt;
 
A housing development named after Loftus, Loftus Garden Village, is planned for the site of the Royal Ordnance Factory Number 11, the location of the painting.&lt;ref name="LoftusGard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loftusgardenvillage.co.uk/the-story/|title=Loftus Garden Village – The story|publisher=Loftus Garden Village|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221180927/http://www.loftusgardenvillage.co.uk/the-story/|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting returned to Newport in 2006 when it was displayed as part of a project recording the recollections of women who had worked at the Royal Ordnance Factory.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/5203414.stm|title=Iconic war painting returns home|date=22 July 2006|work=BBC News Online|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2013 and 2014 the painting was displayed at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]], and then at the [[Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery]], as part of the ''Laura Knight Portraits'' exhibition,&lt;ref name="AHam"&gt;{{cite web |author=Adrian Hamilton|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/human-touch-laura-knights-national-portrait-gallery-show-is-a-timely-reminder-of-her-talent-8724713.html |title=Human touch:Laura Knight's NPG show is a timely reminder of her talent|date=22 July 2013|accessdate=10 February 2014|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being returned to the Imperial War Museum in July 2014.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Samikshavad.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Politicians of Today'' by Ram Chandra Shukla]] --&gt;'''Samikshavad''' is the first indigenous [[art movement]] in modern [[India]], which started in [[North India]] in 1974. It has a different identity from the western movements of art. It is neither affected nor inspired by western art.

Its main source of inspiration is the present social, political, cultural and economic conditions. Its aim is to make the art free from personalized obligations and to socialize it, to change the art from mystery to something having special aim. By this style, the artist tends to expose the corruption prevalent in society and politics, with a language that is symbolic and satirical. This movement has changed the scenario of modern Indian painting in India in the late '70s. A few of the artists who were inspired by this movement were Ravindra Nath Mishra, Hridya Narayan Mishra, Santosh Kumar Singh, Virendra Prasad Singh, Ram Shabd Singh, Raghuvir Sen Dhir, Ved Prakash Mishra, Gopal Madhukar Chaturvedi, Bala Dutt Pandey etc. Prof. [[Ram Chandra Shukla]], Professor and Head of the Department of Painting at [[Banaras Hindu University]], [[Varanasi]], at that time, was the initiator and the main source of inspiration for this movement.

==The theme of Samikshavad==

Samikshavad is an Indian movement of Modern Art which is opposed to the tendency of Indian artists following the Western trends of Modern Art. Its basic purpose is to help create such an art in the country which has its roots in Indian soil. "Samiksha" is a Sanskrit word which means criticism of life and society in which they live. It is also against any type of imitation of the past styles or the present styles of art. A manifesto of the movement was published at the first exhibition of such paintings at the [[AIFACS]] Gallery in 1979 at Delhi. The exhibition presented in all, 26 paintings in oil medium. The artists whose works were included in the first exhibition were S/s R.C. Shukla, R.S. Dhir, Santosh Kumar Singh and Ved Prakash Mishra from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi; Dr. Gopal Madhukar Chaturvedi from Aligarh and Bala Dutt Pandey from Allahabad. The exhibition was inaugurated by the well-known "young Turk" Shri Chandra Shekhar, then President of the [[Janata Party]]. Since then lots of comments, reviews and articles have come from several of the leading newspapers, weeklies and art journals referring to this movement. Invitations have been received from several parts of India to hold exhibitions there. There is a silent but meaningful whisper in the air about "Samikshavad" in Indian art circles. Several illustrated lecture programs on Samikshavad have been sponsored by university art departments at different places. The movement has gained ground in the country and has created a new atmosphere in the field of art for an indigenous development of Indian Modern Art. The only hurdle in the way of Indian art is prejudice, ''purvagrah'' (bias) and misconception. Samikshavad is a modern movement of Indian contemporary art.

The exhibition at Delhi was visited by thousands of people{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} including well-known artists, art critics, art connoisseurs, journalists and the common people.

Modern Western art is either an expression of the artists' inner turmoil and tensions or mere feats of colour and form. Mostly it is aimless or personal fad. Can such art ever become popular and useful to society at large? But capitalist society has accepted it as a form of business transactions. They collect art and sell art just to make capital out of it. In a poor country like India art cannot fulfill that aim. Art can have no other aim but to serve the people, to inspire and educate them, to prepare them for a better life and society. And "Samikshavad" aims at that.

"Samikshavadi" artists are not at all interested in merely showing feats of colour and form. Colour and form or their composition, in itself that of abstract art, may produce a musical or magical effect, but art cannot survive or thrive on that alone. Such music or magic, if they just remain to be a form of entertainment and do not serve a higher purpose of social uplift, cannot claim to be great art. They may remain in the category of crafts. But those crafts which are not useful like "witch-craft" have no place in modern society. Today the so-called Modern Artists who are better than such craftsmen, when called upon to explain the purpose of their art, prattle, "We create 'Form', 'Colour composition' or 'Symbol'". They go no further and expect the visitor to appreciate and explain their jargon themselves. Line, form, colour, texture or tones are just elements of the language of art. They cannot be an end in themselves. They have to be used skilfully to serve the purpose of communication or expression. If they fail in this they are just like heaps of useless bricks, sand and cement gathered together. They cannot claim to be purposeful if they do not help in creating a building suitable for human living. "Samikshavadi" painters are not interested in showing their excellence of skill or painterly qualities as an end in itself.

They believe in using simple, direct and powerful language of art to express their ideas and feelings forcefully as witnessed in the folk arts. Painterly qualities or the fineries of art are the fads of a capitalist or feudalistic society; they are not at all needed in the socialistic society.
Samikshavadi painters use a symbolic language. They express their ideas and feelings through common and powerful symbols. It is because of this that sometimes they are mistaken for Surrealists, which they certainly are not. Surrealists are also supposed to use dream symbols influenced by Freud's dream psychology, and they claimed it to be "pure psychic automatism through which it is intended to express the true functioning of thought. Thought dictated in the absence of all control exerted by reason", whereas Samikshavadis use common symbols consciously and rationally to express their desired idea. Surrealist works are mystic and fantastic in nature but a Samikshavadi artist is socially motivated; a Surrealist attitude is highly personal and individual whereas a Samikshavadi attitude is generally impersonal. Surrealism is basically an anti-art movement but Samikshavadi is an art movement suited to the present atmosphere in the country.

It is generally satirical in nature. The element of satire is its specialty. Up till now the element of satire was generally considered to be a feature of cartoons or caricatures.  Never before in the history of Indian art was satire used as an important medium of art expression in the form of painting, as seen in Samikshavadi art. Perhaps satire was not considered to be necessary or advisable in painting because ancient and medieval art was mostly religious, mythological and idealistic. Under the present circumstances and social change art cannot remain only religious. It has tended towards secularism. The Samikshavadi painters are motivated by day-to-day happenings and are sensitive to the political and social conditions in which they live today. The social, political and economic problems of India are depressing. Life is becoming insecure and helpless. Poverty has multiplied. Exploitation is at its height. Under such circumstances artists and writers have to play an important role. They cannot just remain in a dreamland. They have to educate their people and awaken them to be prepared to fight the evils of the society. Satire is a powerful media to bring to bring people back to senses. Satire can give a shock treatment to generate a new energy in the people to face the real problems, to transform the society. Samikshavad aims at that and that is why it has taken a new course which was not commonly used in the field of painting up till now. Their path may appear to the prejudiced person aesthetically unsound but it is socially very promising.

It is true that Samikshavadi painters are against imagination of any of the past styles or isms of art of the East or the West, but sometimes their work may indicate some influences. This may either be consciously done or just due to past habit, and may disappear after some time. But whatever influences are seen they are generally of a technical nature. Samikshavadi painters are free to choose any technique that serves them in expressing their ideas and feelings powerfully. Some of the Samikshavadis are interested in using techniques of the past Indian Art to become more meaningful and effective. This does not mean that they are tied to any traditional style. Technique and style or "isms" are not the same thing.

The themes of Samikshavadi paintings are taken from social life of the common people. It is not something new. Many artists have done so in the past and are still doing so. In India [[Amrita Shergil]] was the first important and powerful painter of social life. Satish Gujral in his early phase also painted social life powerfully. Others have also done it. But there is a difference of approach between them and Samikshavadi painters. Most of the artists have been interested in their day-to-day social life. That also is no doubt important and useful in bringing about social change but Samikshavadi painters are not contented with that only. They have gone a step further. They may show the plight of the people also but they are much more interested in attacking those who are responsible for it. If the causes are exposed the people will be more alert to eradicate them. Their description of the malady suggests lines of treatment. Moreover, Samikshavadi painters are generally interested in conscious symbolic sarcasm which is definitely a new phenomenon in the field of painting. This attitude has been witnessed casually in some form or the other in some of the artists' work in India and abroad, but never before it has come out as a combined movement with this particular purpose. Mostly other painters have been just satisfied in mocking the contemporary life pattern as did the pop artist of the west, which has been nothing but an anti-art attitude, or the Surrealists' like that of Chagall and Richard Hamilton. Bhupen Khokhor of India has followed the same attitude of the pop artist of the West.

'''Suzanne Jackson''' (American, born 1944) is a visual artist with a luminous career spanning five decades with work exhibited in museums and galleries around the world. Since the late 1960s, Jackson dedicated her life to studio art with additional participation in the theatre, teaching, arts administration, community life, and social activism. Jackson’s oeuvre includes poetry, dance, theater and costume design, paintings (both two- and three-dimensional), prints, and drawings. Jackson has spent a time throughout her career teaching students and influencing future generations of artists and culture creators, as well as building and participating in close-knit art communities with peer artists and thinkers: San Francisco State (College) University and Bay Area artists and teachers including Charles White; Los Angeles during the 1960s-80s including [[Suzanne Jackson (artist)#Gallery 32|Gallery 32]] which she founded, its artistic circle, as well as her representation by Ankrum Gallery; life in Idyllwild, CA in the 1980s teaching and creating art; Yale University; the theatre communities in California, New Haven, CT, New York, NY, and Philadelphia, PA in the 1990s; and the Savannah, GA art community since 1996.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Jackson was born in [[St. Louis|Saint Louis, MO]] and her family moved to [[San Francisco|San Francisco, CA]] when she was nine months old. Jackson lived in San Francisco until she was eight years old, Jackson was then raised in the city of [[Fairbanks, Alaska]] from 1952-61 (both during its time as a Territory and early Statehood), graduating from [[Monroe Catholic High School|Monroe High School]] in 1961—the only Catholic high school in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fairbanks]] and the northernmost Roman Catholic high school in the Americas .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a teenager in Alaska, she became a member of the [[National Audubon Society]] which has influenced some of the content of her work from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=South of Pico: African American Artists in Los Angeles in the 1960s and 1970s|last=Jones|first=Kellie|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=Durham, NC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the first African American to attend the [[4-H|National 4-H]] [http://national4-hcongress.com/ Congress] in  Chicago in 1960 which helped her receive scholarships and allowed her to attend college.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewFile.do?contentFileId=2383743|title=Interview with Suzanne Jackson|last=Mason, Karen Anne (interviewer)|first=Suzanne Jackson (interviewee)|date=UCLA Library Digital Collections, Oral History Collections, African American Artists of Los Angeles|website=|archive-url=http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewFile.do?contentFileId=2383743|archive-date=1998|dead-url=|access-date=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received the "World Peace, Humane Society, and Kindness to Animals" scholarship from The International Latham Foundation, the [[Banff Centre|Banff School of Fine Arts]] Scholarship, the [[Standard Oil]] Scholarship, and National Home Study Art Course.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Art Education ===
Jackson moved to the Bay Area in 1961 to attend [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State (College) University]], where she studied both art and ballet, eventually receiving a BA in painting in 1966. She later completed an MFA from the [[Yale School of Drama|School of Drama]], [[Yale University]], in 1990, specializing in theater design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1960s-1970s ===

At the age of 17, Jackson moved from Alaska to the Bay Area to attend college. She remained on the West Coast through the 1960s and ‘70s, mostly moving between Los Angeles and San Francisco. She opened [[Suzanne Jackson (artist)#Gallery 32|Gallery 32]] in Los Angeles which operated from 1968-70 (see [[Suzanne Jackson (artist)#Gallery 32|Gallery 32]]). Jackson’s artwork was represented by the Ankrum Gallery from 1968 until 1989 and held solo exhibitions there in 1972, 1974, 1976, and 1978.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/ankrum-gallery-records-6569/historical-note Ankrum Gallery] was run by [https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=joan-wheeler-ankrum&amp;pid=170437 Joan Ankrum], a respected and renowned actress turned gallerist, along with [[William Challee|William (Bill) Chalee]] from 1960-89. Jackson produced artists books of poetry and painting, "What I Love" (1972) and "Animals" (1978). (see [[Suzanne Jackson (artist)#Poetry|Poetry]])&lt;blockquote&gt;“When [[Bernie Casey|Bernie [Casey]]] brought to the gallery several of Suzanne’s paintings, I was immediately struck with the freshness and originality of her work. It is most unusual to find so young an artist with a valid philosophical statement (and to communicate it successfully). Her feelings about her blackness are expressed in somewhat symbolic terms, and her world of fantasy, love and hope is revealed to the viewer in a very refreshing style… She very well may be the first Black woman in America to make a truly important contribution to art.”      -- Joan Ankrum (1/5/1974)
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sova.si.edu//record/AAA.ankrgall|title=Suzanne Jackson folder|last=Ankrum|first=Joan|date=|website=Smithsonian Archives|archive-url=https://sova.si.edu//record/AAA.ankrgall|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 1980s-1990s ===
In 1981, Jackson was first introduced to Savannah, GA through an invitation to be a visiting artist with [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] through the recommendation of [[Bernie Casey]]. Additionally, in 1981, Jackson’s work was included in the exhibition “Forever Free: African American Women” which traveled to the [[Gibbes Museum of Art]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, SC]]. Jackson lived in [[Idyllwild, CA]] from 1981–85 and was on faculty as a Visiting Artist at the [[Idyllwild Arts Academy|Idyllwild School of Music and Arts]] (1981–82), and Chair of the Fine and Performing Arts at the Elliott-Pope Preparatory School (formerly Desert Sun School) (1982–85).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1987, Jackson relocated to [[New Haven, CT]] to attend [[Yale University]], pursuing a master’s degree under the tutelage of [[Ming Cho Lee]] for scenography. She worked as a freelance scenic and costume designer moving throughout the region until taking a post at [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]] as a scenographer and Assistant Professor from 1994-96. In 1996, Jackson moved full-time to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah, GA]] to teach at [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] as Professor of Painting, where she taught full-time until 2009.

=== 2000s-Today ===
Jackson officially retired from [[Savannah College of Art and Design|SCAD]] in 2009, but Jackson remained as a part-time and adjunct professor until 2013. Additionally, Jackson taught introductory art history courses, including African American Art History at [[Savannah State University]] in 2013-2014 school year. Jackson has remained an active member of the Savannah artistic community and continues to create and exhibit her work. Jackson co-hosts a weekly radio show featuring jazz and conversation, called ''Listen Hear'' on WHCJ 90.3 [[Savannah State University]] Radio, alongside Ike Carter, Jerome Meadows, Tom Van de Ven, Lisa Jackson and Carla Curran, PhD.

==Artistic Practice==
Suzanne Jackson has had an extensive career an emphasized the importance of living the lifestyle of an artist, in her words, to be an artist is to solve problems as opposed to create images. She states, “I'm not an artist yet. I'm a painter. And I draw, and I work in theater as an "artist person," in quotes. But to become an artist takes a whole lifetime.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout her career, Jackson has looked to nature for inspiration, she has consistently related blackness to nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her work has celebrated blackness through the representation of black bodies without an overtly political message.

=== Visual Arts ===
Jackson has worked in a variety of visual media including works on paper, works on canvas, and Monoprints. Her works on paper include both watercolors and drawings from throughout her career. Jackson has worked mostly with acrylic paint, her earliest paintings on canvas were with acrylic paint layered, the way one would layer oils paints. She stated, “the imagery that everybody has sort of become familiar with, with the really strong white background and the sort of washy layers and layers of paint—that basically is kind of an old masters technique of layering the color for translucency. It's like the layers and layers of color build a depth in the painting. And some of the paintings, as thin as the color looks, there could be a hundred and fifty layers of color on each of my paintings.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 1990s marked a shift in her work as she began to experiment with different combinations of media.  As her style progressed, Jackson began to forego the canvas in favor of netting as a substrate. She uses [https://www.novacolorpaint.com/ Novacolor's]acrylic gels to create 3-dimensional hanging works held together by fabric, papers, found objects, leaves, and or various netting. (For images of Jackson's work, please visit her website http://www.suzannefjackson.net/)

VERSUS FANTASY--- ALONENESS

VERSUS LONLINESS… WHAT I

PAINT ATTEMPTS TO EXPRESS THE

CONFLICTS WITHIN THE MIND,

CONFLICTS OF CHOICES--- OF LOVES,

---OF SENSITIVITIES SEARCHING,

ORDERING, “FREEING” ONESELF

TOWARD SOME CONTINUOUS

CYCLE OF REDISCOVERING WHO,

IN FACT, I MIGHT REALLY BE.

--Statement from Suzanne Jackson’s book, ''What I Love'' (1970)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Gallery 32 ==
Many associate Jackson’s name with Gallery 32, an art gallery she ran in Los Angeles, a space dedicated to fostering a supportive artist community. Gallery 32 (1968-1970) was inspired by artist [[Charles White (artist)|Charles White]]’s philosophy that art could be an effective vehicle for community activism and social change. Seeking to replicate Jackson's previous experiences of San Francisco bohemianism, Gallery 32 functioned less as a business than as a place for the exchange of ideas and philosophies. Jackson funded the gallery herself, largely with money she earned from teaching. The gallery became an important venue, hosting discussions, poetry readings, and fund-raisers for social causes, and exhibiting work that demonstrated strong political and civic engagement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hammer.ucla.edu/now-dig-this/artists/suzanne-jackson/|title=Suzanne Jackson|last=Keith|first=Naima J.|date=08/06/18|website=Hammer Museum|archive-url=https://hammer.ucla.edu/now-dig-this/artists/suzanne-jackson/|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She aimed to make art from black artists with black themes accessible for all members of the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It quickly became one of the few art spaces in Los Angeles to exhibit emerging African American artists such as Gloria Bohanon, [[Emory Douglas]], [[David Hammons]], [[Betye Saar]], and Timothy Washington. The gallery also hosted fund-raising exhibitions for the [[Black Arts Council]], the [[Black Panther Party]], and the [[Watts Towers]] Arts Center children's arts program. One of the gallery's important exhibitions was the 1970 Sapphire Show, the first Los Angeles survey of African American women artists. Gallery 32 played a vital role in the progressive struggles of the period while contributing to the diverse art scene of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The remaining artworks and ephemera have been promised to the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institute]] per the artist’s request.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''Symphony No. 2, the "Copernican," Op. 31''' ''('''II Symfonia "Kopernikowska'''")'' ({{audio|Henryk Górecki 2nd symph 2nd Movement.ogg|sample}}) is a [[choral symphony]] composed by [[Henryk Górecki]] in 1972 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of &lt;!-- do not enter nationality claims here--&gt; astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Composed in a monumental style for [[soprano|solo soprano]], [[baritone]], [[choir]] and [[orchestra]], it features text from [[Psalms]] no. 145, 6 and 135, along with an excerpt from Copernicus' book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''.

The symphony was commissioned by the [[Kosciuszko Foundation]] in New York and presented to Górecki as an opportunity to reach an audience outside his native Poland. Typically, he undertook extensive research on the subject, and was particularly taken by the philosophical implications of Copernicus' discovery, not all of which he viewed as positive.&lt;ref name="th74"&gt;Thomas (1997), 74&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Davies commented: "His discovery, of the earth's motion round the sun, caused the most fundamental revolutions possible in the prevailing concepts of the human predicament."&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Norman. ''God's Playground: A history of Poland''. Oxford, 1981. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Its world premiere took place on June 22, 1973 in Warsaw, featuring soprano [[Stefania Woytowicz]] and baritone Andrzej Hiolski.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Henryk-G-recki-Symphony-No-2-Copernican/2924|title=Henryk Górecki - Symphony No.2 `Copernican'|website=www.boosey.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;Adrian Thomas writes in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition]]'', "The second movement marks an important stage in Górecki's conversion to a more consonant language since the late 1960s, a process which was clarified in several choral pieces and the [[Symphony No. 3 (Górecki)|Third Symphony]]."&lt;ref name="thomas"/&gt; The symphony is written in two movements, following a binary design Górecki had followed in several previous works, "where the fortissimo dynamic, long silent pauses and rapid, [[chromaticism|chromatic]] motifs of the first movement are counterbalanced by a comparatively calm second movement.... The thunderous cosmic vision of the mostly orchestal first movement is answered by a second movement whose proportions are considerably expanded in order to release the earlier tensions."&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;Thomas, ''New Grove (2001)'', 10:160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second symphony has been performed and recorded less than some of his other work (certainly less than his [[Symphony No. 3 (Górecki)|Symphony No. 3]]), in part because it demands a particularly large orchestra, soprano and baritone soloists, and a large choir.&lt;ref name="Perlez"&gt;Perlez, Jane. "Henryk Gorecki". ''New York Times'', 27 February 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, more than one interpretation of Symphony No. 2 is available on compact disc. The most readily available is the [[Naxos Records]] CD of the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra of Katowice, the Polish Radio Choir and the Silesian Philharmonic Choir with soloists [[Zofia Kilanowicz]] and [[Andrzej Dobber]], conducted by [[Antoni Wit]], which includes ''[[Beatus Vir (Górecki)|Beatus Vir]]''.

'''The Bristol Art Library''' (TBAL) is an art and performance project created in 1998 by British artist Annabel Other. It consists of handmade books in a library the size of a suitcase.

==History==
The project was devised as a protest at the closure of the original Bristol Art Library.&lt;ref&gt;"Library and Information News at Exeter", The Line, issue 10, June 2000, [[University of Exeter]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Play 'shop' with library collection at St Ives festival, ''Western Morning News'', Plymouth, August 26, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
The library consists of handmade identically-bound books on a wide range subjects produced by individual contributors from all areas of the arts and sciences, each catalogued according to the [[Dewey Decimal System]]. The books are contained within a small wooden cabinet and made available when Other "performs" the library in the guise of the Head Librarian. Although TBAL is primarily an artistic endeavour, it borrows the rhetoric of, and operates as a public institution with affiliations to official library organisations worldwide. Readers must fill in appropriate application forms, and adhere to strict library rules whereupon the books can be read using a reader's ticket whenever the library is open for lending.

Membership is free. Friends of The Bristol Art Library (FOTBAL) can sit on a special cushion when reading books, and receive the library's internal newsletter. Assistant librarians attend training sessions led by the Head Librarian including book-stamping and shush-ing techniques. TBAL has a gift shop selling tea towels, bookmarks, badges and postcards. The library travels from venue to venue in a hand-pulled red shopping trolley.

The Bristol Art Library officially opened its doors in New York at [[Printed Matter, Inc]] in 1998 (it lent its first book to an air hostess during the flight from London to New York). Since then, TBAL's interdisciplinary collection has toured worldwide to over 200 venues and events including [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]], [[Harvard University]], [[BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art]], [[De La Warr Pavilion]], [[Glastonbury Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;Poetry &amp; Words at Glastonbury (archive) [https://poetryandwordsblog.wordpress.com/tag/annabel-other/"] Retrieved 6 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Hay Festival]], [[WOMAD]], [[Hauser &amp; Wirth]] Somerset, [[Tate St Ives]]&lt;ref&gt;Tate St.Ives, 2 November 2018 [https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-st-ives/late/bristol-art-library] Retrieved 13 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;, and toured extensively in the USA, Poland and Japan. It has a growing membership of over 12,000 and houses in excess of 250 books.

'''The Centre of Attention''' is a [[London]]-based contemporary art organisation set up in 1999. Projects are shown internationally and constitute an ongoing enquiry into the phenomenon of art production, presentation and consumption.

The Centre’s participatory or [[Gonzo journalism|Gonzo]] curating approach include controversial exhibitions such as "Viva la republique" set during the [[Golden Jubilee]] with [[Banksy]], [[Jamie Reid]] and [[Genesis P-Orridge]]; "The curators" which entirely eliminated the artists from the exhibition by putting the curators on display, as well as in-depth solo projects with artists such as a [[Fluxus]] concert with [[Ken Friedman]] or a [[kinetic art]] retrospective of [[Nicolas Schöffer]].

The Centre of Attention was selected for the 51st [[Venice Biennale]] by curator [[Rosa Martinez]] and presented Swansong/Schwanengesang an installation with works from [[Benedict Carpenter]], House of O'Dwyer, Damien Roach and [[Wolfgang Tillmans]]. In this piece, also presented in MousonTurm Frankfurt and [[Mercer Union]] in Toronto, the audience is given an opportunity to rehearse its own funeral: participants select a song; then lay on a plinth, performing death, while the song is webstreamed, formally, reversing the viewer/art-object dynamic.

"'''The Lazy Spinner'''" or "'''The Lazy Spinning Woman'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], tale number 128.  It is [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 1405.

==Synopsis==

A lazy woman did not like to spin and when she did, did not wind onto a reel, but left it on the [[bobbin]].  Her husband complained, and she said she needed a reel to do that, but when he went to cut one, she sneaked after and called out that whoever cut a reel would die. This put him off cutting it, but he still complained.  She then made some yarn and said it must be boiled. Then she put some [[tow]] in the pot instead and set her husband to watch.  After some time, he opened the pot, saw the tow, and thought he had ruined the yarn. From then on, the husband didn't dare complain.

'''[[Vintage (design)|Vintage]] clothing''' is a generic term for [[Clothing|garments]] originating from a previous era. The phrase is also used in connection with a retail outlet, e.g. in ''vintage clothing store.'' Today vintage dressing encompasses choosing accessories, mixing vintage garments with new, as well as creating an ensemble of various styles and periods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.2752/9781847888815/OCNL0022 |url=https://www.bloomsburyfashioncentral.com/products/berg-fashion-library/book/old-clothes-new-looks-second-hand-fashion/vintage-whores-and-vintage-virgins-second-hand-fashion-in-the-twenty-first-century|chapter=Vintage Whores and Vintage Virgins: Second Hand Fashion in the 21st Century|title=Old Clothes, New Looks|series=Dress, Body, Culture|year=2004|last1=Palmer|first1=Alexandra|isbn=978-1-84788-881-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vintage clothes typically sell at low prices for [[Luxury goods|high end]] named brands. It has been part of the world since [[World War I]] as an idea of reusing clothing because of the [[textile]] shortage.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claudio|first=Luz|date=2007|title=Waste Couture: Environmental Impact of the Clothing Industry|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=115|issue=9|pages=A449–A454|issn=0091-6765|pmc=1964887|pmid=17805407|doi=10.1289/ehp.115-a449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vintage clothing can be found in cities at local boutiques or local charities, or also on the internet (e.g. [[eBay]] and [[Etsy]]). [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]] and [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] are the top two charites to donate or shop for vintage clothing. Vintage clothing is used as a muse for new designs and is known to be retro clothing. [[File:BridalSlip1.JPG|thumb|225px|1950s bridal vintage [[Slip (clothing)|slip]].]]

== Definition ==
Generally speaking, clothing which was produced before the 1920s is referred to as [[antique clothing]] and clothing from the 1920s to 20 years before the present day is considered vintage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage definition|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vintage|publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Retro]], short for retrospective, or "vintage style," usually refers to clothing that imitates the style of a previous era. Reproduction, or repro, clothing is a newly made copy of an older garment. Clothing produced more recently is usually called ''modern'' or ''contemporary'' fashion. Opinions vary for these definitions.

Vintage clothing is a form of ease in a fast moving world. Re-wearing clothes from a personal wardrobe and wearing newly acquired vintage and retro clothing, can be understood as a desire to recreate familiarity, or felicity, in a world that is rapidly changing and increasingly impersonal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Most vintage clothing has been previously worn, but a small percentage of pieces have not. These are often old warehouse stock, and more valuable than those that have been worn, especially if they have their original tags. Referred to as deadstock or new old stock (NOS), they nevertheless sometimes have flaws. Vintage clothing may be either commercially produced or handmade by individuals.

== Sizing ==
In the United States, due to [[Vanity sizing|changes in clothing sizes]], vintage sizes are often smaller than the corresponding contemporary size. For example, a garment from the 1970s labeled as Medium (M) might be similar in size to a 2010s Extra Small (XS). As [[Obesity in the United States|obesity]] was relatively uncommon prior to the 1980s, larger sizes are typically rare. Vintage [[Pattern (sewing)|sewing patterns]] offer an option for those who want a historically accurate garment but cannot find one in their size.

== Retail market ==
{{sources|section|date=December 2017}}
Popular places to buy vintage clothing include, charity-run second hand clothing shops, consignment shops, [[garage sale]]s, car boot sales, [[flea market]]s, antique markets, [[estate sale]]s, [[auction]]s, vintage clothing shops and vintage fashion, [[textile]] or collectables fairs. One of the first regular fairs that was set up specifically to cater for the current demand for vintage clothing is [[Frock Me!]]. This event takes place regularly throughout the year in [[Chelsea, London]] as well as in [[Brighton]]. Vintage clothing is sometimes also obtained from older friends and relatives.

Typically in the United States, vintage clothing shops can be found clustered in [[college towns]] and artsy neighborhoods of cities. Sizing is a major factor – in most locations in the United States, the majority of the population would be unable to find vintage clothing that fits. In contrast to [[Charity shop|thrift stores]] that sell both vintage and contemporary used clothing, vintage clothing shops are usually for-profit enterprises, with the market mixed between small chains and independent stores. These stores typically range from 200 to 5,000 square feet in size, and will usually have a [[fitting room]]. In addition to selling clothing and accessories, many vintage clothing stores also buy clothing from the public in exchange for cash or store credit.

The advent of the internet has been a boon to the vintage [[clothing industry]]. It has increased the availability of specific and hard-to-get items and opened up prospective markets for sellers around the world. Popular places to acquire garments include online auctions (e.g. [[eBay]]), multi-vendor sites (e.g. [[Etsy]]), online vintage clothing shops and specialist forums. Many vintage clothing shops with physical locations now also sell their goods online.

Vintage clothing offers past and present clothing at low prices. &amp;nbsp;The reduced name brand clothes accomplish uniqueness and originality. Vintage shopping can be viewed as a continuation of discount culture, while simultaneously achieving an individual identity and exclusivity that the brand names have lost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Since the beginning of [[World War I]] the idea of vintage clothing or reusing clothing was a way of living. During World War I, most clothing was repaired, mended, or [[tailor]]ed for other family members or recycled within the home as rags or [[quilt]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The government conservation campaign used slogans such as “Make economy fashionable lest it become obligatory” resulted in an approximate 10% reduction in the production of trash.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the late 20th century there was as increased demand for high end name brands. During the 1980s, vintage clothing in [[North America]] increased because of the demand for reduce [[high-end]] name brands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Now fashion is non selective as it used to be, as vintage clothing has moved to [[subculture]] to [[mass culture]] it is often not limited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fashion is fast and at our finger tips. The very definition of fashion fuels the momentum for change, which creates demand for ongoing replacement of products with something that is new and fresh.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawley|first=Jana M.|date=2006|title=Textile Recycling: A Systems Perspective|url=http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2097/595/Hawley2006Recycling.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=Woodhead Limited|volume=|pages=13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This increase in interest is due in part to increased visibility, as vintage clothing was increasingly worn by top models and celebrities, e.g. [[Julia Roberts]], [[Renée Zellweger]], [[Chloë Sevigny]], [[Tatiana Sorokko]], [[Kate Moss]], and [[Dita Von Teese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-33457/Best-worst-Oscar-dresses.html |title=Best (and worst) Oscar Dresses|work=[[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=29 October 2010 | first=Susannah| last=Conway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.944.com/articles/extending-the-runway-tatiana-sorokko-style-a-fashion-icon-with-a-wardrobe-to-back-it-up/ |title=A Fashion Icon with a Wardrobe to Back it Up |publisher=''[[944 Magazine]]'' |accessdate=17 November 2010 |first=Dayne |last=Pratt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930223249/http://www.944.com/articles/extending-the-runway-tatiana-sorokko-style-a-fashion-icon-with-a-wardrobe-to-back-it-up/ |archive-date=30 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popularity of [[period piece]]s set in the mid 20th century in television and film have also contributed to vintage's popularity. There is even an international magazine called * [[Vintage Life]] – specifically a Women's Fashion and Lifestyle Magazine.

There has also been an increasing interest in [[Sustainability|environmental sustainability]] in terms of reusing, recycling and repairing rather than throwing things away. Sometimes vintage items are [[upcycling|upcycled]] via changing the hemline or other features for a more contemporary look. Vintage items in poor condition are also salvaged for reuse as part of new garments.

The textile recycling industry is the environmental part of the fashion industry. Throughout the world, used apparel products are salvaged as reclaimed textiles and put to new uses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The textile recycling industry is able to process over ninety percent of the waste without the production of any new hazardous waste or harmful by product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A resurgence of historically based sub-cultural groups like [[rockabilly]] and [[Swing (dance)|swing dancing]] has also played a part in the increased interest in vintage clothes. In Finland the vintage scene has even spawned an officially recognized association or [[non-profit organization]] called [[Fintage]] out of common interest in the preservation of [[material culture]] and the environment.

== Vintage inspired and vintage style ==
[[File:Portrait, Whitby Gothic Weekend, 2013.jpg|thumb|right|A girl wearing Victorian-inspired fashion.]]
Fashion design, throughout history has turned to previous eras for inspiration. Vintage clothing retains and increases in value due to the fact that it is genuinely from a past era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Goldenen Jahre – Eine Zeitreise mit Collectif Clothing|url=http://vintage-kleider.net/collectif-clothing-vintage-von-der-insel/|publisher=www.vintage-kleider.net|accessdate=11 June 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, authentic garments are made one at a time, with enough attention to detail to create an item that has long lasting value. Garments closely resembling original vintage (retro or antique) clothing are mass-produced, for the most part, in China. An example of this is the simple [[slip dress]]es that emerged in the early 1990s, a style that resembles a 1930s design, but upon examination will show that it only superficially resembles the real thing. These styles are generally referred to as "vintage style", "vintage inspired" or "vintage reproductions". They serve as a convenient alternative to those who admire an old style but prefer a modern interpretation. Sellers claim consumer advantage in that, unlike the original garments, they are usually available in a range of sizes and perhaps, colours and/or fabrics, and can be sold much cheaper.

The Hon. '''William Herbert''' (12 January 1778 – 28 May 1847) was a British botanist, botanical illustrator, poet, and clergyman. He served as a member of parliament for [[Hampshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampshire]] from 1806 to 1807, and for [[Cricklade (UK Parliament constituency)|Cricklade]] from 1811 to 1812. His botanical writings are noted for his treatment of [[Amaryllidaceae]].{{sfn|Stearn|1952}}

==Life==
He was the third son and fifth child of [[Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Carnarvon]], by Lady Elizabeth Alicia Maria, eldest daughter of [[Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont]]. He was born on 12 January 1778, and was educated at [[Eton College]]. On 16 July 1795 Herbert matriculated at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], but soon migrated to [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], where he graduated B.A. on 6 June 1798. Subsequently, moving to [[Merton College]], he proceeded M.A. 23 November 1802, B.C.L. 27 May 1808, D.C.L. 2 June 1808, and B.D. 25 June 1840.{{sfn|Jackson|1885–1900}}
In a political career, he was elected M.P. for Hampshire in 1806, and for Cricklade in 1811, and also seems to have practised at the bar. But soon after retiring from parliament in 1812 he changed his plans. In 1814 he was ordained, and was nominated to the rectory of [[Spofforth, North Yorkshire|Spofforth]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. He left Spofforth in 1840 on his promotion to [[Dean of Manchester]].{{sfn|Jackson|1885–1900}}

Herbert died suddenly at his house in Hereford Street, [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]], London, on Friday, 28 May 1847.{{sfn|Jackson|1885–1900}}

==Works==
In 1801 he brought out ''Ossiani Darthula'', a small volume of Greek and Latin poetry. In 1804 appeared part i. of his ''Select Icelandic Poetry, translated from the originals with notes''. Part ii. followed in 1806. These were early works on old Scandinavian literature in English. [[Lord Byron]] mentioned Herbert in his ''[[English Bards and Scotch Reviewers]]'' (1809). Other translations were from German, Danish, and Portuguese poems, with some miscellaneous English poems (1804).{{sfn|Jackson|1885–1900}}

He contributed articles of a non-political character to the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''. ''Helga'', a poem in seven cantos, came out in 1815, with a second edition in the following year; then ''Hedin, or the Spectre of the Tomb'', a tale in verse from Danish history. London, 1820; ''Pia della Pietra'', 1820; ''Iris'', a Latin ode, York, 1820; and the ''Wizard Wanderer of Jutland'' in 1820-1. The epic poem entitled ''Attila, or the Triumph of Christianity'', in twelve books, with a historical preface, was published in 1838; and a final volume of poems, ''The Christian'', in 1846.{{sfn|Jackson|1885–1900}}

Early interested in [[natural history]], and a good shot, he helped [[James Rennie]] to edit [[Gilbert White]]'s ''[[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' in 1833, and contributed notes to [[Edward Turner Bennett]]'s edition of the work in 1837. He wrote much for the ''[[Botanical Register]]'' and ''[[Botanical Magazine]]'', particularly on the subject of [[ornamental bulbous plant|bulbous]] plants. He cultivated a large number of these plants at Spofforth, and at [[Mitcham]], Surrey; many of these were lost to cultivation. His standard volume on this group of plants, Amaryllidaceæ,&lt;ref&gt;''Amaryllidaceae, an attempt to arrange the Monocotyledonous Orders'' (1837)&lt;/ref&gt; was issued in 1837. His ''Crocorum Synopsis'' appeared in the miscellaneous portion of the ''Botanical Register'' for 1843-4-5. Contributions on [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] made by him to the ''[[Journal of the Horticultural Society]]'' were the outcome of observation and experiment. A ''History of the Species of Crocus'' was reprinted separately from that journal, edited by [[John Lindley]] in 1847, just after his death. The genus Herbertia of Sweet commemorated his name.{{sfn|Jackson|1885–1900}}

His major works, including sermons, reviews, and scientific memoirs, besides his early poetical volumes, appeared in 2 volumes in 1842. He edited ''Musae Etonensis'' (1795) while still at school and, on quitting Eton, obtained a prize for a Latin poem on the subject ''Rhenus'', which was published. A translation appeared in ''Translations of Oxford Prize Poems'', 1831.{{sfn|Jackson|1885–1900}}

==Recognition==
The [[International Bulb Society]] awards [[The Herbert Medal]] to persons making meritorious achievement in advancing the knowledge of [[ornamental bulbous plant|bulbous plants]].

==Family==
Herbert married the Hon. Letitia Emily Dorothea, second daughter of [[Joshua Allen, 5th Viscount Allen]], on 17 May 1806, and was father of [[Henry William Herbert]] and three other children.

==Commentary on Herbert==
[[Charles Darwin]] wrote in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Natural Selection#Historical development|Natural Selection]], as we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art. ...The elder [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|De Candolle]] and [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] have largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe competition. In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with more spirit and ability than W. Herbert, Dean of Manchester, evidently the result of his great horticultural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1228/1228-h/1228-h.htm ''On the Origin of Species''] (1859) Ch.3 "The Struggle for Existence"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Andrew Dickson White]] wrote in ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (1896):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
About 1820 Dean Herbert, eminent as an authority in horticulture, avowed his conviction that species are but fixed varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dickson White, ''A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom'' Appleton (1922) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8EXID2XVPzEC&amp; Vol.1] p.65&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Science historian [[Conway Zirkle]] has written that Herbert had recognized the [[struggle for existence]]. According to Zirkle "he 
approached very closely to the natural selection hypothesis when he suggested that winter hardiness might become established in a hybrid stock through the survival of chance variations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=April 25, 1941 |title=Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species' |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123 |jstor=984852 |issn=0003-049X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He created 42 sleeves for the label and its subsidiaries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wimwords.com/2018/02/02/from-the-stacks-rolling-stones-all-meat-music-and-a-william-stout-interview/|title=From The Stacks: Rolling Stones, ‘All-Meat Music’ ( and a William Stout Interview!)|date=2018-02-02|work=Why It Matters|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''All-Meat Music'' (his first), [[the Yardbirds]]' ''Golden Eggs'' and ''More Golden Eggs'', and [[the Who]]'s ''Who's Zoo'' and ''Tales from the Who''.  He became associated with the [[Firesign Theatre]], and designed his first official album sleeve, ''[[In the Next World, You're on Your Own]]'', in 1974.&lt;ref name="rc"&gt;Randy Fox, "Tales from the Boots: the album art of William Stout", ''[[Record Collector]]'', no.418, September 2013, pp.132-135&lt;/ref&gt; Stout also designed the original [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] logo in 1978.

From 1975 to 1977 Stout worked as art director for the [[rock and roll|rock]] magazine ''[[Bomp!]]'' During this time, he became one of the first American contributors to ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' magazine.  He continued to work occasionally designing posters and album sleeves.  These included the poster for ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'' featuring [[the Ramones]] in 1979, the controversial cover for the compilation album ''[[Beatlesongs]]'' in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rutlemania.org/lean3.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rutlemania.org/rhpr1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www.rutlemania.org/rhpr2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www.rutlemania.org/rhpr3.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the cover for ''[[The Smithereens Play Tommy]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref name="rc"/&gt;

=== Film and television ===
In 1977 Stout painted his first movie poster, for [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s film ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]''. During his career, Stout has worked on the advertising for over 120 films.

In 1978, with ''[[Buck Rogers#Film and television adaptations|Buck Rogers]]'', Stout began his film production design career. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stout and fellow illustrator [[Richard Hescox]] ran a Los Angeles art studio, working on such projects as the storyboards for ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and pop singer [[Michael Jackson]]'s video "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]". Fellow cartoonist [[Dave Stevens]] worked for a time in the same studio.&lt;ref name="stout"&gt;[http://www.williamstout.com/news/journal/archives/00000058.shtml "Dave Stevens, 1955-2008," The Worlds of William Stout (Mar. 11, 2008).] Accessed Oct. 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stout has worked on over thirty feature films, including both [[Conan the Barbarian#Films|Conan]] films, ''[[First Blood]]'', ''[[The Hitcher (1986 film)|The Hitcher]]'', and ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders From Mars]]''. He was also the production designer of the ''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]'' film.

Stout illustrated the poster art and wrote the story (and the first draft of the script) of the film ''[[The Warrior and the Sorceress]]'' for [[Roger Corman]], as well as writing a never-produced dinosaur feature for [[Jim Henson]]. For [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] in 1996, he designed "Edgar", the big bug in ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]''. Stout was the key character designer for the computer-animated feature ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]'' (released in 2000). Stout worked as the conceptual designer for ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'', and key designer for [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''. Recent film work includes [[Christopher Nolan]]'s  film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' and creature design for [[Frank Darabont]]'s &amp; [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Mist (film)|The Mist]]''. He is slated to work on del Toro's ''[[At the Mountains of Madness#Film, TV or theatrical adaptations|At the Mountains of Madness]]'' as well as a proposed [[John Carter of Mars]] film.

=== Paleontological art ===
In 1981 Bantam Books published Stout's landmark masterwork ''The Dinosaurs: A Fantastic New View of a Lost Era'' (recently updated and re-published as ''The New Dinosaurs''). In 1983, Stout was among those who illustrated [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Dinosaur Tales]]''. In 1984 he illustrated ''[[The Little Blue Brontosaurus]]'', which was a 1984 Children's Choice Award recipient and the basis for the 1988 animated feature ''[[The Land Before Time]]''.

In 1986, as a result of his paleontological reconstruction work, eleven Stout paintings were selected for inclusion in the traveling exhibition "Dinosaurs Past and Present," an important group show depicting the history of [[paleoart]]. The six-year tour included (among others) the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[British Museum]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], and the [[American Museum of Natural History]].

In 1993, [[Universal Cartoon Studios]] chose Stout to design a prime-time [[Jurassic Park#Cancelled animated series|animated series of ''Jurassic Park'']], which was ultimately shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamstout.com/news/journal/?p=3518|title=My Top Ten Favorite Dinosaur Films – Part One|website=WilliamStout.com|date=April 26, 2014|accessdate=July 12, 2015|first=William|last=Stout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1993 [[Comic Images]] released ''William Stout's Lost Worlds'', the first of three [[trading card]] sets.

==== Antarctica ====
In January 1989, Stout traveled to [[Antarctica]] and [[Patagonia]]. His experiences there eventually resulted in the one-man show "Dinosaurs, Penguins and Whales — The Wildlife of Antarctica." The exhibition was part of Stout's effort to alert and inform the public of the complex beauty of Antarctica, and to work as part of the international effort to make Antarctica the first "World Park." "Dinosaurs, Penguins and Whales" evolved into a forthcoming book, ''Lost Worlds: Modern and Prehistoric Life in Antarctica'', the first visual overview of life in Antarctica.

In August 1991 Stout received a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to participate in their Antarctic Artists and Writers Program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/aawrws.jsp National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs.] Accessed Oct. 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For three months during the 1992-1993 austral summer, Stout was based at [[McMurdo Station]] and [[Palmer Station]]. He made several dives beneath the ice, climbed the active volcano [[Mt. Erebus]], camped in the dry valleys, and produced over one hundred painted studies as he carefully observed Antarctica's wildlife. Shortly thereafter, Stout drove over one thousand miles through central southern [[Chile]], documenting the rare prehistoric forests there for inclusion in his ''Lost Worlds'' book.

==== Murals ====
In 1994 Stout painted two murals for the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]] depicting "Life Before The Dinosaurs." In early 1998 Stout completed three [[Cretaceous]] murals and supervised two full-sized dinosaur sculptures for [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]. &lt;!-- Stout worked in 1998-1999 as the lead designer for Toronto's [[Dinotopia]] theme park. --&gt;

In 2007, Stout completed twelve large murals depicting the prehistoric life of San Diego for the [[San Diego Natural History Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Richard. "Art for the Ages: New Murals offer a glimpse of the Pacific Coast's extinct ecosystems," ''Natural History'' magazine (March 2008), pp. 51-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Stout's murals and paintings are on permanent display at the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]], the [[Orton Geological Museum]], The [[Museum of the Rockies]], and the [[North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences]].

=== Entertainment design ===
Beginning in 1987, Stout worked for [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] for a year and a half as a conceptualist, designer, and producer for [[Euro Disneyland]], [[Disneyland]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Walt Disney World]]. In 1989 he was hired by [[Lucasfilm]]/Industrial Light and Magic as conceptualist and chief designer for their first foray into themed entertainment centers. In 1991 Stout conceived and designed [[ZZ Top]]'s ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' tour. In 1994 Stout continued theme park attraction creation and design for [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]/[[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s [[Islands of Adventure]]. In late 1995, [[Steven Spielberg]] chose Stout as his senior concept designer for [[GameWorks]], a [[Sega]]/[[Universal Studios|Universal]]/[[DreamWorks SKG]] joint project. For two years Stout and his team oversaw the concepts, design, and execution of the first three GameWorks facilities in Seattle, Washington; Tempe, Arizona; and Ontario, California). Stout worked in 1998-1999 as the lead designer for Kansas City's Wonderful World of Oz theme park (which unfortunately was never developed). He was also a designer for [[Michael Jackson]]'s private [[Neverland Ranch]] theme park.

=== Illustration ===
In 2001, Stout illustrated [[Richard Matheson]]'s first children's book, ''Abu &amp; The 7 Marvels'', which won many awards. The Stout-illustrated book ''[[The Emerald Wand of Oz]]'' was released in 2005, followed by ''[[Trouble Under Oz]]'' in 2006. Stout's own publishing company, [[Terra Nova Press]], has published thirty-four books on art and the history of art.

In 2013, he prepared and illustrated ''Legends of the Blues'', a book comprising portraits of classic [[blues]] musicians, intended as a sequel to fellow cartoonist [[Robert Crumb]]'s book ''Heroes of Blues, Jazz and Country''.&lt;ref name="rc"/&gt;

The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of [[West Africa]] ([[Benin]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Togo]], with migrant communities in parts of [[Ghana]] and [[Sierra Leone]]) are responsible for one of the finest artistic traditions in Africa, a tradition that remains vital and influential today.&lt;ref name=Drewal&gt;{{cite book |last1=Drewal |first1=Henry John |last2=Pemberton III |first2=John |last3=Abiodun |first3=Rowland |editor-last=Wardwell |editor-first=Allen |title=Yoruba : nine centuries of African art and thought|year=1989|publisher=Center for African Art in Association with H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1794-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the art of the Yoruba, including staffs, court dress, and beadwork for crowns, is associated with the royal courts. The courts also commissioned numerous architectural objects such as veranda posts, gates, and doors that are embellished with carvings. Other Yoruba art is related shrines and masking traditions. The Yoruba worship a large pantheon of deities, and shrines dedicated to these gods are adorned with carvings and house an array of altar figures and other ritual paraphernalia. Masking traditions vary regionally, and a wide range of mask types are employed in various festivals and celebrations.&lt;ref name="Brooklyn Museum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adande |first1=Joseph |last2=Siegmann |first2=William C. |last3=Dumouchelle |first3=Kevin D. |title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum [u.a.]|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=978-0-87273-163-9|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Abundant natural resources enabled the Yoruba to develop one of the most complex cultures in sub-Saharan Africa. By the beginning of the second millennium CE, [[Ile-Ife]], their most sacred city, had become a major urban center with highly sophisticated religious, social, and political institutions.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=essay by Babatunde Lawal ; exhibition co-curated by Carol Thompson, Christa|title=Embodying the sacred in Yoruba art : featuring the Bernard and Patricia Wagner Collection|year=2007|publisher=High Museum of Art|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=1-932543-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period around 1300 C.E. the artists at [[Ife]] developed a refined and naturalistic [[sculptural]] tradition in [[terracotta]], [[stone]] and copper alloy - [[copper]], [[brass]], and [[bronze]] - many of which appear to have been created under the patronage of King Obalufon II, the man who today is identified as the Yoruba patron deity of brass casting, weaving and regalia.&lt;ref name="Blier Art and Risk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blier|first=Suzanne Preston|title=Art and Risk in Ancient Yoruba: Ife History, Politics, and Identity c. 1300|date=2015| publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=978-1107021662}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty of kings at [[Ife]], which regarded the Yoruba as the place of origin of human civilization, remains intact to this day.

There have been a series of Yoruba kingdoms over the past nine centuries. Ife was one of the earliest of these; [[Oyo Kingdom|Oyo]] was also early and the Owa kingdom in the southwest maintained close ties to Oyo. Ife also experienced the artistic and cultural influence of [[Benin]] dating back to the 14th Century or earlier. Owa artists supplied fine ivory work to the court at Benin and Owa royalty adapted and transformed many Benin institutions and the regalia of leadership.

Yoruba kingdoms prospered until the [[slave trade]] and warfare of the nineteenth century took their toll. One of the effects of this devastation was the dispersal of millions of Yoruba all over the world. This resulted in a strong Yoruba character in the artistic, religious and social lives of Africans in the New World.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt;

==Art and life in Yoruba culture==
The custom of art and artists among the Yoruba is deeply rooted in the [[Ifá]] literary corpus, indicating the [[orisha]]s Ogun, Obatala, Oshun and Obalufon as central to creation mythology including artistry (i.e. the art of humanity).

In order to fully understand the centrality of art (onà) in Yoruba thought, one must be aware of their cosmology, which traces the origin of existence  (ìwà) to a Supreme Divinity called [[Olódùmarè]], the generator of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]], the enabling power that sustains and transforms the universe. To the Yoruba, art began when Olódùmarè commissioned the artist deity [[Obatala]] to mold the first human image from clay. Today, it is customary for the Yoruba to wish pregnant women good luck with the greeting: ''May Obatala fashion for us a good work of art''.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

The concept of ''[[Ase (Yoruba)#''Ase'' and Yoruba Art|ase]]'' influences how many of the Yoruba arts are composed. In the visual arts, a design may be segmented or seriate- a "discontinuous aggregate in which the units of the whole are discrete and share equal value with the other units."&lt;ref name="Drewal 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drewal|first=M. T., and H. J. Drewal|title=Composing Time and Space in Yoruba Art|journal=Word and Image: A Journal of Verbal/Visual Enquiry|year=1987|volume=3|issue=3|pages=225–251|doi=10.1080/02666286.1987.10435383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such elements can be seen in Ifa trays and bowls, veranda posts, carved doors, and ancestral masks.

==The importance of the head in Yoruba sculpture==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1526 Door Ilekun.jpg|thumb|left|Wooden Door (Ilekun) with carved motifs]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 1997.165 Staff Opa Orisha Oko.jpg|thumb|right|Brooklyn Museum 1997.165 Staff Opa Orisha Oko]]
The Yoruba people regard the human head (ori) as the most important part of a person. Likewise, the head is the most prominent part of Yoruba sculpture. An analysis of Yoruba ontology reveals that the Yoruba regard the head as the locus of the [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] of [[Olodumare]]. Therefore, the head constitutes a person's life-source and controlling personality and destiny. Babatunde Lawal identifies three different modes of representing the head in Yoruba sculpture: "the naturalistic, which refers to the external, or physical head (ori ode); the stylized, which hints at the inner, or spiritual, head (ori inu); and the abstract, which symbolizes the primeval material (oke ipori) of which the inner head was made."&lt;ref name="Lawal Ori"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawal|first=Babatunde|title=Ori: The Significance of the Head in Yoruba Sculpture|journal=Journal of Anthropological Research|date=Spring 1985|volume=41|issue=1|pages=91–103 |jstor=3630272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anonymity and authorship in African art==
The issue of anonymity and authorship has long troubled the field of African art history, particularly as it relates to the political disparities between Africa and the West.&lt;ref name=Picton&gt;{{cite book|last=Picton|first=John|title=The Yoruba artist : new theoretical perspectives on African arts ; [based on a 1992 symposium held at the Museum Rietberg Zürich]|year=1994|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington [u.a.]|isbn=1560983396|authorlink=Art, Identity and Identification: A Commentary on Yoruba Art Historical Studies|editor=Rowland Abiọdun |editor2=Henry J. Drewal |editor3=John Pemberton III}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such information was, at least initially, rarely sought in the field and deemed unnecessary and even undesirable by many collectors.&lt;ref name="Brooklyn Museum" /&gt; Susan Vogel has identified a further paradox. "[I]n their own societies," Vogel writes, "African artists are known and even famous, but their names are rarely preserved in connection with specific works... More often than not, the African sculptor becomes virtually irrelevant to the life of the art object once his work is complete... Cultures preserve the information they value."&lt;ref name=Vogel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vogel|first=Susan Mullin|title=Known Artists by Anonymous Works|journal=African Arts|date=Spring 1999|volume=32|issue= 1|pages=40, 42, 50|doi=10.2307/3337537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of anonymity in Yoruba art in particular is troubling in the context of Yoruba culture where "it is absolutely imperative for individuals to acknowledge each other's identity and presence from moment to moment, [and where] there is a special greeting for every occasion and each time of day."&lt;ref name="Abiọdun"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abiọdun|first=Rowland|title=The Yoruba artist : new theoretical perspectives on African arts ; [based on a 1992 symposium held at the Museum Rietberg Zürich]|year=1994|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington|isbn=1560983396|authorlink=An African(?) Art History: Promising Theoretical Approaches in Yoruba Art Studies|editor=Rowland Abiọdun |editor2=Henry J. Drewal |editor3=John Pemberton III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Yoruba artists' names are known, including but not limited to:

*Bangboshe of Osi Ilorin
*Bandele Areogun of Osi
*Master of Ikare
*[[Lamidi Olonade Fakeye|Lamidi Fakeye]]
*[[Olowe of Ise]]

==Metal arts==
Yoruban blacksmiths create sculpture from iron, through hand-beating, welding, and casting. [[Ogoun|Ogun]] is honored as the god of iron.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;[http://www.fa.indiana.edu/~conner/yoruba/blacksmith.html "Shaping: The Blacksmith."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110093453/http://www.fa.indiana.edu/~conner/yoruba/blacksmith.html |date=November 10, 2011 }} ''Cutting to the Essence – Shaping for the Fire.'' 29 March 1995 (retrieved 15 Nov 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Metalworkers also create brass sculptures by [[lost-wax casting]]. Brass is seen as being incorruptible by the [[Ogboni]] Society.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

==Yoruba Masquerade==
The tendency in many African cosmologies to identify the body as a vehicle incarnating the soul on earth has encouraged the metaphoric use of the masquerade for a similar purpose. [[Egúngún]], [[Gelede]], and [[Epa mask|Epa]] are among the many types of Masquerade practiced by the Yoruba.

==Yoruba Crowns==
{{main|Oba's crown}}

The bead-embroidered crown (or ''ade'', in local language) with beaded veil, foremost attribute of the Oba, symbolizes the aspirations of a civilization at the highest level of authority. In his seminal article on the topic, Robert F. Thompson writes, "The crown incarnates the intuition of royal ancestral force, the revelation of great moral insight in the person of the king, and the glitter of aesthetic experience."&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert F.|title=African art &amp; leadership|year=1972|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=0299058204|pages=227–260|authorlink=The Sign of the Divine King: Yoruba Bead-Embroidered Crowns with Veil and Bird Decorations|editor=Douglas Fraser |editor2=Herbert M.
