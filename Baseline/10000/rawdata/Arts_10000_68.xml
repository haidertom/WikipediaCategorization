The '''Ain Sakhri Lovers''' figurine is a sculpture that was found in one of the [[Ain Sakhri]] caves near [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110811115432/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/p/phallic_figurine.aspx|title=British Museum - Ain Sakhri lovers figurine|date=2011-08-11|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is considered to be 11,000 years old and to be the oldest known representation of two people engaged in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=ahotw&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/vNEwNR8rSzGPSwSn3yeJwA A History of the World -7], BBC.co.uk, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The sculpture was identified in 1933 by {{ill|René Neuville|fr||de|}}, a French [[Consulate#Consulates and embassies|consul]] in [[Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;Neuville represented the French Republic as vice-consul at Jerusalem from 1928 to 1937 and as consul-general from 1946 to 1952; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=easK2KFwWssC&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;ots=FUqickvmd0&amp;dq=Ren%C3%A9%20Neuville&amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;q=Ren%C3%A9%20Neuville&amp;f=false footnote on page 301 of ''Les Mandats Francais Et Anglais Dans Une Perspective'' (in French)]; he is known for his work with [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids]] in the [[Levant]].&lt;/ref&gt; and prehistorian, when looking through random finds obtained by the French Fathers at [[Bethlehem]]. He found the stone whilst visiting a small museum with [[Henri Breuil|Abbé Breuil]].&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; Neuville immediately identified it as important and was able to get an introduction to the [[Bedouin]] who had made the finds at Wadi Khareitoun. He was led to a location within the [[Ain Sakhri]] caves and it is from these caves that the sculpture gets its name. Excavations of the caves revealed that the cave had been used domestically thousands of years ago and the finds were [[Natufian]]. For this reason it is thought that the figurine was used domestically and had not been left there as part of a funeral.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The person who made the sculpture came from the [[Natufians]], an early [[Epipaleolithic]] culture whose members are thought to be the first humans to gather grass seeds that remained attached to their stems.&lt;ref name=ahotw/&gt; This is an important step in agriculture as it eventually allowed farmers to choose which seeds to eat and which to keep to sow the following season.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; These people hunted gazelle and are the first known to domesticate dogs,&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock1995"&gt;{{Citation |title=The domestic dog: its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people |last=Clutton-Brock |first=Juliet |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Serpell, James |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-41529-2 |pages= |chapter=Origins of the dog: domestication and early history }}&lt;/ref&gt; sheep, and goats which also involves [[selective breeding]]. It has been speculated that the stability of having a managed food programme allowed the Natufians to create large communities of two to three hundred people and to create [[art]].&lt;ref name=trans&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00q2p68 A History of the World in 100 objects - Part 7], BBC Radio 4, 26 January 2010, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode7/ transcript], accessed 23 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
The sculpture was made by carving a single "[[calcite]] cobble" which was picked away with a stone point to identify the position of the couple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although it lacks details, such as faces, it is considered to be a clever piece of sculpture. Artist [[Marc Quinn]] has noted that the figure looks different depending on the viewer's perspective, and may resemble a couple, a penis, breasts, or a vagina depending on this perspective,&lt;ref name=ahotw/&gt; or two testicles when viewed upside-down, from the bottom. Quinn compared it to a modern pornographic film where the action may include close-ups and long shots. It is clear that the figures in the couple are facing each other, but the gender of the figures can only be presumed.&lt;ref name=bmdb/&gt;

==Importance and purchase==
After the death of René Neuville in 1952, it was purchased by the [[British Museum]] at Sotheby's in 1958 from M. Y. Neuville.&lt;ref name=bmdb&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1358965&amp;partid=1 figurine], British Museum, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The object formed the basis of an episode of ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'', a BBC radio programme in January 2010 about the dawn of agriculture.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

'''''American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America''''' is a 1997 book by [[art critic]] [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]].

==Reception==
''[[BookList]]'' called ''American Visions'' a "sensational history of American art." and wrote "The contrast between the influence of nature and of the city on American art is the fulcrum of Hughes' entire narrative ..."&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; and ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice Reviews]]'' stated "The book bears the stamp of the author's aesthetic sensibilities (which value works of art for their technical competence as well as visual and intellectual qualities), his critical acuity, and his accomplished writing."&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/900642/Reviews |title=American visions : the epic history of art in America |website=www.buffalolib.org |publisher=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' gave a starred review and described it as an "eminently readable handbook on American art.", writing "His readings of three centuries of both art works and trends are lively, detailed, and persuasive (though perhaps a bit too harsh regarding recent art), and his ultimately pessimistic take is expressed with great clarity. A meaty and illuminating excavation, full of vigor and punch..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-hughes-6/american-visions-the-epic-history-of-an-in-amer/ |title=AMERICAN VISIONS: The Epic History of An in America |date=1 March 1997 |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] noted "this is no bland, dumbed-down survey intended to flatter its subject or its audience. Hughes writes with an aesthete's disdain for political posturing, a traditionalist's belief in the importance of technical skills (painters are frequently taken to task for their shoddy draftsmanship) and a pragmatist's contempt for mystagogical bunk.", found "his account of the contemporary scene is disappointingly brief." and concluded "This slashingly witty, briskly paced, ferociously opinionated tour of the American visual landscape is a book that even the most un-likeminded readers will love to hate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-679-42627-1 |title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America |date=31 March 1997 |website=www.publishersweekly.com |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New York Times]]'' review calls it a "witty and impassioned history of American art from its beginnings to the present day", "beautiful and essential", notes that "Mr. Hughes fortunately remains the critic throughout his historical canvassing, making distinctions and judgments without taking sides." and concludes "With it, Mr. Hughes has made American art safe for the receptive alien deep inside us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lee Siegel |date=27 April 1997 |title=A critic interprets American art as a perpetual beginning  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/27/reviews/970427.27siegelt.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Visions'' has also been reviewed by the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=30 October 1997 |title=Big Daddy |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v19/n21/linda-nochlin/big-daddy |journal=London Review of Books |publisher=LRB Limited |volume=19 |number=21 |pages=10,11 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Journal of American History]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1998 |title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8617">[[File:Jonson 1616 folio Workes title page.jpg|180px|thumb|Title page of ''The Workes of Beniamin Ionson'' (1616), the first folio publication that included stage plays.]]

The '''folio collections of [[Ben Jonson]]'s works''' published in the seventeenth century were crucial developments in the publication of English literature and English Renaissance drama. The first folio collection, issued in [[1616 in literature|1616]],&lt;ref&gt;Brady and Herendeen, pp. 11–22 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt; treated stage plays as serious works of literature instead of popular ephemera—at the time, a controversial position. The 1616 folio stood as a precedent for other play collections that followed—most notably the [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays in [[1623 in literature|1623]], but also the first [[Beaumont and Fletcher]] folio of [[1647 in literature|1647]], and other collections that were important in preserving the dramatic literature of the age for subsequent generations.

==The first folio, 1616==
The first Jonson folio of 1616, printed and published by [[William Stansby]] and sold through bookseller [[Richard Meighen]],&lt;ref&gt;When printers like Stansby acted as publishers, they usually had to arrange with one or more booksellers to sell their books—as, for one example, [[Thomas Creede]] sold his books through [[William Barley]].&lt;/ref&gt; contained nine plays, all previously published, plus two works of non-dramatic poetry, thirteen [[masques]], and six "entertainments."

*Plays:
** ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''
** ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]''
** ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]''
** ''[[The Poetaster]]''
** ''[[Sejanus: His Fall]]''
** ''[[Volpone]]''
** ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman]]''
** ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''
** ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy]]''
* Poetry:
** ''Epigrams''
** ''The Forest''
* Masques:
** ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]''
** ''[[The Masque of Beauty]]''
** ''[[Hymenaei]]''
** ''[[The Hue and Cry After Cupid]]''
** ''[[The Masque of Queens]]''
** ''[[The Speeches at Prince Henry's Barriers]]''
** ''[[Oberon, the Faery Prince]]''
** ''[[Love Freed from Ignorance and Folly]]''
** ''[[Love Restored]]''
** ''A Challenge at Tilt, at a Marriage''
** ''The Irish Masque at Court''
** ''[[Mercury Vindicated from the Alchemists]]''
** ''[[The Golden Age Restored]]''
* Entertainments:
** ''[[The Coronation Triumph|The King's Entertainment in Passing to His Coronation]]'' [''The Coronation Triumph'']
** ''A Panegyre, on the Happy Entrance of James''
** ''[[The Entertainment at Althorp|A Particular Entertainment of the Queen and Prince (at Althorp)]]'' [''The Satyr'']
** ''A Private Entertainment of the King and Queen (on May-Day)'' [''The Penates'']
** ''The Entertainment of the Two Kings (of Great Britain and Denmark)'' [''The Hours'']
** ''An Entertainment of King James and Queen Anne''

The first five of the masques, from ''Blackness'' through ''Queens'', had been printed previously, as had three of the entertainments, the ''Panegyre'', and the ''Epigrams''.

==The abortive 1631 addition==
In [[1631 in literature|1631]] Jonson planned a second volume to be added to the 1616 folio, a collection of later-written works to be published by [[Robert Allot]].&lt;ref&gt;Allot was a member of the syndicate of booksellers who published the Shakespeare [[Second Folio]] in [[1632 in literature|1632]].&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson, however, became dissatisfied with the quality of the printing (by John Beale), and cancelled the project. Three plays were set into type for the projected collection, and printings of those typecasts were circulated—though whether they were sold commercially or distributed privately by Jonson is unclear. The three plays are:
* ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]''
* ''[[The Devil Is an Ass]]''
* ''[[The Staple of News]]''

Allot died in 1635; in the 1637&amp;ndash;39 period, the rights to Jonson's works were involved in a complex legal dispute between [[Philip Chetwinde]], the second husband of Allot's widow, and stationers [[Andrew Crooke and William Cooke|Andrew Crooke]] and John Legatt, who believed they owned the rights to the works.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 75-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The second folio, 1640/1==
Two folio collections of Jonsonian works were issued in 1640-41. The first, printed by Richard Bishop for Andrew Crooke, was a 1640 reprint of the 1616 folio with corrections and emendations; it has sometimes been termed "the second edition of the first folio." The second volume was edited by Jonson's literary executor Sir [[Kenelm Digby]], and published by [[Richard Meighen]],&lt;ref&gt;Meighen, like Allot, was a member of the Shakespeare Second Folio syndicate.&lt;/ref&gt; in co-operation with Chetwinde. That volume contained later works, most of them unpublished or uncollected previously—six plays (including the three printed in 1631), two of them incomplete, and fifteen masques, plus miscellaneous pieces. In the Digby/Meighen volume—identified on its title page as "the Second Volume" of Jonson's works—the varying dates (1631, 1640, 1641) in some of the texts, and what editor William Savage Johnson once called "irregularity in contents and arrangement in different copies," have caused significant confusion.

* Plays:
** ''[[Bartholomew Fair]]''
** ''[[The Devil Is an Ass]]''
** ''[[The Magnetic Lady]]''
** ''[[A Tale of a Tub (play)|A Tale of a Tub]]''
** ''The Sad Shepherd'' (unfinished)
** ''Mortimer: His Fall'' (fragment)

==The third folio, 1692==
The [[1692 in literature|1692]] single-volume third folio was printed by Thomas Hodgkin and published by a syndicate of booksellers—the title page lists [[Henry Herringman|H. Herringman]], E. Brewster, T. Bassett, R. Chiswell, M. Wotton, and G. Converse.&lt;ref&gt;Herringman, Brewster, and Chiswell were members of the four-man syndicate that published the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Fourth Folio]] of Shakespeare's plays in [[1685 in literature|1685]]. Herringman was one of three stationers who issued the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|second Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] in [[1679 in literature|1679]].&lt;/ref&gt; The third folio added two works to the previous total: the play ''[[The New Inn]],'' and ''Leges Convivales''.

Two other works by Jonson were left out of the 17th-century folios but added to later editions: the plays ''[[The Case is Altered]]'' and ''[[Eastward Ho]]'' (the latter written with Marston and [[George Chapman]]).

The '''Big Merino''' is a {{convert|15.2|m|ft}} tall concrete [[merino]] [[sheep|ram]], located in [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. Nicknamed "Rambo" by locals, the Big Merino contains a gift shop on the ground floor and a [[wool]] display on the second floor. Visitors can climb to the top and look out through the Merino's eyes to view the local area.

The Big Merino was officially opened on 20 September 1985. In 1992, the [[Hume Highway]] bypassed Goulburn, which resulted in a loss of 40 busloads of tourists to the Big Merino complex per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Bjelaj Fortress''' locally known as ''Stari Grad Bjelaj'', is a Medievil town-fortress complex near the Village of [[Bjelaj]], [[Bosanski Petrovac]][[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

==Location==
Located on the edge of [[the Petrovac plain]] (or part thereof Bjelajsko fields), on the northern slope of the [[Osječenica]] mountain. The area around the city is uninhabited and lean. The whole complex is situated on a plateau about {{convert|850|m}} long.

==History==
On the south end of the northern half, there is a great fort, a prehistoric site from the Bronze and Iron Age. On the north end, there is a small fort. The fort itself has two parts: a medieval southern and northern [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] part. The medieval town has a ground plan of an irregular rectangle over 40 meters long and a width of about 35 meters.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalpark-una.ba/addDocuments/uploads/14666750291810023626.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From the tower on the west side is the beginning of the remains of a large pen that was added along with the medieval city in the Ottoman period.

First mentioned in written sources in 1495 and named after the whiteness (or tint) by which it stood out above Bjelajsko field. Ownership is attributed to of King Vladislav II Treasurer, who in 1495 is recorded paying to [[Gašpar Perušić]] the sum of 30 [[forint]]s "to preserve his city of Belaj" (''egregio Caspar Perusyth pro conservatione castri sui Belay dati sunt 30 fl.''). This clearly shows the settlement was defended by this point. Ten years later, in 1505 had most of the city together with the [[Sokolac fortress]] and Ripač by Princess [[Beatrice Frankopan]], limbs Duke Johannes Corvinus, and is in her name all three cities managed kaštelan Dujam Orlovčić.

Between 1530 and 1537, Bjelaj (Bilaj) came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], becoming part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]], the villagers and the cadillac Neretva. Already in 1540, it is mentioned for the first time on Bjelaj nahija, and later it is mentioned as Nahija Bjelaj-Blagaj, but soon falls under the cadiluk Kamengrad, which is mentioned as a cadil in the Bosnian or Klis sandbag. From 1562, Nađija Bjelaj was connected to the cadillac Novosel, who was in the cliché sandžak. It was noted that in 1577 a crew of 370 Ottoman mercenaries was placed in the fortress under the dizdar command. From 1592, the city was part of the Bihac captaincy, and from the 18th century to the composition of the Petrovac captaincy. Dizdar Bjelaj (Bilaja) Alijaga was in the demining commission with the Republic of Venice. In 1747 in Bjelaj there was a crew of 30 members and Dizdar Hasanag. According to the list of fortifications and weapons in them from 1833, in Bjelaj (Bilaj) there was 1 top of 12 pedals and 3 small canopies of 6 pedals.&lt;ref&gt;https://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stari_grad_Bjelaj#cite_note-Kre%C5%A1evljakovi%C4%87-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description== 
Old town Bjelaj (Bilaj) has two parts: the southern medieval and northern Ottoman part. The medieval city has a layout of irregular rectangles over 40 m long (north-south) and about 35 m wide (east-west). The entrance to the city is in the northward.

===Medieval part=== 
It is half-closed, with partially preserved arches and doorways. In the northwest corner, there is a massive round tower 2/3 off the ramparts, about 16 m high. The entrance to the tower is at a height of about 4 m above the current level of the land. According to the outer form, it is assumed that the inside of the tower was divided into three levels: the ground floor or basement, the level at the entrance level, and the space above the entrance because the ceiling can be seen on the canvas wall continuously. East of the entrance are the remains of a narrow, hollow, heavily-walled area as high as the ramparts (15-16m). That space was built up beside the rampart. Only the upper part of it was preserved and probably served for the rise of soldiers to the top of the wall on which they were coarse, and sometimes small loopholes. On the ground are the remains of the eastern part of the longitudinal wall that forms a whole with the vertical rest of the described wall beside the wall. These remains of a wall on the ground share the easternmost part of the interior of the city from the west. After a few meters they are lost to the south, and on the west side towards the tower, they do not see traces. The impression is that it was part of some enclosure that protected the penetration into the city. The western side of the city was harder defensive because the enemy could draw from the back. The western ramparts are therefore monolithic and end up with clods, of which only a very small part has been preserved. Beneath the level of the chestnut tree, there are a number of stone consoles on the top of the ramparts that served as a wooden backbone. Below them is a series of shorter brackets embedded in a rampart. The eastern rampart was facing Bjelaysko polje. On it are 4 large loopholes semi-rounded. and on the west side towards the tower, they do not see traces. The impression is that it was part of some enclosure that protected the penetration into the city. The western side of the city was harder defensive because the enemy could draw from the back. The western ramparts are therefore monolithic and end up with clods, of which only a very small part has been preserved.

Below them is a series of shorter brackets embedded in a rampart. The eastern rampart was facing Bjelaysko polje. On it are 4 large loopholes semi-rounded.

They are designed to shoot from a wooden or stone platform in a standing position. On some of them, the vertical and horizontal, nicely carved stone blocks and slabs that were used as frames are still on the inside of the ramparts. Above the loophole is a horizontal array of holes for the ceiling beams above which there are stone consoles. From the ramparts, there is a view of the entire Bjelas field and the surrounding area. The southern slum is completely demolished. Towards the tower next to the western ramparts is the remains of the tank. The fortresses and towers of an older fortress were built of travertine blocks and broken stone. In front of the northern rampart and entrance to the old part of the city, there is a ditch that is saturated, but its contours can be identified.

===Ottoman part=== 
From the tower on the west side are the remains of a large patch which was built alongside the medieval city in the Ottoman era. The precinct is located north of the older part of the city, almost regular in a four-legged shape, 110 m long, about 40 m wide. Only parts of the western ramparts are preserved, up to a height of 2 m. According to the material, they are completely different from the walls of the medieval city. They were built from a finely broken stone blended with plenty of plaster. There was a small mosque in the backyard. Today, at its place, the hollow is filled with a bunch of stones. The entrance to the pavement was on the north wall. He was overwhelmed by a "shaggy bow". In this place, the overhead remains of the ramparts are barely visible or only its traces. The most well-preserved part of the Ottoman times is south and north of the medieval trench, along with the west side of the plateau. At the end of one section of the western ramparts, another entry appeared to be in that wall north of the ditch. Along the eastern side of the fortress is not preserved.

==Current state==
On-site inspection in February 2007, found that the medieval city was still quite well preserved, while only parts of the western wall remained from the Ottoman peninsula. In the walls of the medieval city, the holes from which the stone was taken were seen. It is exposed to deterioration due to neglect, lack of maintenance and absence of an appropriate management plan.

Today Old town Bjelaj is located in the contact zone with the National Park "Una", and in 2007 it was declared a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The '''Blue Bell''' is at 63–65 Northgate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376358|desc= Number 63 and 65 street the Blue Bell, Chester|access-date= 8 April 2012 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally it consisted of two [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] houses which were joined together in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century.  The pavement runs through the ground floor storey of the northern part of the building, leaving a separate cabin or chamber between the pavement and the road. 

==History==
The building dates from the mid- to late 15th&amp;nbsp;century,&lt;ref name=images/&gt; and is said to be the oldest surviving intact [[Middle Ages|medieval]] house in Chester.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{Citation | last = Morris| first = Richard| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = |  year = 1993| title = The Buildings of Chester| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Dover| place = | publisher = Alan Sutton|  page = 92| isbn = 0-7509-0255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally two houses, which were joined in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century.  It formed part of Lorimer's Row, a group of buildings with an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] at ground level, as distinct from the [[Chester Rows|Rows]] in the centre of the city whose walkways are at the first floor level.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  From an early date, the south part of the building has been an [[Public_house#Inns|inn]], its first [[licence]] possibly dating from 1494. The separate cabin or chamber has been used for a number of functions; these include being a ticket office for [[Stagecoach|stage coach]] operators in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century and in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century a [[soda fountain]] bar and a [[barber]]'s shop.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century the southern part of the building was an inn while the northern part housed a shop.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;  The inn closed in the 1930s.  In 1948 the building was used as an [[antique]] shop but its condition deteriorated so much that it was threatened with demolition.  In the 1950s the Chester Civic Trust campaigned for its survival, it was restored, and has since been used as a clothes shop and, more recently, as a restaurant.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=36| title = Blue Bell Inn| accessdate = 15 August 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

The building is [[timber-framed]] on a [[sandstone]] [[plinth]] with brickwork added later which has subsequently been [[Stucco|rendered]] and painted.  The roofs are of grey [[slate]]s.  The two buildings comprising the whole have separate frames each with roofs leading to [[gable]]s over the street.  At ground level the southern part of the building has an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] open to the street with a [[Pier (architecture)|pier]] to the south and an octagonal [[column]] south of the centre.  The northern part has a separate cabin or chamber adjacent to the street with the walkway between its rear and the rest of the building. On the street side of the chamber is a three-pane [[Cant (architecture)|canted]] [[oriel window]] and a door.  On the upper floor each part of the building has a horizontal window with a small one-paned window between them.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

==Design ==
The visual appearance of Chitti was based on the [[G.I. Joe]] [[action figure]]s. For Chitti's [[2.0 (film)|2.0]] version look, its hair was spiked and brown coloured lenses were used for its eyes, whereas for its "good robot" look, green coloured lenses were used. The wig used for Chitti's 2.0 look had a silver streak in the middle, made out of [[Yak]] hair,&lt;ref name="Banu Sify"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/movies/banu-i-give-full-credit-to-rajini-sir-news-tamil-kkjrmldfhchsi.html | title=Banu&amp;nbsp;– I give full credit to Rajini sir | publisher=Sify | date=9 October 2010 | accessdate=21 February 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221074710/http://www.sify.com/movies/banu-i-give-full-credit-to-rajini-sir-news-tamil-kkjrmldfhchsi.html | archivedate=21 February 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its leather jacket was designed by Vogt.&lt;ref name="Banu Sify" /&gt; To make Vaseegaran look mature, the team made Rajinikanth sport an [[Beard#Styles|Oakley beard]].{{refn|According to Banu, an Oakley beard is "neither a French beard not a full beard".

==Abilities==
Chitti is described by Vaseegaran as an advanced "[[Humanoid robot|andro-humanoid]]" robot. Over his metallic body, he sports synthetic inorganic skin molded after Vaseegaran himself. He is designed with a speed capacity of 1 Terahertz (Hz) and a memory capacity of 1 Zettabyte.

Initially, Chitti has been programmed with almost all the existing world knowledge managed to put in computable terms in his CPU, thus he is knowledgeable and proficient in all forms of academia, martial arts, communication, creative outlets, athletic skills, and scientific ingenuity. 
Underneath his synthetic skin, he is fire, water, and acid-resistant. 

In his original form, he is partially resistant to severe damage such as gunshots, though he can still be damaged or destroyed by properly aimed and adequately forceful attacks such as being chopped with an axe in the joints. Severe electrocution can also overload short-circuit him.  As long as his CPU head is still functioning, Chitti is able to repair or fix back his minor parts such as eyes. However, for large damage such as limbs being chopped off, he can only put them back in place and function at a much slower speed.

Chitti's eyes are able to not only see and scan his surroundings to extremely acute detail, including X-ray vision, but they can also serve as high-definition projectors. His eyes also allow him to pick up additional skills within seconds. He can also perform virtual phone calls, with displaying his caller or receiver through his eyes as a hologram. However, on downside, the eyes get bleached when exposed to flash light.

Chitti is able to adhere to metal objects through his selective magnetism. This allows him to both render his foes weaponless, as well as fly for a certain distance to any nearby metallic structure. He is physically able to exert superhuman speed, agility and strength; he is at least able to lift with ease a convertible car, and even pull two trucks towards himself while they are in motion. In the second half of ''Enthiran'' as well as in ''2.0'', he designs and equips himself with a "handgun", which is basically a retractable firearm within his right hand.

Chitti's only known weaknesses are flashing lights, which temporarily distort his sight, and his susceptibility to battery drainage. However, in the case of the latter, he just needs to absorb a bare minimum amount of electric power to recharge himself in a matter of seconds.

==Appearances==
In the first film, ''[[Enthiran]]'', Chitti (played by [[Rajnikanth]]) is an android robot created by Dr. Vaseegaran, (also played by Rajinikanth). Dr. Vaseegaran, who is specialised in robotics, created Chitti after a decade of intensive research. Chitti was first created without emotions however in order for the robot to understand human behaviour, Vaseegaran taught the robot about them. But then the robot fell in love with the scientist's fiancée, Sana (played by [[Aishwarya Rai]]) and thus it caused conflict between them. Angered by the robot, Vaseegaran literally chopped the robot into pieces. He was found by Dr. Bohra (played by [[Danny Denzongpa]]) and upgrade into 2.0 because of a red chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Hindu : Entertainment Chennai : Director's dream project |url=https://www.thehindu.com/fr/2005/03/11/stories/2005031101810100.htm |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He converts it into a ruthless killer and turned into an evil destructive killing machine and killed Bohra. He then went after Vaseegaran and Sana and crashed their wedding. He showed numerous other powerful abilities including shape shifting as well as duplicating. He caused so much damage and destruction to the city. However, Vaseegaran managed to defeat and stop Chitti. Since he caused so much damage and destruction to the city, he was de-activated and dismantled. His body parts were then displayed in the museum in the year 2030 as the most advanced humanoid robot ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Script decides the fate of the movie' |url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/lsquoScript-decides-the-fate-of-the-movie/article15609945.ece |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=The Hindu |date=27 December 2010 |language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chitti reappeared in the film ''[[Ra.One]]'' in a special appearance and communicated with [[G.One (character)|G.One]] (played by [[Shah Rukh Khan]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Revealed! What Rajinikanth’s Chitti does in Ra.One's Chammak Challo |url=https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-revealed-what-rajinikanth-s-chitti-does-in-raone-s-chammak-challo-1594868 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=dna |date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Rajnikanth reprising his role. This appearance is non-canon, meaning both this and Chitti's film franchise don't share the same continuity.

In the 2018 film ''[[2.0 (film)|2.0]]'' with Rajnikanth reprising his role one more time, Chitti is forced to be reassembled by Dr. Vaseegaran and the Indian Army in order to stop the antagonist, [[Fifth force]], which is controlled by Pakshi Rajan, an [[Ornithologist]] (played by [[Akshay Kumar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2.0: Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar film trailer to release on Diwali 2018? |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/2point0-trailer-on-diwali-2018-rajinikanth-akshay-kumar-1346962-2018-09-23 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=India Today |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Rajinikanth Effect: 2.0 Teaser Gets Blockbuster Welcome - 32 Million Views in 24 Hours |url=https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/the-rajinikanth-effect-2-0-teaser-gets-blockbuster-welcome-32-million-views-in-24-hours-1916413 |accessdate=24 September 2018 |work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2.0 Movie Review : Is 2.0 worth for watching or not? |url=https://www.indianpeopletimes.com/entertainment/2-0-movie-review-is-2-0-worth-for-watching-or-not|accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=indianpeopletimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;But Chitti is defeated and destroyed in his original form by the antagonist, which leads his CPU head to being rebooted in another advanced mechanical body, identifying himself as Chitti reloaded version '2.0', and will also fall in love with his female counterpart, the super-android Nila (played by [[Amy Jackson]]), also created by Vaseegaran. Alongside Chitti, there is another robot created known as "Kutti" (3.0) which is a minibot (Mini-version),which can transform into a mobile phone.

In three dimensional [[geometry]], there are four infinite series of [[point groups in three dimensions]] (''n''≥1) with ''n''-fold rotational or reflectional symmetry about one axis (by an angle of 360°/''n'') that does not change the object.

They are the finite [[symmetry group]]s on a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]. For ''n'' = ∞ they correspond to four [[frieze group]]s. [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies|Schönflies]] notation is used. The terms horizontal (h) and vertical (v) imply the existence and direction of reflections with respect to a vertical axis of symmetry. Also shown are [[Coxeter notation]] in brackets, and, in parentheses, [[orbifold notation]].

== Types ==

;Chiral:
*'''''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', [n]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, (''nn'')''' of order ''n'' - ''n''-fold rotational symmetry - '''acro-n-gonal group''' (abstract group [[cyclic group|''Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']]); for ''n''=1: '''no symmetry''' ([[trivial group]])
;Achiral:
[[File:S shaped packing.jpeg|thumb|Piece of loose-fill [[cushioning]] with ''C&lt;sub&gt;2h&lt;/sub&gt;'' symmetry]]
*'''''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'', [n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2], (''n''*)''' of order 2''n'' - '''prismatic symmetry''' or '''ortho-n-gonal group''' (abstract group [[cyclic group|''Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']] &amp;times; ''Dih&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''); for ''n''=1 this is denoted by '''''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' (1*)''' and called '''[[reflection symmetry]]''', also '''[[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]]'''. It has [[reflection symmetry]] with respect to a plane perpendicular to the ''n''-fold rotation axis.
*'''''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'', [n], (*''nn'')''' of order 2''n'' - '''pyramidal symmetry''' or '''full acro-n-gonal group''' (abstract group ''Dih&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''); in biology  ''C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called '''biradial symmetry'''. For ''n''=1 we have again ''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' (1*). It has vertical mirror planes. This is the symmetry group for a regular ''n''-sided [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]].
*'''''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'', [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], (''n''&amp;times;)''' of order 2''n'' - '''gyro-n-gonal group''' (not to be confused with [[symmetric group]]s, for which the same notation is used; abstract group ''Z&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;''); It has a 2''n''-fold [[improper rotation|rotoreflection]] axis, also called 2''n''-fold improper rotation axis, i.e., the symmetry group contains a combination of a reflection in the horizontal plane and a rotation by an angle 180°/n. Thus, like ''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'', it contains a number of improper rotations without containing the corresponding rotations.
** for ''n''=1 we have ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ('''1&amp;times;'''), also denoted by '''''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''; this is [[Inversion in a point|inversion symmetry]]. 

'''''C&lt;sub&gt;2h&lt;/sub&gt;'', [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (2*)''' and '''''C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;'', [2], (*22)''' of order 4 are two of the three 3D symmetry group types with the [[Klein four-group]] as abstract group. ''C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;'' applies e.g. for a rectangular tile with its top side different from its bottom side.

== Frieze groups ==
In the limit these four groups represent Euclidean plane [[frieze group]]s as C&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt;, and S&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. Rotations become translations in the limit. Portions of the infinite plane can also be cut and connected into an infinite cylinder.

'''Dutch art''' describes the history of [[visual arts]] in the [[Netherlands]], after the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] separated from [[Flanders]]. Earlier painting in the area is covered in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting]].

The history of Dutch art is dominated by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], mostly of about 1620 to 1680, when a very distinct style and new types of painting were developed, though still keeping close links with [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  After the end of the Golden Age, production of paintings remained high, but ceased to influence the rest of Europe as strongly.

The [[Hague School]] of the 19th century re-interpreted the range of subjects of the Golden Age in contemporary terms, and made Dutch painting once again a European leader. In the successive movements of art since the 19th century, the Dutch contribution has been best known from the work of the individual figures of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Piet Mondrian]], though both did their best work outside the Netherlands, and took some time to be appreciated. [[Amsterdam Impressionism]] had a mainly local impact, but the ''[[De Stijl]]'' movement, of which Mondrian was a member, was influential abroad.

==Golden Age==
{{main article|Dutch Golden Age painting}}
[[File:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]] is often considered to be the best known piece of Dutch art.]]
[[Dutch Golden Age painting]] was among the most acclaimed in the world at the time, during the seventeenth century. There was an enormous output of painting, so much so that prices declined seriously during the period. From the 1620s, Dutch painting broke decisively from the [[Baroque]] style typified by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] in neighboring Flanders into a more realistic style of depiction, very much concerned with the real world. Types of paintings included historical paintings, portraiture, landscapes and cityscapes, [[still life]]s and [[Genre works|genre painting]]s. In the last four of these categories, Dutch painters established styles upon which art in Europe depended for the next two centuries. Paintings often had a moralistic subtext. The Golden Age never really recovered from the French invasion of 1671, although there was a twilight period lasting until about 1710.

[[Image:Heda hermitage.jpg|thumb|[[Willem Claeszoon Heda]] (17th century): ''Breakfast with a Lobster'']]
Dutch painters, especially in the northern provinces, tried to evoke emotions in the spectator by letting the person be a bystander to a scene of profound intimacy. Portrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century. many portraits were commissioned by wealthy individuals. Group portraits similarly were often ordered by prominent members of a city's civilian guard, by boards of trustees and regents, and the like. Often group portraits were paid for by each portrayed person individually. The amount paid determined each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. Allegories, in which painted objects conveyed symbolic meaning about the subject, were often applied. Many genre paintings, which seemingly only depicted everyday life, actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings, or conveyed a moralistic message, the meaning of which is not always easy to decipher nowadays. Favourite topics in Dutch landscapes were the dunes along the western sea coast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often a silhouette of a city in the distance.

[[Rembrandt]] had by 1631 established such a good reputation that he received several assignments for portraits from [[Amsterdam]]. In about 1640, his work became more sober, reflecting the family tragedies that he had suffered. Exuberance was replaced by more sincere emotions. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the New Testament instead of the Old Testament. One of his most famous paintings is ''[[Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]'', which was completed in 1642, at the peak of Holland's golden age. The painting was commissioned to be hung in the banquet hall of the newly-built [[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]] (Musketeers' Meeting Hall) in Amsterdam.

[[File:Johannes Vermeer - De Soldaat en het Lachende Meisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Vermeer's ''[[Officer and a Laughing Girl]]'' circa 1657]]
[[Johannes Vermeer]]'s works are admired for their transparent colors, careful composition, and brilliant use of light. Vermeer painted mostly domestic interior scenes, and even his two known landscapes are framed with a window. The interior scenes are usually genre pieces or portraits.

The [[Utrecht School]] refers to a group of painters active in the city of [[Utrecht]] in the Netherlands in the early part of the seventeenth century. It is part of what is called Baroque. They were all strongly influenced by the then recently deceased Caravaggio, who died in 1610. The [[Bamboccianti]] were a group of Dutch genre painters active in Rome from 1625 to 1700, during high and late Baroque. Their works were typically small parlor paintings or etchings of everyday life, including peasants in picturesque scenes.

==Nineteenth century==
===Hague School===
[[Image:George Hendrik Breitner - Gezicht op de Dam te Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|''The Dam, Amsterdam'' (circa 1895) by [[George Hendrik Breitner]]]]
By the 19th century the Netherlands were far behind the up-to-date art tendencies and schools. Possibly the best known Dutch painter in the first half of the 19th century, [[Johan Jongkind|Johan Barthold Jongkind]], after getting an art education in the country, moved over to France and spend most of his life in Paris.

At the same time, Dutch art responded to the realistic tendencies which were developing in France about the same time. The [[Hague School]] were around at the start of the nineteenth century. They included [[Jozef Israëls]]. [[Jacob Maris]] showed all that is gravest or brightest in the landscape of Holland, all that is heaviest or clearest in its atmosphere. "No painter," says M. Philippe Zilcken, "has so well expressed the ethereal effects, bathed in air and light through floating silvery mist, in which painters delight, and the characteristic remote horizons blurred by haze; or again, the grey yet luminous weather of Holland."

[[Amsterdam Impressionism]] was current during the middle of the nineteenth century at about the same time as [[French Impressionism]]. The painters put their impressions onto canvas with rapid, visible strokes of the brush. They focused on depicting the everyday life of the city. Late nineteenth-century Amsterdam was a bustling centre of art and literature. Famous painters among the Amsterdam Impressionists include [[George Hendrik Breitner]], [[Willem de Zwart]], [[Isaac Israëls]], [[Simon Duiker]] and [[Jan Toorop]]. George Hendrik Breitner introduced a realism to the Netherlands that created shock waves similar to that of [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]'s in France. He was the painter of city views par excellence: wooden foundation piles by the harbour, demolition work and construction sites in the old centre, horse trams on the Dam, or canals in the rain. By the turn of the century Breitner was a famous painter in the Netherlands, as demonstrated by a highly successful retrospective exhibition at Arti et Amicitiae in Amsterdam (1901). When the streets of Amsterdam are grey and rainy, people of Amsterdam whisper grimly "Echt Breitnerweer" (Typical Breitnerweather).

===Vincent van Gogh===

[[Vincent van Gogh]] (30 March 1853{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1890) was a [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. After years of painful anxiety and frequent bouts of mental illness,&lt;ref&gt;Tralbaut (1981), 286,287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1990), 390&lt;/ref&gt; he died aged 37 from a gunshot wound, generally accepted to be self-inflicted (although no gun was ever found). His work was then known to only a handful of people and appreciated by fewer still.

Following his first exhibitions in the late 1880s, van Gogh's fame grew steadily among colleagues, art critics, dealers and collectors.&lt;ref&gt;John Rewald, ''Studies in Post-Impressionism'', ''The Posthumous Fate of Vincent van Gogh 1890–1970,'' pp. 244–254, published by [[Harry N.

In the early 20th century, there were retrospectives in Paris (1901 and 1905) and Amsterdam ([[Stedelijk Museum]], 1905), and important group exhibitions in Cologne ([[Sonderbund westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und Künstler]], 1912), New York ([[Armory Show]], 1913) and Berlin (1914).&lt;ref&gt;See Dorn, Leeman &amp; alt.

==Twentieth century==
[[File:Composition, Piet Mondrian, 1916.jpg|thumb|''Composition'' by [[Piet Mondrian]], 1916]]
Around 1905 and 1910 pointillism as practiced by [[Jan Sluyters]], [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Leo Gestel]] was flourishing. Between 1911 and 1914 all the latest art movements arrived in the Netherlands one after another including [[cubism]], [[futurism]] and [[expressionism]]. After World War I, [[De Stijl]] (the style) was led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and Piet Mondrian and promoted a pure art, consisting only of vertical and horizontal lines, and the use of primary colours. The [[Design Academy]] was established in 1947.

{{otheruses}}
A '''fifer''' is a [[non-combatant]] [[Military career|military occupation]] of a foot soldier who originally played the [[fife (musical instrument)|fife]] during [[combat]]. The practice was instituted during the period of [[Early Modern warfare]] to sound [[Signals (military)|signals]] during changes in formation, such as the [[Line (formation)|line]], and were also members of the [[regiment]]'s [[military band]] during [[Marching|marches]]. 

These soldiers, often boys too young to fight or sons of [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]'s, were used to help [[infantry]] [[battalion]]s to keep marching pace from the right of the formation in coordination with the [[drummers]] positioned at the centre,&lt;ref&gt;when deployed in a line, p.10, Nafziger&lt;/ref&gt; and relayed orders in the form of sequences of musical signals. The fife was particularly useful because of its high pitched sound, which could be heard over the sounds of [[battle]].

The usual allocation of fifers in a [[battalion]] during the Early Modern warfare period varied from five to eight.&lt;ref&gt;p.7, Nafziger&lt;/ref&gt; The [[regimental band]]s, particularly of the high prestige units such as the [[List of army units called Guards|guards]] had as many as 32 (in the [[Preobrazhensky regiment]]) or more fifers.&lt;ref&gt;p.39, Nafziger&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fifers, as part of the [[fife-and-drum corps]] that accompanied Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] and the [[First Fleet]], were present at important national historical events, such as the reading of the [[Governor's Commission]] on 2 February 1788 at [[Sydney Cove]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080905001852/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/military/ Military music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905001852/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/military/ |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Forest and Dove''''' (1927) is a painting by the [[Germany|German]] [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Max Ernst]]. It depicts a nocturnal scene of a forest of bizarre, abstract trees. In the thick of the forest is a childlike depiction of a dove.

Both the forest and dove themes have appeared several times in Ernst’s works. According to an analysis by the [[Tate Gallery]] in [[London]] the forest image represents the forest near Ernst’s childhood home which inspired a sense of ‘enchantment and terror’ in the artist. The same analysis also states that the dove represents Ernst himself.

The painting has a heavily textured and three-dimensional appearance. This is owed to a technique called [[grattage]]. Grattage was invented by Ernst and the [[Spain|Spanish]] surrealist [[Joan Miró]]. This technique involves scraping the paint across the canvas so that the paint takes on the imprints of objects placed beneath the canvas.

'''Frederic Will''' is a Midwestern American writer.  Will has been active in many genres: poetry, fiction, [[cultural history]], philosophy, translation, travel memoir.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
The American poet/novelist/critic/translator Frederic Will was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] in 1928. His parents, Samuel and Constance, moved the family to the [[Midwest]] in 1930; Will's father was for the next 25 years a professor of French at the [[University of Illinois]] and at [[Indiana University]]. His mother was a bilingual (English/French) housewife. The house in which he was brought up was lined with bookshelves of French literary classics—Montaigne and Rabelais featured, in leather bindings cut for them on the Left Bank. Will was raised on the campus of the University of Illinois, where—except during two years of [[asthma]] recovery in [[Arizona]]—he remained until going to [[Phillips Andover]] for his senior year of high school. His subsequent education was at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1946), Laval University in Quebec, and at Indiana University (B.A. in Classics, 1949), and [[Yale University]] (PhD Comparative Literature, 1954). Laval, with its pre-modern Thomist atmosphere, was the deepest of these forays into learning from others.

===Personal life===
Will is married, has six children, and lives both in [[Mount Vernon, Iowa]] and in [[Delta State]], Nigeria. He has traveled widely, both in Asia and Africa, and has only two more locations on his must-visit list: Russia and Zaire. Writing and traveling seem to him activities that call on one another, as though the appetite of the world to be named accompanied the writing instrument of the seeing traveler.

===Career===
Will has taught Comparative Literature, Classics, and Translation Workshops at various Universities in the United States and abroad: [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] (1951–54), [[Penn State]] (1955–60), [[University of Texas]] (1960–65), [[University of Iowa]] (1965–70, 1983–85), [[University of Wisconsin]] (1967), [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (1970–83), [[University of Colorado]] (1978), [[Deep Springs College]] (2004–06), Instituto de Estudios Criticos (2007). He was Co-Director of the University of Iowa International Writing Program (1983-1985). He was Overseer and President of [[Mellen University]] (1990–1999). Abroad he has taught at the Universities of Tuebingen, Tunis, Ivory Coast, Chad, Mizoram (India), Chang'sha China (Hunan Normal). He currently teaches for the Humanities University (humanitiesuniversity.org or humanitiesinstitute.org) where he is Vice President for Research.

===Editorial work===
Founding editor (with [[William Arrowsmith]]) of ''Arion, A Journal of Classical Culture'' (1962--) University of Texas. Founder and editor of ''Micromegas, A Journal of Poetry in Translation'' (1965–75). Arion marked a turning point in Anglo-American classical studies, replacing positivist 'contribution studies' by more imaginative and daring efforts to open the classical tradition into its blazing richness. Micromegas, like Robert Bly's ''The Sixties'', was a single-handed effort to enrich American poetry with the bloodstreams of at first contemporary Latin-American poetry, and then, in subsequent issues, of a wide variety of national issues—French, German, Hungarian, Greek, Icelandic.

===Archival material===
Will's literary and editorial papers (1962–) are in the Humanities Research Center, University of Texas.The collection includes hundreds of pages of manuscripts of both published and unpublished materials, in addition to an extensive correspondence dating back to the University of Texas Renaissance, under HRC Director, Harry Ransom.

A '''Guide to information sources''' (or a '''bibliographic guide''', a '''literature guide''', a '''guide to reference materials''', a '''subject gateway''', etc.) is a kind of '''[[metabibliography]]'''. Ideally it is not just a listing of [[bibliographies]], [[reference work]]s  and other [[information source]]s, but more like a [[textbook]] introducing users to the information sources in a given field (in general).

Such guides may have many different forms: Comprehensive or highly selective, printed or electronic sources, annoteted listings or written chapters etc.

==Functions==
Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources.

The '''International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works''' ('''IIC''') is a global organisation for [[conservation and restoration]] professionals with over two thousand members in over fifty countries. The IIC seeks to promote the knowledge, methods and working standards needed to protect and preserve [[History|historic]] and [[art]]istic works throughout the world.

== Aims ==
IIC is an independent international organisation supported by individual and institutional members. It is a forum for communication among those professionals who have responsibility for the preservation of [[cultural heritage]]. It aims to advance knowledge, practice and standards for the conservation of historic and artistic works through its publications and conferences. It also promotes professional excellence and public awareness through its awards and scholarships.

== Organisation and governance ==
The current Council of the institute (2018-2019) is:

Officers:
* President - Sarah Staniforth ([[National Trust]], ret'd)
* Vice-President - Amber Kerr ([[Lunder Conservation Center]] - [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]])
* Vice-President - Mikkel Scharff ([[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]])
* Vice-President - Valentine Walsh (United Kingdom)
* Secretary-General - Jo Kirby Atkinson (United Kingdom)
* Treasurer - Velson Horie (United Kingdom)
* Director of Publications - Joyce Townsend ([[Tate]])
* Director of Communications - Julian Bickersteth (Australia)
* Director of Membership - David Saunders (United Kingdom)

Ordinary Members of Council:
* Madhavan Velayudhan Nair (India)
* Austin Nevin (Istituto Nazionale di Fotonica - Consiglio Nazionale delleRicerche (IFN-CNR), Dipartimento di Fisica, [[Politecnico di Milano]]))
* Lorenzo Appolonia (Regione Autonoma Valle d'Aosta, Dept. of Cultural Heritage)
* Stavroula Golfomitsou ([[University of Gothenburg]] Sweden)

* Alice Tsang (Conservation Section of the Hong Kong [[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Heritage conservation in Hong Kong]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eleonora Nagy (USA / Hungary)
* Rachel Sabino ([[Art Institute of Chicago]])

IIC's Council attempts to reflect the geographical and professional balance of the worldwide conservation profession. Council Members, including the Secretary-General and Treasurer, are volunteers, as are the editors of ''Studies in Conservation'' and IIC's Congress preprints. The institute has a permanent secretariat in [[London]] with a staff of four.

IIC co-operates closely with other organisations in the field, notably the [[International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property]] and the Committee for Conservation of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) as well as national and regional conservation groups.

IIC is a learned society and is also registered with the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=209677&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 |title=Charity overview |publisher=Charity-commission.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1930, the International Museums Office of the [[League of Nations]] held a conference in Rome on the examination and conservation of works of art. Following this meeting, the Museums Office issued a series of publications on the subject. In 1932 a technical journal of conservation studies, ''Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts'',&lt;ref&gt;Packard, Elisabeth C.G. George Stout and the Art Technical Sections of the AAM annual meetings in the 1930s and 1940s. Part II.&lt;/ref&gt; was established by the [[Fogg Museum]] ([[Harvard University]]), under the managing editorship of [[George L. Stout]]. It continued publication until 1942.

The repatriation of art treasures after World War II brought together experts from Europe and the United States. They proposed the revival of ''Technical Studies'' and the formation of an international body of conservators to continue the interchange of information on the care and conservation of works of art. Between 1946 and 1948 a series of meetings was held to discuss these proposals. Foremost among those involved in the meetings were [[George L. Stout]], W.G. Constable (Boston), Ian Rawlins (London), and Paul Coremans (Brussels).

In December 1948 at a meeting of the [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] Commission on the Care of Paintings in London, it was announced that a new international institute for conservation was about to be incorporated with offices in London and that its interests would be the scientific and technical study of the subject.&lt;ref name=MN&gt;Gettens, Rutherford J. IIC: an international association of conservators. ''Museum News'' (American Association of Museums) 47, no. 10 (1969 Jun), pp. 11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
On April 27, 1950, the International Institute for the Conservation of Museum Objects (which acquired its present name in 1959) was incorporated as a limited company in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;The international journal of museum management and curatorship 1, no. 2 (1982 Jun), pp. 159-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Its aims were "to improve the state of knowledge and standards of practice and to provide a common meeting ground and publishing body for all who are interested in and professionally skilled in the conservation of museum objects”.&lt;ref name=MN /&gt; The Institute was to be concerned with:
* The status of conservators, by forming a professional self-electing body
* Publications: abstracts of the technical literature, and original work with a scientific bias - the end of the "secrets of the Old Masters"
* Training, with the aim of raising standards.

The office was established with the help of a grant from the [[Nuffield Foundation]]. London was chosen as the "midpoint" between the United States and continental Europe. Office space was provided free by the Trustees of the [[National Gallery (London)]]. The Institute moved to its own independent offices in 1968.

The membership was to consist of Fellows who were to be persons highly qualified in (or in positions of great authority in) conservation and Associates who were to be "persons anxious to promote the objects of the Institute". Later a category of Institutional Members was introduced.

When the IIC was founded in 1950, the Founder Fellows were [[George L. Stout]], Rutherford J. Gettens, Richard Buck, W.G. Constable, Murray Pease, Ian Rawlins, [[Harold Plenderleith]], Sir [[Wallace Akers]] (chairman of ICI), Helmut Ruhemann, and [[Paul B. Coremans|Paul Coremans]]. Others who joined in that first year included Arthur van Schendel, [[René Sneyers]], and Sheldon and Caroline Keck. Stout became the IIC's first President, with Plenderleith its Treasurer and Rawlins its Secretary-General.&lt;ref name=MN /&gt;

The IIC membership grew quickly. In October 1952 there were 62 members (38 of them Fellows) with 64 candidates for associate membership in process of election; by March 1952, there were 167 members (50 of them Fellows).&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Hero Boothroyd. ''A Short History of IIC: Foundation and Development''. IIC (2000), {{ISBN|0-9500525-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
* IIC Fellows are senior members of the profession who are elected by the existing body of Fellows. Fellowship of IIC is open to all members who are actively engaged in the profession of conservation. Fellows must be able to demonstrate commitment to the profession and to show that they keep up-to-date with relevant developments. Indicators include publications, voluntary service to conservation organisations, participation in conferences and training events, membership of other relevant professional bodies, and accreditation by a national organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Anon.

* IIC Individual membership is open to those working in conservation and with an interest in conserving the world's heritage.
* Student membership of IIC is for those enrolled in a full-time programme of education, training or work experience under the supervision of a professional conservator.
* Institutional IIC membership is intended for museum and galleries, libraries and archives, conservation schools, research institutes and commercial firms.

== Publications  &amp; Communications ==
In May 1952, the first issue of the ''IIC Newsletter'' appeared; this later became the ''IIC Bulletin'' and in turn was succeeded in 2007 by ''News in Conservation''. In October 1952, ''Studies in Conservation'' began publication. ''IIC Abstracts'', an international journal of abstracts of the technical literature and the forerunner of ''Art and Archaeology Technical Abstracts'', was first published in 1955. With changing editorship, it ran for five volumes ending with Vol.5, no.4 (Autumn 1965). In 2000, the first volume of the annual ''Reviews in Conservation'' was published.

=== ''Studies in Conservation'' ===
''Studies in Conservation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiconservation.org/publications/sic/sic.php |title=Browse Studies in Conservation &amp;#124; International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works |publisher=Iiconservation.org |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]], produced eight times a year, on the conservation of historic and artistic works. ''Studies in Conservation''  publishes original work on a range of subjects including, but not limited to, advances in conservation practice, novel methods of treatment, preventive conservation, issues of collection care, conservation history and ethics, examination methods for works of art, new research in the analysis of artistic materials or mechanisms of deterioration, and conservation issues in display and storage.

=== ''Reviews in Conservation'' ===
Published annually from 2000 until 2010, ''Reviews in Conservation'' has now been incorporated into ''Studies in Conservation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiconservation.org/publications/ric/ric.php |title=Browse Reviews in Conservation &amp;#124; International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works |publisher=Iiconservation.org |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free to the general public for download from the IIC web-site, ''News in Conservation'' contains news from the IIC Council and regional groups, as well as job vacancies, conference listings, and notices, along with a mixture of news stories, features, interviews, and other articles relating to all aspects of conservation in every issue.

===Social Networking===
IIC operates a lively Facebook page and Twitter and LinkedIn presence as well as a discussion group on LinkedIn.  These allow for the rapid sharing of conservation news and events and, at LinkedIn, an active discussion forum for conservation issues and topics

==Biennial Congresses==
In 1961, with the help of a grant from the [[Gulbenkian Foundation]], the IIC held its first international conference. That meeting, in Rome, was attended by 150 people, and the papers were published by [[Butterworths]] under the title ''Recent Advances in Conservation''.&lt;ref&gt;''Recent Advances in Conservation: Contributions to the IIC Rome Conference, 1961'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, conferences have been held at two- or three-year intervals with published preprints on a topic of current interest.

==Student &amp; Emerging Conservator Conferences==
In 2011 IIC instigated its Student &amp; Emerging Conservator Conference series. These events are aimed at helping recent graduates and those still studying conservation to develop their skills and gain valuable career insights. They offer invaluable networking opportunities and panel discussions with webcasts, studio visits and a lively social programme.

The first conference in this series was
* Conservation: Futures and Responsibilities (London 2011)
This was followed by:
*  Conservation: Obstacles or Opportunities? (Copenhagen, 2013)
*  Conservation: Making the Transition (Warsaw 2015)
*  Head, Hands &amp; Heart (Bern, 2017)
With the next event planned for 2019.

== Regional groups ==
IIC's Regional Groups began in 1958. Regional Groups are independent associations affiliated or associated with IIC. A Regional Group is required to adhere to the aims and objectives of the IIC as expressed in the Memorandum of Association. Its by-laws must be approved by the IIC Council and its officers should be members of IIC. The first Regional Groups formed were the IIC-United Kingdom Group (now Icon, the [[Institute of Conservation]]) and the IIC-American Group (now the [[American Institute for Conservation]]). There are currently Regional Groups in Scandinavia, Austria, Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, and Spain as well as an Arabic Group.

==Awards==

=== Forbes Prize Lecture ===
The Forbes Prize Lecture has been delivered at every IIC Congress since the Rome Congress in 1961.  In 1958 a Forbes Prize Fund had been set up at the [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]], to which financial contributions were made in recognition of [[Edward W. Forbes]]'s services to conservation. The fund was to be administered by IIC to provide some kind of prize for outstanding work in the field of conservation. It was agreed in 1960 that the accumulated funds should be awarded in the form of a fee for a Forbes Lecture at the 1961 IIC Rome Conference, and the first Forbes Prize lecture was given there by [[Harold Plenderleith]].

[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|right|Member of the right-wing revisionist group "[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]" putting up a banner reading "[Give] the children correct history textbooks" in front of the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]]]
'''Japanese history textbook controversies''' involve controversial content in one of the [[Government of Japan|government]]-approved [[history]] textbooks used in the [[Secondary education in Japan|secondary education]] (junior high schools and senior high schools) of [[Japan]]. The controversies primarily concern the Japanese nationalist efforts to [[whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]] the actions of the [[Empire of Japan]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Mark-Selden/3173 |title=Japanese Textbook Controversies, Nationalism, and Historical Memory: Intra- and Inter-national Conflicts |publisher=JapanFocus |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="masa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/examining_the_japanese_history_textbook_controversies|title=EXAMINING THE JAPANESE HISTORY TEXTBOOK CONTROVERSIES|last=|first=|date=November 2001|website=|publisher=Stanford Program on International and Cross-Cultural Education|access-date=|author=Kathleen Woods Masalski|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another serious issue is the [[constitutionality]] of the governmentally-approved textbook depictions of [[World War II]], [[Japanese war crimes]], and [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|Japanese imperialism]] during the first half of the 20th century. The history textbook controversies have been an issue of deep concern both domestically and internationally, particularly in countries which were victims of Imperial Japan during the war.

Despite the efforts of the nationalist textbook reformers, by the late 1990s the most common Japanese schoolbooks contained references to, for instance, the [[Nanking Massacre]], [[Unit 731]], and the [[comfort women]] of World War II,&lt;ref name=masa /&gt; all historical issues which have faced challenges from ultranationalists in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s841387.htm |title=Foreign Correspondent - 22/04/2003: Japan - Unit 731 |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2003-04-22 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent of the controversial textbooks, the ''New History Textbook'', published in 2000, which significantly downplays Japanese aggression, was shunned by nearly all of Japan's school districts.&lt;ref name=masa /&gt;

==Textbook authorization system==
School textbooks in Japan are not written by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]]. Instead, the textbooks for all subjects in [[Elementary schools in Japan|elementary]], and both lower and upper secondary schools are written and published by several major private companies. This system was introduced to Japan after [[World War II]] to avoid government having direct authority over the written contents. Japan's [[Fundamental Law of Education|School Education Law]] ({{lang|ja|教育基本法}}) requires schools to use textbooks that are authorized by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]] (MEXT). However, each local education board has the final authority to select which textbooks can be used in their jurisdiction from the approved list.

In Japan, potential school textbooks must pass a sequence of evaluations before receiving approval to be used in Japanese schools. First, textbook companies submit a draft of their proposed textbooks to the Japanese Ministry of Education. The Textbook Authorization and Research Council ({{lang|ja|教科用図書検定調査審議会}}), an official council of the Ministry of Education, composed of university professors, junior high teachers, checks the draft in accordance with the Ministry's educational [[curriculum guideline]]s ({{lang|ja|学習指導要領}}) to ensure that the contents of the proposed textbook is "objective, impartial, and free from errors." The Ministry of Education will give the company that authored the textbook the opportunity to revise the draft when it is found to contain information that is inconsistent with national guidelines. Once the textbook revisions are complete and the textbook has received the approval of the Ministry of Education, Local Boards of Education select books from a list of authorized textbooks for schools under their jurisdiction. The process of textbook authorization is ongoing and conducted every four years, the results of which are presented to the public the following year.

Critics claim that the government textbook authorization system has been used to reject textbooks that depict Imperial Japan in a negative light. This includes a case in the 1960s where a description of the Nanking Massacre and other [[war crime]]s committed by the Japanese military before and during [[World War II]] was rejected by the Ministry of Education. The author sued the Ministry, finally winning the case decades later. Recent controversy focuses on the approval of a history textbook published by the [[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]], which placed emphasis on the achievements of pre–World War II Imperial Japan, as well as a reference to the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] with fewer critical comments compared to the other Japanese history textbooks. Historian [[Stephen E. Ambrose]] noted that "The Japanese presentation of the war to its children runs something like this: 'One day, for no reason we ever understood, the Americans [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|started dropping atomic bombs on us]].'"&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ambrose, To America: Personal Reflections of an Historian, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of the system counter that a book which fails to mention specific negative facts regarding the aggression and atrocities committed by Japan during World War II would also fail the Ministry of Education's approval process. During the approval process for the aforementioned history textbook by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, the author was ordered to revise the book's content several times before receiving final approval. Moreover, during the Cold War, the Ministry rejected textbooks by left-leaning publishers which attempted to portray the Soviet Union, Mainland China, North Korea and other Communist countries in a positive light. Defenders also point out that during the 1960s and 1970s, the extent of the atrocities, as well as the existence of many of the incidents, were still being debated by Japanese historians; therefore, the Ministry of Education was correct in rejecting references to specific atrocities such as the Nanking Massacre during that era, but the Ministry finally insisted on the inclusion of those same incidents after Japanese historians had finally reached consensus during the 1990s. They also point out that, North and South Korea, as well as China, which happen to be the most outspoken critics of the Japanese textbook approval process, do not allow private publishing companies to write history textbooks for their schools. Instead, the governments of those countries write a single history textbook for all of their schools. [[Korean textbook controversy|In the case of South Korea]], the government strictly examines textbooks from different companies before being publicized. Critics of Chinese and Korean textbooks also argue that the textbooks of those countries are far more politically censored and self-favoring than Japanese textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=

Today there are 30 unique textbooks for {{nihongo|Social Studies|社会|Shakai}}, from 5 different publishers, in Japanese primary schools. Additionally, there are 8 unique textbooks for {{nihongo|the study of history as part of the Japanese Social Studies curriculum|社会-歴史的分野|Shakai-Rekishi teki bunya}}, from 8 different publishers, for junior high schools. In Japanese high schools, the number of available options is much greater, with 50 unique textbook editions available for teaching Japanese, and world history.

==Textbook screening==
The current textbook authorization system began in 1947 under the direction of the U.S.-led Supreme Commander, Allied Powers ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]]) authority during Japan's [[Occupied Japan|post–World War II occupation]]. SCAP ordered the provisional government of Japan to end the system of {{nihongo|government-designated textbooks|国定教科書|Kokutei Kyōkasho}} and allow scholars in the private sector to write textbooks. Local educators would then choose which textbooks to use at their schools. Descriptions that promoted [[militarism]] and [[Nationalism|ultranationalism]] were eliminated, and the new idea to promote [[individualism|the dignity of the individual]] ({{lang|ja|個人の尊厳}}) was introduced. The New School Education Law states that while the government sets a curriculum guideline, it is not meant to establish a fixed, uniform line for all educators to observe, like in the old militarist days, but rather to help educators to creatively adapt the curriculum to the new demands of children and society in general.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Major controversies==
[[Tokushi Kasahara]] identifies three time periods in postwar Japan during which he asserts the Japanese government has "waged critical challenges to history
textbooks in attempts to tone down or delete descriptions of Japan's wartime aggression, especially atrocities such as the Nanjing Massacre."  The first challenge occurred in 1955, and the
second took place in the early 1980s. The third began in 1997 and continues unresolved to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/events/2007/kasahara.pdf |title=Reconciling Narratives of the Nanking Massacre in Japanese and Chinese Textbooks |publisher=Tsuru Bunka University |first=Tokushi |last=Kasahara |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074602/http://www.usip.org/events/2007/kasahara.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Ureubeki Kyōkasho" issue (1955)===
At the general election of February 1955, the [[Japan Democratic Party (1954)|Japan Democratic Party]] &lt;!--民主党?--&gt; proposed an idea that whilst editing of school textbooks might be left to the private sector, the government ought to supervise them and limit the kinds of textbooks to about two for each subject by tightening the authorization, so that the textbooks in effect would be equivalent to government-designated textbooks.

At the Special Committee on Administrative Inspection of [[House of Representatives (Japan)|the House of Representatives]] in July of the same year, Kazutomo Ishii ({{lang|ja|石井一朝}}) of  the Democratic Party of Japan suggested that textbooks were about to be published that could overthrow the principle of the education of Japan.  He characterized these textbooks as:

*Intentionally and unwarrantably depicting the life of the working class of Japan as extremely horrible, so that it seems to be a product of the defects of the social system and of the self-contradiction of capitalism.
*Extolling the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Republic of China]] (the [[People's Republic of China]] was not officially recognized at the time) very emphatically and seeming to suggest that Japan should be subservient to them.

In addition, from August to October of the same year, the Japan Democratic Party published three volumes of booklets entitled "'''Ureubeki Kyōkasho'''" ({{lang|ja|うれうべき教科書}}, deplorable textbooks). The first volume listed four types of bias as "examples of biased education that appeared in textbooks":

* Ones that unconditionally support the labor union of teachers and the [[Japan Teachers Union]], and advance their political activities: Miyahara Seiichi ({{lang|ja|宮原誠一}}) ed., social studies textbook for high school, ''Ippan Shakai'' ({{lang|ja|一般社会}}), published from Jikkyo Shuppan ({{lang|ja|実教出版}}).
* Ones that hype how horrible the predicament of the Japanese workers are, and thereby advances a radical and destructive labor movement: Munakata Seiya ({{lang|ja|宗像誠也}}) ed., social studies textbook for junior high school, ''Shakai no Shikumi'' ({{lang|ja|社会のしくみ}}), published from Kyōiku Shuppan ({{lang|ja|教育出版}}).
* Ones that particularly glorify and extol the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Republic of China]], and castigate Japan: Sugo Hiroshi ({{lang|ja|周郷博}}) ed., social studies textbook for 6th grade, ''Akarui Shakai'' ({{lang|ja|あかるい社会}}), published from Chuukyō Shuppan ({{lang|ja|中教出版}}).
* Ones that instill children with Marxist–Leninist, i.e. [[communism|communist]] ideas: Osada Arata ({{lang|ja|長田新}}) ed., social studies textbook for junior high school, ''Mohan Chuugaku Shakai'' ({{lang|ja|模範中学社会}}), published from Jikkyō Shuppan ({{lang|ja|実教出版}}).

The Japan Democratic Party condemned these textbooks as biased "red textbooks" ({{lang|ja|赤い教科書}}). In response to this, the authors and editors of the listed textbooks made various public statements and protest notes. However, the Japan Democratic Party did not reply. Since this incident a greater number of textbooks had been rejected as being biased ({{lang|ja|偏向}}).

The changes resulted in one-third of pre-existing textbooks being banned from Japanese schools. The [[MEXT|Ministry of Education]] required that new textbooks avoid criticism of Japanese involvement in the Pacific War, and avoid mention of the Japanese invasion of China and involvement in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/133p/133p04papers/JChapelNanjing046.htm Joseph Chapel, "Denial of the Holocaust and the Rape of Nanking" (2004)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Section F" purge===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Textbook screening in 1956, right after a change of the members of Textbook Authorization Research Council ({{lang|ja|教科用図書検定調査審議会}}) in September of the previous year, failed six drafts of textbooks, a significantly greater number than before.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The evaluations of drafts by the Council had been noted by five letters from A to E, each representing the evaluation of a member in the Council. At 1955's screening, however, there was an additional section F that was considered responsible for the rejection of all the six drafts. Over this incident professor Iwao Takayama ({{lang|ja|高山岩男}}) of [[Nihon University]] who newly joined the Council was suspected be the writer of section F, and the news media reported the incident as the "Section F purge" ({{lang|ja|Ｆ項パージ}}, "''F-ko paaji''").

===Ienaga v. Japan (1965–1997)===
{{main|Saburo Ienaga}}

Saburo Ienaga was a Japanese historian known partly for his involvement in controversies regarding school history textbooks. In 1953, the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]] published a textbook by Ienaga but censored what they said were factual errors and matters of opinion, regarding [[Japanese war crimes]]. Ienaga undertook a series of lawsuits against the Ministry for violation of his [[freedom of speech]]. He was nominated for the 2001 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] by [[Noam Chomsky]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary: Saburo Ienaga: One man's campaign against Japanese censorship" Jonathan Watts. ''[[The Guardian]]''. London (UK): Dec 3, 2002. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Persistence of memory: Saburo Ienaga insists Japan remember an unsavoury war to ensure dreams of peace" John Price. ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''. Vancouver, B.C.: Mar 7, 2001. p. A.13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighboring Country Clause===
On June 26, 1982, the Japanese textbook authorization system became a major diplomatic issue for the first time when ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' reported that the Ministry of Education demanded a textbook, which stated that the Japanese army ''invaded'' ({{lang|ja|侵略}}) Northern China, be rewritten using the phrase "''advanced'' ({{lang|ja|進出}}) into" instead of ''invaded''. Having heard this news the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] government strongly protested to the Japanese government. In response, on August 26, 1982, [[Kiichi Miyazawa]], then the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, made the following statement:

#The Japanese Government and the Japanese people are deeply aware of the fact that acts by our country in the past caused tremendous suffering and damage to the peoples of Asian countries, including the Republic of Korea (ROK) and China, and have followed the path of a pacifist state with remorse and determination that such acts must never be repeated. Japan has recognized, in the Japan-ROK Joint Communiqué of 1965, that the "past relations are regrettable, and Japan feels deep remorse," and in the Japan-China Joint Communiqué, that Japan is "keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war and deeply reproaches itself." These statements confirm Japan's remorse and determination which I stated above and this recognition has not changed at all to this day.
#This spirit in the Japan-ROK Joint Communiqué and the Japan-China Joint Communiqué naturally should also be respected in Japan's school education and textbook authorization. Recently, however, the Republic of Korea, China, and others have been criticizing some descriptions in Japanese textbooks. From the perspective of building friendship and goodwill with neighboring countries, Japan will pay due attention to these criticisms and make corrections at the Government's responsibility.
#To this end, in relation to future authorization of textbooks, the Government will revise the Guideline for Textbook Authorization after discussions in the Textbook Authorization and Research Council and give due consideration to the effect mentioned above. Regarding textbooks that have already been authorized, Government will take steps quickly to the same effect. As measures until then, the Minister of Education, Sports, Science and Culture will express his views and make sure that the idea mentioned in 2. Above is duly reflected in the places of education.
#Japan intends to continue to make efforts to promote mutual understanding and develop friendly and cooperative relations with neighboring countries and to contribute to the peace and stability of Asia and, in turn, of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/postwar/state8208.html Statement by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kiichi Miyazawa on History Textbooks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread attention that the issue received in both the Japanese and international media, investigations done in September 1982 reveal that the alleged change never actually took place, that the ministry of education did not even make a recommendation for the change, and that the entire incident was caused by hasty and inaccurate reporting by a small group of journalists assigned to cover the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, Kenneth B. 1983. "Japan Besieged: The Textbook Controversy," Journal of Japanese Studies, 9(2):  297-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1982 the Ministry of Education adopted a new authorization criterion, the so-called "Neighboring Country Clause" ({{lang|ja|近隣諸国条項}}): Textbooks ought to show understanding and seek international harmony in their treatment of modern and contemporary historical events involving neighboring Asian countries ({{lang|ja|近隣のアジア諸国との間の近現代の歴史的事象の扱いに国際理解と国際協調の見地から必要な配慮がされていること}}).

===New History Textbook===
{{Main|Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform|2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations}}

In 2000, [[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]], a group of conservative scholars, published the ''New History Textbook'' (''Atarashii Rekishi Kyokasho'', {{lang|ja|新しい歴史教科書}}), which was intended to promote a revised view of Japan.  The textbook downplays or [[whitewash (censorship)|whitewashes]] the nature of [[Japanese war crimes|Japan's military aggression]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910]], the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and in [[World War II]].  The textbook was approved by the Ministry of Education in 2001, and caused a huge controversy in Japan, China and Korea. A large number of Japanese historians and educators protested against the content of ''New History Textbook'' and its treatment of Japanese wartime activities. [[China Radio International]] reported that the PRC government and people were "strongly indignant about and dissatisfied with the new Japanese history textbook for the year 2002 compiled by right-wing Japanese scholars".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web12.cri.com.cn/english/2001/Apr/13714.htm CRI Online, April 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210140041/http://web12.cri.com.cn/english/2001/Apr/13714.htm |date=2004-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the ''New History Textbook'' was used by only 0.039% of junior high schools in Japan as of August 15, 2001. According to the Society, there are currently eight private junior high schools, one public school for the disabled in [[Tokyo]], three public junior high schools and four public schools for the disabled in [[Ehime Prefecture|Ehime]] that use their textbook ([[Mainichi Shimbun]], September 27, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Sven Saaler: Politics, Memory and Public Opinion: The History Textbook Controversy and Japanese Society. Munich: 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations|Anti-Japanese demonstrations were held in the spring of 2005]] in [[China]] and [[South Korea]] to protest against the ''New History Textbook''.

===Comfort women comments===
In 2007, former education minister [[Nariaki Nakayama]] declared he was proud that the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] had succeeded in getting references to "wartime sex slaves" struck from most authorized history texts for junior high schools. "Our campaign worked, and people outside government also started raising their voices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/03/11/news/sex-slave-history-erased-from-texts-93-apology-next/|title=Sex slave history erased from texts|publisher=The Japan Times|date=2007-03-11|accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 passage change on forced World War II suicides===
Japan ordered history books to change passages on [[forced suicide]]s during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/world/asia/01japan.html|title=Japan’s Textbooks Reflect Revised History|publisher=nytimes.com|date=2007-04-01|accessdate=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, the [[Okinawa Prefectural Assembly]] officially asked the Ministry of Education of Japan to retract its instruction to downplay the military's role in [[Battle of Okinawa#Civilian losses, suicides and atrocities|mass suicide in Okinawa]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/06/23/news/okinawa-slams-history-text-rewrite/|title=Okinawa slams history text rewrite|publisher=The Japan Times|date=2007-06-23|accessdate=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 100,000 people in Okinawa rallied against the textbook changes at the end of September.  According to the [[Kyodo News]] agency, it was the biggest staged rally on the island since its 1972 return to Japanese rule.  Okinawa governor [[Hirokazu Nakaima]] spoke to the crowds, commenting that the Japanese military's involvement in the mass suicides should not be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7020335.stm|title=Huge Japan protest over textbook|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-09-29|accessdate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
A comparative study begun in 2006 by the [[Asia–Pacific Research Center]] at [[Stanford University]] on Japanese, Chinese, South Korean and US textbooks describes 99% of Japanese textbooks as having a "muted, neutral, and almost bland" tone and "by no means avoid some of the most controversial wartime moments" like the Nanjing massacre or to a lesser degree the issue of comfort women. The project, led by Stanford scholars [[Gi-Wook Shin]] and [[Daniel Sneider]], found that less than one percent of Japanese textbooks used provocative and inflammatory language and imagery, but that these few books, printed by just one publisher, received greater media attention. Moreover, the minority viewpoint of nationalism and revisionism gets more media coverage than the prevailing majority narrative of pacifism in Japan. Chinese and South Korean textbooks were found to be often nationalistic, with Chinese textbooks often blatantly nationalistic and South Korean textbooks focusing on oppressive Japanese colonial rule. US history textbooks were found to be nationalistic and overly patriotic, although they invite debate about major issues.&lt;ref name=Stanford2014&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2014/pr-memory-war-asia-040414.html |last=Parker |first=Clifton B. |title=Nationalism clouds WWII memories in Asia, says Stanford scholar |work=Stanford News |publisher=[[Stanford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/a00703/|title = Divided Memories: History Textbooks and the Wars in Asia|date = May 29, 2012|accessdate = May 4, 2015|website = Nippon.com|publisher = |last = Sneider|first = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jómsvíkinga saga''' '''(Saga of the Jomsvikings)''' is a medieval Icelandic saga composed by an anonymous Icelander. The Saga was composed in [[Iceland]] during the 13th century. It exists in several manuscripts which vary from each other. There are many different versions and translations of the saga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Saga%20of%20the%20Jomsvikings.pdf|title= Jómsvíkinga Saga The Saga of the Jomsvikings|publisher=Thomas Nelson and sons, Ltd|author=Gabriel Turville-Petre, Sigurð Nordal |date=1962|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Słupecki, Leszek P.  ''Facts and fancy in Jómsvíkinga saga'' in ''The Fantastic in Old Norse/Icelandic Literature: Preprint Papers of the 13th International Saga Conference''  (Durham: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The saga==
The ''Jómsvíkinga saga'' tells the story of the founding of Jómsborg ([[Jomsborg]]), a typical market town in the 13th century, also known as Willon, off of the southern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] by the legendary Danish chieftain [[Palnatoke|Pálna-Tóki]]. Jómsborg's name is composed of two elements: the Old Norse term ''borg,'' meaning a [[citadel]], and the unidentified term, ''Jóm''. The Jómsvíkinga saga is centered around the tensions between Haraldr Gormsson of Denmark, Hákon Sigurðarson of Norway, and the Jómsvíkings. The Jómsvíkings challenged royal authority in the midst of a power struggle between Denmark and Norway. In order to better understand the Jómsvíkinga saga, it is important to understand the relationship between [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] around this time. In addition to founding Jómsborg, Pálna-Tóki founded the brotherhood of Jómsvíkings. The saga describes the brotherhood and the laws of the Jómsvíkings ([[Jomsvikings]]). It also mentions their defeat during the semi-legendary naval [[Battle of Hjörungavágr]] in 986. This battle occurred between the [[Jarls of Lade]] and the Danish invasion fleet of King [[Harald Bluetooth]] of Denmark. Jómsvíking chieftain, [[Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson]], led the Jómsvíkings in an effort to depose Jarl [[Haakon Sigurdsson|Hákon Sigurðarson]], vassal ruler of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title= Jómsvíkinga Saga as a Part of Old Norse Historiography
|publisher= University of Oulu  
|author= Sirpa Aalto
|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jómsvíkings lived monastically and primarily in the Baltic region. The only things that are proven to have existed that were mentioned in the Jómsvíkinga saga are many of the main characters (excluding Pálna-Tóki), the Battle of Hjörungavágr, and the existence of Jómsborg. Aside from those things, the rest is an unsolved mystery.

==History==
There are five versions of the Jómsvíkinga saga that have been recovered over the years. The first, MS AM.291, is an incomplete manuscript written by an Icelander in the late thirteenth century. The second, MS AM.510, was written in the fifteenth century and contains much more information than the other versions. The third, Codex Holmanius 7, written in the fourteenth century, is shorter than the other versions and gives a brief summary of the saga. The fourth, Flateyjarbók, is a combination of the Jómsvíking saga and the Greater saga of Óláfr Tryggvason. Lastly, the fifth version, was a Latin translation of Arngrímr Jónsson written in the year 1592.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Historians have found it difficult to classify the ''Jómsvíkinga saga'' among the [[Saga|Old Norse sagas]]. It is sometimes counted among the [[Kings' sagas]] based principally upon the association with Danish kings. Both the Kings' sagas and the Jómsvíkinga saga can be looked at through a political lens.

'''Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild''' ({{lang-de|Ludwig Nathaniel Freiherr von Rothschild}}&lt;ref&gt;{{German title|Freiherr}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Austrian [[baron]] from the famous [[Rothschild family]]. He was born in [[Vienna]] on 5 March 1882 and died of heart failure while swimming in [[Montego Bay]], [[Jamaica]] on 15 January 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baron Louis de Rothschild Dies; Freed by Nazis for $21. Million; Former Vienna Banker Held Prisoner in '38- 39 During Ransom Negotiations |work=New York Times |date=16 January 1955 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1955/01/16/archives/baron-louis-de-rothschild-dies-freed-by-nazis-for-21-million-former.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of [[Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild]]. He owned a spectacular palace in Vienna, the [[Palais Rothschild]], that housed an exquisite art collection and [[antique]]s.

After the [[Anschluß]] of Austria to [[Nazi Germany]] in March 1938, he was arrested at the airport at [[Aspern]]&lt;ref&gt;MacDonogh, G. ''1938: Hitler's Gamble''. New York: Basic Books, 2009. p 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and taken into custody by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] because he was a distinguished member of the [[Jews|Jewish]] oligarchy. He was released only after lengthy negotiations between the family and the Nazis and upon payment of $21,000,000, believed to have been the largest ransom payment in history for any individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1955/01/17/archive/baron-louis-de-rothschild-dead-paid-21000000-ransom-to-nazis|title=Baron Louis De Rothschild Dead: Paid $21,000,000 Ransom to Nazis {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While imprisoned he was visited by [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Rothschild apparently impressed the [[SS]] leader, who subsequently ordered that Rothschild's prison conditions be improved with better furniture and sanitation facilities.{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|p=61}} Despite appeals from [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] of the United Kingdom and possibly the [[Duke of Windsor]], Rothschild was held in Vienna's [[Hotel Metropole, Vienna|Hotel Metropole]] while the German government attempted to expropriate his business concerns.{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|p=69,71}} He was imprisoned at least through July 1938, and his property placed under control of a German "commissioner".{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|p=137}} [[Felix Somary]], in his memoirs,&lt;ref&gt;F. Somary, Erinnerungen, Manesses Verlag, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; recalls that, soon before the Anschluss, he phoned to the baron repeatedly, in a desperate attempt to convince him to leave Austria. The day before the Anschluss, Louis's brother Alphons and his wife were visiting him in Switzerland, wanting to go back into Austria; he persuaded them to remain there, and to get his children Francesca de Rothschild and Heidi de Rothschild away from Austria to [[Netherlands]].

Finally allowed to leave Austria, Louis survived the [[Holocaust]] and [[Second World War]].

All of the Rothschild possessions were plundered and subsequently "[[Aryan]]ised". The city-palace of the family was destroyed after the war. The baron never received most of his former belongings back, since most of the paintings were taken over by the Austrian state, which did not allow the paintings to leave the country. In 1998, over 200 art works were returned to the Rothschild heirs by the Austrian Government, and were placed at Christie's in London for auction in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At $90 Million, Rothschild Sale Exceeds Goals |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 9, 1999 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/09/world/at-90-million-rothschild-sale-exceeds-goals.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he married the countess Hildegard Johanna von Auersperg (1895–1981) and lived in East Barnard, Vermont (United States) and England. He died childless in 1955.

[[File:Melpomene (by Joseph Fagnani).jpg|thumb|''Melpomene'' by [[Joseph Fagnani]] (1819–1873) (1869)]]

'''Melpomene''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɛ|l|ˈ|p|ɒ|m|ᵻ|n|iː}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:Μελπομένη#Ancient Greek|Μελπομένη]]|Melpoménē|to sing' or 'the one that is melodious}}), initially the [[Muse]] of Chorus, she then became the '''Muse of Tragedy''', for which she is best known now.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Blyth |first=Charles |title=Virgilian Tragedy and [[Troilus]] |publisher= [[The Chaucer Review]] |date=1990 |volume=24 |number=3 |pages=211-218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name was derived from the Greek verb melpô or melpomai meaning "to celebrate with dance and song." She is often represented with a tragic mask and wearing the [[cothurnus]], boots traditionally worn by tragic actors. Often, she also holds a knife or club in one hand and the tragic mask in the other.

Melpomene is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Mnemosyne]]. Her sisters include [[Calliope]] (muse of epic poetry), [[Clio]] (muse of history), [[Euterpe]] (muse of lyrical poetry), [[Terpsichore]] (muse of dancing), [[Erato]] (muse of erotic poetry), [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] (muse of comedy), [[Polyhymnia]] (muse of hymns), and [[Urania]] (muse of astronomy).  She is also the mother of several of the [[Siren (mythology)#List of Sirens|Sirens]], the divine handmaidens of [[Persephone|Kore (Persephone/Proserpina)]] who were cursed by her mother, [[Demeter]]/[[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], when they were unable to prevent the kidnapping of Kore (Persephone/[[Proserpina]]) by [[Hades]]/[[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]].  

In Roman and Greek poetry, it was traditional{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} to invoke the goddess Melpomene so that one might create beautiful lyrical phrases (see [[Horace's Odes]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="137437">[[File:Maize Rivera.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail of a mural by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]].]]

'''Mexican art''' consists of various [[visual arts]] that developed over the geographical area now known as Mexico. The development of these arts roughly follows the [[history of Mexico]], divided into the prehispanic [[Mesoamerica]]n era, the colonial period, with the period after [[Mexican War of Independence]] further subdivided. Mexican art is usually filled most of the time with intricate patterns.&lt;ref name="jflam"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexican Art Over Three Millennia |first=Jack |last=ver Flam |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=October 9, 1990 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican art is that produced in an area that encompasses much of what is now central and southern Mexico, before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] for a period of about 3,000 years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE. During this time, all influences on art production were indigenous, with art heavily tied to religion and the ruling class. There was little to no real distinction among art, architecture, and writing. The Spanish conquest led to 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, and art production remained tied to religion—most art was associated with the construction and decoration of churches, but secular art expanded in the eighteenth century, particularly [[casta]] paintings, portraiture, and history painting. Almost all art produced was in the European tradition, with late colonial-era artists trained at the [[Academy of San Carlos]], but indigenous elements remained, beginning a continuous balancing act between European and indigenous traditions.&lt;ref name="paz"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.301.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Independence, art remained heavily European in style, but indigenous themes appeared in major works as liberal Mexico sought to distinguish itself from its Spanish colonial past. This preference for indigenous elements continued into the first half of the 20th century, with the [[Mexican muralism|Social Realism or Mexican muralist movement]] led by artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]], who were commissioned by the post-[[Mexican Revolution]] government to create a visual narrative of Mexican history and culture.

The strength of this artistic movement was such that it affected newly invented technologies, such as still photography and cinema, and strongly promoted popular arts and crafts as part of Mexico's identity. Since the 1950s, Mexican art has broken away from the muralist style and has been more globalized, integrating elements from Asia, with Mexican artists and filmmakers having an effect on the global stage.

The pre-Hispanic art of Mexico belongs to a cultural region known as [[Mesoamerica]], which roughly corresponds to central Mexico on into [[Central America]],&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing three thousand years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE generally divided into three eras: Pre Classic, Classic and Post Classic.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dominant Mesoamerican culture was that of the [[Olmec]]s, which peaked around 1200 BCE. The Olmecs originated much of what is associated with Mesoamerica, such as [[Mesoamerican writing systems|hieroglyphic writing]], [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendar]], first advances in astronomy, monumental sculpture ([[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec heads]]) and [[jade]] work.&lt;ref name="pazp38"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were a forerunner of later cultures such as [[Teotihuacan]], north of Mexico City, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] in Oaxaca and the [[Mayan peoples|Mayas]] in southern Mexico, [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]]. While empires rose and fell, the basic cultural underpinnings of the Mesoamerica stayed the same until the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name="pazp38"/&gt; These included cities centered on plazas, temples usually built on pyramid bases, [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s and a mostly common cosmology.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p4" /&gt;

While art forms such as cave paintings and rock etchings date from earlier, the known history of Mexican art begins with Mesoamerican art created by sedentary cultures that built cities, and often, dominions.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pazp38"/&gt; While the art of Mesoamerica is more varied and extends over more time than anywhere else in the Americas, artistic styles show a number of similarities.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p9"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike modern Western art, almost all Mesoamerican art was created to serve religious or political needs, rather than art for art's sake. It is strongly based on nature, the surrounding political reality and the gods.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p12" /&gt; [[Octavio Paz]] states that "Mesoamerican art is a logic of forms, lines, and volumes that is as the same time a cosmology." He goes on to state that this focus on space and time is highly distinct from European naturalism based on the representation of the human body. Even simple designs such as [[fretwork|stepped frets]] on buildings fall into this representation of space and time, life and the gods.&lt;ref name="pazp41"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tlatilco culture figurines.jpg|thumb|Female figurines from the [[Tlatilco culture]], 1250 to 800 BCE.]]
Art was expressed on a variety of mediums such as ceramics, [[amate]] paper and architecture.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p9" /&gt; Most of what is known of Mesoamerican art comes from works that cover stone buildings and pottery, mostly paintings and reliefs.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt; Ceramics date from the early the Mesoamerican period. They probably began as cooking and storage vessels but then were adapted to ritual and decorative uses. Ceramics were decorated by shaping, scratching, painting and different firing methods.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p12"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known purely artistic production were small ceramic figures that appeared in [[Tehuacán, Puebla|Tehuacán]] area around 1,500 BCE and spread to [[Veracruz]], the [[Valley of Mexico]], [[Guerrero]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Chiapas]] and the Pacific coast of Guatemala.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt; The earliest of these are mostly female figures, probably associated with fertility rites because of their often oversized hips and thighs, as well as a number with babies in arms or nursing. When male figures appear they are most often soldiers.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p56"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these ceramic figures, which would later include animals and other forms, remained an important art form for 2000 years. In the early Olmec period most were small but large-scale ceramic sculptures were produced as large as 55&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p2"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p6"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the middle pre-Classic, ceramic sculpture declined in the center of Mexico except in the [[Chupícuaro (archaeological site)|Chupícuaro]] region. In the Mayan areas, the art disappears in the late pre-Classic, to reappear in the Classic, mostly in the form of whistles and other musical instruments. In a few areas, such as parts of Veracruz, the creation of ceramic figures continued uninterrupted until the Spanish conquest, but as a handcraft, not a formal art.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p67"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Messico, maya, piatto da calakmul, 600-800 ca..JPG|thumb|Painted ceramic plate from [[Calakmul]], 600 to 800 AD.]]
Mesoamerican painting is found in various expressions—from murals, to the creation of [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]] and the painting of ceramic objects. Evidence of painting goes back at least to 1800&amp;nbsp;BCE and continues uninterrupted in one form or another until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p2"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may have occurred earlier, the earliest known cases of artistic painting of monumental buildings occur in the early Classic period with the Mayas at [[Uaxactun]] and [[Tikal]], and in [[Teotihuacan]] with walls painted in various colors.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;

Paints were made from animal, vegetable and mineral pigments and bases.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Most paintings focus one or more human figures, which may be realistic or stylized, masculine, feminine or asexual. They may be naked or richly attired, but the social status of each figure is indicated in some way. Scenes often depict war, sacrifice, the roles of the gods or the acts of nobles. However, some common scenes with common people have been found as well.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Other subjects included gods, symbols and animals.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4" /&gt; Mesoamerican painting was bi-dimensional with no efforts to create the illusion of depth. However, movement is often represented.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-ceramic sculpture in Mesoamerica began with the modification of animal bones, with the oldest known piece being an animal skull from [[Tequixquiac]] that dates between 10,000 and 8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p56" /&gt; Most Mesoamerican sculpture is of stone; while relief work on buildings is the most dominant, freestanding sculpture was done as well. Freestanding three-dimensional stone sculpture began with the Olmecs, with the most famous example being the [[Olmec#Colossal heads|giant Olmec stone heads]]. This disappeared for the rest of the Mesoamerican period in favor of relief work until the late post-Classic with the [[Aztec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CoyolxauhquiDisk cropped.JPG|thumb|A disk depicting the goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]], 14th to 16th century, at the [[Templo Mayor]] museum.]]
The majority of stonework during the Mesoamerican period is associated with monumental architecture that, along with mural painting, was considered an integral part of architecture rather than separate.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p15"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Monumental architecture began with the Olmecs in southern [[Veracruz]] and the coastal area of [[Tabasco]] in places such as San Lorenzo; large temples on pyramid bases can still be seen in sites such as Montenegro, [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]] and [[La Venta]]. This practice spread to the [[Oaxaca]] area and the [[Valley of Mexico]], appearing in cities such as [[Monte Albán]], [[Cuicuilco]] and [[Teotihuacan]].&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p18"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

These cities had a nucleus of one or more plazas, with temples, palaces and [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s. Alignment of these structures was based on the cardinal directions and astronomy for ceremonial purposes, such as focusing the sun's rays during the spring equinox on a sculpted or painted image. This was generally tied to calendar systems.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p2023"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.20-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Relief sculpture and/or painting were created as the structures were built. By the latter pre-Classic, almost all monumental structures in Mesoamerica had extensive relief work. Some of the best examples of this are Monte Albán, Teotihuacan and [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Hispanic reliefs are general lineal in design and low, medium and high reliefs can be found. While this technique is often favored for narrative scenes elsewhere in the world, Mesoamerican reliefs tend to focus on a single figure. The only time reliefs are used in the narrative sense is when several relief steles are placed together. The best relief work is from the Mayas, especially from [[Yaxchilan]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing and art were not distinct as they have been for European cultures. Writing was considered art and art was often covering in writing.&lt;ref name="pazp41" /&gt; The reason for this is that both sought to record history and the culture's interpretation of reality.(salvatvolp14) Manuscripts were written on paper or other book-like materials then bundled into [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]].&lt;ref name="eboone"&gt;Boone 2000, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of reading and writing was strictly designated to the highest priest classes, as this ability was a source of their power over society.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7" /&gt;

The [[Mesoamerican writing systems|pictograms or glyphs of this writing system]] were more formal and rigid than images found on murals and other art forms as they were considered mostly symbolic, representing formulas related to astronomical events, genealogy and historic events.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7" /&gt; Most surviving pre-Hispanic codices come from the late Mesoamerican period and early colonial period, as more of these escaped destruction over history. For this reason, more is known about the Aztec Empire than the Mayan cultures.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eboone" /&gt; Important [[Aztec codices]] include the [[Borgia Group]] of mainly religious works, some of which probably pre-date the conquest, the [[Codex Borbonicus]], [[Codex Mendoza]], and the late [[Florentine Codex]], which is in a European style but executed by Mexican artists, probably drawing on earlier material that is now lost.

==Colonial era, 1521–1821==

===The early colonial era and indigenous artists and influences===
{{See also|Aztec codices}}
[[File:AtriumCrossAcolman1.JPG|thumb|right|An atrium cross in [[Acolman]]. During the early period of evangelization, an enclosed open chapels for large congregations of neophytes saw the creation and placement of decorated, anthropomorphized stone crosses with Jesus at their center.]]
Since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Mexican art has been an ongoing and complex interaction between the traditions of Europe and native perspectives.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;

'''Church construction'''  After the conquest, Spaniards' first efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches, which needed indigenous labor for basic construction, but they Nahuas elaborated stonework exteriors and decorated church interiors. Indigenous craftsmen were taught European motifs, designs and techniques, but very early work, called ''tequitqui'' ([[Nahuatl]] for “vassal”), includes elements such as flattened faces and high-stiff relief.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p34"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexorg"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicanarchitecture.org/glossary/index.php?detail=121 |author=Charlote Ekland |title= Mexican Colonial Architecture |publisher=Mexican Architecture |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish friars directing construction were not trained architects or engineers. They relied on indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches and other Christian structures, often in the same places as temples and shrines of the traditional religion. "Although some Indians complained about the burden such labor represented, most communities considered a large and impressive church to be a reflection of their town's importance and took justifiable pride in creating a sacred place for divine worship."&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Prentice Hall 2003, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that so many colonial-era churches have survived centuries it testament to their general good construction.

The first monasteries built in and around Mexico City, such as the [[Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl|monasteries on the slopes of Popocatepetl]], had [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Plateresque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] elements, or some combination. They were relatively undecorated, with building efforts going more towards high walls and fortress features to ward off attacks.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p17"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of more elaborate churches with large quantities of religious artwork would define much of the artistic output of the colonial period. Most of the production was related to the teaching and reinforcement of Church doctrine, just as in Europe. Religious art set the rationale for Spanish domination over the indigenous. Today, colonial-era structures and other works exist all over the country, with a concentration in the central highlands around [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p3"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huanitzin.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Mass of St. Gregory]]'', feathers on wood panel, the oldest dated feather work with a Christian subject. Made by or for [[Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin|Diego Huanutzin]], nephew and son-in-law of [[Moctezuma II]] to present to [[Pope Paul III]], dated 1539]]
[[File:The Florentine Codex- Aztec Feather Painters VI.tiff|thumb|left|Feather work artists as depicted in the [[Florentine Codex]] (ca. 1576).]]
[[Mexican feather work|'''Feather work''']] was a highly valued skill of prehispanic central Mexico that continued into the early colonial era.  Spaniards were fascinated by this form of art, and indigenous feather workers (''amanteca'') produced religious images in this medium, mainly small "paintings", as well as religious vestments.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schrefler, "Visual Arts: Sixteenth Century" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1557.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Castello Yturbide, ''The Art of Featherwork in Mexico'', Mexico: Fomento Cultural Banamex 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indigenous writings'''  Indians continued production of written manuscripts in the early colonial era, especially [[Aztec codices|codices in the Nahua area]] of central Mexico.  An important early manuscript that was commissioned for the Spanish crown was [[Codex Mendoza]], named after the first viceroy of Mexico, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], which shows the tribute delivered to the Aztec ruler from individual towns as well as descriptions of proper comportment for the common people. A far more elaborate project utilizing indigenous scribes illustration is the project resulting in the [[Florentine Codex]] directed by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]].  Other indigenous manuscripts in the colonial era include the [[Huexotzinco Codex]] and Codex Osuna.

An important type of manuscript from the early period were pictorial and textual histories of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs from the indigenous viewpoint.  The early [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] illustrated the contributions the Spaniards' Tlaxcalan allies made to the defeat of the Aztec empire, as well the [[Hernán Cortés]] and his cultural translator Doña Marina ([[Malinche]]).

'''Painting''' Most Nahua artists producing this visual art are anonymous.  An exception is the work of Juan Gerson, who ca. 1560 decorated the vault of the Franciscan church in the Nahua town of Tecamachalco,(Puebla state), with individual scenes from the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Schrefler, "Visual Arts", p.1556.&lt;/ref&gt;

While colonial art remained almost completely European in style, with muted colors and no indication of movement—the addition of native elements, which began with the ''tequitqui,'' continued. They were never the center of the works, but decorative motifs and filler, such as native foliage, pineapples, corn, and [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]].&lt;ref name="jcummings"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1311-diego-frida-and-the-mexican-school |title= Diego, Frida And The Mexican School |first=Joe |last=Cummings |date= January 1, 1999 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this can be seen on portals as well as large frescoes that often decorated the interior of churches and the walls of monastery areas closed to the public.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253322 |title=Colonial Art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest of Mexico's colonial artists were Spanish-born who came to Mexico in the middle of their careers. This included mendicant friars, such as Fray Alonso López de Herrera. Later, most artists were born in Mexico, but trained in European techniques, often from imported engravings. This dependence on imported copies meant that Mexican works preserved styles after they had gone out of fashion in Europe.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt; In the colonial period, artists worked in guilds, not independently. Each guild had its own rules, precepts, and mandates in technique—which did not encourage innovation.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p10"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican Baroque===
{{See also|Architecture of Mexico}}
[[File:Eternal father painting guadalupe.jpg|right|thumb|18th-century painting of [[God the Father]] fashioning the image of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]]]
Baroque painting became firmly established in Mexico by the middle of the 17th century with the work of Spaniard Sebastián López de Arteaga. His painting is exemplified by the canvas called ''Doubting Thomas'' from 1643. In this work, the [[Apostle Thomas]] is shown inserting his finger in the wound in Christ's side to emphasize Christ's suffering. The caption below reads "the Word made flesh" and is an example of Baroque's didactic purpose.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

One difference between painters in Mexico and their European counterparts is that they preferred realistic directness and clarity over fantastic colors, elongated proportions and extreme spatial relationships. The goal was to create a realistic scene in which the viewer could imagine himself a part of. This was a style created by [[Caravaggio]] in Italy, which became popular with artists in [[Seville]], from which many migrants came to New Spain came.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Similarly, Baroque free standing sculptures feature life-size scales, realistic skin tones and the simulation of gold-threaded garments through a technique called ''estofado'', the application of paint over gold leaf.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

The most important later influence to Mexican and other painters in Latin America was the work of Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], known through copies made from engravings and [[mezzotint]] techniques. His paintings were copied and reworked and became the standard for both religious and secular art.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Later Baroque paintings moved from the confines of altarpieces to colossal freestanding canvases on church interiors. One of the best known Mexican painters of this kind of work was [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]]. His work can be seen in the [[sacristy]] of the Mexico City Cathedral, which was done between 1684 and 1686. These canvases were glued directly onto the walls with arched frames to stabilize them, and placed just under the vaults of the ceiling. Even the fresco work of the 16th century was not usually this large.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Another one of Villalpando's works is the cupola of the [[Puebla Cathedral]] in 1688. He used Rubens’ brush techniques and the shape of the structure to create a composition of clouds with angels and saints, from which a dove descends to represent the Holy Spirit. The light from the cupola's windows is meant to symbolize God's grace.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; [[Juan Rodríguez Juárez]] (1675–1728) and mulatto artist [[Juan Correa]] (1646–1716) were also prominent painters of the baroque era. Correa's most famous student, [[José de Ibarra]] (1685–1756) was also mixed-race. One of Mexico's finest painters, [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] (1695–1768), was possibly mixed race.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, "Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700–85" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550–1820'', Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown, eds. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church produced the most important works of the seventeenth century. Among the important painters were [[Baltasar de Echave Ibia]] and his son Baltasar Echave Rioja, also [[Luis Juárez (painter)|Luis Juárez]] and his son [[José Juárez]], [[Juan Correa]], [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], Rodrigo de la Piedra, Antonio de Santander, Polo Bernardino, Juan de Villalobos, Juan Salguero and Juan de Herrera. Juan Correa, worked from 1671 to 1716 and reached great prestige and reputation for the quality of its design and scale of some of his works. Among the best known: 'Apocalypse in the Cathedral of Mexico', 'Conversion of St. Mary Magdalene', now in the 'Pinacoteca Virreinal' and 'Santa Catarina and Adam and Eve casting out of paradise', the latter located in the [[Museo Nacional del Virreinato|National Museum of Viceroyalty]] of [[Tepotzotlán]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1541-Arte-y-cultura-en-la-colonia Arte y cultura en la colonia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013144844/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1541-Arte-y-cultura-en-la-colonia |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial religious art was sponsored by Church authorities and private patrons. Sponsoring the rich ornamentation of churches was a way for the wealthy to gain prestige.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p3" /&gt; In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Mexico City was one of the wealthiest in the world, mostly due to mining and agriculture, and was able to support a large art scene.&lt;ref name="dwarren"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=David B. |date=April 2002 |title=The Magazine Antiques |journal=Art Journal |volume=161 |issue=4 |pages=120–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical and Secular Art===

While most commissioned art was for churches, secular works were commissioned as well. Portrait painting was known relatively early in the colonial period, mostly of viceroys and archbishops. Beginning in the late Baroque period, portrait painting of local nobility became a significant genre. Two notable painters of this type are brothers Nicolás and Juan Rodríguez Juárez. These works followed European models, with symbols of rank and titles either displayed unattached in the outer portions or worked into another element of the paintings such as curtains.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

Another type of secular colonial painting is called [[casta]] paintings referring to the depiction of racial hierarchy racially in eighteenth-century [[New Spain]]. Some were likely commissioned by Spanish functionaries as souvenirs of Mexico. A number of artists of the era created casta paintings, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], [[José de Ibarra]], [[Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz]], [[Francisco Clapera]], and [[Luis de Mena]], but most casta paintings are unsigned. Ibarra, Morlete, and possibly Cabrera were of mixed race and born outside Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, "Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700-85" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550–1820'', Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mena's only known casta painting links the Virgin of Guadalupe and the casta system, as well as depictions of fruits and vegetables and scenes of everyday life in mideighteenth-century Mexico. It is one of the most-reproduced examples of casta paintings, one of the small number that show the casta system on a single canvas rather than up to 16 separate paintings. It is unique in uniting the thoroughly secular genre of casta painting with a depiction of the Virgin of Guadalupe.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cline, "Guadalupe and the Castas: The Power of a Singular Colonial Mexican Painting", ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 31, Issue 2, Summer 2015, pages 218–246.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of these paintings stopped after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], when legal racial categories were repudiated in independent Mexico. Until the run-up to the 500th anniversary of the Columbus's 1492 voyage, casta paintings were of little or no interest, even to art historians, but scholars began systematically studying them as a genre.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Guadalupe and the Castas", p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;María Concepción García Sáiz, ''Las castas mexicanas: un g´enero pictórico americano''. Milan: Olivetti, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew. ''Casta Paintings: Images of Race in Eighteenth-Century Mexico''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico was a crossroads of trade in the colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those natively produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain.&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a ''salon de estrado'', to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to recline in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men. Folding screens were introduced from Japan, with Mexican-style ones produced called ''biombos'' The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One example of this is a screen with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of Mexico City on the other at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]].&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt;

The Crown promoted the establishment in Mexico of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style of art and architecture, which had become popular in Spain. This style was a reinterpretation of Greco-Roman references and its use was a way to reinforce European dominance in the Spain's colonies. One Neoclassical artist from the Academy at the end of the colonial period was [[Manuel Tolsá]]. He first taught sculpture at the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and then became its second director. Tolsá designed a number of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical buildings]] in Mexico but his best known work is an equestrian status of King Charles IV in bronze cast in 1803 and originally placed in the [[Zócalo]]. As of 2011 it can be seen at the [[Museo Nacional de Arte]].&lt;ref name="statesponsored" /&gt;

Along with the construction of temples and houses artistic religious themes proliferated. In New Spain, as in the rest of the [[New World]], since the seventeenth century, particularly during the eighteenth century, the portrait became an important part of the artistic repertoire. In a society characterized by a deep religious feeling which was imbued, it was expected that many portraits reflected the moral virtues and piety of the model.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145806/http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here he shows a Spanish (español) father, Mestiza (mixed Spanish-Indian) mother, and their Castiza daughter.]]

Some prominent painters of this period are: [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], [[Juan Correa (1646–1716)|Juan Correa]], [[José de Ibarra]], Joseph Mora, Nicolas Rodriguez Juarez, Francisco Martinez, [[Miguel Cabrera]], Andrés López and Nicolás Enríquez. Sebastian Zalcedo painted ca. 1780 a beautiful allegory of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Mexico)|Virgin of Guadalupe]] in oil on copper foil. In this century Josep Antonio de Ayala was a prominent artist, who is known for painting ''[[La familia del Valle a los pies de la Virgen de Loreto (Josep Antonio de Ayala)|The family of the Valley at the foot of Our Lady of Loreto]]'' c. 1769. This devotional painting was commissioned to be done for the children of the del Valle family in memory of his parents and is characteristic of the painting of this century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seis Siglos de Arte, Cien Grandes Maestros de Romero|editor-last=de Romero|editor-first=Soumaya Slim|editor-first2=Minerva Mogollan|editor-last2=Garcia|editor-first3=Eva Maria|editor-last3=Ayala Canseco|publisher=Fundacion Carso / Museo Soumaya|year=2006|isbn=9789687794303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of colonial art says: ''"In the "Sponsorship of [[Saint Joseph]] on the Caroline College", [[Saint Joseph]] is seen as a major figure of the work, who carries on his left side the child [[Jesus]]. Two archangels flank him and maintain its long purple robe. At the top two little angels are observed with intent to crown the holy". "For centuries, the work was attributed to [[Manuel Caro]], but the meticulous restoration work allowed to find the signature of the original author. Miguel Cabrera"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunicacion.buap.mx/bol_mar08/boletin-d-13mar.html |title=Puebla, Pue. México, Jueves 13 de Marzo de 2008 |website=Comunicacion.buap.mx |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, artists increasingly included the Latin phrase ''[[pinxit]] Mexici'' (painted in Mexico) on works bound for the European market as a sign of pride in their artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Painted in Mexico, 1700–1790: Pinxit Mexici |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/pinxit-mexici |website=www.metmuseum.org |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |quote=This expression eloquently encapsulates the painters' pride in their own tradition and their connection to larger, transatlantic trends.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Academy of San Carlos===
[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Manuel Tolsá - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Manuel Tolsá]], director of the [[Academy of San Carlos]] by [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]], director of painting at the Academy]]
The last colonial era art institution established was the [[Academy of San Carlos]] in 1783.&lt;ref name="statesponsored"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253329 |title=State sponsored art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the depiction of saints consumed most artistic efforts, they were not without political effects. The most important of these was the rise of the cult of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] as an American rather than European saint, representative of a distinct identity.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p13"&gt;Rosas, 1982, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 18th century, Spain's colonies were becoming culturally independent from Spain, including its arts. The Academy was established by the [[Spanish Crown]] to regain control of artistic expression and the messages it disseminated. This school was staffed by Spanish artists in each of the major disciplines, with the first director being Antonio Gil.&lt;ref name="statesponsored" /&gt; The school became home to a number of plaster casts of classic statues from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|San Fernando Fine Arts Academy]] in Spain, brought there for teaching purposes. These casts are on display in the Academy's central patio.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=70–72 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy of San Carlos survived into post-independence Mexico.

==Independence to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, 1821–1911==

===Early Post-independence era the Mid Nineteenth Century===
[[File:Retrato del excelentísimo señor don José María Morelos.png|thumb|left|Hero of Independence, Father [[José María Morelos]], artist unknown, painted ca. 1812.]]
[[File:Flag of Mexico (1823-1864, 1867-1893).svg|thumb|left|The [[Mexican flag]] during most of the nineteenth century. The flag with the eagle wearing a gold crown was designed by [[Agustín de Iturbide]], emperor of Mexico 1821–22.]]
[[File:Valle de México José Maria Velazco 3.jpg|thumb|[[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]], El Valle de México.]]

Artists of the independence era in Mexico (1810–21) produced works showing the insurgency's heroes. A portrait of secular cleric [[José María Morelos]] in his military uniform was painted by an unknown artist. The portrait is typical of those from the late eighteenth century, with framing elements, a formal caption, and new elements being iconography of the emerging Mexican nationalism, including the eagle atop the nopal cactus, which became the central image for the Mexican flag.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Mexican Art and Architecture''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson 2013, pp. 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt; Morelos was the subject of a commissioned statue, with [[Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque]], who trained at the Academy of San Carlos and remained an important sculptor through the era of era independence.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Art and Architecture in Mexico''. London: Thames and Hudson 2013, pp. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos remained the center of academic painting and the most prestigious art institution in Mexico until the [[Mexican War of Independence]], during which it was closed.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/ |title= Academia de San Carlos |language= Spanish |accessdate= November 30, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090409140215/http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/ |archivedate= April 9, 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its association with the Spanish Crown and European painting tradition, the Academy was reopened by the new government after Mexico gained full independence in 1821. Its former Spanish faculty and students either died during the war or returned to Spain, but when it reopened it attracted the best art students of the country, and continued to emphasize classical European traditions until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neoclassbrit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253332 |title=Neoclassicism |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academy was renamed to the National Academy of San Carlos. The new government continued to favor Neoclassical as it considered the Baroque a symbol of colonialism. The Neoclassical style continued in favor through the reign of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] although President [[Benito Juárez]] supported it only reluctantly, considering its European focus a vestige of colonialism.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;

Despite Neoclassicism's association with European domination, it remained favored by the Mexican government after Independence and was used in major government commissions at the end of the century. However, indigenous themes appeared in paintings and sculptures. One indigenous figure depicted in Neoclassical style is Tlahuicol, done by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artist Manuel Vilar in 1851. In 1887, [[Porfirio Díaz]] commissioned the statue of the last Aztec emperor, [[Cuauhtémoc]], which can be seen on [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. Cuauhtémoc is depicted with a toga-like cloak with a feathered headdress similar to an Etruscan or Trojan warrior rather than an Aztec emperor. The base has elements reminiscent of Mitla and Roman architecture. This base contains bronze plates depicting scenes from the Spanish conquest, but focusing on the indigenous figures.&lt;ref name="neoclassbrit" /&gt;

There were two reasons for this shift in preferred subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture—the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican.&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.&lt;ref name="pazp2"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 19th century, the Romantic style of painting was introduced into Mexico and the rest of Latin America by foreign travelers interested in the newly independent country. One of these was [[Bavaria]]n artist [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]], who lived in the country from 1831 to 1834. He painted scenes with dynamic composition and bright colors in accordance with Romantic style, looking for striking, sublime, and beautiful images in Mexico as well as other areas of Latin America. However much of Rugendas's works are sketches for major canvases, many of which were never executed. Others include Englishman [[Daniel Egerton]], who painted landscapes in the British Romantic tradition, and German [[Carl Nebel]], who primarily created [[lithograph]]s of the various social and ethnic populations of the country.&lt;ref name="foreigntravel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253334 |title=Foreign Travelers |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:VelorioJaraDF.JPG|thumb|right|''El Velorio'' by [[José María Jara]] 1889]]
A number of native-born artists at the time followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called ''[[Costumbrismo|costumbristas]]'', a word deriving from ''costumbre'' (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well. Most of these painters were from the upper classes and educated in Europe. While the European painters viewed subjects as exotic, the costumbristas had a more nationalistic sense of their home countries. One of these painters was [[Agustín Arrieta]] from Puebla, who applied realistic techniques to scenes from his home city, capturing its brightly painted tiles and ceramics. His scenes often involved everyday life such as women working in kitchen and depicted black and Afro-Mexican vendors.&lt;ref name="costumbristas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253335 |title=Costumbristas |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Nineteenth Century to the Revolution===
[[File:NezahualcoyotlGardenTADF.JPG|thumb|180px|A bronze casting (1888–1889) of [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], by [[Jesús F. Contreras]] at the Garden of the Triple Alliance, Filomeno Mata street, historical center of Mexico City.]]
[[File:SceneTortureCuautemocMonumentDF.jpg|thumb|[[Cuauhtemoc]]'s torture on a monument to him on the Paseo de la Reforma, by [[Gabriel Guerra]] (1847–1893).]]
In the mid-to late 19th century Latin American academies began to shift away from severe Neoclassicism to “academic realism”. Idealized and simplified depictions became more realistic, with emphasis on details. Scenes in this style were most often portraits of the upper classes, Biblical scenes, and battles—especially those from the Independence period. When the Academy of San Carlos was reopened after a short closure in 1843, its new Spanish and Italian faculty pushed this realist style. Despite government support and nationalist themes, native artists were generally shorted in favor of Europeans.&lt;ref name="realismbrit" /&gt;

One of the most important painters in Mexico in the mid 19th century was Catalan [[Pelegrí Clavé]], who painted landscapes but was best known for his depictions of the intellectual elite of Mexico City. Realist painters also attempted to portray Aztec culture and people by depicting settings inhabited by indigenous people, using live indigenous models and costumes based on those in Conquest era codices. One of these was [[Félix Parra]], whose depictions of the conquest empathized with the suffering of the indigenous. In 1869, José Obregón painted ''The Discovery of Pulque''; he based his depictions of architecture on [[Mixtec]] codices, but misrepresented temples as a setting for a throne.&lt;ref name="realismbrit"&gt;dead link {{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253336 |title=Realism |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of the 19th century after Independence is considered to have declined, especially during the late 19th century and early 20th, during the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1876–1911).  Although during this time, painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts were often limited to imitation of European styles,&lt;ref name="tburton"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title= Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art |first=Tony |last=Burton |date= March 14, 2008 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the emergence of young artists, such as [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Saturnino Herrán]], increased the focus on Mexican-themed works. This meant that following the military phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the 1920s, Mexican artists made huge strides is forging a robust artistic nationalism.

In this century there are examples of murals such as folkloric style created between 1855 and 1867 in La Barca, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=02042008173408 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030053129/http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=02042008173408 |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlights at this time: Pelegrín Clavé, [[Juan Cordero]], Felipe Santiago Gutiérrez and José Agustín Arrieta.
In Mexico, in 1846 he was hired to direct Pelegrín Clavé's reopening of the Academy of San Carlos, a body from which he promoted the historical and landscaping themes with a pro-European vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/cercadetuarte/pintura.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015220757/http://www.geocities.com/cercadetuarte/pintura.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-15 |title=Pintura |website=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos continued to advocate classic, European-style training until 1913. In this year, the academy was partially integrated with [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM). Between 1929 and the 1950s, the academy’s architecture program was split off as a department of the university; the programs in painting, sculpture, and engraving were renamed the National School of Expressive Arts, now the [[Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas "Rafael Rodríguez Padilla"|Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas]] (ENAP). Both moved to the south of the city in the mid-20th century, to [[Ciudad Universitaria]] and [[Xochimilco]] respectively, leaving only some graduate programs in fine arts in the original academy building in the [[historic center of Mexico City|historic center]]. ENAP remains one of the main centers for the training of Mexico’s artists.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;

===Mexican muralism and Revolutionary art===
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 6 063.jpg|thumb|Detail of mural "Gente y paisaje de Michoacán" at the Palacio de Gobierno in [[Michoacán]] (1962)]]
{{Further|Mexican muralism}}

While a shift to more indigenous and Mexican themes appeared in the 19th century, the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1910 to 1920 had a dramatic effect on Mexican art.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arquitectuba" /&gt; The conflict resulted in the rise of the Partido Revolucionario Nacional (renamed the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]]), which took the country in a socialist direction. The government became an ally to many of the intellectuals and artists in Mexico City&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; and commissioned murals for public buildings to reinforce its political messages including those that emphasized Mexican rather than European themes. These were not created for popular or commercial tastes; however, they gained recognition not only in Mexico, but in the United States.&lt;ref name="pazp24"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This production of art in conjunction with government propaganda is known as the Mexican Modernist School or the Mexican Muralist Movement, and it redefined art in Mexico.&lt;ref name="pazp298299"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.298-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavio Paz gives [[José Vasconcelos]] credit for initiating the Muralist movement in Mexico by commissioning the best-known painters in 1921 to decorate the walls of public buildings. The commissions were politically motivated—they aimed to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and redefine the Mexican people vis-à-vis their indigenous and Spanish past.&lt;ref name="pazp11"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these commissioned paintings were at [[San Ildefonso College|San Ildefonso]] done by Fernando Leal, [[Fermín Revueltas]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[Diego Rivera]]. The first true fresco in the building was the work of [[Jean Charlot]]. However, technical errors were made in the construction of these murals: a number of them began to blister and were covered in wax for preservation.&lt;ref name="pazp12"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberto Montenegro]] painted the [[San Pedro y San Pablo College (Museum of Light)|former church and monastery of San Pedro y San Pablo]], but the mural in the church was painted in [[tempera]] and began to flake. In the monastery area, Montenegro painted the ''Feast of the Holy Cross,'' which depicts Vasconcelos as the protector of Muralists. Vasconcelos was later blanked out and a figure of a woman was painted over him.&lt;ref name="pazp1213"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first protagonist in the production of modern murals in Mexico was [[Dr. Atl]]. Dr Atl was born “Gerard Murillo” in [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] in 1875. He changed his name in order to identify himself as Mexican. Atl worked to promote [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexico's folk art and handcrafts]]. While he had some success as a painter in Guadalajara, his radical ideas against academia and the government prompted him to move to more liberal Mexico City. In 1910, months before the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]], Atl painted the first modern mural in Mexico. He taught major artists to follow him, including those who came to dominate Mexican mural painting.&lt;ref name="tburton" /&gt;

The muralist movement reached its height in the 1930s with four main protagonists: [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and Fernando Leal. It is the most studied part of Mexico's art history.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alee"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Anthony |date=Spring 1999 |title= Mexican murals and their meaning |journal=Art Journal |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; All were artists trained in classical European techniques and many of their early works are imitations of then-fashionable European paintings styles, some of which were adapted to Mexican themes.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pazp298299" /&gt; The political situation in Mexico from the 1920s to 1950s and the influence of Dr. Atl prompted these artists to break with European traditions, using bold indigenous images, lots of color, and depictions of human activity, especially of the masses, in contrast to the solemn and detached art of Europe.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;

Preferred mediums generally excluded traditional canvases and church porticos and instead were the large, then-undecorated walls of Mexico's government buildings. The main goal in many of these paintings was the glorification of Mexico's pre-Hispanic past as a definition of Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; They had success in both Mexico and the United States, which brought them fame and wealth as well as Mexican and American students.&lt;ref name="pazp24" /&gt;

These muralists revived the fresco technique for their mural work, although Siqueiros moved to industrial techniques and materials such as the application of [[pyroxilin]], a commercial enamel used for airplanes and automobiles.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; One of Rivera's earliest mural efforts emblazoned the courtyard of the Ministry of Education with a series of dancing tehuanas (natives of [[Tehuantepec]] in southern Mexico). This four-year project went on to incorporate other contemporary indigenous themes, and it eventually encompassed 124 frescoes that extended three stories high and two city blocks long.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; The [[Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market, Mexico City|Abelardo Rodriguez Market]] was painted in 1933 by students of Diego Rivera, one of whom was [[Isamu Noguchi]].&lt;ref name="pazp16"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure of this time period was [[Frida Kahlo]], the wife of Diego Rivera. While she painted canvases instead of murals, she is still considered part of the Mexican Modernist School as her work emphasized Mexican folk culture and colors.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dgoddard"&gt;{{cite news |title= enfoque ; Artistic update ; Mexican art featured at Blue Star and the Instituto de Mexico |first= Dan R. |last= Goddard |newspaper=Conexion |location=San Antonio, Texas |date=May 20, 2004 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's self-portraits during the 1930s and 40s were in stark contrast to the lavish murals artists like her husband were creating at the time. Having suffered a crippling bus accident earlier in her teenage life, she began to challenge Mexico's obsession with the female body. Her portraits, purposefully small, addressed a wide range of topics not being addressed by the mainstream art world at the time. These included motherhood, domestic violence, and male egoism. 

Her paintings never had subjects wearing lavish jewelry or fancy clothes like those found in muralist paintings. Instead, she would sparsely dress herself up, and when there were accessories, it added that much more importance to them. She would also depict herself in very surreal, unsettling scenarios like in ''[[The Two Fridas]]'' where she depicts two versions of herself, one with a broken heart and one with a healthy infusing the broken heart with “hopeful” blood., or Henry Ford Hospital where she depicts herself in having an abortion and the struggle she had in real life coming to terms with it.

Although she was the wife of Diego Rivera, her self-portraits stayed rather obscured from the public eye until well after her passing in 1954.  Her art has grown in popularity and she is seen by many to be one of the earliest and most influential feminist artists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meade |first=Teresa |title=The History of Modern Latin America |year=2016 |pages=192-193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selling Mexican art abroad===
Despite maintaining an active national art scene, Mexican artists after the muralist period had a difficult time breaking into the international art market. One reason for this is that in the Americas, Mexico City was replaced by New York as the center of the art community, especially for patronage.&lt;ref name="pazp25"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Mexico, government sponsorship of art in the 20th century (dominated until 2000 by the PRI party) meant religious themes and criticism of the government were effectively censored. This was mostly passive, with the government giving grants to artists who conformed to their requirements.&lt;ref name="rgallop11" /&gt;

===Other Artistic Expressions 1920–1950===
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|300px|''Mexico de Hoy'' by Rufino Tamayo on the first floor of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]]]
The first to break with the nationalistic and political tone of the muralist movement was [[Rufino Tamayo]]. For this reason he was first appreciated outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="pazp2425"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamayo was a contemporary to Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco, and trained at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes. Like them he explored Mexican identity in his work after the Mexican Revolution. However, he rejected the political Social Realism popularized by the three other artists and was rejected by the new establishment.&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;

He left for New York in 1926 where success allowed him to exhibit in his native Mexico. His lack of support for the post-Revolutionary government was controversial. Because of this he mostly remained in New York, continuing with his success there and later in Europe. His rivalry with the main three Mexican muralists continued both in Mexico and internationally through the 1950s. Even a belated honorific of “The Fourth Great One” was controversial.&lt;ref name="miami"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexican Master |author= Carlos Suarez De Jesus |url= http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2007-07-05/culture/mexican-master/full |newspaper=Miami New Times |location=Miami |date=July 5, 2007 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, [[Wolfgang Paalen]] published the extremely influential ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'' magazine in Mexico City, which focussed on a transitional movement between surrealism to abstract expressionism.

In 1953, [[Museo Experimental El Eco]] (in Mexico City) opened; it was created by [[Mathias Goeritz]].

===The Rupture Movement===
{{Further|Generación de la Ruptura}}

[[File:Murayl y tempusfugit.jpg|thumb|160px|A mural and clock sculpture by [[Manuel Felguerez]] at [[Universidad La Salle]], Campus central.]]
The first major movement after the muralists was the [[Generación de la Ruptura|Rupture Movement]], which began in the 1950s and 1960s with painters such as [[José Luis Cuevas]], Gilberto Navarro, [[Rafael Coronel]], Alfredo Casaneda, and sculptor [[Juan Soriano]]. They rejected social realism and nationalism and incorporated surrealism, visual paradoxes, and elements of Old World painting styles.&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rfajardo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fajardo |first=Renee |date=September 10, 2003 |title= Miradas Del Arte Mexicano; A modern perspective on contemporary Mexican art |journal=La Voz Bilinguë |page=25 |location=Denver, Colorado }}&lt;/ref&gt; This break meant that later Mexican artists were generally not influenced by muralism or by Mexican folk art.&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt;

José Luis Cuevas created self-portraits in which he reconstructed scenes from famous paintings by Spanish artists such as [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Francisco de Goya]], and [[Picasso]]. Like Kahlo before him, he drew himself but instead of being centered, his image is often to the side, as an observer. The goal was to emphasize the transformation of received visual culture.&lt;ref name="trends1950"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253344 |title=Trends 1950–1970 |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure during this time period was Swiss-Mexican [[Gunther Gerzso]], but his work was a “hard-edged variant”{{cite quote|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Is this is a quotation from a critic, or "scare-quotes"?--&gt; of Abstract Expressionism, based on clearly defined geometric forms as well as colors, with an effect that makes them look like low relief. His work was a mix of European abstraction and Latin American influences, including Mesoamerican ones.&lt;ref name="trends1950" /&gt;&lt;ref name="violencia"&gt;{{cite news |title= Opinion invitada/ Gunther Gerzso/Gunther Gerzso: una violencia metaforica |first=Cuauhtemoc |last=Medina |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=April 3, 2000 |page=9 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Invited opinion/Gunther Gerzo:metaphoric violence }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[watercolor]] field we can distinguish [[Edgardo Coghlan]] and [[Ignacio Barrios]] who were not aligned to a specific artistic movement but were not less important.

===The Olympics in Mexico City (1968); later===
"Designed by [[Mathias Goeritz]], a series of sculptures ... [lined] the "Route of Friendship" ([[Ruta de la Amistad]]) in celebration of the Olympics ... In contestation to the government-sanctioned artistic exhibition for the Olympics, a group of diverse, independent visual artists organize a counterpresentation entitled ''[[Salón Independiente]]'', or ''Independent Salon''; the exhibition signifies a key event in the resistance by artists of state-controlled cultural policies. This show of antigovernment efforts by artists would also be expressed in a mural in support of student movement's protests; the work became known as the ''Mural Efímero'' (or ''Ephemeral Mural'')" at [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]]".&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXV"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M. Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=XXV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Independent Salon was staged in 1970. In 1976 "[[Fernando Gambao]] spearheads the organization of an exposition of abstract art entitled ''El Geometrismo Mexicano Una Tendencia Actual''".&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXVI"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M.

"In an attempt to reassess ... post-1968 Mexican art, the Museum of Science and Art at UNAM" organized in 2007, the exhibition ''La Era de la Discrepancia. Arte y cultura visual en México 1968-1997''
&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXXIII"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M. Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=XXXIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 the exhibition ''Mexico: Esplendor de Treinta Siglos'', started its world tour at [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

===Neo-expressionism===
From the 1960s to the 1980s [[Neo-expressionist]] art was represented in Mexico by [[Manuel Felguerez]], Teresa Cito, Alejandro Pinatado, and [[Jan Hendrix]].&lt;ref name="rfajardo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huella"&gt;{{cite news |title= Manuel Felguerez: La huella de su arte |first=Leticia |last=Sanchez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=July 11, 1997 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Felguerez:The mark of his art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss-German artist, [[Mathias Goeritz]], in the 1950s created public sculptures including the ''Torres Satélite'' in [[Ciudad Satélite]]. In the 1960s, he became central to the development of abstract and other modern art along with [[José Luis Cuevas]] and [[Pedro Friedeberg]].&lt;ref name="rogallery"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rogallery.com/Goeritz_Mathias/goeritz-biography.html |title= Mathias Goeritz, German-Mexican (1915–1990) |publisher= RO Gallery |location=Mexico City |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neomexicanismo===
In the mid-1980s, the next major movement in Mexico was Neomexicanismo, a slightly surreal, somewhat kitsch and postmodern version of Social Realism that focused on popular culture rather than history.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; The name ''neomexicanismo'' was originally used by critics to belittle the movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Works were not necessarily murals: they used other mediums such as collage and often parodied and allegorized cultural icons, mass media, religion, and other aspects of Mexican culture. This generation of artists were interested in traditional Mexican values and exploring their roots—often questioning or subverting them. Another common theme was Mexican culture vis-à-vis globalization.&lt;ref name="artmod"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mam.org.mx/exposiciones/actuales/376-ineomexicanismos-ficciones-identitarias-en-el-mexico-de-los-ochenta |title=¿Neomexicanismos?

===Postmodern===
Art from the 1990s to the present is roughly categorized as Postmodern, although this term has been used to describe works created before the 1990s. Major artists associated with this label include [[Betsabeé Romero]],&lt;ref name="nunes"&gt;{{cite news |title= ART IN REVIEW; Betsabee Romero |first=Ken |last=Johnson |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/arts/art-in-review-betsabee-romero.html |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |date=July 28, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monica Castillo]], [[Francisco Larios]],&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt; Martha Chapa and Diego Toledo.&lt;ref name="rfajardo" /&gt;

The success of Mexican artists is demonstrated by their inclusion in galleries in New York, London, and [[Zurich]].&lt;ref name="rgallop10"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art collections and galleries===
In 1974 Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil (MACG), a gallery and museum, opened.

[[Museo Tamayo de Arte Contemporáneo]] opened in Mexico City in 1981. The [[Museo Nacional de Arte|National Museum of Art]] (MUNAL) opened in 1982.

[[Centro Cultural Arte Contemporáneo]] opened in Mexico City in 1986, now defunct. "In 1998 ... with the sudden death of its chief executive, [[Televisa]] closed ... [the gallery] for a time, as the turnover in the company coincided with a drastic drop in the company's profitability".

[[Kurimanzutto]]—a private gallery was founded in 1999.&lt;ref name="rgallop11"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the [[Jacques Gelman|Gelman collection]] was donated to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (in New York); part of the Gelmans' collection is on display in the [[Cuernavaca#Museo Muros|Muros Museum]] in [[Cuernavaca]].

[[Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo]] (MUAC) opened in 2008.

Private art exhibition is concentrated  to major urban centers, in particular [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Léon]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Oaxaca City]] and [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="Zaragoza51"/&gt;

===Art criticism===
[[Octavio Mercado]] said in 2012 that the activity of art criticism still can be found in specialized magazines and nationally disseminated newspapers; furthermore, a new generation of art critics include [[Daniela Wolf]], [[Ana Elena Mallet]], [[Gabriella Gómez-Mont]], and [[Pablo Helguera]].
&lt;ref name="Zaragoza59"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M.

==21st century==

[[File:Mexican Street Artist.jpg|thumb|Mexican artist creating an ephemeral work of [[street art]] in chalk on the streets of the Historical Center of Mexico City]]
Just like many other parts in the world, Mexico has adopted some modern techniques like with the existence of street artists depicting popular paintings from Mexico throughout history or original content.

===Modern Mexican visual artists===
Some of the most prominent painters in this century are:

==Popular arts and handcrafts==
{{Main|Mexican handcrafts and folk art}}

[[Mexican handcrafts and folk art]], called ''artesanía'' in Mexico, is a complex category of items made by hand or in small workshops for utilitarian, decorative, or other purposes. These include ceramics, wall hangings, certain types of paintings, and textiles.&lt;ref name="mexpopart"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mexipopulart.org/mexicanpopularart.aspx |title= Mexican Popular Arts |accessdate= 2009-11-28 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005022/http://mexipopulart.org/mexicanpopularart.aspx |archivedate= 2010-03-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the more formal arts, artesanía has both indigenous and European roots and is considered a valued part of Mexico's ethnic heritage.&lt;ref name="pomar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/interior/index.php?idNota=4038&amp;p=nota |title=Centenaria presencia de las artesanías |first=Maria Teresa |last=Pomar |date=Nov–Dec 1999 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=100 years of arts and crafts |accessdate=2009-11-28 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This linking among the arts and cultural identity was most strongly forged by the country's political, intellectual, and artistic elite in the first half of the 20th century, after the Mexican Revolution.&lt;ref name="pomar" /&gt; Artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[Rufino Tamayo]], and [[Frida Kahlo]] used artesanía as inspiration for a number of their murals and other works.&lt;ref name="pomar" /&gt; Unlike the fine arts, artesanía is created by common people and those of indigenous heritage, who learn their craft through formal or informal apprenticeship.&lt;ref name="mexpopart" /&gt; The linking of artesanía and Mexican identity continues through television, movies, and tourism promotion.&lt;ref name="iturbe"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Iturbe |first1=Mercedes |editor1-first=Mercedes |editor1-last=Iturbe |title= Folk Art Aesthetics and Poetry in Belleza y Poesía en el arte popular mexicano |year=1996 |publisher= CVS Publicaciones |location= Querétaro,QRO |language=Spanish, English |isbn=968-7377-14-3 |pages=223–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the artesanía produced in Mexico consists of ordinary things made for daily use. They are considered artistic because they contain decorative details or are painted in bright colors, or both.&lt;ref name="mexpopart" /&gt; The bold use of colors in crafts and other constructions extends back to pre-Hispanic times. These were joined by other colors introduced by European and Asian contact, always in bold tones.&lt;ref name="aprahamian1112"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |pages=11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design motifs vary from purely indigenous to mostly European with other elements thrown in. Geometric designs connected to Mexico's pre-Hispanic past are prevalent, and items made by the country's remaining purely indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="aprahamian31"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs from nature are popular, possibly more so than geometric patterns in both pre-Hispanic and European designs. They are especially prevalent in wall-hangings and ceramics.&lt;ref name="aprahamian36"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best of Mexico's handcrafts is [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera pottery]] produced in [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; It has a mix of Chinese, Arab, Spanish, and indigenous design influences.&lt;ref name="delpaso"&gt;{{cite book |last1= del Paso |first1=Fernando |editor1-first=Mercedes |editor1-last=Iturbe |title= Form and Color in the Manual Arts of Mexico in Belleza y Poesía en el arte popular mexicano |year=1996 |publisher= CVS Publicaciones |location= Querétaro,QRO |language=Spanish, English |isbn=968-7377-14-3 |pages=245–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known folk paintings are the ''ex-voto'' or ''[[retablo]]'' [[Votive paintings of Mexico|votive paintings]]. These are small commemorative paintings or other artwork created by a believer, honoring the intervention of a saint or other figure. The untrained style of ex-voto painting was appropriated during the mid-20th century by Kahlo, who believed they were the most authentic expression of Latin American art.&lt;ref name="trends1970"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253345 |title=Trends 1970-present |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==
{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}
[[File:Francisco Villa.gif|right|thumb|Iconic image of [[Pancho Villa]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]], a publicity still taken by Mutual Film Corporation photographer John Davidson Wheelan, January 1914.&lt;ref name="John Mraz 2012, pp. 246-47"&gt;[[John Mraz]], ''Photographing the Mexican Revolution'', Austin: University of Texas Press 2012, pp. 246-47. Inv. #287647. Fondo Casasola. SINAFO-Fototeca Nacional de INAH.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Cinema in Mexico|Cinematography]] came to Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution]] from the U.S. and France. It was initially used to document the battles of the war. Revolutionary general [[Pancho Villa]] himself starred in some silent films.  In 2003, [[HBO]] broadcast ''[[And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself]]'', with Antonio Banderas as Villa; the film focuses on the making of the film ''[[The Life of General Villa]]''.  Villa consciously used cinema to shape his public image.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Mistron. "The Role of Pancho Villa in the Mexican and American Cinema." ''Studies in Latin American Popular Culture'' 2:1-13 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sound film in Mexico was made in 1931, called ''Desde Santa''. The first Mexican film genre appeared between 1920 and 1940, called ''ranchero''.&lt;ref name="truax"&gt;{{cite news |title=El Cine Mexicano Vuelve a Brillar |first=Eileen |last=Truax |newspaper=La Opinion |location=Los Angeles |date=January 29, 2007 |pages=1A, 16A |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican Cinema Shines Again }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Mexico's Golden Age of Cinema]] is regarded as the 1940s and 1950s, two films from the mid to late 1930s, ''Allá en el Rancho Grande'' (1936) and ''Vamanos con Pancho Villa'' (1935), set the standard of this age thematically, aesthetically, and ideologically. These films featured archetypal star figures and symbols based on broad national mythologies. Some of the mythology according to [[Carlos Monsiváis]], includes the participants in family melodramas, the masculine ''[[charro]]s'' of ranchero films, [[femme fatale]]s (often played by [[María Félix]] and [[Dolores del Río]]), the indigenous peoples of [[Emilio Fernández]]’s films, and [[Cantinflas]]’s ''peladito'' (urban miscreant).&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt;

Settings were often ranches, the battlefields of the Revolution, and [[cabaret]]s. Movies about the Mexican Revolution focused on the initial overthrow of the [[Porfirio Díaz]] government rather than the fighting among the various factions afterwards. They also tended to focus on rural themes as “Mexican”, even though the population was increasingly urban.&lt;ref name="strayer"&gt;Strayer, 2009 p.7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico had two advantages in filmmaking during this period. The first was a generation of talented actors and filmmakers. These included actors such as [[María Félix]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Pedro Armendáriz]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Cantinflas]], and directors such as [[Emilio Fernández|Emilio “El Indio” Fernandez]] and cinematographer [[Gabriel Figueroa]]. Many of these starts had success in the United States and at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] .&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacDonald |first1=Christine |year=1994 |title= Cinema renaissance: Mexican films captivate world audiences |journal=Business Mexico |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=60–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the corner of La Brea and [[Hollywood Boulevard]], there is a sculpture of four women who represent the four pillars of the cinema industry, one of whom is Mexican actress [[Dolores del Rio]] .&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt; Gabriel Figueroa is known for black-and-white camerawork that is generally stark and expressionist, with simple but sophisticated camera movement.&lt;ref name="roads"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=Alex |date=November 1995 |title=Roads to the south: In praise of Mexican cinema |journal=Film Comment |volume=31 |issue=6 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second advantage was that Mexico was not heavily involved in the [[Second World War]], and therefore had a greater supply of celluloid for films, then also used for bombs.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

[[File:Bird of Paradise (1932) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|A scene from ''Bird of Paradise'' (1932) with [[Dolores del Río]].]]
In the 1930s, the government became interested in the industry in order to promote cultural and political values. Much of the production during the Golden Age was financed with a mix of public and private money, with the government eventually taking a larger role. In 1942 the Banco Cinematográfico financed almost all of the industry, coming under government control by 1947. This gave the government extensive censorship rights through deciding which projects to finance.&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt; While the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) censored films in many ways in the 1940s and 1950s, it was not as repressive as other Spanish speaking countries, but it played a strong role in how Mexico's government and culture was portrayed.&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

The Golden Age ended in the late 1950s, with the 1960s dominated by poorly made imitations of Hollywood westerns and comedies. These films were increasingly shot outdoors and popular films featured stars from [[lucha libre]]. Art and experimental film production in Mexico has its roots in the same period, which began to bear fruit in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; Director [[Paul Leduc (film director)|Paul Leduc]] surfaced in the 1970s, specializing in films without dialogue. His first major success was with ''Reed: Insurgent Mexico'' (1971) followed by a biography of [[Frida Kahlo]] called ''Frida'' (1984). He is the most consistently political of modern Mexican directors. In the 1990s, he filmed ''Latino Bar'' (1991) and ''Dollar Mambo'' (1993). His silent films generally have not had commercial success.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

In the late 20th century the main proponent of Mexican art cinema was Arturo Ripstein Jr.. His career began with a spaghetti Western-like film called ''Tiempo de morir'' in 1965 and who some consider the successor to [[Luis Buñuel]] who worked in Mexico in the 1940s. Some of his classic films include ''El Castillo de la pureza'' (1973), ''Lugar sin limites'' (1977) and ''La reina de la noche'' (1994) exploring topics such as family ties and even homosexuality, dealing in cruelty, irony, and tragedy.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;
State censorship was relatively lax in the 1960s and early 1970s, but came back during the latter 1970s and 1980s, monopolizing production and distribution.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

Another factor was that many Mexican film making facilities were taken over by Hollywood production companies in the 1980s, crowding out local production.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; The quality of films was so diminished that for some of these years,{{which|date=January 2012}} [[Ariel Award|Mexico's Ariel film award]] was suspended for lack of qualifying candidates.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt; Popular filmmaking decreased but the art sector grew, sometimes producing works outside the view of censors such as [[Jorge Fons]]’ 1989 film ''Rojo Amanecer'' on the [[Tlatelolco massacre|1968 Tlatelolco massacre]]. The movie was banned by the government but received support in Mexico and abroad. The film was shown although not widely.{{elucidate|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Shown where? In Mexico? I thought it was banned. From whom did it receive support?--&gt; It was the beginning of more editorial freedom for filmmakers in Mexico.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Starting in the 1990s, Mexican cinema began to make a comeback, mostly through co-production with foreign interests. One reason for international interest in Mexican cinema was the wild success of the 1992 film [[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|''Como Agua Para Chocolate'']] (''Like Water for Chocolate'').&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; In 1993, this film was the largest grossing foreign language film in U.S. history and ran in a total of 34 countries.&lt;ref name="macdonald" /&gt; Since then, Mexican film divided into two genres. Those for a more domestic audience tend to be more personal and more ambiguously political such as ''Pueblo de Madera'', ''La Vida Conjugal'', and ''Angel de fuego''. Those geared for international audiences have more stereotypical Mexican images and include ''Solo con tu Pareja'', ''La Invencion de Cronos'' along with ''Como Agua para Chocolate''.&lt;ref name="macdonald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Mexico's newest generation of successful directors includes [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], and [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. Films include ''[[Children of Men|Cuarón/Children of Men]]'' filmed in England and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth|El Laberinto del Fauno]]'', which was a Mexican/Spanish production. Film professionals in the early 21st century tend to be at least bilingual (Spanish and English) and are better able to participate in the global market for films than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

==Photography in Mexico==
[[File:MetlacBridgeKahlo.JPG|thumb|300px|An image of the Metlac Bridge, taken by [[Guillermo Kahlo]].]]
Photography came to Mexico in the form of [[daguerreotype]] about six months after its discovery, and it spread quickly. It was initially used for portraits of the wealthy (because of its high cost), and for shooting landscapes and pre-Hispanic ruins.&lt;ref name="monroy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/hitoria-de-la-fotografia-en-mexico.html |title= Historia de la Fotografía en México |first=Rebeca |last=Monroy Nasr |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=History of Mexican photography |accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another relatively common type of early photographic portraits were those of recently deceased children, called ''little angels,'' which persisted into the first half of the 20th century. This custom derived from a Catholic tradition of celebrating a dead child's immediate acceptance into heaven, bypassing purgatory. This photography replaced the practice of making drawings and other depictions of them as this was considered a “happy occasion.”&lt;ref name="sleeping"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marino |first1=Daniela |date=Summer 1997 |title= Prayer for a sleeping child: Iconography of the funeral ritual of little angels in Mexico |journal= The Journal of American Culture |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=37–49 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734x.1997.2002_37.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal portraits were the most common form of commercial photography through the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

Modern photography in Mexico did not begin as an art form, but rather as documentation, associated with periodicals and government projects. It dates to the [[Porfirio Díaz]] period of rule, or the ''Porfiriato'', from the late 19th century to 1910.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1086-the-legacy-of-agustin-victor-casasola-photographer-1874-1938 |title= The legacy of Agustin Victor Casasola (Photographer 1874–1938) |author=Rita Pomade |date=June 1, 2004 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn= 1028-9089 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp7"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Porfirian-era photography was heavily inclined toward the presentation of the nation's modernization to the rest of the world, with Mexico City as its cultural showpiece. This image was European-based with some indigenous elements for distinction.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp24"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylized images of the indigenous during the Porfirato were principally done by Ybañez y Sora in the [[costumbrista]] painting style, which was popular outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; The most important Porfirian era photographer was [[Guillermo Kahlo]], who worked with associate Hugo Brehme.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; Kahlo established his own studio in the first decade of the 1900s and was hired by businesses and the government to document architecture, interiors, landscapes, and factories.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp35"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahlo's style reflected the narratives of the period, solely focusing on major constructions and events, and avoiding the common populace.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp37"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; It avoided subjects that hinted at the political instability of the country at the time, such as [[strike action]]s.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp26"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; One major Kahlo project was the Photographic Inventory of Spanish Colonial Church Architecture in Mexico (1910), which consisted of twenty five albums sponsored by the federal government to document the remaining colonial architecture.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp25"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's photography was used to link Mexico's past to its progress with political and social power provided in symbols and ideals, as well to link the government's aspirations with its colonial and pre-Hispanic past.{{clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp34"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decena trágica.JPG|thumb|300px|A scene from the [[Decena Trágica]], February 1913, from the [[Agustín Casasola]] archives.]]
Another pioneer of Mexican photography was [[Agustín Casasola|Agustín Victor Casasola]]. Like Kahlo, he began his career in the Porfirato, but his career was focused on photography for periodicals. Again like Kahlo, Casasola's work prior to the Mexican Revolution focused on non-controversial photographs, focusing on the lives of the elite. The outbreak of civil war caused Casasola's choice of subject to change. He began to focus not only on portraits of the main protagonists (such as [[Francisco Villa]]) and general battle scenes, but on executions and the dead. He focused on people whose faces showed such expressions as pain, kindness, and resignation.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

His work during this time produced a large collection of photographs, many of which are familiar to Mexicans as they have been widely reprinted and reused, often without credit to Casasola. After the war, Casasola continued to photograph common people, especially migrants to Mexico City during the 1920s and 1930s. His total known archives comprise about half a million images with many of his works archived in the former monastery of San Francisco in [[Pachuca]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

Kahlo and Casasola are considered the two most important photographers to develop the medium in Mexico, with Kahlo defining architectural photography and Casasolas establishing photojournalism. Neither man thought of himself as an artist—especially not Casasolas—who thought of himself as a historian in the [[Positivism|Positivist]] tradition, but the photography of both show attention to detail, lighting, and placement of subjects for emotional or dramatic effect.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp1825"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.18-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of the 20th century, most photography was connected to documentation. However, artistic trends from both inside and outside the country had an effect. In the 1920s, the dominant photographic style was [[Pictorialism]], in which images had a romantic or dream-like quality due to the use of filters and other techniques. American [[Edward Weston]] broke with this tradition, taking these effects away for more realistic and detailed images.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |title= Edward Weston: Pictorialist Pioneer |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 27, 2003 |pages=62–65 s }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a split in the photography world between Pictorialists and Realists both inside and outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

Weston and his Italian assistant [[Tina Modotti]] were in Mexico from 1923 to 1926, allying themselves with Mexican Realist photographers [[Manuel Álvarez Bravo]] as well as muralists such as [[Gabriel Fernández Ledesma]]. These photographers' political and social aspirations matched those of the muralist movement and the new post-Revolution government.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp1718"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariana Yampolsky]], originally from the U.S., became an important photographer in Mexico.  Photography and other arts shifted to depictions of the country's indigenous heritage and the glorification of the Mexican common people.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9" /&gt; This was mainly to reject the elitist and heavily European values of the Porfiriato, along with the increasing cultural influence of the United States in favor of an “authentic” and distinct Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp910"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the government's decision to use this imagery, rather than the still-fresh memories of the battles and atrocities of the Revolution to promote itself.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp27"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Centro-fotografico-in-oaxaca-founded-by-toledo.jpg|thumb|[[Centro Fotográfico Álvarez Bravo]] at the [[Institute of Graphic Arts of Oaxaca]].]]

Manuel Alvarez Bravo experimented with abstraction in his photography and formed his own personal style concerned with Mexican rites and customs. He was active from the 1920s until his death in the 1990s. Like other artists of the 20th century, he was concerned with balancing international artistic trends with the expression of Mexican culture and people. His photographic techniques were concerned with transforming the ordinary into the fantastic. From the end of the 1930s to the 1970s his photography developed along with new technologies such as color, using the same themes. In the 1970s, he experimented with female nudes.&lt;ref name="aalonso"&gt;{{cite news |title= Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico en imagenes |first=Alejandro |last=Alonso |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=June 13, 1997 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico in images }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These post-Revolution photographers influenced the generations after them, but the emphasis remained on documentary journalism, especially for newspapers. For this reason, the focus remained on social issues. This included work by [[Nacho López]] and [[Héctor García Cobos|Hector Garcia]], best known for their photography of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|student uprising of 1968]].&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

During the 1970s, a fusion of various styles retained a social focus.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; During the same period, institutions were established that dedicated themselves to the promotion of photography and conservation of photographs, such as the Centro de la Imagen, the Fototeca Nacional del [[INAH]], and the publication ''Luna Córnea''.&lt;ref name="grandes"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los 13 grandes de la fotografía mexicana |first=Yanet |last=Aguilar Sosa |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/sociedad/3014.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The 13 greats of Mexican photography }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography in Mexico from the latter 20th century on remains mostly focused on photojournalism and other kinds of documentary. Francisco Mata de Rosas is considered the most notable photographer in contemporary Mexico mostly working with documentaries.{{according to whom|date=January 2012}} He has published a number of books including ''México Tenochtitlan'' and ''Tepito, Bravo el Barrio''. Eniac Martínez specializes in panoramas. Patricia Aridjis works with social themes, mostly to illustrate books. Gerardo Montiel Klint's work has been described as a “shadowing and dark world”, focusing on the angst and violence of adolescents.&lt;ref name="grandes" /&gt; The most recent generation of photographers work with new and digital technologies. One of these is [[Javier Orozco]] who specializes in interiors.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

However, purely artistic photography has had an impact. In 2002, a photographic exhibit by Daniela Rossell featured images of Mexican multimillionaires posing in their ostentatious homes, filled with expensive paintings, hunting trophies, crystal chandeliers, gold lamé wallpaper, and household help. The photographs set off a wave of social criticism as well as tabloid gossip.&lt;ref name="rgallop47"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Enn Sirvet''' (born 1967) is an American sculptor, designer, and structural engineer. He acquired skills and exposure to traditional sculpture techniques while studying undergraduate art history as a minor at Fordham University in the Bronx, New York, and while studying for his Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, at the University of Maryland, College Park, by pursuing a minor in Studio Arts.

==Early career==
Sirvet  is largely self-taught. In his early career as an artist, while maintaining full-time employment as a structural engineer as a member of [[Land Sculpture Studio]] in [[Beltsville, Maryland]], he worked principally at making abstract, contemporary minimalist constructions using recycled metals and wood. His first shows at [[Washington D.C.]]'s [[Artomatic]] introduced him to the larger contemporary arts community in the metropolitan area. His bowl "Millennia" was awarded Award of Distinction for Metal by the James Renwick Alliance, a program of the [[Renwick Gallery]], [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawson|first=Mallory|title=jra participates in ARTomatic|year=2009|series=James Renwick Alliance quarterly|issue=Summer|page=21|url=http://www.jra.org/images/Summer%2009%20Quarterly%20FINAL.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203202633/http://www.jra.org/images/Summer%2009%20Quarterly%20FINAL.pdf|archivedate=3 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mid-career==
Sirvet's mid-career started flourishing when he left full-time work in 2008 to concentrate on fine art sculpture and functional design.

Having experimented with new forms in the early 2000s, Sirvet still works by hand, but has also pioneered use of new industrial technology for his art, using skills learned in the engineering field to create solid forms out of structural aluminum, architectural plastics, and wood, which are sometimes combined in modular components. 

Sirvet has garnered several public art installations, including two commissions for the United States' [[Art in Embassies Program]] for the United States Embassy in [[Valletta]], Malta&lt;ref&gt;[https://art.state.gov/portfolio/valletta_embassy_2010/ Maltese Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States Consulate&lt;ref&gt;[https://art.state.gov/portfolio/dubai_consulate_2011/ Arabesque 1 and 2]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dubai, United Arab Emirates]]. In the United States, public art installations include Farragut Spheres for [[District of Columbia]]'s [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] MetroArts Art in Transit program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fynes|first=Gene|title=Metro Unveils Station Artwork|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/getthere/2010/02/metro_officials_unveil_artwork.html|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=18 February 2010}} &lt;/ref&gt; and Red Orchard Wall for the Montgomery County Public Arts Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bressi|first1=Todd W.|last2=Cohen|first2=Dr. Michele|last3=Jenkins|first3=Suzan|title=Montgomery County Public Art Roadmap: Creating A Vibrant Public Art Ecosystem in Montgomery County|date=2016|publisher=Montgomery County Public Arts Trust Arts and Humanities Council of Montgomery County|pages=25|url=https://issuu.com/ahcmc/docs/roadmap_17-02_20|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Misunderstood''''' ({{lang-it|'''Incompreso'''}}) is a 1966 Italian [[drama film]] directed by [[Luigi Comencini]]. It was entered into the [[1967 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2787/year/1967.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Misunderstood |accessdate=8 March 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Duncombe is the UK Consul General in [[Florence]], Italy.  He becomes a widower when his two sons, Andrew and Miles, are still children.  Andrew, the eldest, apparently reacts with adult maturity to the loss of his mother, looking after little Miles, an attempt to find a way out of such premature heart-crushing loss.  Miles constantly blames Andrew for his mischievous behavior but his brother valiantly takes said blame as his personality is that of a grown up, or at least that is what he tries to be.  The father, given his mandate, is often absent, both physically and emotionally, especially toward Andrew.  It will be at the end that Duncombe will acknowledge his mistakes when finding himself at a father's point of no return.

'''New Orleans Airlift''' is an artist-driven arts nonprofit, located in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. [http://www.neworleansairlift.org New Orleans Airlift] is dedicated to producing innovative projects for New Orleans-based artists to collaborate and engage with diverse communities locally and internationally. Airlift projects are identified by collaboration, experimentation and a belief in the artist’s role in creating a just, equitable and joyous future.

Airlift's programming highlights New Orleans’ underground art and experimental artists. Through networks, friendships, and close connections to New Orleans' street life, Airlift is able to cultivate and foster long-standing relationships with artists locally and globally. The organization understands how important a dynamic street culture, living culture and a thriving contemporary arts scene are to the neighborhoods within New Orleans. By transporting that which is unique to New Orleans to workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects, Airlift is able to bring recognition to New Orleans as well as provide inspiration and creative collaboration around the globe.

__TOC__

==History==
 
Airlift was founded in 2008 by Delaney Martin and Jay Pennington. Pennington and Martin began to collaborate just after [[Hurricane Katrina]].  As they witnessed the particular devastation of the Storm on the New Orleans artistic community, Pennington and Martin saw collaborative creativity as a way of coming together and mending their community.

Together they organized an event called The New Orleans Airlift, which brought New Orleans artists to [[Berlin, Germany]] in 2009. Jay and Delaney named this project, thought to be a one-time-event, after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Soon after returning from Berlin, though, Jay and Delaney decided to continue the cultivation of unique artistic collaborations, and kept the organization under the name New Orleans Airlift.

==Projects==
Airlift projects are hallmarked by creative collaboration, and artistic experimentation. One of the most successful projects to date has been [http://www.musicboxvillage.com The Music Box], a multi-disciplinary project dedicated to the exploration and performance of musical architecture. This project was inspired by the twin pillars of New Orleans culture, music and architecture.

From 2011 through 2012 the first ever installation of The Music Box called "A Shantytown Sound Laboratory"  presented groundbreaking musical performances and hosted free public hours in its inaugural location, the historic [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater]] neighborhood. Constructed from the remains of a blighted house, invented instruments were embedded into the walls, ceilings and floors of structures created by 25 collaborating artists. The Music Box captured the hearts of New Orleans community and the attention of international press including [[NPR]] who said: “High concept and nontraditional as it may be, The Music Box has found a place in the long history of New Orleans music."&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Ann. "A Night Out In New Orleans' New Bohemia." National Public Radio. NPR. Web. 28 Sept. 2015. https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2012/06/11/154776190/a-night-out-in-new-orleans-new-bohemia&lt;/ref&gt;

New Orleans Airlift continues to pair New Orleans artists with influential institutions, individuals and community members to collaborate to create artistic productions that are participatory, multifaceted and high quality. In the spring of 2015, New Orleans Airlift completed their installment of the Roving Village Residencies, an ambitious project where the musical houses travel to different neighborhoods around New Orleans. The first residency took place in City Park. Over the course of six weeks (April to May 2015) over 10,000 audience members explored the installation through night time orchestral concerts, free public hours on weekends, educational workshops and artist talks. Over 700 children participated in the Music Box Roving Village: City Park through school field trips and after school partnerships. The Village also hosted musicians from all musical backgrounds and locations such as Bruce “Sunpie” Barnes, [[Solange Knowles]], [[Wilco]], influential Jazz musicians [[William Parker (musician)|William Parker]] and [[Cooper-Moore|Cooper Moore]], Lost Bayou Ramblers, and [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]], to name a few. Having proved to be a great success, a permanent Music Box Village and headquarters for New Orleans Airlift has been erected in the [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater]], neighborhood of New Orleans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9420">[[Image:Retablo1-Three.jpeg|right|frame|1.Three ''retablos'']]

'''Retablos''' are a sophisticated [[Peruvian]] [[folk art]] in the form of portable boxes which depict religious, historical, or everyday events that are important to the Indigenous people of the highlands. It is a tradition originated in [[Ayacucho region|Ayacucho]].

The Spanish word ''retablo'' comes from the Latin ''retro-tabulum'' (“behind the table or altar”), which was later shortened to ''retabulum''. This is a reference to the fact that the first ''retablos'' were placed on or behind the altars of [[Catholic Church|Catholic churches]] in Spain and [[Latin America]]. They were three-dimensional statues or images inside a decorated frame.

==Origins==

[[Image:Retablo2-Santiago.jpeg|right|frame|2. ''Santiago'' (St James)]]

The ''retablos'' probably originated with the Christian knights of the Crusades and the Spanish ''reconquista'' (the 700-year struggle against the Moors in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]).

The Christian warriors, who frequently found themselves far away from their home churches, carried small portable box-altars for worship and protection against their enemies. These earliest ''retablos'' usually featured religious themes, especially those involving ''Santiago'' (Saint James), the patron saint-warrior in the fight against the Moors.

''Retablos'' came to the New World as small portable altars, Nativity scenes and other religious topics used by the early priests to evangelize the Indigenous.

==Adam and Eve==

[[Image:Retablo3-Adam&amp;Eve.jpeg|left|frame|3. Adam and Eve]]

There is a story of how a [[Holy Orders|Catholic priest]] effectively used a ''retablo'' to hold the attention of his Indigenous audience. He began with a closed ''retablo'', and told a long story about what was in the box, which he kept closed:

* a naked man
* ...a naked woman
* ...a snake
* ...temptation...
* sin...and punishment.
* He eventually opened the box and revealed that he was talking about...the [[creation myth]] of Adam and Eve.

==Patron saint of cattle== 

[[Image:Retablo4-Patron.jpeg|right|frame|4. St. Mark, patron of animals]]

In a syncretic process, the early ''retablos'' brought by the Spanish merged with Indigenous beliefs in the Andean region to acquire certain magical or symbolic properties which had been the attributes of local spirits before the Conquest. This was particularly true of the ''retablos'' named after [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]], known as ''cajones sanmarcos'' (“boxes of St. Mark”). Since St. Mark is the [[patron saint]] of farm animals, his spirit was used to invoke protection of cattle from disease and theft. These early ''retablos'' were wooden boxes with figures inside carved from stone, ivory or wood.

==Daily life and identity==

[[Image:Retablo5-Corn.harvest.jpeg|left|frame|5. Corn harvest]]

Later, ''retablos'' evolved to include daily scenes in the lives of the Andean people, such as harvests, processions, feasts, and tableaux depicting shops and homes.

The use of wood for the outside box remained, but other materials, such as gypsum, clay, or a potato-gypsum-clay paste mix, were increasingly used for the figures because of their ease of handling and durability.

In the 1940s more and more artists were using ''retablos'' as a vehicle for affirming and recording the distinct identity of the Indigenous people of the Andean region. They are also a defense of [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous culture]] and values in the face of the modernization and the penetration of their culture by that of the white Hispanic elites of Lima.

==Ayacucho and Nicario Jiménez==

[[Image:Retablo7-NicarioJ.jpeg|right|frame|6. Nicario Jiménez Quispe]]

The tradition of making ''cajones sanmarcos'' or ''retablos'' is very strong in the mountainous Peruvian region around the city of Ayacucho. In recent years the [[Political terrorism|political violence]] and the fighting between the [[Peruvian Army]] and the Marxist ''Sendero Luminoso'' (“Shining Path”) ''guerrillas'' around Ayacucho has forced many peasant families in the area to migrate to the capital city of Lima, where they make and sell their crafts commercially.

[[Nicario Jiménez Quispe]] (Quispe is his mother’s name) is a master artisan of the craft of making retablos. He was born in 1957 in a small highland Andean village near Ayacucho, and learned how to make ''retablos'' from his father and other skilled craftsmen. He has studied at the University of San Marcos in Lima, and has exhibited his retablos in Peru and abroad in several international competitions. His photo was taken while doing a demonstration at American University’s Language and Foreign Studies Department in 1991.

==Ayacucho==

[[Image:Retablo6-Ayacucho.jpeg|left|frame|7. Ayacucho, Peru]]

In 1968 Nicario’s family moved from their small village to the city of Ayacucho. A decade later Nicario Jiménez had his first chance to display his ''retablos'' alongside those of his father in a Lima gallery. The quality of and unique style of his work quickly caught the attention of many Peruvian and foreign connoisseurs of retablo folk art. In 1986 he opened his own workshop-gallery in Lima.

==His themes==

[[Image:Retablo8-Cross.jpeg|right|frame|8. Cross with coca leaves]]

He frequently injects elements that remind us of his Andean heritage. For example, this Crucifix has three [[Coca|coca leaves]] below the heart of Christ. He says he put them there to remind us that coca leaves (not cocaine) play an important role in Indigenous Andean cultures.

==The ''curandero'' (shaman)==

[[Image:Retablo9-Curandero.jpeg|left|frame|9. ''Curandero'' (shaman)]]

The shaman, or ''curandero'' (healer) practices [[traditional medicine|traditional folk medicine]]. He uses various herbs, including coca leaves, and passes a live Andean [[guinea pig]] (the ''cuy'') over the body or the patient as a [[Diagnosis|diagnostic tool]]. The ''cuy'' is then killed and its entrails studied to diagnose the illness and prescribe treatment, which is a combination of traditional [[medicinal herbs]] and Christian practices.

==''Yawar fiesta''==

[[Image:Retablo10-Yawar.fiesta.jpeg|right|frame|10. “''Yawar fiesta''”]]

This ''retablo'' shows a ceremony (“''Yawar Fiesta''”) involving a struggle between a bull (symbol of the Spanish) and a condor (symbol of the Andeans). The condor is tied to the back of the bull, who is infuriated and cannot rid itself of the condor, and eventually dies from exhaustion. The condor is then set free. It spreads its wings, and it becomes the symbol of the freedom of the Andean Indigenous peoples.

==The ''Pistaku'' (cutter of throats)==

[[Image:Retablo11-Pistaku.jpeg|left|frame|11. The ''Pistaku'']]

''[[Pistaku]]'' is a Quechua Indigenous word meaning “cutter of throats,” and he is the subject of an [[oral tradition]] among the Andean people. The ''Pistaku'' attacks and kills solitary travelers in the countryside in order to extract their fat. He is portrayed as a foreigner, and is tall, bearded, wears boots, and generally looks like a European.

The top part of the ''retablo'' represents the Colonial period and shows the ''Pistaku'' dressed as a Franciscan priest who extracts human fat to make bells whose sound varies according to the victim.

The middle portion shows the [[Modern Times (history)|modern period]] when the ''Pistaku'', wearing a cape, is a long-haired ''gringo'' who extracts fat to lubricate his airplanes and machines.

The final portion of the ''retablo'' is contemporary. The ''Pistaku'' appears more violent, especially in the period of former President Alán García. The human fat he extracts now not only serves to lubricate airplanes and machinery, but also to pay the [[external debt]] and buy weapons.

==''Sendero Luminoso'' (“Shining Path”)==

[[Image:Retablo12-Sendero.jpeg|right|frame|12. ''Sendero Luminoso'' (Shining Path)]]

In recent years there have been more controversial ''retablos'', such as those showing exploitation and mistreatment of the Indigenous peoples, and the plight of the Andean people caught between leftist ''guerrillas'' and the security forces of the State.

One recurring theme is the way the ''campesino'' is caught between the ''Sendero Luminoso'' (Shining Path) Marxist ''guerrillas'' and the military.

'''''Portrait of Émile Zola''''' is a painting of [[Émile Zola]] by [[Édouard Manet]]. Manet submitted the portrait to the 1868 Salon.
[[Image:Edouard Manet 049.jpg|thumb|right|220px]]

At this time Zola was known for his art criticism, and perhaps particularly as the writer of the novel [[Thérèse Raquin]].  This told the story of an adulterous affair between Thérèse, the wife of a clerk in a railway company, and a would-be painter named Laurent, whose work, rather like that of Zola's friend [[Paul Cézanne]], is denigrated by the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Ross King, ''The Judgment of Paris'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eleventh chapter the milieu of Manet's [[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe]] is evoked, in the murder scene, where Camille, the husband, goes out for the day with his wife and her lover to [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]].

On the wall is a reproduction of Manet's ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'', a controversial painting at the 1865 Salon but which Zola considered Manet's best work. "Behind it is an engraving from [[Diego Velázquez|Velazquez]]'s ''Bacchus'' indicating the taste for Spanish art shared by the painter and the writer. A Japanese print of a wrestler by [[Utagawa school|Utagawa Kuniaki II]] completes the décor."  A Japanese screen on the left of the picture recalls the role that the Far East played in revolutionizing ideas on perspective and colour in European painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/emile-zola-3060.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&amp;cHash=97ca12b598 musee-orsay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Provincetown Arts was launched in 1985.&lt;ref name="provincetownarts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://provincetownarts.org/home/?page_id=182|title=About &amp;#124; Provincetown Arts Magazine|website=provincetownarts.org|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Christopher Busa, who is also the publisher and editorial director. He is the son of painter Peter Busa (1914–1985),&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-peter-busa-11686|title=Oral history interview with Peter Busa, 1965 September 5 &amp;#124; Archives of American Art|website=aaa.si.edu|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; who participated in the formative years of Abstract Expressionism and formed a school for painters in Provincetown.

Contributors to the magazine include emerging artists as well as established figures. Its articles mainly cover art, culture, and literature. Articles also feature topics of national interest, including profiles of prominent figures, human interest stories, interviews and book reviews.

Since 2006, the magazine has featured in each issue two cover artists, one visual artist and one writer. There was an exception to this format in 2014, when the magazine focused on the centennial celebration of the Provincetown Art Association and Museum.&lt;ref name="wbur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/artery/2014/10/20/provincetown-frame-project|title=Provincetown Is Reframing Its History In A Cool New Way &amp;#124; The ARTery|website=wbur.org|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds''''' is an 1823 painting by the nineteenth-century landscape painter [[John Constable]] (1776–1837). This image of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], one of England's most famous medieval churches, is one of his most celebrated works, and was commissioned by one of his closest friends, [[John Fisher (Anglican bishop)|John Fisher]], The Bishop of Salisbury.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O56227/salisbury-cathedral-from-the-bishops-oil-painting-john-constable/ V&amp;A page]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Constable visited Salisbury in 1820 and made a series of oil sketches of the cathedral, which served as the model for this composition. The artist selected a viewpoint from the bishop's garden and included figures of Dr. Fisher and his wife at the bottom left. Following its exhibition at the 1823 Royal Academy, Constable observed: "My Cathedral looks very well....It was the most difficult subject in Landscape I ever had upon my Easel. I have not flinched at the work of the windows, buttresses, &amp;c. – but I have as usual made my escape in the Evanescence of the [[chiaroscuro|Chiaro-Oscuro]]". His patron took exception to the dark cloud over the cathedral, and when he commissioned a smaller replica, requested "a more serene sky". 

The painting embodies the full range of qualities of a quintessentially British [[landscape painting]] – the clouds, trees, a water meadow, cattle drinking at the edge of the pasture and the glorious architecture of a medieval cathedral – but all on a human scale.{{cn|date=March 2015}} Paintings like this one have so conditioned our view of rural Britain that it is now difficult to imagine a time when the countryside and country life were not held in such high regard.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

A version of the painting also resides at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City.  It is slightly different in that it shows different weather and hence light.  Whereas the London version depicts the cathedral with an overcast sky, the version in the Frick shows the cathedral with a clear, bright sky.

A small version of the painting resides at the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]]. John Fisher gave it to his daughter as a wedding present.

There is an earlier, homonymous version (1821-1822) of this painting at [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] in São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;http://masp.art.br/masp2010/acervo_detalheobra.php?id=662&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Fisher, seeing its sombre and grave colors, disliked it and asked for a happier, lighter one.

The '''Si-nangsong''' ({{korean|시낭송|詩朗誦}}) refers to the Korean poetry recitation style, which conveys emotions by memorizing poems. 

==History==
In South Korea, it began to be known to the public through a festival called 'Hurrah for the Poets'&lt;ref&gt;올해 첫「詩人(시인)의 날」 11월1일 http://newslibrary.naver.com/viewer/index.nhn?articleId=1987102700329206016&amp;editNo=3&amp;printCount=1&amp;publishDate=1987-10-27&amp;officeId=00032&amp;pageNo=6&amp;printNo=12948&amp;publishType=00020&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;오늘밤'92 시인만세 행사 http://newslibrary.naver.com/viewer/index.nhn?articleId=1992091600289109010&amp;editNo=5&amp;printCount=1&amp;publishDate=1992-09-16&amp;officeId=00028&amp;pageNo=9&amp;printNo=1339&amp;publishType=00010&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967. At that time, many poets participated in the festival, and the poetry recitation contest for the general public was held for the first time. Since then, there have been many poetry recitation contest and groups in South Korea. Even now, there are many contest participating in the competition.

''Si-nangsong-ga'' refers to a Korean [[poetry]] recitation expert. Usually, it is awarded to the winner of the contest.  Currently, the title ''Si-nangsong-ga'', which is certified by the [[Society of Korean Poets]], is awarded only to the winner of the JEI poetry recitation contest.

'''The Arts Club''' is a London [[private members club]] founded in 1863 by, amongst others, [[Charles Dickens]], [[Anthony Trollope]], and [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Lord Leighton]] in Dover Street, [[Mayfair]]. It remains a meeting place for men and women involved in the creative arts either professionally or as patrons.

==History==
The Arts Club was a hub of [[the arts]] during the 19th century and, although a social venue, it was known to be a place where influence could be exerted and careers developed. It was seen as the powerhouse behind the dealings of the [[Royal Academy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Its members and guests included Dickens, [[John Everett Millais|Millais]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] and [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]]. As early as 1891, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]], one of the Arts Club's leading members, broke away to found the rival [[Chelsea Arts Club]].

The Arts Club has continued to provide a forum and meeting place for those involved in all the arts. The visual arts predominate the professional artists amongst today's membership; the vast majority of Royal Academicians still present amongst the members. Members not professionally active as artists include [[art dealer]]s, gallery owners, artists' agents, as well as those who simply have an amateur or recreational interest in the arts.

Various scandals undermined the club during the last century, including the disappearance of the club's extensive collection of first-edition books and silver during refurbishments (the crates when opened were full of bricks) as well as fifty artworks from its collection.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The Club was completely refurbished in 2011/12.

== Clubhouse ==
The original club premises were at 17 [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square, Mayfair]]. After thirty years there, the club moved nearby to its current accommodation, an [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|18th-century townhouse]] at 40 [[Dover Street]], [[Mayfair]], just north of the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] on [[Piccadilly]], formerly the London home of the family of the [[Baron Stanley of Alderley]]. It was badly bombed in [[the Blitz]] and extensively rebuilt. The Arts Club is also looking at expanding its clubhouses, and planning venues in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Canary Wharf]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/05/15/arts-club-follow-rival-private-members-clubs-expanding-overseas/|title=Arts Club to follow rival private members clubs in expanding overseas|last=Boland|first=Hannah|date=2018-05-16|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Current membership includes a number of Royal Academicians, architects, musicians, actors and writers.  [[HRH The Prince Philip|HRH Prince Philip]] is the Patron and Sir [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] is the President of the Club. The Chairman of the Club is Gary Landesberg and the Chief Operating Officer is Remy Lyse. Current members include [[Grayson Perry]], the photographer [[Tom Hunter]], the actresses [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Kim Cattrall]] and also [[Ronnie Wood]]. Well known 'non-artist' members include [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Matthew Parris]], and [[Henry Blofeld]].

There are regular activities, recitals and lectures. The Arts Club operates a smart dress code. Membership requirements are a participation or interest in art, literature or science. Members must be proposed and seconded by existing members.

As of 2012, the Club has no reciprocal clubs in the UK.  However, a number of clubs outside the UK of similar character and prestige have reciprocal arrangements, including the [[Cercle de l'Union interalliée]] in Paris, [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto]], the St. Botolph and [[Algonquin Club]]s in Boston, the [[Cosmos Club]] in Washington DC, the [[Arts Club of Chicago]] and the Arts Club of Washington DC, and the [[Century Association]], The Coffee House, [[National Arts Club]] and [[Salmagundi Club]] in New York.

'''''The Child's Brain''''' (Italian: ''Il bambino cervello'') is [[oil painting|oil on canvas painting]] by the Italian artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. The painting was completed in 1914 in Italy. It is an example of the [[Metaphysical art]] style. The painting measures 81.5 by 65 centimeters and is now housed at [[Moderna museet]], Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Le Cerveau de l'enfant |website=Moderna Museet |url=http://sis.modernamuseet.se/en/view/objects/asitem/search$0040swg$0027Giorgio$0020de$0020Chirico$0027$002c$00271914$0027/0?t:state:flow=7ddc0fa5-ebbd-4166-9603-484d0cd41303 |access-date=21 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of ''The Child’s Brain'' is a nude young man, seen from the waist up, who is standing in back of a table with his eyes closed.&lt;ref name=Bohn&gt;

  |first=Willard|last=Bohn
  |isbn=0791451593
  |publisher=SUNY Press
  |year=2002
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting depicts a nude young man with a mix of both masculine and feminine features (the feminine being especially prominent in the lack of body hair or defined musculature, the long eyelashes and the finely groomed eyebrows) standing behind a table which blocks our view of him below the waist.  On the table is a yellow book with a red bookmark, that has been interpreted as an allegorical representation of male/female intercourse.  The man's right arm is hidden from view by a Greek column, connecting this painting to the art of the ancient Greeks, a common theme among de Chirico's work.  The man himself is likely a younger version of the figure of [[Dionysos]] who appears in later works by de Chirico, such as ''The Phantom''.&lt;ref name=Bohn/&gt;

The common interpretation of the painting is that the figure represents de Chirico's father, with the book on the table representing the artists' parent's lovemaking, perhaps witnessed at some point by the young artist.&lt;ref name=Bohn/&gt;

In ''The Child’s Brain'', the man depicted has his pelvic area covered by a book. This can be interpreted as the man being faced with the terror of castration which can be found in the psychological work of Sigmund Freud. De Chirico was in tune with Freud's studies, reflecting a fascination with psychosexual stages, particularly the phallic stage. It is at this time that the male child develops an obsession with his genitals, that leads to the realization of gender difference and a fear of castration.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David B. "Psychosexual Development." Psychosexual Development. Brown University, 1996. Web. 13 Mar. 2013. &lt;http://www.victorianweb.org/science/freud/develop.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Greatest''''' is a 2009 American [[drama film]] written and directed by [[Shana Feste]] in her [[list of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], and starring [[Pierce Brosnan]] (also an executive producer), [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Carey Mulligan]], and [[Michael Shannon]].

==Plot==
Eighteen-year-old Bennett Brewer ([[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]]) and Rose ([[Carey Mulligan|Mulligan]]) have sex together, the only time either of them have ever done so. When Bennett is killed when a truck crashes into his car while he is parked in the middle of the road at night, his family feel like they cannot go on. His mother Grace ([[Susan Sarandon|Sarandon]]) and his father Allen ([[Pierce Brosnan|Brosnan]]) get an unexpected visitor knocking at their door; it turns out to be Rose, who is pregnant with Bennett's child. As the story develops, Bennett's younger brother Ryan is introduced and he is grieving the fact he did not say a final good bye to his brother. One sees the true relationships of the family as the story comes together, Grace waits at the bed of Jordan Walker, the man driving the truck which collided with Bennett's car in the crash. She is waiting for him to wake so she can ask him what occurred during the 17 minutes between the crash and his death. After a while, she finds out the truth, but is disappointed with what she hears. In the last moments, Bennett was not calling for his mother - he was calling to Rose asking Walker to make sure that she was safe.

Allen hires a cleaner to clean the house, but when Grace finds out she is terribly angry, claiming their son has been washed away. Allen then appears to be having a heart attack, whilst Grace carries on shouting until she realises what is happening. At the hospital bed, shortly after Grace returns from finding out about Bennett's final minutes, Allen breaks down crying, saying that he had been holding in all his grief and upset, and that he could have done something to prevent the crash and his son's death.

Meanwhile, Rose has overheard Grace saying Rose should have died instead of Bennett, so she leaves and seeks the help of her own mother. She soon realises that all her mother is bothered about is trying to get money from the Brewers, claiming it will help her. The Brewers try to find Rose and they find her in labor and persuade her to go to the hospital and, while in the car on the way, she seeks to find out everything about Bennett she did not already know.

When the film draws to a close, one sees Rose and the baby, a girl called Ruby, Grace's favourite girl's name. The film ends with the moment Bennett spoke to Rose earlier on the day he died.

==Production==
Feste received the help of [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA) director Richard Lovett, for whom she had been working as an assistant in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leydon|first=Joe|title=Shana Feste’s Nanny Diaries|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/articles-directing/shana-feste-country-strong-gwyneth-paltrow-20101201/|work=MovieMaker Magazine|accessdate=August 9, 2013|date=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAA sent [[Pierce Brosnan]]'s producing partner, [[Beau St. Clair]], the script and she convinced him to read it.&lt;ref name="HuffPo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverstein|first=Melissa|title=Interview with Shana Feste -- Writer and Director of The Greatest|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melissa-silverstein/interview-with-shana-fest_b_523165.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=August 9, 2013|date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, [[Susan Sarandon]] joined the film, convinced by Brosnan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Susan Sarandon answers the call from Pierce Brosnan for 'The Greatest'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/susan-sarandon-answers-call-pierce-brosnan-greatest-article-1.422820|publisher=NYDailyNews.com|accessdate=August 10, 2013|date=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feste met with a lot of actresses for Carey Mulligan's role but ultimately Mulligan stood out. It was Feste's [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. To gain the confidence of investors and producers, she made a scrapbook which contained her ideas on tone, camera movement, color, space and lines.&lt;ref name="HuffPo"/&gt;

[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Rockland County, New York]]. The film was shot in [[35 mm film|35 mm format]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Bailey, ASC: Exploring the aesthetics|url=http://motion.kodak.com/motion/uploadedFiles/johnBailey.pdf|publisher=Motion.kodak.com|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film screened at the [[2009 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defamer.gawker.com/5134316/is-the-greatest-destined-for-greatness|title=Is 'The Greatest' Destined For Greatness?|publisher=Gawker|accessdate=March 18, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929174051/http://defamer.gawker.com/5134316/is-the-greatest-destined-for-greatness|archivedate=September 29, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another film starring Mulligan, the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated ''[[An Education]]'', also screened at the festival.

[[File:Luca Rossetti Trinità Chiesa San Gaudenzio Ivrea.jpg|thumb|270px|''Holy Trinity'', [[fresco]] by Luca Rossetti da Orta, 1738–9 (St. Gaudenzio Church at [[Ivrea]]).]]

The [[Holy Trinity|Trinity]] is most commonly seen in [[Christian art]] with the Spirit represented by a dove, as specified in the Gospel accounts of the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]; he is nearly always shown with wings outspread. However depictions using three [[anthropomorphic]] figures appear occasionally in most periods of art.&lt;ref&gt;See below and G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971, Vol II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs I;5–16 &amp; passim, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}} and {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Father and the Son are usually differentiated by age, and later by dress, but this too is not always the case. The usual depiction of the Father as an older man with a white beard may derive from the biblical [[Ancient of Days]], which is often cited in defense of this sometimes controversial representation. However, in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] the Ancient of Days is usually understood to be God the Son, not God the Father (see below)—early [[Byzantine]] images show Christ as the Ancient of Days,&lt;ref&gt;Cartlidge, David R., and Elliott, J.K.. ''Art and the Christian Apocrypha'', pp. 69–72 (illustrating examples), Routledge, 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-23392-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-23392-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o0LBvOMYArYC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=Dura+Europas+Christian&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=RZLkSebpF5KKNbePpZoN#PPA53,M1 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; but this [[iconography]] became rare. When the Father is depicted in art, he is sometimes shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] shaped like an [[equilateral triangle]], instead of a circle. The Son is often shown at the Father's right hand.{{bibleref2c|Acts|7:56}} He may be represented by a symbol—typically the Lamb or a cross—or on a [[crucifix]], so that the Father is the only human figure shown at full size. In early medieval art, the Father may be represented by a hand appearing from a cloud in a blessing gesture, for example in scenes of the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]. Later, in the West, the '''Throne of Mercy''' (or "Throne of Grace") became a common depiction. In this style, the Father (sometimes seated on a [[throne]]) is shown supporting either a [[crucifix]]&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art'', Vol. II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs I;5–16 &amp; passim, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}} and {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}, pp. 122–124 and figs 409–414&lt;/ref&gt; or, later, a slumped crucified Son, similar to the [[Pietà]] (this type is distinguished in German as the ''Not Gottes'')&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art'', Vol. II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs I;5–16 &amp; passim, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}} and {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}, pp. 219–224 and figs 768–804&lt;/ref&gt; in his outstretched arms, while the Dove hovers above or in between them. This subject continued to be popular until the 18th century at least.

By the end of the 15th century, larger representations, other than the Throne of Mercy, became effectively standardised, showing an older figure in plain robes for the Father, Christ with his torso partly bare to display the wounds of his Passion, and the dove above or around them. In earlier representations both Father, especially, and Son often wear elaborate robes and crowns. Sometimes the Father alone wears a crown, or even a [[papal tiara]].

== Eastern Orthodox tradition ==

[[File:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Trinity (Andrei Rublev)|Old Testament Trinity]]'' [[icon]] by [[Andrey Rublev]], c. 1400 ([[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow)]]

Direct representations of the Trinity are much rarer in [[Eastern Orthodox]] art of any period—reservations about depicting the Father remain fairly strong, as they were in the West until the high Middle Ages. The [[Second Council of Nicea]] in 787 confirmed that the depiction of Christ was allowed; the situation regarding the Father was less clear. The usual [[Holy Trinity Icon|Eastern Orthodox representation]] of the Trinity was through the "Old Testament Trinity" of the three angels visiting Abraham—said in the text to be "the Lord"{{bibleref2c|Genesis|18:1–15|NRSV}}. However scholars generally agree that the direct representation of the Trinity began in Greek works from the 11th century onwards, where Christ is shown as an infant sitting on the Father's lap, with the Dove of the Holy Spirit also present. Such depictions spread to the West and became the standard type there, though with an adult Christ, as described above. This type later spread back to the Eastern Orthodox world where [[post-Byzantine art|post-Byzantine]] representations similar to those in the West are not uncommon outside Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, 89–98&lt;/ref&gt; The subject long remained sensitive, and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] at the Great Synod of Moscow in 1667 finally forbade depictions of the Father in human form. The canon is quoted in full here because it explains the Russian Orthodox theology on the subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Chapter 2, §44:'' It is most absurd and improper to depict in [[icon]]s the [[Sabaoth|Lord Sabaoth]] (that is to say, [[God the Father]]) with a grey beard and the Only-Begotten Son in His bosom with a dove between them, because no-one has seen the Father according to His Divinity, and the Father has no flesh, nor was the Son born in the flesh from the Father before the ages. And though [[David]] the [[prophet]] says, "From the womb before the morning star have I begotten Thee"{{bibleref2c|Psalm|109:3}}, that birth was not fleshly, but unspeakable and incomprehensible. For Christ Himself says in the holy Gospel, "No man hath seen the Father, save the Son".&lt;sup&gt;cf.&lt;/sup&gt;{{bibleref2c|John|6:46}} And [[Isaiah]] the prophet says in his fortieth chapter: "To whom have ye likened the Lord? and with what likeness have ye made a similitude of Him? Has not the artificier of wood made an image, or the goldsmiths, having melted gold, gilt it over, and made it a similitude?"{{bibleref2c|Isa|40:18–19}} In like manner the [[Apostle Paul]] says in Acts{{bibleref2c|Acts|17:29|KJV}} "Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone, graven by art of man's imagination." And [[John Damascene]] says: "But furthermore, who can make a similitude of the invisible, incorporeal, uncircumscribed and undepictable God? It is, then, uttermost insanity and impiety to give a form to the Godhead" (''Orthodox Faith'', 4:16). In like manner St. [[Gregory the Dialogist]] prohibits this. For this reason we should only form an understanding in the mind of Sabaoth, which is the Godhead, and of that birth before the ages of the Only-Begotten-Son from the Father, but we should never, in any wise depict these in icons, for this, indeed, is impossible. And the Holy Spirit is not in essence a dove, but in essence he is God, and "No man hath seen God", as [[John the Theologian]] and [[Gospel|Evangelist]] bears witness{{bibleref2c|John|1:18}} and this is so even though, at the [[Jordan River|Jordan]] at [[Baptism of Jesus|Christ's holy Baptism]] the Holy Spirit appeared in the likeness of a dove. For this reason, it is fitting on this occasion only to depict the Holy Spirit in the likeness of a dove. But in any other place those who have intelligence will not depict the Holy Spirit in the likeness of a dove. For on [[Mount Tabor]], He appeared as a cloud and, at another time, in other ways. Furthermore, Sabaoth is the name not only of the Father, but of the Holy Trinity. According to [[Dionysios the Areopagite]], Lord Sabaoth, translated from the Jewish tongue, means "Lord of Hosts". This Lord of Hosts is the Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And although [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] the prophet says that he beheld the [[Ancient of Days]] sitting on a throne, this should not be understood to refer to the Father, but to the Son, Who at His second coming will judge every nation at the dreadful Judgment.&lt;ref&gt;The Tome of the Great Council of Moscow (1666–1667 A.D.), Ch. 2, 43–45; tr. [[Hierodeacon]] Lev Puhalo, ''Canadian Orthodox Missionary Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Oriental Orthodox traditions ==
[[File:Trefoil-Architectural-Equilateral-Triangle-interlaced.svg|thumb|[[Trefoil]] and [[triangle]] interlaced.]]
The [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] never depicts God the Father in art although he may be identified by an area of brightness within art such as the heavenly glow at the top of some icons of the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ.

In contrast, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] has many ancient icons depicting the Holy Trinity as three distinct Persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prairienet.org/~dxmoges/icons.htm The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Icons] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103064629/http://www.prairienet.org/~dxmoges/icons.htm |date=November 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henrytrotter.com/travels/africa/ethiopia/slides/40-gondar-monastary.jpg |title=An Ethiopian Iconostasis |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; These icons often depict all Three Persons sitting upon a single throne to signify unity. The [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] follows the same practice.

== Scenes ==

Only a few of the standard scenes in Christian art normally included a representation of the Trinity. The accounts in the Gospels of the Baptism of Christ were considered to show all three persons as present with a separate role. Sometimes the other two persons are shown at the top of a crucifixion. The [[Coronation of the Virgin]], a popular subject in the West, often included the whole Trinity. But many subjects, such as [[Christ in Majesty]] or the [[Last Judgement]], which might be thought to require depiction of the deity in the most amplified form, only show Christ. There is a rare subject where the persons of the Trinity make the decision to incarnate Christ, or ''God sending out the Son''. Even more rarely, the Angel of the Annunciation is shown being given the mission.&lt;ref&gt;for both, G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'',1971, Vol II, 1972, (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}} and {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}, pp. 6–12 and figs 10–16&lt;/ref&gt;

== Less common types of depiction ==
[[File:Courgenard - St Martin SGW 01.jpg|thumb|left|Stained glass window depicting the Trinity in three persons. Saint Martin church, [[Courgenard]], France.]]

Especially in the 15th century, and in the less public form of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, there was experimentation with many solutions to the issues of depicting the three persons of the Trinity. The depiction of the Trinity as three ''identical'' persons is rare, because each Person of the Trinity is considered to have distinct attributes. Nonetheless, the earliest known depiction of [[God the Father]] as a human figure, on the 4th century [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus]], shows the Trinity as three similar bearded men creating [[Eve]] from [[Adam]], probably with the intention of affirming the [[consubstantiality]] recently made [[dogma]] in the [[Nicene Creed]]. There are many similar sarcophagi, and occasional images at intervals until a revival of the iconography in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, figs 7, 10, 11&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction was finally formally condemned by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky, Erwin]], "Once More "The Friedsam Annunciation and the Problem of the Ghent Altarpiece", ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Dec., 1938), pp. 419-442, College Art Association, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3046600 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Even rarer is the depiction of the Trinity as a single anthropoid figure with three faces (Latin "Vultus Trifrons"), because the Trinity is defined as three persons in one Godhead, not one Person with three attributes (this would imply [[Modalism]], which is defined as [[heresy]] in traditional [[Orthodox Christianity]]). Such "Cerberus" depictions of the Trinity as three faces on one head were mainly made among Catholics during the 15th to 17th centuries, but were condemned after the Catholic [[Council of Trent]], and again by [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1628,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many existing images were destroyed.

The Trinity may also be represented abstractly by [[symbol]]s, such as the [[triangle]] (or three triangles joined together), [[trefoil]] or the [[triquetra]]—or a combination of these. Sometimes a halo is incorporated into these symbols. The use of such symbols are often found not only in painting but also in [[needlework]] on [[tapestry|tapestries]], [[vestment]]s and [[antependia]], in [[metalwork]] and in [[architecture|architectural]] details.

'''''Tit-Bits from all the interesting Books, Periodicals, and Newspapers of the World''''', more commonly known as '''''Tit-Bits''''', was a British weekly magazine founded by an early father of popular journalism [[George Newnes]] on 22 October 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bridget Griffen-Foley|title=From Tit-Bits to Big Brother: a century of audience participation in the media|journal=Media Culture and Society|date=2004|volume=26|issue=4|url=http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/MEDIA165/%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B5%CF%82%20%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85-audience%20research-%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%B7/big%20brother.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the magazine's headquarters moved from [[Manchester]] to [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Howard Cox|author2=Simon Mowatt|title=Technology, Organisation and Innovation: The Historical Development of the UK Magazine Industry|url=http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10292/1129/Technology_organisation.pdf?sequence=1&amp;origin=publication_detail|work=Auckland University of Technology|accessdate=25 June 2016|format=Research paper|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it paved the way for popular journalism — most significantly, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' was founded by [[Alfred Harmsworth]], a contributor to ''Tit-Bits'', and the ''[[Daily Express]]'' was launched by [[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|Arthur Pearson]], who worked at ''Tit-Bits'' for five years after winning a competition to get a job on the magazine.&lt;ref name = "Hulda"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Friederichs, Hulda|authorlink= | coauthors= | title=George Newnes| year=1911 | publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton (1911) Kessinger Publishing (2008) | location=London | isbn=978-0-548-88777-6 | pages=}} (republished 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the outset, the magazine was a mass-circulation commercial publication on cheap newsprint which soon reached sales of between 400,000 and 600,000. Like a mini-encyclopedia it presented a diverse range of tit-bits of information in an easy-to-read format, with the emphasis on human interest stories concentrating on drama and sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Conboy ''Journalism: A Critical History''&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured short stories and full-length fiction, including works by authors such as [[Henry Rider Haggard|Rider Haggard]] and [[Isaac Asimov]], plus three very early stories by [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]].

The first humorous article by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings", appeared in ''Tit-Bits'' in November 1900.&lt;ref&gt;From the chronology maintained by the [http://wodehouse.ru/chrono.htm Russian Wodehouse Society]&lt;/ref&gt; During the first world war [[Ivor Novello]] won a ''Titbits'' competition to write a song soldiers could sing at the front: he penned ''[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]''.&lt;ref name="MagfTB"&gt;{{cite web|title= Tit-Bits/Titbits |url=http://www.magforum.com/mens/mensmagazinesatoz11.htm |work= Magforum |accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pin-ups appeared on the magazine's covers from 1939 and by 1955 circulation peaked at 1,150,000.  At the beginning of 1973 ''Tit-Bits'' lost the hyphen from its masthead. In 1979 ''[[Reveille (newspaper)|Reveille]]'' (a weekly tabloid with a virtually identical demographic) was merged into ''Titbits'', and the magazine was briefly rebranded as ''Titbits incorporating Reveille''. This however was dropped in July 1981. On 18 July 1984,&lt;ref name="MagfTB"/&gt; under its last editor Paul Hopkins, ''Titbits'' was selling only 170,000 copies and was taken over by Associated Newspapers' ''Weekend''. At the time, the ''Financial Times'' described ''Titbits'' as “the 103-year-old progenitor of Britain's popular press”&lt;ref name="MagfTB"/&gt;. ''Weekend'' itself closed in 1989.

==Cultural influence ==
In ''All Things Considered'' by [[G. K. Chesterton]], the author contrasts ''Tit-Bits'' with the ''Times'', saying: "Let any honest reader... ask himself whether he would really rather be asked in the next two hours to write the front page of ''The Times'', which is full of long leading articles, or the front page of ''Tit-Bits'', which is full of short jokes." Reference to the magazine is also made in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"In the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits." ''[[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 4.2C Calypso|Calypso]]'' episode of ''Ulysses'' by James Joyce.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Moments of Being]]'', [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'' and AJ Cronin's ''The Stars Look Down''. It has been also mentioned in [[Stanley Houghton]]'s play [[The Dear Departed]]. Wells also mentioned it in his book ''Experiment in Autobiography''. The magazine is burlesqued as "Chit Chat" in [[George Gissing]]'s ''[[New Grub Street]]''. In the closing scene of the film ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), the protagonist Louis Mazzini ([[Dennis Price]]) is approached by a journalist ([[Arthur Lowe]]) from ''Tit-Bits''.

The magazine name survived as a glossy adult monthly ''Titbits International''.

The '''Tudor House''' is a shop and house at 29 and 31 Lower Bridge Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376301|desc= Tudor House, Chester|accessdate= 31 October 2011|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The house was built for a wealthy merchant.&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = | page = 95| format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was probably built in 1603.  Above the door is a plaque inscribed with the date 1503, but this is an error because the building has been dated to the early 17th&amp;nbsp;century by [[dendrochronology]].&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  It was extended to the rear in the middle of the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, and in 1728 it was rebuilt, enclosing the portion of the [[Chester Rows|Row]] passing through its first floor.  At street level are two [[undercroft]]s.  In the past one undercroft was in use as a bakehouse, while the other formed part of the Britannia Inn.  The building has subsequently been used as a café on the ground floor, with an apartment above it.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;  The [[timber framing]] on the south side of the building was reconstructed in 1973–74.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;

==Architecture==

Tudor House is constructed in [[sandstone]], in brick, and in timber framing with plaster panels, and is roofed in [[slate]]. It has four storeys plus a cellar.  The lower two storeys are in brick, with timber-framing above.  The entrance door at street level is in a doorway with a [[Four-centred arch|Tudor]] arch, and on each side of it is a two-pane window.  Above the windows are headboards inscribed "TUDOR" and "HOUSE".  The first floor contains three [[casement window]]s.  The two top storeys are both [[jettying|jettied]] and timber-framed.  The third storey contains two three-light [[mullion]]ed and [[transom (architectural)|transomed]] casement windows, with panels containing S-shaped braces on their outer sides.  The top storey has one three-light mullioned window over four arched panels.  To the side of it are panels containing S-shaped braces, and above it is a [[gable]] with lozenge- and S-shaped braces.  The lower two storeys on the south side of the house are constructed in sandstone, with timber-framing above.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;

[[File:Head old Roman Glyptothek Munich 320.jpg|thumb|Portrait Bust of a Man, Ancient Rome, 60 BC]]'''Verism''' is the artistic preference of contemporary everyday subject matter instead of the heroic or legendary in art and literature; it is a form of realism. The word comes from [[Latin]] ''verus'' (true).

==Roman art==
Verism first appeared as the artistic preference of the Roman people during the late [[Roman Republic]] (147–30 BC) and was often used for Republican portraits or for the head of “[[pseudo-athlete]]” sculptures. Verism, often described as "warts and all," shows the imperfections of the subject, such as warts, wrinkles, and furrows. It should be clearly noted that the term veristic in no way implies that these portraits are more "real." Rather, they too can be highly exaggerated or idealised, but within a different visual idiom, one which favours wrinkles, furrows, and signs of age as indicators of gravity and authority. Age during the Late Republic was very highly valued and was synonymous with power, since one of the only ways to hold power in Roman society was to be part of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. Yet to be in the Senate, a Roman [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] had to be at least forty-two years of age, which in ancient times was considered a mature stage of life.&lt;ref name=smith1981&gt;''Greek, Foreigners, And Roman Republic Portraits'', Cambridge Journals: The Journal of Roman Studies, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}}[[File:General de Tivoli (Massimo) 01.JPG|thumbnail|left|General de Tivoli, pseudo-athlete with veristic head, ca. 90-70 BC, Tivoli]]It is debated among scholars and art historians whether these veristic portraits were truly blunt records of actual features or exaggerated features designed to make a statement about a person’s personality.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010"&gt;''A History of Roman Art'', Enhanced Edition, Wadsworth CENGAGE Learning, Boston, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}}  It is widely held in academia that in the ancient world [[physiognomy]] revealed the character of a person; thus, the personality characteristics seen in veristic busts could be taken to express certain virtues very much admired during the Republic.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010" /&gt;{{rp|54}} However,scholars can never know for certain the accuracy of portrait renditions made long before their own era.

==Verism throughout the Roman Empire==
As stated in the section above, verism first appeared during the Late Republic. The subjects of veristic portraiture were almost exclusively men, and these men were usually of advanced age, for generally it was elders who held power in the Republic.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|53}} However, women are also seen in veristic portraiture, though to a lesser extent, and they too were almost always depicted as elderly.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|53}} A key example of this is a marble head found at Palombara, Spain. Carved between 40 BCE and 30 BCE, during the decade of the [[Liberators' civil war|civil war]] that followed Julius Caesar’s assassination, the woman’s face shows her advanced age.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|54}} The artist carved the woman with sunken cheeks and pouches under her eyes to illustrate her age, much like male veristic portraiture of the time.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|54}}

Verism, while the height of fashion during the Late Republican era, quickly fell into obscurity when [[Augustus]] and the rest of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] (44 BC-68 AD) came to power. During this imperial reign, Greek [[Classical sculpture]] that featured "eternal youth" was favored over verism. It wasn’t until after the suicide of [[Nero]] in 68 AD that verism was revived.[[File:Vespasianus01 pushkin.jpg|thumbnail|right|Bust of Vespasian, ca. 75-79]]During the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (68-69 AD) that resulted from Nero’s suicide, when [[Galba]], [[Vitellius]], and [[Otho]] all grappled for the throne, verism made a resurgence, as seen in obverse portraits of Galba on bronze coins or marble busts of Vitellius. When [[Vespasian]] and his sons came to the throne the [[Flavian dynasty]] harnessed verism as a source of propaganda. Scholars believe that Vespasian used the shift from the Classical style to that of veristic portraiture to send a visual propagandistic message distinguishing him from the previous emperor. Vespasian’s portraits showed him as an older, serious, and unpretentious man who was in every respect the anti-Nero: a career military officer concerned not for his own pleasure but for the welfare of the Roman people, the security of the Empire, and the solvency of the treasury.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010" /&gt;{{rp|123}} Like the Romans from the Late Republic, Vespasian used veristic busts to underscore traditional values as a way to indicate to the Roman people a connection to the Republic.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010" /&gt;{{rp|123}} With this reminder of the Late Republic, many Roman citizens were likely put at ease, knowing Vespasian was truly not like the previous emperor Nero, who represented everything the Republic abhorred. Yet after the Flavian period verism again faded into obscurity.

==Verism in academia==
Veristic portraits of the late Republic hold a special fascination for classical art historians. Romans had inherited the use of sculpted marble heads from the Greeks but they did not inherit the veristic style from them. To scholars verism is uniquely Roman. Scholars have put forth multiple theories as to what or who were the precursors to Republican portraiture. Yet what is important to note is that there is not one single accepted theory of the origin of verism. The question of veristic style remains to this day essentially open and unresolved. Each theory, while plausible in its own way, will require further research and adequate consideration among scholars.

=== First Theory ===
[[File:IMG 1075 - Perugia - Museo archeologico - Urna etrusca - 7 ago 2006 - Foto G. Dall'Orto2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Etruscan Cinerary Urn, c. 150-100 BC]]Scholars believe the ancient [[Italic peoples]] had an inclination to veristic representation leading to influence on later Roman art.&lt;ref name="Richter, p. 39"&gt;Richter, ''The Origin of Verism in Roman Portraits'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; From a central Italian provenance in ancient times tribes from this area used [[Terracotta]] and [[Bronze]] to make a somewhat realistic portrayal of the human head.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Yet the ‘Italic’ heads, as they are called, are not seriously considered to be a favorable or strong theory held among scholars as being forerunners to the Republican portraits.&lt;ref name="Richter, p. 39"/&gt; Scholars note that none of the realistic looking specimens can be shown to be earlier than the arrival of the new wave of Greek influence, rather than vice versa.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

=== Second Theory ===

Scholars debate whether the heads of reclining figures on [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] cinerary urns are the forebears to Republican portraiture.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}} In Etruscan culture it was traditional and very common in [[Etruscan art]] to provide a naturalistic look to figures. Many cinerary urns are realistic looking or at least have harshly treated faces.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Scholars debate whether the realistic-looking style of head of these figures were a native creation which influenced the Romans, or whether the Romans influenced [[Etruria]].&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|31}} The issues relating to chronological time casts doubts as to the accuracy of the theory.

=== Third Theory ===

Scholars consider the ancient Roman custom of making wax portraits, known as funerary or [[Death mask]], of their ancestors as a convincing source for the veristic style. H. Drerup, a man of academia, argues that death masks molded straight from the face were early in use at Rome and exerted a ‘direct influence’ on Republican portraits.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|31}} Yet research has cast doubt on this theory. None of the funerary masks date before the 1st century AD. Evidence suggests the ancestral funerary masks merely kept pace with contemporary portraits in the round.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|31}} Chronology seems to be an issue with supporting the theory.
[[File:Face of a child-MGR Lyon-IMG 9850.jpg|thumbnail|left|Roman funerary mask of a child]]

=== Fourth Theory ===

Scholars debate whether Egyptian influence started Roman verism. A group of portraits in hard [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|Egyptian stone]] from the Roman [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] show a harsh realism that is similarly seen in Republican portraits.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|32}} Scholars believe the Egyptian portraits began to be made before the Republican portraits and strongly influenced the Romans into establishing the veristic style when Egyptian priests and cults came into contact with Italy and Greece.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|32}} Although this theory like the others has merit, lack of concrete dating of this certain Egyptian style makes scholars doubt the creditability. Suggested stylistic dates often fluctuate by two or three centuries leaving scholars with no solid evidence for when the style of harshly realistic [[Portraiture in Ancient Egypt|Egyptian portraiture]] begun.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|31}} Historians also note Romans did not have extensive military or commercial contact with [[Egypt]] before 30 BCE, which was after the Late Republic when verism was being used on portraiture.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|32}} Scholars conclude that it is unlikely that Egyptian portraits influenced the Republican style.

=== Fifth Theory ===

Another theory presented to scholars in classical academia suggests that verism came about from Greek reactions to the conquering Romans. The theory goes that Romans in the Republic privately cherished the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic culture]] yet still held onto Republic values.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|34}} This interest leaked similar portrayals seen in the more realistic Hellenistic royal portraits of the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] and [[Bactria|Bactarian]] kings of the first half of the 2nd century BC, such as the slight turn of their heads and upward glance of the eyes, into Roman veristic busts.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|34}} As Rome conquered Greece the empire saw an influx of talented Greek artists who were commissioned by the Romans to create their portraits that portrayed both the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic look]] and Republic values. It should be noted that Greek artists notoriously portrayed foreigners in an unfavorable light as a result of Greek attitudes of superiority.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|35}} For the Romans the Greeks found them not only to be foreigners, yet to be increasingly pompous and unlikeable oppressors.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|35}} Greek artists were little concerned to put the sitter’s case favorably and portrayed Romans with an unsympathetic likeness.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|35}} As a result, the Greek artist would maintain the Hellenistic ‘pathos formula’ – turn of the head and neck, eyes looking upward – but the Greek sculptor, rather than adapt the Roman’s features to a Hellenistic ruler ideal, had concentrated on bringing out an air of caricature to the face leading to what scholars call veristic portraiture.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|36}}

Some scholars refute this theory as being the cause of verism. Scholars doubt that Romans would not have been angered by the caricature like portrayal given to them by the Greeks. Many question why the Romans did not punish the Greeks for this obvious slight. Yet scholars who are in favor of this theory state that the Romans simply didn’t care for this over realistic portrayal. The Republic values of that time favored the straightforward and honest Roman citizen who did not need the deceits of art, but instead should be portrayed as they were, without artifice, for this would best bring out their Republican values.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|37}} As a result, some art historians, like [[R. R. R. Smith]], believe verism originated from the negative Greek attitudes, if not somewhat unconscious attitudes, the artists felt towards these particular foreign clients, which was allowed to work itself into the Roman portraits because the artists had been freed from the usual obligation to flatter and idealized the sitter and instead allowed to sculpt without artifice.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|38}}

'''''Vesuvius from Posillipo by Moonlight''''' was painted by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] in 1774. It is an oil painting of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in the distance, from the coastal shores of [[Naples]] at night. Dark grey smoke spews from the glowing red crater of the volcano and fills up the top right of the canvas, in contrast to the pale glow of moonlight to the left. Known as a "Painter of Light," Wright liked to play with highlights and shadows in his works and was most well known for his "Candlelight Pictures," landscape or genre scenes depicting dramatic contrasts between light and dark.&lt;ref&gt;Pressly, William. "A World of Trouble." DRUM. 2009. 20 Mar. 2013. &lt;http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/9309/1/Fox_umd_0117N_10337.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Through utilizing this technique, Joseph Wright exhibits the sublimity of nature in ''Vesuvius from Posillipo by Moonlight'' as well as his other paintings of Mt. Vesuvius.

Wright made a trip to Italy in 1733, where he acquired a wealth of new sights and experiences which greatly influenced his art. He drew and wrote extensively about ancient Roman and Italian art and architecture, and Italian landscapes and coastal scenes, especially around Naples.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry. "Joseph Wright of Derby."

Web. 25 Mar. 2013. &lt;http://gerryco23.wordpress.com/2008/02/13/joseph-wright-of-derby/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His imagination was particularly captivated by the volcanic activities of Mount Vesuvius, from which he derived many sketches of its textures and painted over 30 versions of it upon his return to England.&lt;ref&gt;"Vesuvius from Portici."

Web. 20 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not personally witness an eruption,  Wright still observed the volcano in a restrained state of activity, as it fumed smoke and spilled lava—and later expanded on and pieced together what he saw in his future paintings of the volcano.&lt;ref&gt;Pressly, William. "A World of Trouble." DRUM. 2009. 20 Mar. 2013. 	&lt;http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/9309/1/Fox_umd_0117N_10337.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vesuvius from Posillipo'' by Moonlight was painted in Europe during the Neoclassical period. In response to the discovery of the ancient Roman cities, the king of Naples appeared to have encouraged the exploration of Mt. Vesuvius, Pompeii, Herculaneum,  and the Bay of Naples.  This likely lead numerous artists, such as Wright himself, to go to England and become inspired by the sublimity of Mt. Vesuvius.&lt;ref&gt;Pressly, William. "A World of Trouble." DRUM. 2009. 20 Mar. 2013. 	&lt;http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/9309/1/Fox_umd_0117N_10337.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Occurring at the same time was the Enlightenment movement, towards which Wright contributed his more popular scientifically and industrially themed works, especially his two most famous pieces: ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'' and ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schiff, Bennett. "From The Midlands, A Unique Master Of Light And Color." Smithsonian 21.6 (1990): 50. Academic Search Premier. Web. 20 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These typically displayed scientific demonstrations in a dimly lit room, suggesting the idea that society should revolve around education. Even though ''Vesuvius from Posillipo by Moonlight'' is not of a directly historical or scientific theme, Wright may have painted Mt. Vesuvius because he felt that it was an important part of history to preserve and be aware of, in addition to his fascination by its nature. Today, is evident that the 79 A.D. eruption of Mt. Vesuvius was indeed a major catastrophic event, because two cities with great archaeological artifacts of ancient Rome lie beneath its volcanic ashes.

'''The William Morris Society''' was founded in 1955 in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="Founding"/&gt; The Society’s office and museum are located at [[Kelmscott House]], [[Hammersmith]], where Morris lived from 1879 until his death in 1896.&lt;ref name="Time Out"/&gt;

The Society aims to make more well-known the life and work of the Victorian designer, artist, writer, and socialist, [[William Morris]] (1834–1896) and his associates. The Society's programmes involve branches in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. Activities include conferences, educational activities, lectures, museum visits, social events, and tours. The Society also publishes books and pamphlets dealing with the life and work of Morris, a quarterly members' newsletter and, twice a year, the '''''Journal of William Morris Studies''''' (founded in 1961 as the ''Journal of the William Morris Society'').&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt;

The associated [[William Morris Society of Canada]] was founded in 1981&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; and is based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4679">'''Women of Color Quilters Network (WCQN)''' is a national organization dedicated to preserving African American quiltmaking. 

==History==
The Women of Color Quilters Network was founded in 1986 by [[Carolyn L. Mazloomi]].

For many years in the early 1980s Mazloomi had tried unsuccessfully to expand her circle of African American quilters. She eventually placed an advertisement in Quilter’s Newsletter Magazine requesting correspondence with other quilters who shared this frustration. She received several responses to this advertisement, and the resulting correspondence led to the formation of the Women of Color Quilters Network (WCQN).&lt;ref&gt; Quilter’s Exchange – Needle and Pin Pals.” Quilters Newsletter Magazine, February 1986, p. 41. Carolyn Mazloomi wishes to correspond with “Black quilters worldwide.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Founding members of the WCQN included Carolyn, Claire E. Carter, aRma Carter, [[Cuesta Benberry]], Meloydy Boyd, [[Michael_Cummings_(quilter)|Michael Cummings]], [[Peggie Hartwell]] and Marie Wilson.

In 1992-1993, a survey of WCQN members, conducted by quilter Sandra German, indicated members had low expectations for fairness, acceptance, and success from traditional or mainstream quilting ventures (e.g., quilt guilds, magazines, contests).&lt;ref&gt; “Surfacing: The Inevitable Rise of the Women of Color Quilters’ Network” In Uncovering 1993, ed. Laurel Horton, pp. 137 – 168. San Francisco: American Quilt Study Group, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The objectives of the organization include the fostering and preservation of the art of quilt making among women and men of color, researching quilt history and documenting quilts, and offering authentic, handmade African American quilts and fiber art to museums and galleries for exhibition.

WCQN membership surpassed 1,000 quilters from the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean and England. &lt;ref&gt;Martin, Charles. “What’s New and News in Quilting – Women of Color Network Membership Approaches 1,000.” Quilter’s Newsletter Magazine, May 1996, p. 7. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; German, Sandra K. “Surfacing: The Inevitable Rise of the Women of Color Quilters’ Network” In Uncovering 1993, ed. Laurel Horton, pp. 137 – 168. San Francisco: American Quilt Study Group, 1994.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Many members specialize in narrative quilts on contemporary African-American themes because, as Mazloomi pointed out, "we are a people with many stories to tell."&lt;ref&gt; Life's Thread Stitched Into Quilts,” by Patricial Leigh Brown, New York Times, April 04, 1996.  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dfaPC_WSlNwC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=WCQN&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BKMQd3NQh4&amp;sig=_GS40MQydm2rr06o5sikaoch6Ns&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=txRoUfO-GKOOyAGr8oDICQ&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=WCQN&amp;f=false Crafted Lives] Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

WCQN members continue to exhibit their quilts in community venues, local galleries and museums. In 2004, the Museum of Biblical Art sponsored the traveling exhibition, Threads of Faith: Recent Works from the Women of Color Quilters Network. &lt;ref&gt;[http://mobia.org/exhibitions/threads-of-faith#slideshow1 Museum of Biblical Arts, Past Exhibitions.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6976">The success of [[World Book and Copyright Day]], launched in 1996, encouraged [[UNESCO]] to develop the concept of '''World Book Capital''' City, selecting [[Madrid]] as the Capital for 2001. This was again a success, and so UNESCO's General Conference resolved to make the designation of a World Book Capital City an annual event.

UNESCO invited the [[International Publishers Association]], the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] and the [[International Booksellers Federation]] to participate in the nomination process, to ensure the three major branches of the book industry can participate in the decision.

The nomination does not include any financial prize; it rather acknowledges the best programmes dedicated to books and reading.

==Nomination criteria==
The nominating committee welcomes programmes &amp;mdash; presented by or endorsed by the mayor of the city making the application — that promote and foster reading. The programmes are to run from one World Book and Copyright Day and the next. The nomination committee will turn its attention to certain criteria:
* the degree of participation of all levels (from the municipal to the international level)
* the programme's potential impact
* the scope and quality of the activities proposed by the candidates, and the extent to which they involve writers, publishers, booksellers and libraries
* any other projects promoting books and reading
* the extent to which the programme respects the principles of freedom of expression, as stated by the UNESCO Constitution as well as by Articles 19 and 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and by the [[Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials]]

[[File:Cambridge St John's College Main Gate 02.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Yales serving as supporters above the gate of [[St John's College, Cambridge]]]]
[[Image:Yale salient.gif|thumb|250px|right|Heraldic image of a Yale.]]
The '''yale''' or '''centicore''' ([[Latin]]: ''eale'') is a [[mythical beast]] found in [[European mythology]] and heraldry.

==Description==
Most descriptions make it an [[antelope]]- or [[goat]]-like [[quadruped|four-legged]] [[animal|creature]] with the tusks of a boar and large [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] that it can swivel in any direction.

The name might be derived from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] יָעֵל (''yael''), meaning "[[Ibex]]".

The yale was first written about by [[Pliny the Elder]] in Book VIII of his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'': he describes the ''eale'' as a creature found in [[Aethiopia]] "the size of a [[hippopotamus]], with an [[elephant]]'s tail, of a black or tawny colour, with the jaws of a boar and movable horns more than a [[cubit]] in length which in a fight are erected alternately, and presented to the attack or sloped backward in turn as policy directs." The creature passed into [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[bestiary|bestiaries]] and [[heraldry]], where it represents proud defence. 

===Heraldic symbol===
[[File:The Queen's Beasts - The Yale of Beaufort.jpg|thumb|The Yale as one of [[The Queen's Beasts]]]]
The yale is among the heraldic beasts used by the [[British Royal Family]]. It had been used as a [[supporter]] for the arms of [[John, Duke of Bedford]], and by England's [[House of Beaufort]]. Its connection with the British monarchy apparently began with [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in 1485. Henry Tudor’s mother, [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Lady Margaret]]  (1443–1509), was a Beaufort, and the Beaufort heraldic legacy inherited by both her and her son included the yale. Lady Margaret Beaufort was a benefactor of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]'s [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] and [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] and her yale supporters can be seen on the college [[gatehouse]]s. There are also yales on the roof of [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel]] in [[Windsor Castle]]. The Yale of Beaufort was one of the [[The Queen's Beasts|Queen's Beasts]] commissioned for the coronation in 1953; the plaster originals are in Canada, stone copies are at [[Kew Gardens]], outside the [[palm house]].
 
In the US, the yale as a heraldic symbol is associated with [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]. Although the school's primary sports mascot is a [[bulldog]] named [[Handsome Dan]], the yale can be found throughout the university campus.  The mythical beast occupies two quadrants of the [https://fas.yale.edu/coat-of-arms coat of arms] of the Yale [https://fas.yale.edu/ Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS)], playfully representing the intellectual curiosity and inquiry of the FAS faculty. The yale is also depicted on the official banner of the president of the university, which, along with a wooden [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] capped by a yale's head,&lt;ref name = mace&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ydsadmissions.yale.edu/blog/2012/05/14/many-maces-yale|title= The Many Maces of Yale|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 14 May 2012|website= 409 Prospect Street|publisher= Yale Divinity School|access-date= 11 October 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is carried and displayed during commencement exercises each spring. Yales can be seen above the gateway to Yale's [[Davenport College]] and the pediment of [[Timothy Dwight College]].&lt;ref name = myth&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ydsadmissions.yale.edu/blog/2012/05/19/mythical-yale|title= The Mythical Yale|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 19 May 2012|website= 409 Prospect Street|publisher= Yale Divinity School|access-date= 11 October 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student-run campus radio station, [http://www.wybc.com/ WYBCX Yale Radio], uses the yale as its logo.

'''Zemirot''' or '''Z'mirot''' ({{lang-he|זמירות}}) (Yiddish: Zmiros; Biblical Hebrew: Z'miroth; singular: '''zemer/z'mer''') are [[Jew]]ish hymns, usually sung in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic]] languages, but sometimes also in [[Yiddish]] or [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]].  The best known ''zemirot'' are those sung around the table during [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday]]s.  Some of the Sabbath ''zemirot'' are specific to certain times of the day, such as those sung for the Friday evening meal, the Saturday noon meal, and the third Sabbath meal just before sundown on Saturday afternoon.  In some editions of the Jewish prayerbook ([[siddur]]), the words to these hymns are printed after the opening prayer ([[kiddush]]) for each meal.  Other ''zemirot'' are more generic and can be sung at any meal or other sacred occasion.

The words to many ''zemirot'' are taken from poems written by various rabbis and sages during the [[Middle Ages]].  Others are anonymous [[folk songs]] that have been passed down from generation to generation.  The words generally focus on the themes of the Sabbath or the specific holiday being celebrated.

The melodies vary greatly from one Jewish community to another, as local tunes and styles of music are adapted to the same liturgical poems. One famous hymn, ''[[Adon Olam]],'' (Ruler of the Universe) has been set to countless tunes.  Jews of different backgrounds enjoy sharing the various versions when they meet around the Sabbath table.   New tunes continue to be written today for the same ancient lyrics. It is now rare, however, for new zemer-type lyrics to be written.

The term ''zemirot'' is used by [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] to refer to the sequence of psalms in the [[Jewish services#Shacharit (morning prayers)|morning service]], known to other communities as ''pesuke de-zimrah''.
